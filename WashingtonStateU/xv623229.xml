			<p>James R. King (1927-1991) was born in San Jose, California. While earning his B.A. in
				Biological and Physical Sciences from San Jose State College, King married Eleanor
				P. Porter (1928-2006) in 1950. He then came to Washington State College, where he
				received his M.A. (1953) and Ph.D. (1957) with a combined focus in Zoology and
				Physiology. King became an Assistant Professor in Experimental Biology at the
				University of Utah, and then returned to WSU as a Professor of Zoophysiology in the
				Department of Zoology from 1960 until his death in 1991. King Served as Chairman of
				the Department of Zoology (1972-1978), the President of the Council of the Cooper
				Ornithological Society (1977-1978), and the President of the American
				Ornithologists' Union (1980-1982). He was also the recipient of the William Brewster
				Medal (1974), Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation (1969), editor of the
				journal "Condor" (1965-1968), and among many other publications, he co-edited the
				multivolume series "Avian Biology" with Donald Farner. In 1979, King received the
				WSU Distinguished Faculty Award, and the Department of Zoology annually awards a
				memorial James R. King Fellowship to graduate students.</p>
