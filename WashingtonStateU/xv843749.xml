			<p>(Revised information from Guide to the Lazslo Valko Papers 1936-1974, Cage 470) </p>
			<p>Dr. Laszlo Valko (1907-1982) served as a Professor of Agricultural Economics at
				Washington State University from 1950 to 1972. Valko was born on June 18, 1907 in
				Budapest, Hungary. He earned doctoral degrees in law, political science, and
				economics at Budapest University. After completing his education in 1938, he entered
				government service, and directed the official social work in Hungarian agriculture
				until 1944. Valko left civil service and joined the Hungarian Resistance when Nazi
				Germany invaded and occupied Hungary in 1944. Following World War II, Valko was
				appointed to lead the Office of Social Administration in Hungary's Ministry of
				Social Welfare, but stepped down as Soviet influence spread throughout the country
				in late 1945. In 1946, he served as the director for the Central Institute of
				Farmers' Co-operatives, and also taught at the University of Szeged. In 1848, after
				the Hungarian Communist Party took control of Hungary's co-operatives, Valko and his
				wife, Helena, escaped to Switzerland. They immigrated to the United States a year
				later.</p>
			<p>After a brief tenure at Iowa State University, Valko joined the Washington State
				University faculty in 1950, and remained a member of the Agricultural Economics
				Department at WSU until his retirement in 1972. Widely published, translated, and
				traveled, Valko represented the United States at many co-operative farming
				conferences worldwide throughout the 1950s and 1960s. After his retirement from WSU,
				he frequently delivered guest lectures at the invitation of numerous foreign
				governments.</p>
