      <p>The Morrill Act of 1862 provided for the funding of colleges by granting federally controlled land to the states for them to develop or sell.  These land grant colleges were initially intended to further education in agriculture, sciences, and technology.  After becoming a state in 1889, Washington became eligible for these federal grants, and in 1890 the state authorized what would eventually evolve into Washington State University.<?xm-replace_text {Text of biographical or historical note, in paragraphs; separate each with paragraph tags}?></p>

These land grants were part of the basis for the creation and funding of the Washington Agricultural College and School of Science, later the State College of Washington, then Washington State University. Also includes an inserted report on timber cruise and land sales, titled "Final Report upon Timber Cruising in the Summer of 1912 for the State College of Washington," a handwritten “List of State College (Scientific School) lands to be sold June 6, 1908,” and a copy of the State of Washington Office of the Commissioner of Public Lands’ “List of school, granted and other public lands… to be sold at public auction on Saturday, June 1st, 1912.”<?xm-replace_text {Text of the scope and content note, in paragraphs; separate each with
