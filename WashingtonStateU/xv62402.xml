  		<p>Frank Fraser Potter (1879-1959) was a member of the faculty at Washington State College from 1912 to 1949. He was WSC's first professor of philosophy. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, and taught there and at Transylvania University prior to accepting a position at WSC. Upon his retirement from WSC, he was named Professor Emeritus.</p>
  		<p>Frank Potter and his wife, Irene, were actively involved in the campus community, and for over 25 years they hosted regular Friday afternoon gatherings at their home for students they encouraged to pursue advanced, competitive scholarly opportunities, particularly Rhodes Scholarships; ten of these students became Rhodes Scholars.</p>
