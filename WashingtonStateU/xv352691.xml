			<p>[From the guide to the Catherine May Congressional Papers, Cage 304): </p>
			<p>Catherine May was born Catherine Dean Barnes at Yakima, Washington, in 1914.
				Graduating from Yakima High School in 1932, she attended Yakima Valley Junior
				College through 1934, and then received the Bachelor of Science degree in 1936 and
				the Fifth Year Education Certificate from the University of Washington in 1937. From
				1937 through 1940, she taught English in the Chehalis High School, interrupting this
				tenure for a brief period in 1939 to study speech at the University of Southern
				California. </p>
			<p>At the close of the school year in 1940, Mrs. May entered into a career in radio
				journalism and advertising, first with station KMO in Tacoma, and later stations
				KOMO and KJR in Seattle. From 1942 to 1944, she worked in advertising for Strange
				and Prosser Advertising Agency and the Federal Insurance Company, both of Seattle.
				She was in New York City 1944-1946 in the employment of the National Broadcasting
				Company. Following this, Mrs. May returned to Washington State, continuing in radio
				journalism at station KIT in Yakima through 1957. </p>
			<p>Catherine May entered politics actively when she was a candidate and elected to the
				Washington State House of Representatives in 1952, representing a Yakima district.
				Re-elected twice, she remained a member of the state legislature until 1958, when
				she secured the Republican nomination to succeed retiring Republican Congressman,
				Otis Halbert Holmes. She was elected to the United States Congress six times and
				served until 1970 when she was succeeded by Democrat, Mike McCormack. Upon leaving
				Congress, she was appointed one of the Federal government trustees of the
				quasi-public National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK). In May of 1971,
				President Richard Nixon appointed her a member and Chairman of United States Tariff
				Commission. </p>
			<p>When Catherine May entered the United States Congress in early 1959, she was the
				first woman Representative from the State of Washington. Also, she was the first
				Representative from the State of Washington in quite a few years to be appointed to
				the Committee on Agriculture, an assignment that is highly desired by
				Representatives from Washington State. Mrs. May held this Agriculture Committee
				assignment during her entire tenure in Congress. Work in this committee, and her
				efforts on behalf of her constituents, occupied the center of attention throughout
				her congressional career. Partially due to this concern with agricultural policy,
				May was selected as a Congressional member of the National Commission on Food
				Marketing, one of the numerous "study commissions" of the 1960's. During her last
				term in office, she received a second committee assignment, the Joint committee on
				Atomic Energy. She was, lastly, a member of the somewhat ephemeral but nevertheless
				interesting, House Beauty Parlor Committee. </p>
			<p>Although Representative May's attention centered on her committee and constituent
				work, her career was not dominated by either of these. Like most members of Congress
				in the 1960's, she was involved in almost every major public issue of the time. Her
				papers reveal significant interests in consumer affairs, the "hunger" and poverty
				issues, transportation policy, drugs, minority relations, and, on occasion, foreign
				affairs. The return of a Republican administration to power in the 1968 election
				increased May's contact and concern with the whole range of governmental and public
				affairs. She was one of the congressional leaders that supported the administration.
				She was apparently considered for the post of Secretary of Agriculture at the time
				the Nixon Administration was organized. After leaving Congress, she continued to
				receive significant appointments, including United States Tariff Commissioner, a
				position of importance to the economic issues of the early 1970's. </p>
