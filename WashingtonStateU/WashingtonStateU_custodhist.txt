<p>The provenance on these materials is confusing at best. They were donated to the WSU
College of Veterinary Medicine ca. early 2021 by former faculty member Dr. Jack
Alexander. They came in a set of materials tied to Dr. Harry Keown (1911-2007),
another former faculty member. Within those, they were in an envelope, dated April,
1987 and addressed to Keown from Mr. and Mrs. R.W. Bailey of Placerville, CA.
However, given that the envelope contained a variety of document from Keown’s life,
it seems likely he simply reused the envelope and the materials had no tie to the
Baileys. Further, neither Alexander nor Keown served in WWII, and so far as we can
tell neither has any ties to the events in these images. In short, the full
provenance of the materials is a mystery.</p>

<p>When he left the University, Compton removed from the office files the documents
found in the folder entitled "E.O. Holland, 1944-1950" (Folder 191). These he
retained in his personal possession until his death. Later these were transferred to
the College of Wooster Library with another sequence of his personal materials. In
1996, the Wooster Archivist transferred the documents to Washington State University
Libraries.</p>

<p>Although the materials almost certainly originated from the WSU President's Office,
the exact provenance of this collection is unclear. The records were originally kept
as a WSU publication (WSU 131). The records were redesignated as University Archives

current designation.</p>
