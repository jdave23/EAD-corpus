A few are 7.5" x 9.5". Most photographs are both captioned and dated; all dates are in the 1918-1919 range, excepting a dozen or so 1925 photos. Based solely on descriptions of images, we theorize this scrapbook to have originally been created by some sort of government agency, though which one is unclear.</p>

<p>The James P. Leynse papers consist of four manuscripts plus a small
correspondence file. Beauty for Ashes is an autobiography of his life in China
and was the principal source for the preceding biography. Before the Mayflower
and Dream Come True are novels concerning the lives of a Puritan family who
fled from England to Holland to escape English religious persecution in the
17th century. The family eventually became part of the group of Pilgrims who
sailed for America. Fly the Dragon is the fictional story of a Chinese boy
during the early 20th century who rebels against the ancient traditions of his
family and strikes out on his own. This story offers a view of Chinese society
and the struggle against the traditions which hindered Chinese modernization in
the 20th century. </p>
<p>Leynse's autobiography is significant in that it provides a picture of
life in Peking and the surrounding countryside from the 1920s through the
1940s. Leynse encountered many of the individuals who molded the history of
China during the first half of the 20th century. His character sketches of
Chiang K'ai-shek, Madame Chiang, the last Ch'ing emperor Pu-yi, members of the
Nationalist government (T. V. Soong and others), Mao Tse-tung, Chou Enlai, and
Chu Teh are thoughtful and vividly drawn. Leynse's particular style and strong
viewpoint--that of a Western Christian missionary dedicated to helping the
Chinese people--do not obscure an interesting glimpse of China in poverty, war,
and revolution. </p>
<p>Included in the last folder of the papers are letters received from
Leynse's son, Humphrey. This correspondence dates from the year 1964. </p>

<p>The papers of Mart Albert Howard, 1855-1926, consists of the
correspondence, diaries, bills and receipts, legal documents and photographs
which Howard, a Webster, Massachusetts, businessman, retained from his
experience as a gold miner in the Klondike gold rush of 1897. Approximately two
thirds of the collection are photographs taken by Howard or purchased from
other Alaskan and Canadian photographers. Most photographs are glass-mounted
transparencies. </p>

<p>The COHP operates under a "unit history" format whereby each university department or
unit has been asked to participate so that a balanced collective history emerges.
Forty-five departments/units are represented in the collection. An important
emphasis of COHP in addition to departmental/unit histories has been the 25 Golden
Grad interviews, undertaken from 1984 to 1987, during the 50th anniversary alumni
celebrations held each spring. By the end of the Centennial Oral History Project in
June, 1988, 174 interviews have been processed and transcribed. This is a
significant feat, as the Oral History Office has no interviewing staff and relies
soley upon volunteers to conduct the interviews. The resulting interviews have been
made available to Centennial historians and any others who wish to research or just
reminisce. </p>
<p>Each interview in the first series has been transcribed, but due to budget
constraints, most of them have not been edited. If in doubt on a name or years,
consult Campus Directories or Catalogs in Holland Library. Also, remember that these
interviews are informal conversations where errors in grammar sometimes occur. The
description outlines basic information--the interviewer, interviewee, number of
tapes, interview date, Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC)
location, any additional material filed with the originals, and a brief sketch of
topics discussed during the interview. </p>
<p>An index to departments and subjects exists in print form at WSU Libraries:
Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections. In addition to information presented
here, the print index also contains a subject index and a university department
index. </p>
<p>During digitization of these in 2013, it was realized that a 1970 History of WSU's
Physics Program roundtable was included in the Golden Grads cassettes in box 21; its
provenance is unknown but it is speculated that it might have come as supporting
material to Dr. Band's interview (Box 1). </p>

<p>The collection contains aphorisms, correspondence, photographs, pictorials, journals,
writings and translations by and about Lewis Thompson. The main series headings were
taken from the work done on the papers by Richard Lannoy when he used the Thompson
archives for the book Mirror to the Light. A copy of the book is included in this
collection (Series 1). The Anthology series (Series 2) contains either hand-written
or typed pages of passages from books that Thompson considered important enough to
keep. This collection functioned as his library as he had no money to buy books. </p>
<p>The Aphorisms (Series 3) are comprised mostly of 3"x5" slips of paper on which
Thompson wrote his thoughts on topics ranging from the body to eating to yoga. The
small slips are in Boxes 4, 5, and 6. Care was taken to maintain the order of the
aphorisms, so all were numbered in the upper right hand corner. The alphabet section
cards have been added to help the user in finding aphorisms on particular subjects.
The topic heading slips were copied from the slips that Thompson had used. The paper
on which the topic headings were written was highly acidic and was discarded.
Thompson wrote some of his aphorisms on larger slips of paper. These were removed
from the small file boxes, unfolded, and placed in folders. A slip of paper was put
in its place in the small file box on which was written the folder number where that
page had been placed. </p>
<p>The Correspondence (Series 4) is mostly from Thompson to his relatives and a few
close friends. The final folder of correspondence contains a folder of letters kept
by Blanca Schlamm after Thompson's death. These condolence letters are from
relatives and friends. </p>
<p>The Journals series (Series 5) gives a glimpse into Thompson's life in India. Some
parts of the journals were written on 3"x5" slips and are in Box 7. As with the
aphorisms, the larger sheets that were pulled from this small file box have been
noted with slips of paper telling where that numbered page may be found. </p>
<p>There is only one folder of Photographs (Series 6). It contains the only known
photographs of Thompson to exist as well as photographs of Thompson's friends in
India. </p>
<p>The Pictorial series (Series 7) consists of pictures by children which tell a
well-known story with pictures, as well as pencil sketches of children by Thompson. </p>
<p>The Poems (Series 8) are all original works by Thompson. Some are hand-written and
some are typed out in preparation to send to publishers. </p>
<p>The Prose series (Series 9) includes essays and articles by Thompson to be submitted
for publication. This section includes Thompson's Autobiography, as well as Such
Stuff: Book of Dreams. </p>
<p>The Talks With Gurus (Series 10) are notes taken by Thompson during talks with his
teachers and other spiritual leaders. </p>
<p>The Translation (Series 11) section shows that Thompson spent much of his time
translating the works of those authors he deemed important. He seemed especially
interested in translating poetry. </p>
<p>The Miscellaneous material (Series 12) includes manuscript items and notes that had
no logical section in which to be placed or were loose when the collection was
received. </p>

<p>The collection comprises audio and video produced by, for, or about Washington State University, dating from 1930 up to 2005. However, the majority of the media is from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Included in the collection are news stories, promotional videos, recordings of significant performances, events, and speakers, and unfinished stock footage used in creating these and other productions. Video found here was created by numerous sources, notably WSU's various news services and its campus television and radio stations. Many of the items were created by non-WSU organizations, either in the form of news (or other) stories about the school, or in the form of promotional or other materials contracted to other institutions by campus departments.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware that much of the description of this collection comes from the labels on the media or the containers they came in; it was not possible to view all the materials to determine accuracy of the labeling. As a result, users may discover upon viewing these items that their contents do not match their labels, and a few items have been discarded since this collection was created after we discovered the actual contents were not related to Washington State University. In some cases duplicate copies of materials are retained; this is primarily due to the significance of the material in question and the ongoing deterioration of electronic media, as well as due to the fact that uncertain labeling means items may not match their description, and that similarly (but not identically) named items may not actually be the same thing.</p>
<p>The majority of the collection is video recordings, primarily VHS tapes and U-matic 3/4" tapes. Other videotape formats include S-VHS, M II, Betacam, BetacamSP, and one open reel 1" Type C. Other non-tape video include digital media on DVD, CD, and MiniDV; and film in 16mm and Super 16mm. Audio formats include 1/8" standard audio cassette tapes, 1/4" open reel tapes (reel-to-reel), and one 8-track tape.</p>

Pimsleur's career as well as a few letters of interest, notably from Vincent
d'Indy, Rubin Goldmark, Dmitri Mitropoulos and Willem Mengelberg. The musical
sketches provide a mass of fragments and scraps of paper, with little apparent
order or identification. There are virtually no complete scores in the second
series, but a number of scores are included on microfilm in series III. Series
IV encompasses a set of paintings and drawings by an unknown hand.</p>

<p>This collection consists of professional papers of Gerald "Jerry" Brong while he worked at Washington State University Libraries during the 1970s. The materials reflect Brong's activities during the first years of the Information Age when libraries diversified not only access to materials through early online networks and databases but also the types of materials they housed especially non-print ones. Brong devoted his attention to the WSU Libraries' growing collection of audiovisual resources, to their use in education, and increasingly to educational technology. His expertise in non-print media and interest in technology's application to library services led to involvement in statewide and national efforts. Among those were his leadership of the Washington State Library Futures Planning Task Force from 1974 to 1975 to develop intrastate cooperation mechanisms to meet the needs of library users in the present and future, advocacy for recognition of the audiovisual specialty nationally through the Association for Educational Communication and Technology and within Washington State's librarian certification, contributions to various divisions of the American Library Association, and participation in the 1979 White House Conference on Library and Information Services.<?xm-replace_text {Text of the scope and content note, in paragraphs; separate each with

The Truax family photographs date from 1868 to 1949. They were received with descriptive notes by Davis written on separate slips, and these were transcribed onto the verso of the photographs during processing.</p>

<p>This collection of miscellaneous manuscript leaves on parchment and
vellum dating from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries has usefulness as
examples of scripts, texts, writing surfaces, inks, decorations and
illustrations. The leaves come from a variety of religious texts, including
Books of Hours, Missals and Graduals. All are in Latin save for two which seem
to be medieval Dutch and one in medieval French.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>Breviary (fragment), in Latin</p>
<p> France, saec. XIIImed</p>
<p>1v-2r: //In illo t[empor]e erat S[ancti] Johan[nis] ... conservis
suis minora peccantibus. Si//</p>
<p>Folio 1v begins with the sixth reading for the 17th Sunday after
Pentecost, followed by the first five readings for the following week. Folio 2r
continues the fifth reading and runs through the eighth reading of the 18th
Sunday after Pentecost, ending with the first word of the ninth reading.</p>
<p> The order of the readings is noted in red roman numerals in the
outer margin by a contemporary hand. A slightly later hand has indicated
through the use of black Roman numerals that during a later period these were
the 21st and 22nd Sundays after Pentecost.</p>
<p>Parchment, two leaves (conjoint and consecutive), in two columns
of 31 lines, prickings preserved in the inner margin. Written in a gothic
texutra script by a single scribe. Initials alternate blue with red penwork and
red with blue penwork, one or two-lines (with the exception of the letters [L]
or [I] which extend down the margin three- to six-lines); rubrics red.</p>
<p>Written in France in the mid-thirteenth century. This bifolium was
the innermost bifolium of its quire, and was folded backwards to be used as a
wrapper binding in the late middle ages. The title of the manuscript that it
bound is written in the upper margin of f. 2r: it appears to read "Donatio
tertia maculosi", which could indicate an accounting of donations made by
sinners to the local church to secure their salvation. A nineteenth-century
hand has written in pencil in the lower margin of f. 2r the price of "100 fr."
and the date "Debut XIIIe s.", although the style of script suggests a slightly
later date.</p>
<p>[note: the cataloguer, Lisa Fagin Davis, has only examined a
digitized image of the verso of the bifolium, that is, folios 1v and 2r]</p>

<p>Book of Hours (fragment), in Latin</p>
<p> Germany, saec. XIIIex/XIVin</p>
<p>F. 1: //gloria mea et non conpungar ... meus est in manibus//</p>
<p>Psalm 29:13 "gloria" - end; antiphons "Adorate dominum in aula"
and "In tua justi[tia]"; Psalm 30:1 - 16 "manibus". The original antiphons have
been scraped away and replaced by a later hand (with the exception of the word
"patri" on the recto, line 3, which is original). The red roman numeral "viii"
before and after the second antiphon may indicate that the following Psalm is
the eighth Psalm of Matins for that day.</p>
<p>Parchment, single leaf, in a single column of 19 lines. Written in
a gothic texutra script by a single scribe. Psalm initial blue with red
penwork; versal initials alternating red and blue.</p>
<p>Written in France in the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth
century. A nineteenth-century hand has written in pencil in the lower margin of
the recto "XII siecle", although the style of script suggests a slightly later
date.</p>
<p>[note: the cataloguer, Lisa Fagin Davis, has only examined a
digitized image of the fragment]</p>

<p>Written in Flanders in the late 15th century. A late-medieval hand
has written the (incorrect) Psalm number "XVI" on the recto. A modern purple
ownership stamp on the recto gives the monogram "ABV".</p>

was during the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. Most of the photographs are
individually dated and labeled with a description of the photograph, including the
photographer, machinery pictured, and construction processes. According to
information found on the photographs, they were taken for the purpose of keeping a
record of the dam’s construction.</p>
<p>Machinery pictured in the collection includes concrete mixers and pourers, conveyor
feeders and belts, trestles, barges, trimmer machine, irrigation equipment, siphons,
and steel beams. These machines and materials were used to lay the foundation, build

<p>This collection comprises Murrow-related recordings of the 1973 dedication of the Murrow Communications Center, various Murrow symposia from the 1970s until 2002, and the 1994 Murrow Postage Stamp dedication ceremony. The collection consists of audio and video materials in a myriad of formats. </p>
<p>Reel-to-reel audio recordings preserve talks delivered at the 1973 Murrow Communications Center dedication including those by Murrow's widow Janet and the speakers at the first Murrow Symposium: CBS News commentator Eric Sevareid and Harry Ashmore, Pulitzer-Prize winning editorial writer on the 1957 Little Rock, Arkansas, school desegregation and in 1973 President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. The theme for the symposium was "Threats to the Public's Right to Know."</p>
<p>The next recording is a single audio cassette from the 1978 Murrow Symposium of the keynote address delivered by Richard Wald, then vice president of ABC News and former president of NBC News. That year featured Howard K. Smith of ABC News speaking about the First Amendment and broadcasting. Fifteen audio reel-to-reel tapes and cassettes preserve more of the 1979 symposium, which centered on the topic of "international rights and media news flow." Held before the Iranian hostage crisis began, the symposium featured Ted Koppel who by the end of the year anchored the nightly update on the crisis in the program that would become ABC News Nightline.</p>
<p>In 1980, the Murrow Symposium's theme was "Mass Media and the Political Process: Reshaping American Democracy." Seven audio cassettes record many of the talks given by regional media representatives and also a panel moderated by Richard Leonard of the Milwaukee Journal newspaper. The symposium in 1981 centered on the "information society" with PBS President Robben Fleming speaking on "The Future of Telecommunications." Three reel-to-reel audio tapes seem to preserve addresses from that symposium that were aired later as a KWSU special report.</p>
<p>The collection then jumps to the 1983 symposium, which marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of Murrow's birth with a program titled: "The Murrow Heritage: A Challenge for Tomorrow." Speakers included Walter Cronkite, Charles Kuralt, Diane Sawyer, and others but only Fred Friendly's "Socratic discussion" is preserved here on video tape. Friendly, the former president of CBS News, by that time was well known for his Socratic discussions on PBS that became the Fred Friendly Seminars.</p>
<p>The next recordings are video tapes from ABC News senior correspondent Bettina Gregory's 1988 Edward R. Murrow Symposium lecture entitled, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of TV News." Video recordings of FCC Chair Albert Sykes's address at the 1992 symposium and then Charles Kuralt's address in 1993 follow. At the 1996 symposium, WSU alumnus and ABC sports broadcaster Keith Jackson sat on a panel discussing inter-collegiate athletics which is preserved here on reel-to-reel video tape and cassettes.</p>
<p>The final symposia included are VHS recordings of Bernard Shaw's 2001 and Daniel Schorr's 2002 addresses as Murrow Award winners. </p>
<p>Concluding the collection, six video tapes documented the 1994 dedication at WSU of a postage stamp honoring Murrow and the media coverage of it. </p>

Martin," the processors of the collection in 2018 found it challenging to identify him. After locating a 1936 memoir by Lieutenant Colonel A.G. Martin, Mother Country, Fatherland: The Story of a British-Born German Soldier, they were able to compare details in the diary with information in the published memoir, and determined that both works are by the same author.</p>
<p>It is likely that this volume is a typed original, or a contemporary transcription by the author, rather than a later typed transcription. The repository has no information about the existence or location of other volumes of Martin's war diary.</p>

<p>This collection contains 517 posters, most issued by governments to influence
behavior and public morale. Most items are from the period beginning with the start
of World War I and concluding with the end of World War II. </p>

dating back into the 1910s. They became part of the College's War Library, a
collection established in 1937-1938, consisting of rare books, pamphlets, posters,
and other ephemera. The collection continued to grow through donations from various
sources. In 2009, approximately 300 posters were assembled into this collection. In
2013, approximately 200 more posters were added to the collection. Dating largely
from World War II and post-World War II, most of the added posters are in French and
are directed toward Parisians, announcing war updates and requesting public action.
The additions also include United States World War I and World War II posters, and

<p>"Photos include Monroe Street Bridge, Post Street Bridge, town scene looking north from Post Street, County Court House, Dam at City Water Works, Twickenham Ferry, 2 pictures of Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, 2 of the balloon ascension and parachute jump at Loon Lake. One of the photographs shows a parachute descent from a hot-air balloon at Loon Lake about 35 miles north of Spokane. The jumper is undoubtedly "Captain" Thomas S. Baldwin as he was the only daredevil making parachute attempts at this time. Baldwin was a 19th century circus aerialist who, after becoming fascinated with hot air balloons, modified his act in 1875 so that he could perform from a bar hanging below an airbag. He quickly became a star attraction at fairs all over the country, Canada, and the Far East, performing almost 3,000 acrobatic ascents. Noticing that the novelty of his act had begun to fade, Baldwin and his brother designed a light, flexible, and compact parachute. "In front of an audience at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park on January 30th, 1885, Baldwin offered the park manager a deal - he would jump from a hot-air balloon for $1.00 per foot of height, with 2,000 feet being the maximum. The crowd, unknowingly, witnessed the first public descent in a parachute by an American, and Baldwin was soon dubbed 'The Father of the Modern Parachute.' Although Baldwin invented the first parachute harness, his jumps were nothing like those of today. Baldwin would ascend in a sitting position on a small seat beneath his balloon. When he reached the desired altitude, Baldwin would pull a rip panel in his balloon to release hot air, causing the balloon to begin a rapid descent. With the momentum needed to fill the parachute with air, Baldwin would then jump from the seat." (National Aviation Hall of Fame)" (seller's description).<?xm-replace_text {Text of the scope and content note, in paragraphs; separate each with

<p>The collection consists of fifteen reels of 16-mm film and five 1-inch paper data tapes. Films in the collection are preprints that include A, B, and C rolls, magnetic sound tracks, and internegative prints. The A, B, and C rolls and separate magnetic sound tracks are edited together in post-production to create a print. A, B, and C rolls are used to create effects such as fades and dissolves by alternating scenes back and forth from one roll to the next and back. For example, the A roll may have the even-numbered shots with black leader film between them and the B roll the odd-numbered ones. The A and B rolls and the sound track are then run through the contact printer in three passes to create a negative. An internegative comes later in post-production when editing is finished; it is the internegative from which a final release print is made. The internegative reels include an optical sound track that, unlike a magnetic track, is on the film and not on a separate reel. A- or B-wind refers to emulsion orientation. The data tapes carry more identifying information and seem to have been used to sync the rolls in post-production printing. The final two 16mm films are completed films.</p>

<p>This collection of assorted images depicting the history of the State College of
Washington (later Washington State University) covers a wide range of subjects,
including photographs of buildings on campus, students, faculty, University regents,
and campus visitors. </p>
<p>The positive and negative images in this collection were arranged into two separate
series; however, it should be made clear that images in the two series do not
necessarily overlap - the majority of the negatives and not present as positives,
and vice versa. The sub-division of the subjects can be quite extensive. For
example, Athletics is arranged alphabetically by individual sports and each sport is
subdivided chronologically. If one were looking for a photograph of the 1945
Basketball team, one would first look under Athletics, then Basketball, then 1945.
One should check the positives first, then the negatives. During initial processing,
a series of "sports contact sheet prints," covering primarily the 1940s and 1950s,
was retained as a separate subseries (1.1.05) within sports positives. So, someone
looking for sports images in this era should check this subseries as well. Regents
and Faculty members have been arranged into subdivisions alphabetically by name. </p>
<p>The collection continues to grow as loose single images are added and interfiled over
time.</p>

<p>This collection comprises the annual reports of the Director of the Agricultural Extension Service and his assistants and is bound by volume. These volumes survey the beginnings and progression of the State College of Washington (later Washington State University)'s Extension Service in agriculture and home economics. These books show the growth of the program and record its expansion into a cooperative organization working with chambers of commerce, bankers, and railway companies to render assistance to growing Washington urban and rural economies. These reports detail demonstration activities, education efforts, and in general represent the work of the directors and assistants who worked to modernize Washington State agriculture and the economy through cooperative efforts with communities and individuals across the state. These volumes contain abundant reports on topics including land clearing operations in Western Washington, livestock evaluations, and general 4-H club work across the state, as well as monthly reports of the service's expenditures, attendance, and efforts at extending the knowledge of the State College of Washington to the citizens of Washington State.
