<p>The New York Brewery was founded in 1886 by Rudolph Gorkow. In 1900 it was purchased
and its management was consolidated with that of Henco Brewery as the Spokane
Brewing and Malting Company, although it continued to function under its own name as
a branch operator. In 1903 the branch closed. </p>
<p>In 1902, the Galland-Burke Brewing and Malting Company was also purchased by the
Spokane Brewing and Malting Company. All three breweries were operated, at least
initially, as branch breweries. The company remained in business until the
mid-thirties when the assets were sold to the Sicks-Rainier brewing interests of
Puget Sound.</p>

<p>As early as 1953 a computing laboratory was operating on the campus of Washington State University. The Computing Center was established at the University in 1956; at that time, data-processing projects functioned under the auspices of the Department of Mathematics. The University offered two courses on the subject of computers, taught in the Department of Mathematics, beginning with the 1956-1957 academic year.</p>
<p>In 1966, a "Program in Information Science" was initiated which included vastly expanded course offerings and faculty members. By 1970, the Department of Computer Sciences, with 15 faculty members, had been formed; this program offered M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. During the same time period, the Office of Systems and Computing began operations as a part of the Washington State University administrative body. This office directs all data-processing operations performed for University business, many officials of the office hold joint appointments in the Department of Computer Sciences and the WSU Computing Center.</p>
<p>Currently, the Office of Systems and Computing consists of Computer Engineering Services, Mathematical/Statistical Faculty Consultants, University Computing Services, and the Computing Service Center. The Office, in addition to administering these sub-units, allocates computing funds to the colleges, approves all acquisitions of computer-related equipment, performs long-range planning for WSU computing, and represents WSU to the State Data Processing Authority.</p>

<p>Shiro Takeda (1901-1971) and Hisako Manabe (1911-1970) were married on September 13,
1938 in Reno, Nevada. Shiro Takeda emigrated from Japan in 1929 to attend graduate
school at Lincoln University in San Francisco. After graduating, he served as editor
for The New-World Sun in San Francisco and the Rafu Shimpo in Los Angeles. Hisako
was born in San Francisco to immigrant parents born in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.
In 1942, Hisako gave birth to a son, Terry. In the same year the Takeda family was
removed from their home to Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Wyoming via Santa Anita
Assembly Center, California by the War Relocation Authority as part of the mass
incarceration of Japanese Americans authorized by Executive Order 9066. In 1943,
Shiro was hired as a Japanese language instructor for the United States Navy at the
University of Colorado, Boulder on May 6, 1943. On July 16, 1943, Hisako and Terry
were also released from Heart Mountain. In 2002, the U.S. Navy presented an award
for distinguished service to Shiro Takeda (posthumously) and other instructors at
the U.S. Navy Japanese Language School.</p>

<p>The College of Agriculture began as one of six divisions of the Washington Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science in 1892. The Division of Agriculture became the Department of Agriculture in 1894 when the departmental system was organized. In 1917, that departmental system was reformed into a system of schools and colleges, one of which was the College of Agriculture. WSU's Institute of Agricultural Sciences combined Agriculture, Extension, and other departments in 1946, but was dissolved into its component departments in 1965. In 1982, Agriculture and Home Economics merged to form CAHE (College of Agriculture and Home Economics), and in 2002 CAHE became CAHNRS (College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences).</p>

<p>Rupert Croft-Cooke was born June 30, 1903 in Edenbridge, Kent, and was
educated at Tonbridge School and Wellington College. He began teaching when he
was seventeen. He went to Paris that year as a private tutor, then spent two
years in Buenos Aires, where besides teaching English he founded and edited the
journal
<title>La Estrella</title>. In 1925 he returned to London and pursued a
career as a free-lance journalist and writer. Soon after, he opened a bookshop
in Rochester, Kent, and took up the antiquarian book trade. At the same time he
also entered the field of broadcasting, giving a series of radio talks on
psychology. In 1930 he went abroad again, spending a year in Germany, writing,
and later lecturing in English in Switzerland and Spain. He joined the British
Army in 1940 and saw service in Africa and India. After his discharge in 1946
he returned to writing and produced several works reflecting his military
experience. He became the book critic for
<title>The Sketch</title> in 1947, a position he held until 1953. He died
June 10, 1979.</p>
<p>One of the most prolific writers for the British mass market in the
20th century, Croft-Cooke produced countless magazine and journal articles and
more than 125 books--everything from co-books to political commentary, from
books about circuses to steamy romances. His greatest success, however, came in
the genre of detective fiction; he published nearly thirty detective novels,
mysteries and thrillers.</p>
<p>His first book,
<title>Songs of a Sussex Tramp</title>, a collection of poetry, was
published in 1922, when he was nineteen. When, shortly after the appearance of
his Songs, another of his works precipitated a suit for slander, his publisher,
in order to recoup losses he had suffered, forced Croft-Cooke to produce ten
books without renumeration. After a self-imposed two year-long exile in
Argentina, he returned to England in 1925. He continued to write and his work
appeared in the literary magazines New Writing, Adelphi, Chapbook, The New
Coterie and English Review. In the late 1920s several of his pieces were
published in the American magazine, Poetry.</p>
<p>With the coming of the Great Depression in the 1930s, however,
Croft-Cooke rejected the "cult of poetry and literature" and embraced the "cult
of experience." Characterizing himself as a "writer for the middle class," he
produced numerous works in diverse genres for the mass market. In addition to
more than twenty volumes of autobiographical writing and several romantic
novels, he also wrote books on travel, food and wine, circus life and gypsies.
He explored the politics of the Hitler era, creating a near best-seller in
<title>The Man in Europe</title>, as well as
<title>Rule Britannia</title>, and
<title>The Last Days of Madrid</title>. Croft-Cooke's greatest popularity
with both British and American readers was based on his detective fiction and
thrillers. Using the pseudonym Leo Bruce, he wrote two series of detective
novels. The first, begun in 1936, was based on the adventures of Sergeant Beef,
a bumbling village policeman. His second sleuth was introduced in 1952. This
new hero, Carolus Deane, a witty and urbane gentleman, was the antithesis of
Sergeant Beef. Both series of novels created Croft-Cooke's greatest literary
success.</p>

<p>Gisèle Freund was born December 19, 1908, in the Schoneberg district of Berlin,
Germany, to Jewish parents who had a passion for collecting art. Her father’s gift
of a camera to the fifteen-year-old Gisèle set the course of her life. During her
university years in Frankfurt, where she studied sociology, Freund took an active
political stand against National Socialism. Forced to flee Germany in 1933, she
landed in Paris with little more than a suitcase containing her camera and some
photographic documentation of Nazi violence. At the Sorbonne her doctoral studies
emphasized the history of nineteenth century French photography. Her friendship with
Adrienne Monnier, the proprietress of La Maison des Amis des Livres bookshop (which
published her dissertation) provided Freund with access to the literary elite of
Paris. </p>
<p>The exigency to make a living led Freund to photography as a serious vocation. Life
magazine published some of Freund’s early projects in the mid-1930s. Other
significant commissions from that period include the dust jacket photographs for the
first hard cover editions of Andre Malraux’s Man’s Fate (1935) and James Joyce’s
Finnegans Wake (1939). In 1939, Freund had her first private showing at the Peggy
Guggenheim Gallery in London. In 1940, Freund fled Nazi-occupied Paris, first to
southern France and then to South America, where she continued her photographic
assignments throughout the war. In 1947, she began a seven-year association with
Magnum, the photographic news agency established by Robert Capa and others,
including Henri Cartier-Bresson. Freund’s first public exhibition was in 1975 in New
York, at the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery. Three years later, Freund was awarded the
photokina Kulturpreis, and she was the first woman to receive the Grand Prix
National des Arts in 1980. Gisèle Freund died in Paris on April 1, 2000. </p>
<p>Along with her documentary reportage, Freund is best known for her photographic
portraits, many of them in color which, she said, came closer to life, including
studies of some of the greatest literary and artistic figures of the twentieth
century. This list includes James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, George Bernard Shaw, H.G.
Wells, Leonard and Virginia Woolf, Andre Malraux, Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, and
Henri Matisse.</p>

<p>The town of Pampa (near present day LaCrosse, Washington) was founded in 1889 by David and Rachel Bowman. The expansion of the Union Pacific Railroad increased settler access to the region. Two notable families were the Hoopers and the Turners, who had been in the region since the 1870s. There was a post office from 1894 until 1919. The town dissolved in 1929, when the school was consolidated with the LaCrosse school.</p>
<p>The Gordon Brothers General Merchandise Store was established by 1888, at which time it was owned by T.H. Logsdon and J.H. Mason. In 1893, they sold it to Charles Woehr, who owned it until 1898. Emory and Frank Gordon bought the store in 1898 and sold it to Ai Camp in 1905, who eventually closed the store in 1919. The store sold a wide range of goods and served as a meeting place for the surrounding community. The busiest day of the week was Saturday, but the store was open every day. The store engaged in barter, including trade for the Hoopers’ annual apple harvest.</p>
<p>When the Gordon brothers bought the store in 1898, it cost them $200 and had an inventory of goods valued at $1,825.55. They added a coal house and an oil house in 1901. James Emory (b. 1867) and Frank L. Gordon (b. 1871) were two of six children of Jonathon F. and Lizzie Gordon. Their father was a carpenter, and their parents moved from Burlington, Iowa in 1870, traveling first to Ogden, Utah and eventually ended up homesteading in Covello, near Dayton, Washington. Frank attended business college in Portland in 1890 and 1891, and returned to work in Dayton, Washington. Emory raised livestock with his brother Worden for several years, but eventually went into business with Frank when they bought the general merchandise store. Frank Gordon married Alice Bowman (the daughter of the Tampa founders) in 1909, and Emory Gordon married Mary Steward in 1907.</p>

<p>The North Pacific Grain Growers Company (NPGG) came into existence as a regional cooperative in late 1929 in Lewiston, ID, and organized as a company in April of 1930 in Spokane, WA. Following the stock market crash of 1929, agricultural prices plummeted to the point that farmers would be selling their crops at a loss. To prevent the collapse of the U.S. agricultural system, the Federal Farm Board's Grain Stabilization Corporation arranged loans for farmers. The NPGCC was created to handle initial loans of $3,500,000 for northwest farmers. Following that crisis, it remained in existence as a cooperative for the benefit of regional farmers. In 1938 the NPGG moved its headquarters to Portland, OR, where it would remain until 1983, when it merged with the Farmers Union Grain Terminal Association to become the Harvest States Cooperatives. In turn, that was merged into Cenex in 1998.</p>
<p>Grain elevators are towers which use (usually) bucket elevators or pneumatic conveyors to move grain from near-ground levels into a silo. The technology was developed in the 1840s, and allowed grain to be transported in bulk in vehicles rather than having to be bagged. Most small eastern Washington communities had their own grain elevators, usually located alongside railways ort rovers. The elevators in the scrapbook in this collection were photographed in 1918-1919, and most no longer exist due to improvements in agricultural technology, the natural decay of what were primarily wooden buildings, and changes in transportation capabilities. The river-based elevators in the loose photographs portion of the collection are mostly still in existence.</p>

<p>Charles Stanton Benson (1874-1959) was a piano teacher who lived a reclusive lifestyle in northern Idaho. Benson hailed from a pioneering Northwest family, who settled in Walla Walla, Washington during the nineteenth century. According to the Fort Walla Walla Historical Society, Benson was the first white child born in eastern Oregon Territory. Instead of following the family business of farming, Benson studied at the Whitman College Conservatory of Music, where he graduated circa 1897. By 1912, he led the Benson Orchestra, but with the arrival and popularity of jazz in the subsequent decades, the group disbanded. Benson worked at a piano store in Walla Walla, where he traveled around Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, before settling down in Idaho. He opened a studio in Wallace before moving to Kellogg in 1918. </p>

<p>Little is known about his first marriage, other than he had a daughter who died in early adulthood, named Paloma Zuerita Benson Spenier (1902-1930), and his marriage did not last. In 1929, he married Pearl Wilson, a woman twenty years his junior. Both partners studied and were devout Christian Scientists. According to the donor of this collection, Larry Persons, Pearl destroyed Benson's diaries dating prior to 1934, as well as some other documents that dealt with Benson's working with other women. He also observed that Charles' and Pearl's marriage was not a happy one.</p>

<p>Benson owned the studio in Kellogg until 1932, when he started teaching out of his home. He lived in a cabin owned by the U.S. Forest Service in Two Mile Creek, outside of Osburn, Idaho, at first during the summers, and eventually full time. In 1955, he gave up the cabin for good, as it was falling into disrepair. In the same year, he also suffered a stroke. He died in 1959 and was buried in Walla Walla with his pioneering family members.

<p>Arthur Monrad Johnson was born at Fredrikstad in Norway in 1878. He
attended the University of Minnesota, receiving his B.S. in 1904. For the next
decade he was a high school teacher in Washington and Minnesota, after which he
entered graduate school in botany at the University of Minnesota, completing
the Ph.D. in 1919. From 1919 to 1927 he held a succession of academic posts at
the University of Minnesota, Harvard University and the University of
Wisconsin. In 1927, he joined the faculty of the Southern Branch of the
University of California (now University of California-Los Angeles), where he
remained until retirement. His main interests were taxonomy, ecology and plant
geography. The genus Saxifraga occupied much of his attention. </p>
<p>While a high school teacher in Colfax, Washington, Johnson developed a
liking for the Eastern Washington region. Perhaps it was for this reason that
he directed that his research notes be left at Washington State University upon
his death. This attraction to Eastern Washington he explained in 1938 to a
young botanist who had complained of the seemingly botanical barrenness of the
area: </p>
<p>
<emph render="italic">Your remarks about the Palouse country as
compared to California amused me. Of course California,--well it is California,
and that's that. But, "when summer comes," I venture to predict that you will
begin to attune yourself to the Palouse country. Perhaps you will never thrill
over it, as I did, when I landed in Colfax in 1905, from Minnesota, but
nevertheless I think you will develop a liking for it, for to my mind it is one
of the most fascinating botanizing regions in America. This is true
floristically, phytogeographically, and ecologically, the vegetation is soft,
friendly, and inviting, like all northern vegetation, not the d--- spiny,
prickly, rigid, tangled, skin-and-temper-tearing sort like that of much of
southern California, which draws out all the curses of the English Language
whenever one tries to press a specimen. Phytogeographically and ecologically I
found the "contact" of the eastern, the northern and the boreal, and the
southern (Sonoran) floras one of the most fascinating features of the Palouse
and adjacent montane floras. I was always searching every nook and cranny for
the "outliers" of these vegetation types. The various plant communities, too,
were a constant source of interest, for they were many and diverse, and well
defined. The buttes, the canyons, the bottom lands,--well, I scoured all of
them. When you have covered the marvelous Snake River gorge, the Clearwater
gorge, and that of the Palouse, and the foothills of the Bitterroots, if you
then haven't gotten some thrills, well,--I think I should take you in hand for
a special treatment.</emph> A. M. Johnson to Carl Sharsmith, March 6, 1938,

<p>In May, 1970 at Washington State University, students led demonstrations against U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam War, and challenged university officials to recognize
institutional racism as a fundamental problem with the university system. The Black
Student Union (BSU), established at WSU in the fall of 1968, spearheaded May
protests against racism and, in conjunction with several other radical
organizations, presented President Glenn Terrell with eleven demands. Terrell
initially rejected the demands which had called for, among other things, a mandatory
ten day workshop in the fall to heighten faculty awareness of racism. 3,000 students
protested that decision on May 21, 1970. On May 28, 1970, the Resident Instructional
Staff (RIS) approved of two racism workshops, one for the fall of 1970 and one for
the Spring of 1971. To plan the event, the RIS created the Minority Student
Committee on Racism Workshops. To run the committee, Terrell appointed four minority
students, Sarah Dennis, Ron Taplin, Rebecca Hobbs, and Rudy Ryser. The students
planned to host prominent movement speakers, present movies, and make available
printed handouts concerning racism. Although leaders of the BSU and MEChA (a Chicano
students' organization) denounced the racism workshops as manifest symbols of
university paternalism, the first racism workshop took place on October 7-8, 1970
and attracted 20,000 people. The second was held on March 9-10, 1971, and had a much
smaller crowd.</p>

<p>James P. Leynse was born in Middleburg, Holland, on March 20, 1890. At
an early age Leynse showed a talent for rhetoric and had ambitions as a stage
actor. His Dutch-Calvanist father challenged him to do more with his life and
this eventually led him to the University of Leiden to study for the ministry
in the Dutch Reformed Church. </p>
<p>As soon as he was ordained, Leynse elected to serve as a missionary in
China. His church did not have any missions in China at that time; but this
stopped him only momentarily. He decided to seek affiliation with the
Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions in the United States. The American
officials, however, were not satisfied with his education and required him to
study for two more years at Princeton University and be ordained once again.
</p>
<p>Shortly after he completed his additional studies, his Dutch fiancee,
Anna Marie Groenendyk, came to America and they were married on June 21, 1920.
They sailed for China in December 1920 and for the next 29 years their home was
the Presbyterian Mission in Peking. It was there that their two sons, Humphrey
and Waldo, were born. </p>
<p>Leynse's first three years in China were spent learning to read and
speak Mandarin Chinese at the College of Chinese studies. At this time Peking
was noted for its poverty, beggars, and disease. One of Leynse's first jobs was
the organization of kitchens which served free millet porridge to thousands of
the hungry. Leynse soon realized, however, that he was only treating a symptom
of the problem. Therefore, he wrote to Holland and asked his sister Francina
Leynse for help. She arrived in 1930 and for 15 years helped to establish and
run an industrial center where homeless women and children could learn a skill.
</p>
<p>With the Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation of China, larger
problems loomed for the Leynses. At first the Japanese permitted Leynse to
continue the Peking Poor Relief Committee. Even though other foreigners were
being evacuated the Leynses stayed on in the hopes that the Japanese would
continue to overlook them. Late in 1941, they travelled to Japan in order to
secure passage to America for their younger son, Waldo. While in Japan they
were placed under house arrest and confined for a year and a half. With the aid
of Japanese friends they were released and returned to China only to be
recaptured and held at the British Embassy in Peking for the remainder of World
War II. </p>
<p>During his captivity, Leynse was considerably weakened by bouts with
typhoid fever and "sprue" (a disease of the liver and intestines brought on by
malnutrition). Despite this ill health he stayed on in China after the Japanese
surrender to reorganize and reopen the mission kitchens and hospital. </p>
<p>In 1946 "sprue" attacked him again and he became almost bedridden.
Owing to his long service and poor health the mission retired him in 1949. Upon
his retirement, Leynse settled in Claremont, California where he began to
write. </p>

<p>Ida Louise Anderson was born in Morganton, Tennessee, on 6 November 1900. At three
years of age she and her parents moved to Colfax, Washington. Five years later, she
returned to Tennessee with her family for a visit. While there, she became gravely
ill. Doctors diagnosed her condition as infantile paralysis or polio. During the
next several years, Anderson underwent medical and physical therapy in attempt to
lessen the disease's effects. Despite treatment, Anderson experienced health changes
due to polio, including a severe curvature of the spine. In 1924, Anderson received
an undergraduate degree in speech from the State College of Washington. She spent a
summer in Alaska before returning to Pullman to begin a sixteen-year teaching career
at WSC in the school's Department of Speech. Anderson took advanced speech work at
the Boston School of Expression and at the University of California during two
summers. She also studied a year at Northwestern University. Her teaching career
ended in 1939, when the lingering effects of polio forced her to retire. Shortly,
Anderson moved to Oregon to be nearer her sister. She died there on 16 September
1941. Anderson was buried in Colfax, Washington. </p>
<p>Ida Lou Anderson was one of the State College's most respected instructors with a
powerful mind and character that reached well beyond the classroom. She pioneered
the field of radio broadcasting. One of Anderson's earliest and most impressive
students was Edward R. Murrow, a European news correspondent during World War II and
a journalist and executive for the news division of the Columbia Broadcasting System

<p>Mr. Edwin Burgess, a lawyer with wide railroad experience, was chosen
in 1960 to represent the interests of the Mercantile Safe Deposit and Trust
Company of Baltimore in the proposed merger of the Atlantic and the Seaboard.
Mercantile held fiduciary control over nearly 35 per cent of the Atlantic Coast
Line and thus would gain a controlling interest in the newly merged company.
</p>
<p>This new railroad would bring together the 5,573 miles of track of the
Atlantic with the 4,146 miles of the Seaboard. Both roads were in strong
financial condition when they appeared before the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC) for permission to merge. This merger, they claimed, would save
the new line nearly 38 million dollars over a five year period. In addition,
the merger would hasten the lowering of rates, eliminate duplication of service
in many areas, and generally improve rail service along the whole southeastern
coast of the United States. </p>
<p>The historical importance of this merger was recognized at the time
since mergers between financially strong competitors were generally conceived
as favoring monopolistic trends. Michael Conant in his 1964 study
<title render="italic">Railroad Mergers and Abandonment</title>commented:
</p>
<p altrender="italic">"A significant aspect of this case was the petition
of intervening railroads that as a condition of approval the Commission require
the Seaboard and the Atlantic Coast Line to transfer specific sections of their
lines to intervenors. . . . All these requests for conditions to the merger
were based on the argument that the merged line would divert so much traffic
from the intervenors that their solvency would be endangered. (p. 80)" </p>
<p>The ICC rejected all arguments opposed to the merger since to permit
them to stand would have frustrated the overall objectives of the merger. Thus,
in approving the merger the ICC held that it was of greater import to eliminate
wasteful transport and increase efficiency than to allow a near monopolistic
situation to arise in the area's rail service. However, two of the ICC
examiners did reject the proposed merger on the grounds that it would not help
preserve rail competition in the southeastern United States. </p>
<p>The decision of the ICC favoring merger was rendered on December 2,
1963. The merger, however, was not completed until several years of
intervenor's court appeals were finally ended when the United States Supreme
Court, in a per curiam decision, sustained the merger on May 10, 1967. </p>

<p>Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf (1850-1932) was a renowned botanist of the Pacific
Northwest during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was born in
Holstein, Germany, and immigrated to Iowa as a small child. A few years after moving
to the Midwest, the Suksdorf family moved to Bingen, Washington. Working on the
family farm as a boy, Suksdorf became interested in the plant life around him and
began collecting specimens. He entered the University of California in the
mid-1870s, where he communicated with and sent his specimens to Dr. Asa Gray of
Harvard, considered by many to be the most important American botanist of the
nineteenth century. Gray was impressed with Suksdorf's work and in 1886, invited him
to the Gray Herbarium at Harvard for the next two years to be his assistant. Gray
even named a plant genus after Suksdorf, Suksdorfia. Following Gray's death in 1888,
Suksdorf returned to his home in Klickitat County where he continued working as a
botanist until his death.</p>
<p>His private herbarium contained around 25,000 specimens, which were donated to
Washington State University following his death. Suksdorf discovered and named many
plants, and in 1892 made the first list of flowering plants and ferns of Washington.
From 1896 until 1931, he continued to contribute to the discovery and classification
of plants in the Northwest, publishing much of his findings. On October 3, 1932, he
was killed by a train at a railway station in his hometown of Bingen. </p>

<p>Both the Gaines and McCulloch families arrived in Washington from the Midwest at the
turn of the twentieth century. Edward F. Gaines (1886-1944) was born in Missouri and
moved as a teenager with his family to a farm near Chewelah. The McCulloch family
and young Xerpha Mae (1891-1970) left Wisconsin to homestead near Othello.</p>
<p>Edward F. Gaines graduated from the State Normal School at Cheney (now Eastern
Washington University) in 1907. He then worked as a public school principal and
teacher in Ritzville, where he met Xerpha Mae McCulloch, who graduated from high
school there in 1910. Edward left Ritzville in 1909 to continue his education at the
State College of Washington (now Washington State University) in Pullman where he
earned his bachelor and master of science degrees in agronomy in 1911 and 1913,
respectively.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Edward was associated with several plant genetics pioneers, as
a student, colleague, and mentor. One of his students was Karl Sax, who received his
bachelor's degree in agriculture from WSC in 1916 and became a leading cytologist
and plant geneticist, and National Academy of Science member. Sax credited Edward
Gaines for introducing him as an undergraduate to research in plant breeding, and
encouraging his pursuit of graduate studies, and they remained correspondents
throughout Gaines's lifetime.</p>
<p>Another lifelong correspondent was Harry B. Humphrey, who had been Edward's botany
professor at WSC and became long-time phytopathologist with the Bureau of Plant
Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In an obituary for
Edward in the journal Phytopathology, Humphrey wrote that his most important
contributions centered on his genetic studies of bunt resistance in wheat and smut
resistance in wheat and oats. Gaines developed the Triplet, Ridit, and Albit wheat
varieties to increase both yields and smut resistance. Orville Vogel, renowned wheat
breeder at WSU with the USDA, named two wheat varieties for Edward Gaines: Gaines
(1961), the first semidwarf winter wheat for commercial production, and NuGaines
(1965).</p>
<p>Xerpha McCulloch Gaines established her own legacy at WSC. Though she pursued her
education at WSC in the first years of marriage, raising her four children delayed
her graduation until 1930 when she received her bachelor of arts degree in education
and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>Married in 1912, Edward F. and Xerpha McCulloch Gaines made their home in Pullman as
Edward continued in his position as Assistant Cerealist and Instructor of Agronomy.
Edward spent a semester at Harvard University in 1915 studying genetics and plant
breeding under Dr. Edward M. East at the Bussey Institution for Research in Applied
Biology. He returned in 1920, and received his Doctor of Science degree in 1921. At
the same time, he continued on the faculty at WSC, rising to Cerealist in 1917 and
serving as Assistant Professor of Farm Crops from 1918 to 1926, Associate Professor
from 1926 to 1930, and as Professor of Genetics in Agronomy from 1930 until his
death in 1944.</p>
<p>Xerpha began a collaboration in 1950 with Dr. Theodore Scheffer of the U.S.
Biological Survey to collect plant specimens in the area around Grand Coulee Dam
with their results published in a 1957 article: "A Botanical Survey of the Grand
Coulee-Eastern Washington," Research Studies of the State College of Washington 25.3
(Sept. 1957): 207-235. In 1957 she accepted an invitation from the Museum of
Northern Arizona for a May botanical collection raft trip down the Colorado River
through the area soon to be inundated behind the Glen Canyon Dam. She published her
results in an article, "Plants in Glen Canyon," Plateau 30, no. 2 (October 1957):
31-34.</p>
<p>For each of the above botanical surveys, Xerpha collected specimens for herbaria. The
University of Washington's Burke Museum herbarium today lists nearly 400 specimens
collected by Xerpha Gaines, many from the Grand Coulee surveys. A University of Utah
publication about the 1957 Colorado River trip noted that Xerpha Gaines collected
specimens from 150 species for the Museum of Northern Arizona herbarium. Because of
her association with what is now WSU's Ownbey Herbarium, Xerpha duplicated her Glen
Canyon specimens there as well as adding her many specimens collected over her years
in the Palouse.</p>
<p>After retirement, Xerpha continued her work, identifying specimens from home at her
kitchen table. The WSU Agronomy Club and Agronomy and Soils Department dedicated its
Spring 1971 Agronomy and Men issue to Xerpha Gaines, noting that "[h]er reputation
as an excellent 'seed hawk' was known throughout the Inland Empire and the State."
Xerpha listed under "Hobbies, recreational activities, specialties" on a 1957 WSC
personnel information form: "Taxonomy of plants and plant collecting Seeds." That
lifelong interest culminated in the posthumous publication of a book, co-authored
with D.G. Swan, Weeds of Eastern Washington and Adjacent Areas (1972). </p>
<p>In 2008, Dr. Stephen Jones, Director at the WSU Research and Extension Center in Mt.
Vernon, released "Xerpha," a new variety of soft-white common winter wheat named
after Xerpha Gaines.</p>
<p>Edward and Xerpha Gaines had four children: Edward M. (1913-2000), Xerpha Mae
(1915-2003), John (1917-1955), and Grant (1922-1965). Xerpha Mae Gaines was always
known as "Mae." All four siblings graduated from WSC. In 1938 Mae married Ramon
Kent, who had a long career with the Soil Conservation Service primarily out of the
Spokane office. Janice Gaines Walker, daughter of Grant, and Jocelyn Liu,
granddaughter of Mae Gaines Kent, were instrumental in the donation of this
collection to WSU.</p>

<p>A native of Missouri, Marion Ownbey was one of three twentieth century
Ownbeys associated with plant taxonomy, the others being his brother Gerald
Ownbey and his wife Ruth Peck Ownbey. His botanical education began at the
University of Wyoming and its Rocky Mountain Herbarium and continued at
Washington University in St. Louis and the associated Missouri Botanical
Garden. Major influences on the early parts of his education were Aven Nelson
and J. M. Greenman, two older taxonomists whose methods stressed close study of
the details of plants, especially of dried specimens, and careful and precise
organization of the knowledge of those plants. Their approach had been
especially useful in criticising and revising the original description of North
American flora, a development in which both had also participated. Though their
approach was similar to that long used by botanists, it tried the patience of
many, who could see no relation between modern science and the dried plant
collections of the "haymaker" botanists, as they were derisively called.
Moreover, their field had been much vexed by a troublesome and perhaps needless
debate over the rules of botanical nomenclature. Nevertheless, by the 1920s and
1930s American taxonomists had essentially completed a catalog of North
American plants and were well into a cycle of critical revision. This
revisionary cycle consisted largely of a long sequence of "monographed genera."
By the 1920s, this expression had come to mean the extensive and comprehensive
examination of all literature and herbarium specimens of particular genera,
resulting in lengthy and exhaustive monographic publications, then considered
the mark of competence as a plant taxonomist. In this milieu, Ownbey began his
career as a botanist. Not surprisingly he began with an attempt to study and
revise Castellija, an extensive and complex genus which other taxonomists had
worked with for years without producing a definitive statement. </p>
<p>Ownbey encountered difficulties with his effort to become the
authoritative specialist on Castellija, and not until much later in his life
did he complete his Castellija project. Yet it was not simply problems with
this genus which marked his early career, but problems with the whole approach
of plant taxonomy, and the influence of a newer means for approaching this
science. This influence had come into the Missouri Botanical Garden in the
person of Edgar Anderson, a geneticist who had, as he put it, invaded the field
of plant taxonomy in search of an explanation of the mechanisms of the
evolution of species. Anderson appeared to offer a newer philosophy for
taxonomy, a field which seemed to be in need of such. He called for a
combination of genetics, cytology and taxonomy, with a considerable influence
of such diverse fields as paleontology, archaeology, anthropology and history
also represented in his approach. Anderson's approach tended to stress common
weeds and agronomic plants typified by the common road-side plants of the genus
Tradescantia. (See Edgar Anderson, Plants, Men and Life (Boston: Little, Brown
and Co., 1952) 16-30.) Ownbey may even have assisted briefly in the famous
Tradescantia project. </p>
<p>Anderson's influence also appeared in Ownbey's adoption of the genus
Calochortus as his primary field of investigation, for this genus featured many
examples of the hybridizations and combinations of genetic materials which
Anderson stressed. Calochortus, accordingly, became a life-long interest. A
similar generic revision was added to Ownbey investigations in the early 1940s,
shortly after he had become a botany instructor and herbarium curator at
Washington State University. The second project concerned the genus Allium, a
diverse genus containing both natural and domestic species and again much
characterized by various hybridizations. Done in conjunction with a WSU
cytologist, Hannah Aase, the Allium project combined traditional methods of
plant description with root-tip chromosome counts and garden experiments. It
resulted in a number of papers which constituted definitive revision of the
North American species of this genus. In addition to these two projects, Ownbey
began work on a general Flora of the Pacific Northwest with another Missouri
Botanical Garden alumnus, C. Leo Hitchcock, who by the 1940s was at the
University of Washington. Ownbey also participated briefly in a war-time
botanical expedition seeking pharmaceutical plants in Ecuador. </p>
<p>Had Ownbey continued as he started he would have been known
principally as someone who had revised hybridization-prone genera and as a
contributor to a regional Flora. However, an almost accidental observation in
the late 1940s took his career into a considerably different direction and into
the project with which he became identified in his profession. This project
concerned the genus Tragopogon, an introduced plant of the American West, some
varieties of which had been used as a garden vegetable. This genus was prone to
hybridization and Ownbey observed it informally for several years. He first
commented on it in 1946 in a letter to geneticist Charles Heiser. But not until
early June of 1949 did he make the discovery that he had observed the natural
evolution of new species of Tragopogon occurring in his back yard. The first
known observation of a species evolving in nature, Ownbey's Tragopogon study
indicated that a chromosomal doubling had occurred without human intervention
and an apparently stable species had appeared. His description to a colleague
carried his sense of excitement about the discovery of the polyploid Tragopogon
species: </p>
<p>"<emph render="italic">I have been having an exciting time this spring
studying the origins of species in Tragopogon through natural hybridization and
amphiploidy. We have three introduced species in the Palouse area which
hybridize readily whenever any two grow together. The three Fl hybrids are
highly sterile but give rise on occasion to three possible amphiploid. I have
been observing the Fl hybrids between the two species for several years. This
spring I found their amphidiploid and with this lead worked out the rest of the
story. It is easily the most spectacular case that has yet been discovered.
This would apply to the first case let alone its triplication.</emph>" (Ownbey
to Phillip Munz, June 28, 1949)</p>
<p>An informal paper on the genetic behavior of Tragopogon presented
these observations in the spring of 1949. The following year a more formal
presentation appeared in the American Journal of Botany, at which time Ownbey
assigned names and published description of the two newly-evolved species of
Tragopogon. Despite the publication of the species, Ownbey felt a degree of
reservation about his findings. In later publications he expressed caution
about the validity of the new species, although he continued to list them.
Such, for example, was his practice in Vascular Plants of the Pacific
Northwest, the regional Flora produced in cooperation with his associate
Hitchcock and another collaborator, Arthur Cronquist, who joined in the project
in the late 1940s. </p>
<p>Tragopogon tended to dominate the rest of Ownbey's botanical career.
His initial article of the subject quickly proved to be a classic. More writing
on the subject followed closely. Then in 1954, the investigation of further
phases of Tragopogon won Ownbey a Guggenheim fellowship. The fellowship enabled
Ownbey to spend a year in Europe examining historical Tragopogon specimens, as
well as affording time to observe some species in their native area of the
Balkan peninsula. It also enabled him to establish contact with Russian,
Bulgarian and Turkish botanists, who offered to find specimens of the varieties
of Tragopogon found in remote areas, principally within the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Ownbey returned to the United States with much information about
Tragopogon, though not enough to complete a global generic survey. For several
years he sought to acquire the Asian species necessary to the task, but only
over a long period of time did some material become available. Even the Russian
correspondents had difficulty acquiring materials, as many of the species
existed in remote areas of the Caucasus and Asiatic Russia, and, possibly, they
had been discouraged from cooperation with a western geneticist. Consequently
Ownbey's work with Tragopogon tended to take a more specialized approach. His
greenhouse and garden plantings, accordingly, came to be used by himself and a
succession of graduate students as materials for examination of very specific
questions about genetic mechanisms. </p>
<p>In the later 1950s, Ownbey partly turned his attention from the
Tragopogon project to production of Vascular Plants of the Pacific Northwest.
Although this five-volume work came to be more the project of Hitchcock and
Cronquist, two more traditional taxonomists, Ownbey's genetic insights had an
influence. Working in close association with Cronquist, who was located in New
York City, Ownbey proved he could also work in traditional manners. This
approach also appeared in his contribution of the section on the genus
Castellija, in which he "monographed" the genus with Greenmanian thoroughness.
</p>
<p>Through the 1950s and 1960s, a constant series of small matters
concerning Allium and Calochortus had been in the background of the more
spectacular Tragopogon project and the regional flora. Also, Ownbey had been
administering the University herbarium during all this time, as well as
teaching classes in botany. By the later 1960s the herbarium and his teaching
duties began to occupy greater portions of his time, and his research activity
slackened. He died in December 1974 at the age of 64. Shortly afterward, the
University herbarium was named the Marion Ownbey Herbarium as a tribute to him.

<p>What would become Camp Larson began in the summer of 1950, when Washington State
University and the State Society for Crippled Children and Adults sponsored a summer
camp at an Episcopal Church Camp located at Point McDonald on Lake Coeur d’Alene.
The camp was named Camp Manitowish (or Manitou-Wish), and Roger Larson and Ruth
Radir were co-directors. In 1955, WSU purchased 40 acres on Cottonwood Bay (still on
Lake Coeur d’Alene), and the camp was moved there, to what would become its
permanent home. The Manitowish name was lost in the move, and the new location was
known as Camp Easter Seal, which had been an unofficial second name in the earlier
location. In 1977 the name was officially changed to Camp WSU, and in 1980 it was
named Camp Larson following founder Roger Larson’s retirement. Use of the camp
subsequently decreased over the years, and despite a push for renewed usage in the
late 1990s, WSU closed the camp in 2003 and sold it the following year.</p>

<p>The Executive Budget for Washington State University comprises both a capital budget for new construction and similar projects, and an operating budget for existing and new research and educational programs. WSU's Executive Budget Committee consisted of higher level members of the Budget Office, the Provost's Office, and similar positions, and was responsible for proposing the Executive Budget for submission to the governor and legislature, and for adjusting these plans based on funding the legislature was willing to give the university. Circa the year 2000, the Executive Budget Committee transitioned into a Budget Council. The same process appears to exist as of 2016, though the term "executive budget" is no longer used; it's simply the "biennial operating and capital budget."

<p>From the guide to the Save Our Summers Records, 1975-2004 (Collection number: Cage
749):</p>
<p>Save Our Summers (SOS), a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, was organized in
1995 to raise public awareness about the environmental and health hazards of the
agricultural practice of grass burning, and to strengthen regulations to protect
public health and air quality. SOS was originally formed in response to practices in
Spokane County, WA, and subsequently expanded its area of concern to include wheat
stubble burning in the Palouse region.</p>
<p>Patricia Hoffman, a retired veterinarian, founded this nonprofit volunteer
organization in Spokane. SOS recruited volunteers through membership drives,
advertisements in local newspapers, and public meetings. Many members and their
families had personally experienced health problems linked to smoke and emissions
from agricultural burning. SOS challenged government agencies and farmers to more
effectively regulate, reduce, and halt the practice. SOS pursued these goals by
holding meetings, writing letters, lobbying government officials, circulating
petitions, distributing educational literature, and initiating legal action.</p>
<p>At about the same time, the Clean Air Coalition (CAC) organized separately in
Sandpoint, ID, to address similar agricultural burning on the Rathdrum prairie. The
two groups made attempts to work together, but because most of the local organizing
happened at neighborhood meetings, the geographical separation was problematic.
Another group, Safe Air For Everyone (SAFE), was organized in 2001 following some of
the worst burns on the Rathdrum prairie. SOS and SAFE worked cooperatively, using
the court system in their efforts to end agricultural burning in the region.</p>
<p>SOS filed lawsuits challenging government actions and public policies in Washington
and Idaho. In 1999, the group initiated three lawsuits against Washington State
Department of Ecology (DOE), and in 2000 filed suit against two State of Idaho
departments, Agriculture and Environmental Quality.</p>
<p>SOS filed its first case in Thurston County (WA) Superior Court, the jurisdiction in
which the Washington DOE headquarters is located, on March 19, 1999. SOS claimed
that DOE had violated the state Clean Air Act by making a voluntary agreement in the
form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Washington Association of Wheat
Growers (WAWG) to reduce pollution from field burning. SOS also alleged that the
agency violated state rulemaking requirements and failed to fully consider the human
and environmental health consequences of this agreement. Judge Richard Hicks
observed that he failed to see how an agreement that moved growers in the direction
of less burning was harmful. The courts also ruled that since the MOU between DOE
and WAWG was a voluntary agreement, failure to reach the goals stated in the MOU
were not punishable offenses.</p>
<p>The second suit was filed in Thurston County Superior Court on August 11, 1999. SOS
alleged that DOE was in violation of the state Open Records Act for failing to
disclose key documents relevant to reduction of agricultural burning. Specifically
at issue was a report by the WAWG about their public relations plan to garner
support for their deal with DOE. DOE was cleared of wrongdoing, but the judge ruled
that SOS was correct in filing the suit and ordered DOE to pay SOS's court costs and
legal fees. The judge also directed SOS and DOE to reach an agreement on any
additional documents requested by SOS.</p>
<p>The third suit, initiated by SOS with families from Whitman County, WA and Kootenai
County, ID, was filed in U.S. District Court in October 1999. They sought an
immediate halt to field burning. SOS argued that DOE was in violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They argued that by failing to regulate the
smoke generated by wheat-stubble burning, DOE was preventing access to public
resources by people suffering from respiratory diseases severely aggravated by the
smoke. A final ruling was delayed several times as the judge waited to hear from the
U. S. Department of Justice over the question of jurisdiction in the case.
Ultimately, SOS and all other parties in the suit agreed to resolution through a
mediation process.</p>

of farmers' issues and for winning legislation to ease farmers' problems associated
with the high cost of goods and services, and the low prices received for
commodities. The Grange in later years became one of the principal general farmers'

<p>Veterinary science has been a part of the curriculum of Washington State University
from the institution's beginning in 1890. Within seven years, veterinary science
expanded from one course to become a major division: the School of Veterinary
Science. Upon completion of a three year program, the first class of Doctors of
Veterinary Medicine were graduated in 1902. The school was designated the College of
Veterinary Science in 1916, and the program of study was extended to four years. In
1925 the title was altered to the College of Veterinary Medicine. Reorganization in
1945 made the Veterinary College a subdivision of the Institute of Agricultural
Sciences, however during the 1960's the College regained its autonomy. Presently the
College of Veterinary Medicine is comprised of the departments of (1) Anatomy,
Pharmacology/ Toxicology, and Physiology, (2) Clinical Medicine and Surgery, and (3)
Microbiology and Pathology as well as five special programs.</p>
<p>Classes in veterinary medicine have been taught at Washington State University since
the institution's beginning. In 1899 the veterinary program was organized into the
School of Veterinary Science, and the granting of professional degrees for a
three-year program in veterinary medicine was introduced. The first graduating
class, consisting of two individuals, received their degrees in 1902. In 1906 the
degree program expanded from three to four years of study. </p>
<p>Beginning in 1908 senior veterinary students were taught at a clinic in Spokane,
where they could receive more practical experience, while all other students were
taught in Pullman. This arrangement continued until 1923 when all teaching
facilities and staff were brought to Pullman. In 1917, as a result of President E.
O. Holland's reorganization of the institution, the School of Veterinary Science
became the College of Veterinary Science. The name was altered to the College of
Veterinary Medicine in 1925. In the 1930's the degree program was expanded to five
years of study. Reorganization in 1944 made the College of Veterinary Medicine a
subdivision of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences until, due to pressure from
local and national veterinary organizations, the College regained its autonomy in
1950. </p>
<p>In 1979, in partnership with the University of Idaho, Montana State University and
Utah State University, the Washington-Oregon-Idaho Regional Program in Veterinary
Medical Education is formed, allowing students from various western states access to
a veterinary medical education, without paying out-of-state tuition. </p>

<p>The Washington State University Faculty Executive Committee (FEC), under the name
Executive Committee of the Faculty of the State College of Washington, was first
organized in January 1934. From this beginning two long-standing concerns of the
committee were evident: academic tenure and faculty salaries. Other matters of
concern to the faculty were also quickly brought before the committee. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because of what were termed "practical difficulties" encountered by the committee, it
nearly ceased operations during 1936 and 1937. In late 1937 the committee proposed
its own dissolution and the establishment of a Faculty Advisory Committee. By vote
of the faculty this was done and the Faculty Advisory Committee was established in
October, 1937. The change in name was meant to be a change in function. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1945, as a result of the reorganizations proposed by the Committee of Forty, the
Faculty Executive Committee was re-established and took over the functions of the
Faculty Advisory Committee. Recent accounts of the history of the committee refer to
the 1945 body as the "first" establishment of the committee. In each case the
records of the preceding body were transferred to its successor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the fall of 1971, with the establishment of the University Senate and the
subsequent reorganization of the committee structure, the FEC was again dissolved.
Its functions were divided between the Faculty Affairs Committee of the University
Senate (which did not begin operations until the following spring) and the
faculty-elected Faculty Status Committee. This split assigned personnel arbitration,
a major function of the FEC, to the Faculty Status Committee. Other matters,
formerly the responsibility of the FEC, were turned over to the Senate's Faculty
Affairs Committee. These included policy recommendations on appointments, promotion,
tenure, leave of absence, standards of performance, professional ethics, faculty
rights and responsibilities, academic freedom and faculty compensation. All of these
were given on-going consideration as revisions were proposed to the Faculty Manual.
Between the demise of the FEC and the establishment of the Faculty Affairs Committee
these matters were also handled by the Faculty Status Committee.</p>

<p>Leo K. Bustad was born in 1920 in Stanwood, Washington. He received his B.A. in
Agriculture from Washington State College (now Washington State University) in 1941.
Within a year of graduation, he married Signe Byrd, a Washington State College
graduate in Home Economics Education, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in
the Army, serving in Italy and Germany during World War II. He returned to Pullman
in 1945, after being a prisoner of war in a German prison camp for fifteen months.
Dr. Bustad went on to receive his M.A. in Animal Nutrition in 1948 and his D.V.M. in
1949 from Washington State College, as well as a Ph.D. in Physiology in 1960 from
the University of Washington. From 1949 to 1965, he also directed biological
research at Hanford Laboratories in Benton County, Washington. He then went on to
become the Director of the Radiobiology Laboratory and Comparative Oncology
Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, before returning to WSU as the
Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine (1973-1983). </p>
<p>Dr. Bustad's research initially focused on the physiological effects of radiation
exposure, but he is most widely known for spearheading the study of human-animal
interaction and the human-animal bond. Among his many accomplishments and
contributions to veterinary medicine, he co-founded and was the first Chair of The
Delta Society (Pet Partners), also serving as its first president from 1981 to 1988.
As of 2015, the society continues to present the Bustad Companion Animal
Veterinarian Award to a veterinarian working in the field of human-animal
interactions. Dr. Bustad founded the People-Pet Program at Washington State
University, and helped establish the journal Anthrozoos (1987) on human-animal
interaction studies, as well as the International Association of Human-Animal
Interaction Organizations (1990). In addition to his two books (Animals, Aging, and
the Aged and Compassion: Our Last Great Hope), Dr. Bustad co-authored Learning and
Living Together: Building the Human-Animal Bond, and contributed to over 200
academic articles during his career. </p>
<p>The WSU Veterinary Science Building was renamed Bustad Hall in 1985 in honor of Dr.
Bustad's service as Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine. He remained an
active member of the Pullman community until his death in 1998. </p>

<p>Mart A. Howard (1855-1926) was a businessman at Webster, Massachusetts
in 1897 when news of the Klondike gold strikes reached the United States. He
left from home in October of that year, taking a train to Portland, then on to
Seattle where he outfitted for a trip to Alaska. Leaving Seattle in January
1898, he traveled north via coastal steamer to Dyea, then across Chilkoot Pass
and along inland waterways to his eventual destination at Dawson, Yukon
Territory. In the fall of the same year, he returned to Seattle and purchased a
shipment of supplies, which he retailed in the Klondike the following spring.
Using the profits of this mercantile venture, he became a mine operator,
purchasing interests in various mines on the creeks north of Dawson. He
returned briefly to Massachusetts in 1900 after which he took his third trip to
the Klondike, this time accompanied by his wife and son. Howard remained in
Dawson until 1905, after which he returned to Massachusetts permanently. In

<p>Lewis Levien Thompson was born on January 13, 1909 in Fulham, England. He spent his
childhood in north London with two younger sisters. He received a good conventional
education in private schools, and though he did not excel in academic areas, he was
a good singer and accomplished pianist. His happiest memories of childhood were the
times the family spent on long summer holidays in West Molesey, Surrey at The
Priory, their quiet summer home. In early adolesence, Lewis became friends with a
Buddhist and began to read the scriptures of the East. This new interest began to
distance him from his family so much so that in his teens he lived on his own in
London with a small legacy from a relative. He did not go to the university but
educated himself in the classics, including the translations of Chinese, Japanese,
and Indian classics. He also read extensively in anthropology and psychoanalysis. In
his adolescence, Lewis underwent the first severe crisis of his life, the turning
point on which his whole future life revolved. He discovered Rimbaud at the age of
21, and finally he, like Rimbaud, rejected literature. He realized the truth in
Rimbaud's remarks of a wish to possess the truth in one soul and body and the
impossiblity of this wish. Rimbaud saw the only solution for the poet of integrity
was to abandon all attempts as a poet. Thompson too experienced the anguish of a
young artist who is certain that "the truth cannot be told" and that in his writing
he wrote only half of the truth which is an untruth. On recognizing this, Thompson
destroyed the manuscript he had worked on for five years. In the future, he would
write only as a form of spiritual excercise. </p>
<p>Thompson believed that in the West all was distorted and fragmentary, while in the
East he could find what was clear, classical, and complete. He wished to travel to
the East and was given money for the fare to Ceylon by Sir Arnold Wilson, a Persian
explorer, who took pity on Thompson. He departed from England on July 26, 1932 and
lived in India for the remaining seventeen years of his life. While in India, he
wandered the country living off of what others would give him in the form of food
and lodging. During this time, he carried all his possessions with him in one trunk,
including all his papers. (This explains why some of the paper is in such a
deteriorated state.) Thompson was not interested in finding a guru in the beginning,
but in 1936 he developed a relationship of affection, intensity, and frankness with
a man Thompson called Jnani, or Man of Knowledge. Their relationship ended in 1943
when Jnani withdrew from the unconventional and untraditional relationship which he
and Thompson had established. In 1943, Thompson found employment in the Rajghat
School in Benares as the writer-in-residence and librarian. He remained there for
four years. When the job at Rajghat ended, Thompson drew a small stipend from G. D.
Birla, the industrialist and a friend of Gandhi. </p>
<p>In his last years, Thompson wrestled with declining health, a problem he had
throughout his adult life. His end came when he returned to Benares in the lethal
heat. He was found wandering by the river in a daze with the effects of sunstroke.
He went to bed with a high fever and died alone in his room on June 23, 1949. He was
cremated and his ashes spread over the Ganges River. After his death, Thompson's
poetry was sent to Edith Sitwell by Deben Bhattacharya. Sitwell saw the poetry as
the work of a genius and published some of it in an anthology she compiled. </p>

<p>In 1926 scientists working mainly for western agricultural experiment
stations organized an association for the purpose of studying oil spray
insecticides. The group's objective was to discover new and better ways of
protecting fruit crops from disease and insects without exposing humans to
hazardous chemicals such as lead-arsenic compounds, DDT and Parathion.
Initially, government and business expressed only a cursory interest in the oil
spray project. As the quality of the research teams' work became apparent,
interest in organizing a public/private cooperative intensified. </p>
<p>In 1935, agricultural experiment station scientists from Washington,
Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, representatives from the agro-chemical industry,
and officials from the American and Canadian agriculture departments formed the
Western Cooperative Spray Project. The organization's objectives included: the
rapid advancement of knowledge concerning the control of fruit insects and
fruit diseases; the promotion of consistent test results from region-to-region
through the use of a successful standardized system of experimentation; the
broadening of knowledge among those engaged in the fruit industry through
annual reports of findings, and the establishment of mutual confidence. </p>
<p>As a part of its research work, each cooperating unit included a spray
project, provided it with sufficient operational funds, and assigned a chemist,
an entomologist, and a plant physiologist or plant pathologist to the project.
The cooperative decided on which materials, methods, insects, and plant
diseases should be utilized and studied. At the beginning of each year, the
project members gathered for a conference at which papers were read, findings
were discussed, and proposals for future research made. </p>
<p>The project's members conducted many experiments on a variety of
crop-damaging insects and diseases. The project also explored the effects of
some insecticides and fungicides on humans. </p>
<p>By 1946, the project's scope was expanded. New member states were
added, as were additional representatives from government and business.
Research topics became more complex, and the papers presented at the
conferences won wide acclaim. The Western Cooperative Spray Conference
continued to operate through the early 1950s. </p>

<p>View-Masters date to 1939, created initially by Sawyer's Photo Services (later purchased by GAF Corporation). A View-Master is basically a stereoscopic viewer designed to view seven pairs of film images, rather than pairs of printed photographs that a traditional stereoscopic viewer would view. During the 1940s and 1950s they became very popular; the most common subject of View-Master reels tended to be scenic views of tourist destinations.</p>

<p>Solomon Pimsleur was born in Paris, France, in 1900 and emigrated to
the United States with his parents at an early age. Completing both his
undergraduate and graduate studies at Columbia University he was the recipient
of a Julliard Fellowship in 1926 and studied at the Summer Institute of the
Mozarteum, Salzburg, Austria, in 1929. An honorary D. Mus. was awarded to him
by the Boguslawski College of Music in Chicago in 1940. He died in New York
City in 1962. With over 120 compositions to his credit, Pimsleur can be
considered a prolific composer. His work aroused some early attention, but he
gained little recognition later in his life. Nor did he ever succeed in
securing an academic position. A performance of his
<title>Symphonic Ballade</title> by the Philharmonic Society of New York
at Lewisohn Stadium in 1933 marked the sole performance of any of his works by
an established professional ensemble. Subsequent performances of his
compositions were in large part due to his own persistent efforts. While his
compositions drew praise for the craftsmanship they exhibited, Pimsleur's
self-declared conservative style put his music outside the mainstream of
contemporary development. A posthumous concert of his music was arranged by his
wife Meira in 1965 and was presented in Carnegie Recital Hall, New York
City.</p>

<p>Murray David Henry was a Pullman pioneer and businessman. He was born
on May 26, 1865 in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, to David Steward Henry (d.
1911) and Rebecca Cline Henry (d. 1912). Murray Henry was one of five children.
His siblings included Mrs. J. T. (Mary) Chilton, Whittier, California; George
N. Henry (1853-1926), Pullman; John T. (1862-1926), Pullman and Spokane; W. D.
Henry, Chambers; and Mrs. Alice Hardy, Palouse. In the late 1860s the family
began moving west for Oregon. Due to misfortune they only traveled as far as
Missouri. In the spring of 1879 the Henrys left Missouri by wagon and finally
headed west. After six months on the trail, they arrived in the Palouse
country. Instead of continuing on to Oregon, they stayed in Washington
Territory and farmed land on Union Flat near Pullman.</p>
<p>Murray Henry was a businessman in Whitman County, Wash., for all his
adult life. In 1881, at the age of sixteen, he began operating a freight wagon
between Almota and Colfax. By the late 1880s, he farmed a section of land on
what later became Pullman's Military Hill. He also farmed what was known as the
Drinkwater place north of the town.</p>
<p>In 1889, Henry constructed his first of several business buildings in
Pullman. It was destroyed in the fire of 1890. He then constructed the first
brick block built after the fire. He was also associated with his brother, John
T., in the contracting business. Henry served on Pullman's first volunteer fire
department. He also was a member of the city council for nineteen years. Henry
retired from business shortly after the First World War, but he remained a
long-term investor in Pullman real estate, both business and residential
property.</p>
<p>Murray D. Henry married Lou S. Clark of Oregon on July 20, 1892. They
became parents of five children, Mrs. Mabel Henry Tatham and Arthur Henry of
Pullman; Mrs. Laurel Henry Goff of Walnut Creek, California; Ernest Henry of
Opportunity, Washington; and Harold Henry of Salem, Oregon. Lou S. Henry passed
away on October 17, 1926. In 1933, Murray Henry married Edith Cox of Pullman.
She died in 1945. Murray D. Henry died on August 28, 1948, in Pullman after
suffering a stroke.</p>

<p>G. J. Lomen and his son Carl originally came to Nome as part of the 1900 gold rush. G.J. Lomen soon established a profitable law practice. In 1903 Carl's mother, sister Helen, and brothers Ralph, Harry and Alfred moved from Minnesota to Nome. Brother George arrived in Nome in 1906, opening a men's furnishing store in 1907. The family was involved in many commercial and civic interests including law, their reindeer corporation, lighterage, retail, and photography. In 1908 the brothers bought a photographic studio and later bought the negatives of several other photographers including Dobbs, Nowell, Goetze and Kinne. Brothers Carl, Harry, Alfred, and Ralph Lomen were partners in the business. Harry managed the studio and all of them took photographs, quickly learning how to keep cameras in working order at Arctic temperatures. Alfred became particularly interested in photography and took most of the photos. In September 1934, a fire destroyed their studio along with 25,000-30,000 negatives and 50,000 commercial prints. Approximately 3,000 negatives were salvaged. The Lomens never reopened their photography business but they remained in Nome, pursuing their other business enterprises, including the Lomen Reindeer Corporation. By the 1940's they all moved to Seattle, Washington, where George died in 1934, Alfred in 1950, Harry in 1957 and Carl in 1965.</p>

Daggy headed the Speech Department from its inception in 1923 until 1946 and

<p>On May 22, 1891, the Board of Regents took possession of the 200-acre farm donated by
the citizens of Pullman for the site of the Washington State Agricultural College,
Experiment Station, and School of Sciences. In the early years, program offerings
were listed only as “Agriculture.” It was not until the arrival of President Holland
in 1916 that the institution was restructured into colleges, departments, and
schools. Also in 1916, there was pressure to make the Department of Home Economics
part of the Department of Agriculture. After surveying the work of other
institutions, Agnes Craig, Department Head, wrote, “Since homemaking is a universal
need, would it not be desirable to create as part of the newly organized State
College of Washington, a separate organization, the first College of Home Economics,
thus recognizing the importance of education in that field and giving the work the
dignified position that it deserves?” When the reorganization was announced in June
1917, it was confirmed that the College of Home Economics would be one of the five
colleges. The College of Agriculture and Home Economics has undergone many changes
over the years – the merging of the Colleges of Agriculture and Home Economics in
October 1982, programs moving from other colleges to CAHE, departmental name changes
and mergers, joint programs with other colleges. Martin Waananen was the chairman of
the department of general agriculture, assistant director for the resident
instruction, and project director for the Indonesia project all at the same
time.</p>

<p> Esther Elizabeth Pond Smith was born in Craig, Nebraska on December 25, 1899 to Charles and Anna Pond. In her senior year at Plainview High School in Nebraska, Smith took on a job as a rural teacher of home economics. After graduation, she enrolled at Iowa State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts in Ames, Iowa, and completed her Bachelor of Science in home economics. In 1923, Smith returned to Plainview and continued to teach home economics to families preparing to work on farms under the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. In 1925 she returned to Iowa State College to work as the college’s Extension Clothing Specialist, and in 1928 moved into the general home management branch. In 1930, she accepted a position at the University of Wyoming in Laramie to develop a new department of home management for their extension service. However, in 1933, funding for her department was cut and she returned to Iowa State College Extension. There she started a 4-H program in home management through the Extension Service, which was the first program of its kind in the United States.</p>
<p> In 1935, Smith came to Pullman to become Washington State College’s Extension Economist in home management. During her time in this position, she wrote more than twenty publications for the Extension Service and was published in Kelvinator’s <emph render="italic">Kitchen Reporter</emph>. Most of her articles related to time and motion economy, and streamlining common household tasks. Smith’s work and studies are focused on domestic management, which, during her career, she studied at Columbia University and Purdue University. While at WSU, Esther collaborated with Stanley A. Smith, University Architect and professor and Head of the architectural engineering department. The pair collaborated on many Extension Bulletin publications related to home design and space requirements for maximum efficiency of tasks, and won fourth prize in the <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph> contest for best kitchen design. Stanley and Esther were married on September 27, 1945. Esther continued to work with the Extension Service and was hired as Instructor of household equipment for WSU’s home economics (euthenics) department. During this time, Esther also received her Master’s degree from WSU in home economics. In 1945 she was appointed by the Human Nutrition and Home Economics Division of the United States Department of Agriculture to complete micro-motion studies on food preparation in farm kitchens in order to establish the most efficient arrangement of kitchen equipment.</p>
<p> When Stanley A. Smith retired in 1950, the couple moved to Ankara, Turkey where Stanley had been appointed architectural advisor to the Ataturk University Development Committee. When they returned to Pullman, Esther joined the Whitman County Historical Society, amassed a large collection of historic photographs of Pullman, and contributed regularly to <emph render="italic">The Bunchgrass Historian</emph>. Esther published a small book on the history of the small town where she and Mr. Smith summered (<emph render="italic">Excelsior Beach on Lower Twin Lake, Kootenai County, Idaho, 1966</emph>). An active local historian, Esther spearheaded the project to create the artesian well replica fountain on Kamiaken Street in Pullman. Moreover, Esther was in the process of writing a book about Pullman’s history, which she never completed. Her research and photo collection were given to the Whitman Historical Society at the time of her death. Both Stanley and Esther Smith died in Pullman in 1988.</p>

<p>The early history of Washington State University's College of Education, as revealed in these records, was closely bound to the career of Dean Alfred Alexander Cleveland (b.1876) and the development of primary and secondary education within Washington State. Born in Oregon, Cleveland acquired the Ph.D. in psychology from Clark University in 1906. In 1907 A.. A. Cleveland joined the faculty of the, then, state College of Washington as Assistant Professor of Psychology. Between 1908 and 1910 he first became full professor and then temporary head of the education department. In those times education and psychology were parts of the same department. During the 1917 reorganization WSU was divided into five colleges and four schools. Cleveland's responsibilities then included the deanship of the School of Education and directorship of the annual Summer Session. The records indicate the important role the Summer Session played in enlarging the formal training of primary and secondary teacher in the State of Washington.</p>
<p>Thus from the early years Dean Cleveland was to play an important role in developing education and psychology at WSU. Often in those years he was the only full-time teacher in the department of education. In addition, he served on many statewide educational committees and groups. His students were potent forces within the State of Washington calling for increased attention to quality education for all and adequate teacher preparation. Cleveland served as Dean of the School of Education until his retirement early in 1941.</p>
<p>Dean Cleveland's replacement, J. Murry Lee, came to WSU in January 1941 directly from the faculty of the University of Wisconsin where he had been and active scholar, teacher, and consultant to educational groups. He held the Ph.D. in Education from Columbia University and had experience as a school principal in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at WSU he proceeded to continue many of Dean Cleveland's policies but he also moved rapidly to help meet the impending war needs of the United States. Lee's first years at WSU were interrupted when he was called to serve in the U. S. Navy from 1943 to 1945. Cleveland temporarily resumed his duties as dean of the School of Education during Lee's absence. However, to ease Cleveland's administrative burden Lee removed the direction of the Summer Session from the Dean's Office. He placed fellow faculty member L. L. Chisholm in temporary charge of the Summer Session. The records show that this new situation produced great strain between the temporary Dean and the temporary Director of the Summer Session.</p>
<p>Upon Lee's return direction of the Summer Session reverted back to the Dean's Office. In addition, Lee began to take up the problems of post-war American education. For example, the program of inservice teacher Preparation was expanded to meet the new demands of returning veterans and the predicted post-war "baby boom." The records show that the WSU College of education actively worked to secure the same objectives it had always sought--quality education for all Washington State citizens through high quality teacher preparation.</p>

<p>The Western Sudan Agricultural Research Project, 1979-1986, was funded by the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank. The Agricultural Research Corporation, research division of the Government of Sudan's Ministry of Agriculture, was a partner in the research program. The Consortium for International Development, of which Washington State University is a member, signed with the University's International Programs Development Office in August 1979 to implement the work. Washington State University provided the leadership and administrative support. The World Bank, initiator of the original plan, remained a co-funder, paying for the purchase and operation of an airplane to transport goods and personnel across the 350,000 square miles of the project. </p>
<p>The project aimed to meet the needs of the Western Sudan by: providing training; improving the agricultural research capabilities of four Western provinces; and raising the standard of living for subsistence farmers and pastoralists.

<p>[From the guide to the Catherine May Congressional Papers, Cage 304): </p>
<p>Catherine May was born Catherine Dean Barnes at Yakima, Washington, in 1914.
Graduating from Yakima High School in 1932, she attended Yakima Valley Junior
College through 1934, and then received the Bachelor of Science degree in 1936 and
the Fifth Year Education Certificate from the University of Washington in 1937. From
1937 through 1940, she taught English in the Chehalis High School, interrupting this
tenure for a brief period in 1939 to study speech at the University of Southern
California. </p>
<p>At the close of the school year in 1940, Mrs. May entered into a career in radio
journalism and advertising, first with station KMO in Tacoma, and later stations
KOMO and KJR in Seattle. From 1942 to 1944, she worked in advertising for Strange
and Prosser Advertising Agency and the Federal Insurance Company, both of Seattle.
She was in New York City 1944-1946 in the employment of the National Broadcasting
Company. Following this, Mrs. May returned to Washington State, continuing in radio
journalism at station KIT in Yakima through 1957. </p>
<p>Catherine May entered politics actively when she was a candidate and elected to the
Washington State House of Representatives in 1952, representing a Yakima district.
Re-elected twice, she remained a member of the state legislature until 1958, when
she secured the Republican nomination to succeed retiring Republican Congressman,
Otis Halbert Holmes. She was elected to the United States Congress six times and
served until 1970 when she was succeeded by Democrat, Mike McCormack. Upon leaving
Congress, she was appointed one of the Federal government trustees of the
quasi-public National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK). In May of 1971,
President Richard Nixon appointed her a member and Chairman of United States Tariff
Commission. </p>
<p>When Catherine May entered the United States Congress in early 1959, she was the
first woman Representative from the State of Washington. Also, she was the first
Representative from the State of Washington in quite a few years to be appointed to
the Committee on Agriculture, an assignment that is highly desired by
Representatives from Washington State. Mrs. May held this Agriculture Committee
assignment during her entire tenure in Congress. Work in this committee, and her
efforts on behalf of her constituents, occupied the center of attention throughout
her congressional career. Partially due to this concern with agricultural policy,
May was selected as a Congressional member of the National Commission on Food
Marketing, one of the numerous "study commissions" of the 1960's. During her last
term in office, she received a second committee assignment, the Joint committee on
Atomic Energy. She was, lastly, a member of the somewhat ephemeral but nevertheless
interesting, House Beauty Parlor Committee. </p>
<p>Although Representative May's attention centered on her committee and constituent
work, her career was not dominated by either of these. Like most members of Congress
in the 1960's, she was involved in almost every major public issue of the time. Her
papers reveal significant interests in consumer affairs, the "hunger" and poverty
issues, transportation policy, drugs, minority relations, and, on occasion, foreign
affairs. The return of a Republican administration to power in the 1968 election
increased May's contact and concern with the whole range of governmental and public
affairs. She was one of the congressional leaders that supported the administration.
She was apparently considered for the post of Secretary of Agriculture at the time
the Nixon Administration was organized. After leaving Congress, she continued to
receive significant appointments, including United States Tariff Commissioner, a
position of importance to the economic issues of the early 1970's. </p>

<p>Walter Strickland Thornber (1874-1959) was born in Illinois and received both his
Bachelor and Master of Science degrees from South Dakota Agricultural College
(today’s South Dakota State University) by 1899 and served on the faculty there
until 1904. Special studies at Cornell University followed and resulted in a Master
of Science degree in Agriculture. In 1900 Thornber married Phoebe Hough, who died
two years later. With his second wife Ethelyn Henry, Thornber had two sons, Gordon
and Merrill, and two daughters Evelyn and Georgeann. In spring 1905, Thornber
accepted an appointment as Professor of Horticulture at Washington State College and
horticulturist for the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station (WAES) at the
college. </p>
<p>As horticulturist with WAES, Thornber continued the farmers’ institutes and
demonstration trains begun by predecessors and wrote WAES bulletins such as 1910’s
“Cherries in Washington.” Glass-plate negatives in this collection furnished some of
the prints in Thornber’s bulletins. Thornber also conducted research on fruit
varieties suitable for local conditions in an already established experimental
orchard. </p>
<p>Thornber served as horticulture faculty and department head at WSC and
horticulturalist with WAES until the summer of 1911 when he resigned to become a
consulting horticulturist in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley. There, in the first two
decades of the century, the Lewiston-Clarkston Improvement Company (LCIC) and the
Lewiston Land and Water Company (LLWC), secured water and land rights in order to
irrigate and then sell orchard plots to those who “come here for a common purpose,
that of making homes in an orchard community for congenial conditions.” </p>
<p>These companies had solicited Thornber’s advice before he moved from Pullman to the
valley, but by 1911 they convinced him to move south where he could work more
directly with each company to plan the orchard plots and offer short courses about
fruit choices and care under the auspices of the Lewiston-Clarkston School of
Horticulture, of which Thornber was made the director. Thornber lectured daily on
orchard management, combatting pests, and other topics of interest to budding valley
orchardists. LLWC planned to devote about six thousand of its thirty thousand or so
acres in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley to experimental orchards and vineyards which
would also be used for laboratory instruction on pruning, spraying, grafting, and so
on. </p>
<p>National and state support for agricultural extension work coincided with the
diminishment of Thornber’s consulting work and brought him back to Pullman in 1915.
The State of Washington had provided funding for agricultural extension work at the
experiment station in Pullman and by 1911 the college’s Board of Regents separated
the agricultural extension work from the experiment station. With that division,
came the need to hire specialists within the Agricultural Extension Service. In 1914
the federal government responded to the demand for more extension work with the
Smith-Lever Act that granted money to each land-grant school for agricultural
extension work. This attention to the importance of extension work drew Thornber
back to Pullman and Washington State College in 1915 as the Director of Agricultural
Extension. </p>
<p>Thornber worked at WSC from 1905 until 1911 when he left to work as the
Horticulturist for the Leswiston-Clarkston School of Horticulture. He returned to
Pullman in 1915 as the director of the Washington Agricultural and Home Economics
Extension Service. He again left in 1919 to return to Lewiston to become a full-time
fruit grower. Walter S. Thornber died of a stroke April 1, 1959 in his home in
Lewiston, Idaho. </p>

orchards did very well through the rest of the decade, raising a number of apple
varieties for nationwide markets. These included the Starking Red Delicious. The
early 1930s economic downturn nearly left Sundquist in financial ruin. In 1948,
Sundquist and a colleague opened the Hansen Fruit and Cold Storage Company, in
Yakima. He later established the Sundquist Fruit and Cold Storage Co. In 1966, he
built a new controlled-atmosphere storage facility for processing, storing and
shipping apples from his 850 acres of orchards and those of others. </p>
<p>Sundquist was an active member of the community. He was an early communicant of
Yakima's First Presbyterian Church, giving much of his time and money. He made large
contributions for improvements in the congregation's pipe organ in the 1940s and
1950s, and for stained glass windows. He was president of the Lower Naches Telephone
Company, the the Yakima District Horticultural Society, and the Washington State
Horticultural Association. He also as a board member of the Yakima YMCA, founding
director of the Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital (later a trustee), director of the
Yakima Valley College, and member of the Yakima School board. Sundquist also helped
organize Yakima's first television station, KIMA-TV, and Yakima's educational
television station. </p>
<p>Early in the 1950s, Ralph became a member of the Atomic Energy Commission's Personnel
Advisory Board for the Hanford Project. He helped evaluate potential employees'
security clearance applications. At this time, he also became a director of the San
Francisco Federal Reserve Bank's Seattle Branch. In 1963, Ralph and two dozen other
regional agribusinessmen travelled around the world as part of the U.S. State
Department's People-to-People cultural exchange program. They observed crop
production methods in many developing Middle Eastern and Asian countries. Among his
many honors for civic activities, Ralph Sundquist received the Boy Scouts of
America's Silver Beaver Award for his commitment to the Fort Simcoe Council. He also
won the Greater Yakima Valley Chamber of Commerce's Award of Merit for outstanding
community service. He received the State College of Washington's Certificate of
Merit. </p>

<p>James L. Stevens (1892-1971), author of Paul Bunyan (1925), was born in Iowa and spent his early years there, first on a farm with his mother, and then in the town of Moravia with his maternal grandmother. At thirteen, he moved to southwestern Idaho to live with his father, who had homesteaded there after leaving his family before James was born. His formal education in public and industrial schools ended with the eighth grade, when he left the Weiser area on a freight train. He worked as a casual laborer in various parts of Idaho, moving from place to place on freight trains, and continued his education independently in public libraries.</p>
<p>During his military service with the Oregon National Guard in Europe during World War I, Stevens, who had been writing since he was very young, began publishing stories in Stars and Stripes. When his military service was completed he returned to Oregon and his former work as a laborer. He continued to write, publishing some of his work in national periodicals including the Saturday Evening Post and H. L. Mencken's American Mercury.</p>
<p>His first and best-known book, Paul Bunyan, a collection of "tall tales" about the legendary North American woodsman, was published by A. A. Knopf in 1925. After this early success, he regularly wrote and published stories, articles, and reviews in magazines and newspapers, and produced several more books, including Brawnyman (1926), Mattock (1927), Homer in the Sagebrush (1928), Saginaw Paul Bunyan (1932), Timber (1942), and Big Jim Turner (1948).</p>
<p>From 1937 to 1957, Stevens was public relations director for the West Coast Lumbermen's Association. While there, he helped initiate the "Keep Washington Green" program.</p>

<p>The ASWSU (Associated Students of Washington State University) Activities Center serves the university by organizing, directing and generally over-seeing many campus-related student group activities. Administering of student organizations includes constant evaluation and advisement. </p><p>The Activities Center was established with approval of the Board of Regents in the Spring of 1947 in answer to student and faculty demands. It began operation during the fall semester of that year. The goal of the Activities Center was to enable a joint student-faculty coordination and participation in student and campus life. The student-faculty cooperative effort was to be augmented by a staff of professionals through whose help the Activities Center was "to bring efficiency and direction by coordinating and guiding existing student organizations, by assisting new groups in developing new programs, an by aiding individual students in planning a balanced program of activities." (As observed in a Review of Student Activities Center Program, April, 1948). </p><p>At the time the Activities Center was organized, most of the social activities and student involvement in campus life were coordinated by living groups. As students' living arrangements gradually became more diffuse, the Activities Center became a more important central focal point coordinating their activities. The Activities Center, therefore, became a place of general guidance, assistance and counseling for student committees and concerns. Furthermore, it became a central repository for committee records where evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluative reports are filed with the Activities Center so that evaluations of the programs can be made; these reports are filed by Committee Chairmen, as well as by faculty advisors to individual committees. </p><p>The Activities Center also played a supplemental role in reorganization of the student government. Prior to the formation of the Activities Center, and for some time after it began, the major student government organizational structure was the class governments. However, in time, and especially during the decade of the 1960s, the ASWSU (an organization of all students) superseded the class government system, and the class governments were discontinued in 1968. For the Activities Center this has meant that the role of the students, in directing and actually involving themselves in the workings of the Activities Center, has increased. What was once a joint student-faculty arrangement, in conjunction with professional administrators, has become more of a joint effort between students and professionals.</p>

<p>Veterinary science has been a part of the curriculum of Washington State University
from the institution's beginning in 1890. Within seven years, veterinary science
expanded from one course to become a major division: the School of Veterinary
Science. Upon completion of a three year program, the first class of Doctors of
Veterinary Medicine were graduated in 1902. The school was designated the College of
Veterinary Science in 1916, and the program of study was extended to four years. In
1925 the title was altered to the College of Veterinary Medicine. Reorganization in
1945 made the Veterinary College a subdivision of the Institute of Agricultural
Sciences, however during the 1960's the College regained its autonomy. Presently the
College of Veterinary Medicine is comprised of the departments of (1) Anatomy,
Pharmacology/ Toxicology, and Physiology, (2) Clinical Medicine and Surgery, and (3)
Microbiology and Pathology as well as five special programs. </p>

<p>Blukis Onat Applied Sciences, Inc. (later simply BOAS, Inc.) is a Washington corporation registered in 1982 by Dr. Astrida Blukis Onat. Classified by the North American Industry Classification System under 541690, "Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services," this Seattle-based firm specializes in archaeological and ethnographic work authorized under federal and state regulations to provide for the management of cultural resources. </p>

<p>Astrida Blukis Onat's professional life in the Pacific Northwest began in 1966 with an appointment as an Anthropology and Sociology Instructor at the newly formed Seattle Community College (later Seattle Central Community College) from which she retired nearly 30 years later. During a 1973-1974 sabbatical, Blukis Onat continued graduate studies at Washington State University (WSU) and in 1980 completed her PhD in anthropology.</p>

<p>For the first couple decades of her teaching career, Blukis Onat organized summer archaeological field schools for her students. Because of opportunities for consulting work separate from her academic position, she founded in 1974 as a sole proprietorship Blukis Archaeological Consulting Service (BACS) and characterized it as "perhaps the second private contract archaeology company in Washington State" (Blukis Onat, "BOAS History").* BACS and Blukis Onat joined others around the United States in cultural resource management (CRM), a term and a profession that emerged in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Blukis Onat's WSU affiliation gave access to the emerging contract arm of the university's anthropology department, Washington Archaeological Research Center, as well as to private contracting firms such as National Heritage, Inc., co-founded by WSU anthropology professor Richard Daugherty. Through BACS and working for or sub-contracting with WSU-associated groups, Blukis Onat completed archaeological projects for government entities and private firms. By late 1978, though, the advantages of an approach outside of university/college bureaucracies that allowed not only quicker response times but also collaborations with nearby professionals for more complex projects resulted in Blukis Onat teaming with Seattle Central colleagues in the Institute of Cooperative Research, Inc. (ICR), a Washington corporation, and within a year directing large projects such as for the Washington Public Power Supply System and Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Blukis Onat left ICR to found Blukis Onat Applied Sciences (later BOAS, Inc.) in October 1982. Blukis Onat's progression from consulting within college or university structures to business incorporation mirrored a national trend from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s of private industry replacing institution-based groups in the management of cultural resources. Some American archaeologists characterize this transition as the discipline's bifurcation between the contract-based work of CRM professionals and the research focus of academic archaeologists.</p>

<p>Cultural resource management flourished during this era because of the confluence of historic preservation with natural resources protection in the stream of governmental regulations. The 1906 Antiquities Act articulated the federal government's interest in protecting historic and prehistoric sites on public land while the 1935 Historic Sites Act asserted that the protection of resources identified as of national historical or archaeological significance was in the public's interest. But before the 1960s, policymakers had not systematically applied those acts to foster a preservation ethic for a variety of cultural resources. Preservation measures for archaeologists, in particular, involved not the management of cultural resources but attempts to "salvage" data as infrastructure projects such as dam building inundated huge areas from the 1930s into the 1960s. Although the 1960 Reservoir Salvage Act mitigated the ad hoc nature of these information collection efforts, the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) solidified a national commitment to preservation in its call for "productive harmony" between "our modern society and our prehistoric and historic resources." NHPA orchestrated that harmony through provisions that constructed a management apparatus for cultural resources that included federal-state partnership in the formation of state historic preservation offices (and, after 1992 amendments, tribal historic preservation offices too), national oversight in the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, a more expansive definition of significance for cultural resources deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places that the act created, and the Section 106 review process that was critical for the development of the field of cultural resource management because it mandated that federal agencies consider the effects on cultural resources of any projects they carried out, approved, or funded.</p>

<p>Albeit NHPA's Section 106 established a management process for cultural resources affected by federal undertakings, cultural resource management's rapid expansion waited until after the 1969 National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). That statute called for "productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment" to be achieved by establishing the role of the federal government in assessing the effect of federally funded actions on the environment through its Environmental Assessment/Environmental Impact Statement process, which took into account "historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage." Thus NHPA and NEPA instituted a federal planning process to identify the effect of actions on the environment and on cultural resources. In 1971 President Nixon's Executive Order 11593 reinforced NHPA's preservation ethic and also called for locating and evaluating sites on federally owned or controlled properties. The 1974 Archeological and Historic Preservation Act authorized all federal agencies to fund investigations in order to mitigate the impacts of their projects on important archaeological sites.</p>

<p>The resulting historic preservation and environmental protection regulatory structure standardized a bureaucratic procedure of identifying and mitigating effects of actions on cultural resources that then created a market for CRM firms who could respond quickly to private and governmental requests for assessments. BOAS was one such firm. It competed for and secured many projects from the 1980s through the 1990s and into the 21st century. </p>

<p>In the 1980s, Blukis Onat continued as a full-time college instructor while directing the company and managing report production as principal investigator. Assisted by a limited staff of sometimes only a couple full-time employees supplemented by part-time workers, especially project-specific field crews, Blukis Onat and BOAS completed many small projects, most often surveys to locate prehistoric and historic sites within an area to be impacted by an undertaking such as highway realignment. Sometimes, though, the projects provided background used for planning. For example, Blukis Onat noted that in 1986 BOAS completed Washington State's first Resource Protection Planning Process (RP3) document ("BOAS History"). The National Park Service in the late 1970s advocated RP3, calling for each state to identify study units with common historical contexts and then to develop management plans for the cultural resources within them. Though RP3 generated much criticism and was replaced with more general guidelines for preservation and management plans, BOAS Project 198606 for the "Northern Puget Sound Study Unit" along with other study unit reports prepared for the state by other CRM contractors recorded early statewide cultural resource management efforts.</p>

<p>BOAS took on larger projects in the 1990s, some that included archaeological excavation for which data recovery required more temporary workers both for the field and the laboratory and demanded wide and deep data analysis to enable the synthesis necessary for reports that assessed responsibly the impact of an undertaking on the cultural resources. Blukis Onat characterized these projects as "equivalent to PhD dissertations" ("BOAS History") and noted the additional burden they imposed because clients often needed to be convinced that appropriate funding of report writing was as critical to compliance with CRM regulations as fieldwork. BOAS proved adept at these projects. In 2006, nearly a quarter century after the company's beginning, a principal with a competing CRM company remarked that BOAS had conducted more data recovery excavations than any other company in Washington state (Blukis Onat, "BOAS History").</p>

<p>The largest of these projects was a five-year contract with the Walla Walla District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reassess the Palouse Canyon Archaeological District (BOAS Project 199212). That district included the famed but inundated Marmes Rockshelter with its evidence of occupation more than 11,000 years ago as well as dozens of other sites. The scope of this contract required the company to secure a Small Business Administration loan to bulk up for a project that required field crews for each October from 1992 through 1995 for site survey and extensive rock shelter excavations, the subsequent analysis of what was recovered, annual report production, and a culminating, eighth volume with a management plan for the Palouse Canyon Archaeological District. During these years, BOAS managed $500,000 or more in contracts. The expanded workload allowed Blukis Onat to accept an early retirement from Seattle Central in 1995 and devote herself full time to the company no longer only as principal investigator but also often as project manager.</p>

<p>Projects ebbed and flowed as cultural resource management evolved in changing governmental environments such as ones that favored public-private partnerships. Another complex excavation project brought BOAS into one of these partnerships beginning in 1997. For a Tolt River water treatment facility, Seattle Public Utilities teamed with CDM Philip, the company in charge of designing, building, and operating the facility once constructed. That private firm then subcontracted BOAS first for monitoring during construction that quickly became large-scale data recovery of cultural resources several thousand years old and resulted in a six-volume report. The Tolt archaeological site generated more than bureaucratic paperwork and gray literature. Because its location was known as an old Snoqualmie settlement Stuwe'yuqw, members of several Northwest tribes visited the site. Chairman of the Snoqualmie Tribe Andrew de los Angeles organized volunteer efforts to continue investigations after the contracted work concluded and involved Snoqualmie Valley public schools as well. Archaeology Month activities in 1998 and 1999 offered visits to the site and to the laboratory. King County integrated the site into middle school curriculum for Snoqualmie Valley schools. In addition to these public outreach efforts, BOAS informed the professional archaeological community through a series of poster and paper presentations at the 1999 Northwest Anthropology Conference and the 2000 and 2001 Society for American Archaeology conferences. Finally Stuwe'yuqw starred in a 2001 video production for "Seattle Focus," a monthly video magazine on Seattle's governmental access channel. In these outreach efforts, BOAS Project 199705 revealed the wider reach possible for some CRM projects.</p>

<p>The Palouse Canyon and Tolt projects focused primarily on prehistoric resources but another project highlighted the company's ability to work with historic resources including standing buildings in the Swanson Lakes Wildlife Area in the Channeled Scablands of Lincoln County, Washington (BOAS Project 199710). Along with prehistoric land uses, BOAS documented historic ones through oral history interviews with local residents who recalled agricultural uses and with members of the Spokane Tribe and Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation who traveled to the area to harvest seasonally available plants.</p>

<p>The company's ethnographic research into the communities who moved across the Swanson Lakes landscape exemplified another shift in the scope of and approach to cultural resource management. Though not specifically a piece of CRM legislation, the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) identified the federal government's role in protecting access to Native sacred places. For federal landholding agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the act motivated them to identify such sites. As mentioned above, one of ICR's large projects was for Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. In 1980 this forest contracted for an inventory of tribal peoples' religious use of the forest. Working with thirteen tribes and different ethnographers over three years, ICR produced a three-volume report not in this collection but held by the forest. This experience in applied ethnography and the contacts made with Northwest tribal members produced long lasting results for Blukis Onat and ultimately for BOAS.</p>

<p>The founding documents of cultural resource management referred to "resources" and "properties," but not often to the people who produced them. Unlike NHPA or NEPA, AIRFA referred first to people in its call "to protect and preserve for American Indians" their religious rights. Though the 1988 Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association Supreme Court decision eviscerated the law's provisions to protect sacred places, AIRFA marked a shift in federal legislation solidified in 1990 when the National Park Service issued "National Register Bulletin 38: Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties" and in it defined "traditional cultural properties." The Section 106 review process had always included consultation with living communities and through it had, for example, been used to protect places a community, especially tribal peoples, regarded as integral to their identity. These locations, not all with distinct boundaries, became known in the bulletin as "traditional cultural properties" (TCP). The bulletin then provided guidelines to assess their eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places. Nothing in the bulletin limited designation of "traditional cultural properties" to Native American spiritual sites, but cultural resource managers most often use TCP for such sites.</p>

<p>A reorientation of CRM practice to recognize cultural resources' significance as defined by living communities and not just by research potential aligned with Blukis Onat's broadened anthropological approach that combined archaeology and ethnography. While conducting field schools for her SCC students, Blukis Onat had since the late 1960s regularly consulted with members of the Swinomish Indian Community (SITC) and in the 1970s had met Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe (SSIT) members. By the late 1980s, Blukis Onat worked with and for these communities as an ethnographic expert in court cases and because of her friendship with the sisters Jean Bedal Fish and Edith Bedal, edited their "Two Voices, A History of the Sauk and Suiattle People and Sauk Country Experiences." Though the legal work belongs to and resides with the tribes, the "Two Voices" manuscript is accessible here (BOAS Project 200003). BOAS produced an ethnographic literature review for Mount Rainier National Park that also resulted in a volume of the "Journal of Northwest Anthropology" devoted to reproducing Northwest Indian peoples' legends about Tahoma (Mount Rainier). Each of the above along with the earlier inventory of tribal peoples' religious use of Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest laid the groundwork in ethnographic practice essential for the Sound Transit's Central Link Light Rail project (BOAS Project 200005). For it, in addition to the archaeological monitoring and data recovery on prehistoric and historic sites, BOAS interviewed tribal members and defined as a traditional cultural property a series of rock promontories associated with mythological beings and events for the Duwamish people. For researchers interested not only in the results for archaeological work on prehistoric sites and a historic 1930s Hooverville in the Seattle vicinity but also in the integration of TCP and ethnographic studies, the data recovery reports, "Epic of the Winds" TCP National Register nomination form, and "Winds, Waterways, and Weirs" ethnographic study of the Central Link Light Rail route are available here.</p>

<p>In 2006, founder Blukis Onat hoped to sell BOAS and retire, but when that plan fell through she chose to complete the remaining archaeological projects in the next few years and continue ethnographic work with tribal governments. As of 2017, constrained but active, BOAS, Inc., lives.</p>

<p>The collection's most obvious value lies in the diverse topics represented by different projects, most in Washington, including data recovery for sites several thousand years old to those only a few decades old as well as applied ethnography with a number of Northwest tribes. Those interested in following the arc of the discipline of cultural resource management from its first years into the twenty-first century may do so here through close examination of the types of projects and for whom they were completed and of Blukis Onat's narrative history of BOAS, Inc., found in the Processing and Collection Documentation file. </p>

<p>For scholars interested in small businesses, BOAS certified as a Women's Business Enterprise and as an Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business. The narrative history tells tales of small business challenges: second mortgages; financial juggling necessitated by the nature of CRM work that required tremendous capital outlays to hire and equip field crews and sustain office staff sometimes for months before receiving any payment; the founder having to delay or default in paying herself; personnel management; billing overhead; and to the third of her three business lessons: "make sure one has access to loads of money all the time" (Blukis Onat, "BOAS History").</p>

<p>* "BOAS History" is not only a narrative history of BOAS, Inc., but also a professional autobiography of Astrika Blukis Onat. It can be found in the Processing and Collection Documentation file. </p>

<p>The ASWSU (Associated Students of Washington State University) Activities Center serves the university by organizing, directing and generally over-seeing many campus-related student group activities. Administering of student organizations includes constant evaluation and advisement. </p><p>The Activities Center was established with approval of the Board of Regents in the Spring of 1947 in answer to student and faculty demands. It began operation during the fall semester of that year. The goal of the Activities Center was to enable a joint student-faculty coordination and participation in student and campus life. The student-faculty cooperative effort was to be augmented by a staff of professionals through whose help the Activities Center was "to bring efficiency and direction by coordinating and guiding existing student organizations, by assisting new groups in developing new programs, an by aiding individual students in planning a balanced program of activities." (As observed in a Review of Student Activities Center Program, April, 1948). </p><p>At the time the Activities Center was organized, most of the social activities and student involvement in campus life were coordinated by living groups. As students' living arrangements gradually became more diffuse, the Activities Center became a more important central focal point coordinating their activities. The Activities Center, therefore, became a place of general guidance, assistance and counseling for student committees and concerns. Furthermore, it became a central repository for committee records where evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluative reports are filed with the Activities Center so that evaluations of the programs can be made; these reports are filed by Committee Chairmen, as well as by faculty advisors to individual committees. </p><p>The Activities Center also played a supplemental role in reorganization of the student government. Prior to the formation of the Activities Center, and for some time after it began, the major student government organizational structure was the class governments. However, in time, and especially during the decade of the 1960s, the ASWSU (an organization of all students) superseded the class government system, and the class governments were discontinued in 1968. For the Activities Center this has meant that the role of the students, in directing and actually involving themselves in the workings of the Activities Center, has increased. What was once a joint student-faculty arrangement, in conjunction with professional administrators, has become more of a joint effort between students and professionals.</p>

<p>Edwin L. Chalcraft was born on November 13, 1855, on his father's farm near Albion,
Illinois, where he lived until his marriage to Alice Pickering on October 13, 1880.
The following summer, Edwin, a teacher in the Albion Public School and a county
surveyor, and Alice also a school teacher, accepted the invitation of her brother
William to visit him in "Squak Valley" (now Issaquah), thirteen miles east of
Seattle. </p>
<p>Originally they had planned to stay only for a short visit; but in the spring of 1883
Edwin met Mr. Charles M. Anderson, a. recent graduate of the engineering department
of the Territorial University. Anderson and Chalcraft subsequently formed a
partnership and opened an office in civil engineering. Meanwhile in Squak Valley the
residents learned that Alice had taught school and persuaded her to instruct the
very first "Squak Valley" school. </p>
<p>In the summer of 1886, however, the city of Tacoma succeeded in securing the rail
terminal for the Northern Pacific Railroad. The ensuing depression in Seattle caused
the Anderson-Chalcraft firm to suffer along with other businesses. Then Chalcraft
learned of an opportunity to enter the Government Service as Superintendent of the
Chehalis Indian Reservation and Boarding School, seventy-five miles southwest of
Seattle. Chalcraft had agreed to stay at Chehalis for one year, but worked there
until 1889; when he became superintendent of the Puyallup Agency near Tacoma. At
Puyallup Chalcraft battled to protect the Indians from the greedy designs of white
land grabbers and from the less savory temptations of white civilization. </p>
<p>In 1894 the Agency sent Chalcraft and Alice to superintend the Indian Training school
at Chemawa, near Salem, Oregon. Edwin and Alice found Chemawa to be a most congenial
place to live and work; but when the Democrats swept into office Chalcraft found
through personal experience that political sympathies often outweighed
considerations of merit in placing and replacing people in federal jobs. In 1895 the
Indian Agency dismissed Chalcraft, without apparent reason other than his Republican
political affiliation. Thus Edwin and Alice returned to Seattle, where Edwin resumed
his surveying activities. During the years between 1895 and 1900 Edwin surveyed,
managed a grocery store and a shingle mill at Mt. Vernon. But in 1900 Republicans
under the leadership of William B. McKinley- returned to office and among the people
they brought with them were the Chalcrafts. The Agency reinstated Chalcraft then
sent him to the Shoshone Reservation in Wyoming. Within a few months the
Commissioner appointed Chalcraft to be Supervisor of Indian Schools. In this
capacity Edwin was responsible for inspecting the operations of the Indian Schools
in their entirety and for evaluating and if necessary correcting any charges of
maladministration or wrongdoing. </p>
<p>In 1904, after having traveled throughout the country in discharging his
responsibilities, Chalcraft requested and received reassignment to the Salem Indian
Training School at Chemawa, Oregon, the place he and Alice liked so well and from
which he had been so rudely removed in 1895. Edwin and Alice and their two children
lived and worked happily at Chemawa until 1911, when an assistant managed to
persuade the Indian Commissioner to remove Chalcraft on the basis of several charges
that Edwin was able to prove groundless. Though Chalcraft was able to exonerate
himself of these charges, the Agency Commissioner nevertheless transferred him to
the James Male Academy in Oklahoma. Chalcraft spent two rather hot and unpleasant
years at James Male Academy, but nevertheless admired the abilities of the Indian
students there. </p>
<p>In 1914, however, Chalcraft succeeded in getting a transfer to the Siletz Agency in
western Oregon. At Siletz Chalcraft pursued the normal duties of Superintendent,
teaching, organizing fairs and bands, basketball, baseball and football teams,
combatting the evil influence of liquor and generally endeavoring to impart to the
Indian students the practical abilities with which to integrate themselves with
white society. In 1925, as the time for his retirement approached, Chalcraft
recommended to the Indian Commissioner that the Siletz Agency be abolished and its
remaining functions integrated with the Chemawa, Agency. In Chalcraft's view, the
Agency at Siletz had accomplished its purpose of giving the Indians the practical
skills to cope with the white world. The Indian Commissioner complied with
Chalcraft's request, and on his birthday, November 13, 1925, Chalcraft and his wife
Alice, who had come to Chehalis to stay for a year, retired after forty-one years of
service. He and his wife returned to live at their home at 923 Cherry Street in
Seattle. Their son, a newspaperman, and their daughter also lived in Seattle. </p>

<p>Dr. Laszlo Valko (1907-1982) served as a Professor of Agricultural Economics at Washington State University from 1950 to 1972. Valko was born on June 18, 1907 in Budapest, Hungary. He earned doctoral degrees in law, political science, and economics at Budapest University. After completing his education in 1938, he entered government service, and directed the official social work in Hungarian agriculture until 1944. Valko left civil service and joined the Hungarian Resistance when Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Hungary in 1944. Following World War II, Valko was appointed to lead the Office of Social Administration in Hungary's Ministry of Social Welfare, but stepped down as Soviet influence spread throughout the country in late 1945. In 1946, he served as the director for the Central Institute of Farmers' Co-operatives, and also taught at the University of Szeged. In 1848, after the Hungarian Communist Party took control of Hungary's co-operatives, Valko and his wife, Helena, escaped to Switzerland. They immigrated to the United States a year later.</p>
<p>After a brief tenure at Iowa State University, Valko joined the Washington State University faculty in 1950, and remained a member of the Agricultural Economics Department at WSU until his retirement in 1972. Widely published, translated, and traveled, Valko represented the United States at many co-operative farming conferences worldwide throughout the 1950s and 1960s. After his retirement from WSU, he frequently delivered guest lectures at the invitation of numerous foreign governments.</p>

<p>The statewide organization Washington Women United (WWU) was established in 1979 by
Washington State Women's Political Caucus members as an independent unit to replace
the services of the defunct Washington State Women's Council. WWU's primary purpose
is to promote equal rights through legislative action, education, and networking.
Members include individuals and organizations who are advocates of women's rights
and proponents of the Equal Rights Amendment. Membership dues and pledges are the
basis of support for WWU. The primary activity of WWU is to lobby the Washington
State Legislature on issues of especial concern to women such as child care
programs, domestic violence, abortion, comparable worth, and education. An annual
poll of members determines WWU's position and lobbying priorities and guides its
legislative efforts. The group maintains a staff, office, and full-time lobbyist in
Olympia, and coordinates a statewide referral and information service on legislative
activity. In addition, WWU provides telephone lists, mailing lists, a hot-line
telephone service, information on lobbying techniques, news releases on political
positions and issues, annual meetings, and six yearly newsletters. The organization
also sponsors an annual legislative reception for elected officials which allows
women to become acquainted with their legislators. </p>

<p>International projects concerned with economic, agricultural, social and educational development began at Washington State University in 1952 with a Pakistan Project that was to run for almost 20 years. The Office of International Programs in the College of Arts and Sciences provided the management for that project and succeeding projects until 1978. The College of Agriculture was heavily involved in the projects and provided increasing assistance. A Campus Coordinator for international projects was established in the College of Agriculture for the University of Jordan Project (1975-1979). The Coordinator's office also acted as a clearing house for other projects in which the University was involved in the middle 1970's, such as those in Syria, Morocco, and Mali. In 1978 the International Program Development Office was established in the Graduate School of WSU to direct the international development projects.

<p>(From the guide to the Kenneth W. Brooks papers, Cage 685) </p>
<p>Architect Kenneth W. Brooks was born in Cedarvale, Kansas in 1917. He received his
undergraduate degree in Architectural Engineering in 1941 and a master's degree in
Architecture in 1948, both from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He
served in the Caribbean with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1941-1943) and the
U.S. Marine Corps (1944-1946). </p>
<p>In 1948 Brooks traveled to Europe on a University of Illinois Francis Plym
Fellowship, spending most of his seven-month trip in Sweden working with Sven
Markelius, a Swedish city planner and architect. </p>
<p>He moved to Spokane in 1948 and established his architectural practice there in 1951
(Kenneth Brooks, Architect; later Brooks, Hensley, Creager). He became an
award-winning urban designer and city planner; one of his most ambitious and
noteworthy projects was "A Place in the Sun," an urban design plan for downtown
Spokane. He participated very actively in the planning process for Expo '74, the
World's Fair held in Spokane in 1974. He designed several major commercial
buildings, including the headquarters for Washington Water Power in Spokane, the
Rogers-Orton Dining Hall at Washington State University, the Intermountain Gas
Company Central Service Facility in Boise, and the art-music-drama complex at
Columbia Basin Community College in Pasco, Washington. </p>
<p>Brooks was very active in his profession, frequently presenting papers to local,
regional, and national groups on topics in architecture, urban design,
transportation planning, and environmental policy. </p>

<p>Edward R. Murrow (1908-1965), the distinguished radio and television journalist, was an alumnus of Washington State College (WSC). Hired by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1935, Murrow worked for CBS until 1961 and then headed the U.S. Information Agency until 1964. Murrow became known first for his "This is … London" radio broadcasts during the Second World War and then as a television journalist who demonstrated the power of the new medium in his documentaries exposing Senator Joseph McCarthy's red-baiting and later the wretched conditions endured by migrant laborers in the United States. Throughout his lifetime, Murrow acknowledged his alma mater in word and deed, returning to campus to speak and to offer his voice to projects such as the 1952 promotional film "This is W.S.C."</p>
<p>Washington State University recognized the Murrow legacy in eponymous building and program names, lecture series, and awards. In 1973 WSU renamed the home of its communications programs after Murrow when the old Science Hall later Arts Hall connected by a skyway to a new building became the Edward R. Murrow Communications (later Communication) Center. That year also began a panel discussion and lecture series focused on media issues named the Murrow Symposium. The symposium welcomed over the next two and a half decades prominent journalists such as Howard K. Smith, Charles Kuralt, Ted Koppel, and Diane Sawyer. Beginning in 1997, the Murrow Symposium expanded to add recognition of communication leaders through the Edward R. Murrow Award. Sam Donaldson, Ted Turner, Christiane Amanpour, former Murrow colleague Daniel Schorr, and Tom Brokaw are among those to receive the award. </p>
<p>During his college years that began in 1926, Murrow studied radio broadcasting in one of the first courses offered in the nation in that field. He graduated in 1930 with a Speech degree and held in high regard the people and the training at WSC. The Speech Department's broadcasting courses that prepared Murrow were merged in 1964 with the Journalism Department to create the Department of Communications. In 1990 that department became the Murrow School of Communication and in 2008 the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication. </p>
<p>Murrow's lifelong connection to Washington State University was acknowledged again in 1994 when WSU in the Edward R. Murrow Communication Center hosted the dedication of the U.S. postage stamp honoring Murrow's achievements, the first broadcast journalist honored with a commemorative stamp.</p>

<p>Mechanical Engineering courses were offered at Washington State College (WSC) from
the school’s beginning in the 1890s. In 1917-1918, the Department of Mechanical and
Electrical Engineering was incorporated into the College of Mechanic Arts and
Engineering during a WSC reorganization. By the time Professor Howard Langdon became
department chair in 1933, the College of Mechanic Arts and Engineering had
officially separated. Langdon replaced Professor A.C. Abell as Mechanical
Engineering department chair following Abell’s sudden death from paralysis on
December 31, 1932. Langdon served as chair until 1944. </p>
<p>Prior to his death, Abell had gathered research and taken notes on designing and
operating a new power plant for WSC. Both before and after Abell’s death, Langdon
contributed to this research. In late 1933, the Mechanical Engineering Department
was placed in charge of designing, writing specifications for, and supervising the
installation of a new power plant at WSC, replacing the power plant that had heated
the campus for nearly thirty years. Langdon served as the Chief Engineer for the
design and construction of the new power plant. Funded by the New Deal’s Works
Progress Administration (WPA), the power plant began operating on October 25, 1935
and the WPA contract for the project was deemed officially complete on December 1,
1935. </p>
<p>During this same period, two other New Deal programs assisted the Department of
Mechanical Engineering. From 1933-1935, selected students received funding to stay
at WSC through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). The National
Youth Administration (NYA) replaced FERA following the 1935 enactment of the WPA.
Like FERA, the NYA provided work-study programs for selected college students
throughout the United States, including WSC’s Mechanical Engineering students. Both
programs intended to prevent students from dropping out of school and flooding the
job market. These federal programs helped the Mechanical Engineering department
survive the Depression, providing necessary funding for student tuition, jobs, and
campus projects.</p>

His family was part of a large and prominent community of families of German origin in Champion Hill in south London. As a fairly young boy, A.G. Martin was sent to Switzerland for his health and education, and while there he became interested in preparing for a military career in the Prussian army. His family sent him to Kassel, Germany for specialized education and training. He joined the Prussian army in 1893, and was commissioned as an officer in 1894.</p>
<p>His military assignments included work in foreign service as a military attache, most notably in Washington, D.C. during the Theodore Roosevelt administration. He served in the German army during World War I, and was taken as a prisoner of war by the Russian army in 1915. He was sent to a prison camp in Siberia, where he remained until December 1916 when he was returned to Germany in a prisoner of war exchange.</p>
<p>Martin served in the German army for 27 years, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Prussian 6th Dragoons in 1919. After his formal discharge, he joined his family at their home near Konigstein. He and his wife, Andree Richmers Martin, had three children, Gerald, Albert ("Bertie"), and Angela. In 1936, he published a memoir: Mother Country, Fatherland: The Story of a British-Born German Soldier (London: Macmillan, 1936).</p>

<p>The Washington State University Agriculture Research Center (ARC) is a part of WSU’s
College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences (CAHNRS). The ARC
began in 1892 as the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station, then an element of
the Washington Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science, now
Washington State University. Located near Pullman on a farm donated to the state,
the station became the site of agricultural instruction and experimental work
conducted by the staff of the station and the faculty of the College of Agriculture.
It soon extended to branch stations across the state. In 1946 it became part of the
Institute of Agricultural Sciences, and in 1965 it was integrated into the
newly-organized Agricultural Research Center (ARC) of the College of
Agriculture. </p>

<p>Prior to the advent of broadcast radio and television, governments looked to other
media to communicate information to their citizens. One of the most eye-catching
formats is the propaganda poster, the use of which peaked during World War I and
remained pervasive through World War II. The U.S. government alone produced an
estimated 20,000,000 copies of more than 2,500 distinct posters during the First
World War. Through these "weapons on the wall," governments persuaded their citizens
to participate in a variety of patriotic functions, from purchasing war bonds to
conserving scarce resources. These posters also strengthened public support for the
wars by providing "message control" about the government's allies and enemies. </p>

<p>Originally created in the late 1920s by Washington State University (WSU) President
Ernest O. Holland, the WSU Press began as a committee focused on scholarly
publishing. In April 1929, the Press distributed its first scholarly journal,
Research Studies. This journal became WSU’s primary academic publishing outlet
until the mid-1940s. Another scholarly journal was added to WSU Press in 1947,
Northwest Science, which originated with the Northwest Scientific Association and
had already been established for 20 years prior. Northwest Science is still an
active journal with the Press as of 2022. </p>
<p>An influential figure in the history of the Press was University Editor Henry
Grosshans, who made sweeping changes starting in the 1950s and remained a dynamic

<p>A University Architect served as the construction officer at Washington State University from 1911 forward. The modern form of the office dates from 1947 when it became a full-time, staffed administrative department. In 1967 the University Architect office was renamed as Facilities Planning, and then to Facilities Development in 1993. In 2001 it was renamed as Capital Planning (later Capital Planning and Development). While Capital Planning is responsible for major planning and development, smaller projects are conducted by Facilities Operations. Facilities Operations descended from the Physical Plant in 1998, which in turn descended from Building and Grounds in 1967. While each line of programs has existed separately, some migration in function has occurred over the years. The primary difference between Capital Planning and Facilities Operations is the cost of the project in question - initially items costing less than $1,000,000 were assigned to Fac Ops, and those costing more to CP. By 2009, this break point is between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000.</p>

<p>While the Washington State University Libraries date to the first days of the college, and while librarians have certainly conducted meetings amongst themselves, the official organization of the Library Faculty in its current incarnation dates to a September 15, 1970 meeting. The groups purpose, as defined at that first meeting, was "to promote the group's professional involvement in the field of library and information science; to provide for the group's active participation in the library and academic affairs of Washington State University; and to fulfuill those duties as listed [in] the Faculty Manual as they pertain to the Library." Prior to that, a Staff Association had been created after an August 10th 1946 directive from the Office of the President which recognized professional librarians as "Library Staff" and non-professional library workers as "Office and Technical Staff." Initially the Staff Assocation filled a role similar to the current Library Faculty group, but by the end of the 1960s its focus had moved more to internal morale and communications.</p>
<p>The Library Faculty Study Committee was established on March 9, 1971 to undertake studies on professional development, faculty review procedures, salary levels, working conditions, and fringe benefits. On February 26th, 1974, the Library Faculty renamed the Study Committee the Library Faculty Affairs Committee (LFAC), and its goals were redefined to monitor, investigate, and report to Library Faculty on University and Library matters which could affect the Faculty, as well as to insure Library Faculty input into matters of concern to the faculty. Additional short-term tasks and projects were initially defined and continued or resolved; early projects included an investigation into breaking the library into departments, and the creation of a library faculty manual.</p>

<p>William A. Inman was born in Limestone County, Alabama, on 22 January
1843. By the time he was five years old, Inman's family moved to Indiana.
Within the next few years both parents died leaving Inman homeless. During the
next few years, Inman worked as a hired hand for farmers. Relatives from Greene
County, Missouri, sent for him and he lived with them until he became an adult.
He received an education and also apprenticed in a printer's shop.</p>
<p>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Inman and his Missouri family
sided with the Union. In December 1861, he enlisted in Company H, Phelp's
six-month infantry regiment, of the Missouri volunteers. He left this unit the
following May and resumed his work in the printing business. In July 1862,
Inman again enlisted. This time he became a member of the Eighth Missouri
Volunteer Cavalry's Company K. Inman rapidly moved up the officer ranks as he
participated in the Battle of Pea Ridge, which cleared Confederate forces from
Missouri and achieved Union control of Arkansas, and the Battle of Prairie
Grove, which kept northwest Arkansas under Union control. Finally, he
participated in the Union siege of Little Rock, Arkansas. Inman resigned in
October 1864, in Arkansas, as a captain.</p>
<p>From 1866 through 1868, Inman was a superintendent and agent for the
Freedmen's Bureau in Craighead, Green, and Poinsett counties of Arkansas. In
his spare time, he read law. In June 1867, Inman was admitted to the bar in
Jonesboro, Arkansas. In 1868, he was appointed prosecuting attorney of the 3rd
Judicial Circuit, at Batesville. Six years later, Inman moved to Seattle,
Washington Territory. Inman practiced law in Washington. He moved from Seattle
to Port Townsend in 1877 and then to Colfax two years later. He lived in Colfax
for the next forty-five years, making a long and eventful career as a member of
the legal profession. By 1880, Inman was elected probate judge and served until
the position was abolished in 1890. He also served as city clerk for Colfax and
director and clerk of the district school. He was elected prosecuting attorney
for Whitman County in 1898.</p>
<p>Judge Inman was a member of several fraternal organizations: the Order
of United Artisans, the Grand Army of the Republic, the Ancient Order of United
Workmen, and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Of these, he attained the
ranks of grand master of the United Workmen; vice commander of the department
of Washington, G.A.R.; and all the offices in the I.O.O.F. In other activities,
Inman served as an officer in the Colfax Congregational Church and as president
of the Whitman County Bar Association. In politics, he was a Republican. Judge
Inman married twice: to Hannah Crosson, in April 1865 (she died in 1900); to
Mrs. Margaret M. Donnelly, in March 1901. He had five children by his first
wife. Inman died on 11 August 1924, eight months after he suffered a stroke.
His second wife and three of his children, Maggie Jane Inman Blair, William C.
Inman, and Frank Inman, survived him.</p>

<head>Organizational History:</head>
<p>Continuing education has been defined variously. As a specific effort, aside from content, continuing education takes the form of off-campus classes, correspondence course, recorded instructional materials, special short courses or workshops, and so on. In one form or another Washington State University has been involved in continuing education since its inception. Early efforts were chiefly concerned with agriculture. The nature of these programs changed considerably after the establishment of the Agr icultural Extension Service in 1915. In later years an engineering extension program was added, along with general extension, the last dating from 1921. General Extension's effort mostly nearly resembled continuing education as commonly defined.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s, the State College initiated various efforts at off-campus classes, taught chiefly at night. These "branches" were informally known as "Little WSCs." The program at Spokane was the most extensive. It survived in limited form following fiscal cutbacks in 1951 that basically cancelled the larger effort, with a program of night classes that lasted until 1968.</p>
<p>In the years following 1970, distance classes, video-tape instruction and similar programs led to the re-establishment of off-campus classes in various cities around Washington, and even one in an out-of-state location. These classes all involved spe cial subjects, mainly technical, and often were presented at the request of employers. In the years 1977-80, these programs became involved in complex state wide educational planning effort and in so-called "turf wars" that arose as schools with low enrollment sought to deploy their excess faculty members in extended campus programs.</p>

<p>According to the Washington State University (WSU) Faculty Senate web page (as of August 2012), "The mission of the Faculty Senate is to exercise the legislative powers delegated to it, and to make recommendations to the president and appropriate administrative officials of the University and through the President to the Board of Regents on matters affecting the general welfare of Washington State University and its educational, research, and service activities."</p>
<p>On April 12, 1971 WSU's Board of Regents approved the creation of a University Senate, which included undergraduate and graduate student representation, as well as faculty. The Senate originally arose out of student/faculty conflicts in the turbulent 1960s/1970s, and was intended as a place where faculty and student could cooperatively engage on legislative matters. On June 3, 1983, undergraduates were officially removed from the group, and the University Senate became the Faculty Senate.</p>

<p>The Fortune Press, originally named Fortune and Merriman, was founded in 1924 by Reginald Ashley Caton (1897-1971) in London, England. From the beginning, Caton encountered legal copyright conflicts with Nonesuch Press in 1925 and 1926. Although the case was not ultimately taken to court, in 1934 Caton faced trial when ten of his books were condemned for obscene libel.</p>
<p>Timothy d'Arch Smith (1936- ), assistant and later owner of Fortune Press from 1970 to 1971, blamed Caton's lack of success on his poor distribution. Early 20th century antiquarian booksellers described his books as "curious," many of them involving violence, poverty, "amatory unorthodoxy," and other obscenities. Until its closing in 1971, the Fortune Press published more than 600 books under the efforts of Caton.</p>

<p>[From the guide to the Catherine May Congressional Papers, Cage 304): </p>
<p>Catherine May was born Catherine Dean Barnes at Yakima, Washington, in 1914.
Graduating from Yakima High School in 1932, she attended Yakima Valley Junior
College through 1934, and then received the Bachelor of Science degree in 1936 and
the Fifth Year Education Certificate from the University of Washington in 1937. From
1937 through 1940, she taught English in the Chehalis High School, interrupting this
tenure for a brief period in 1939 to study speech at the University of Southern
California. </p>
<p>At the close of the school year in 1940, Mrs. May entered into a career in radio
journalism and advertising, first with station KMO in Tacoma, and later stations
KOMO and KJR in Seattle. From 1942 to 1944, she worked in advertising for Strange
and Prosser Advertising Agency and the Federal Insurance Company, both of Seattle.
She was in New York City 1944-1946 in the employment of the National Broadcasting
Company. Following this, Mrs. May returned to Washington State, continuing in radio
journalism at station KIT in Yakima through 1957. </p>
<p>Catherine May entered politics actively when she was a candidate and elected to the
Washington State House of Representatives in 1952, representing a Yakima district.
Re-elected twice, she remained a member of the state legislature until 1958, when
she secured the Republican nomination to succeed retiring Republican Congressman,
Otis Halbert Holmes. She was elected to the United States Congress six times and
served until 1970 when she was succeeded by Democrat, Mike McCormack. Upon leaving
Congress, she was appointed one of the Federal government trustees of the
quasi-public National Railroad Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK). In May of 1971,
President Richard Nixon appointed her a member and Chairman of United States Tariff
Commission. </p>
<p>When Catherine May entered the United States Congress in early 1959, she was the
first woman Representative from the State of Washington. Also, she was the first
Representative from the State of Washington in quite a few years to be appointed to
the Committee on Agriculture, an assignment that is highly desired by
Representatives from Washington State. Mrs. May held this Agriculture Committee
assignment during her entire tenure in Congress. Work in this committee, and her
efforts on behalf of her constituents, occupied the center of attention throughout
her congressional career. Partially due to this concern with agricultural policy,
May was selected as a Congressional member of the National Commission on Food
Marketing, one of the numerous "study commissions" of the 1960's. During her last
term in office, she received a second committee assignment, the Joint committee on
Atomic Energy. She was, lastly, a member of the somewhat ephemeral but nevertheless
interesting, House Beauty Parlor Committee. </p>
<p>Although Representative May's attention centered on her committee and constituent
work, her career was not dominated by either of these. Like most members of Congress
in the 1960's, she was involved in almost every major public issue of the time. Her
papers reveal significant interests in consumer affairs, the "hunger" and poverty
issues, transportation policy, drugs, minority relations, and, on occasion, foreign
affairs. The return of a Republican administration to power in the 1968 election
increased May's contact and concern with the whole range of governmental and public
affairs. She was one of the congressional leaders that supported the administration.
She was apparently considered for the post of Secretary of Agriculture at the time
the Nixon Administration was organized. After leaving Congress, she continued to
receive significant appointments, including United States Tariff Commissioner, a
position of importance to the economic issues of the early 1970's. </p>

<p>Courses in economics have been offered at Washington State University since the school was first opened in 1892. The original Department of Economic Science and History was incorporated into the College of Sciences and Arts in 1917 and it became the Department of Business Administration in 1926. Composed of five faculty members, the department offered, in addition to the regular economics courses, a thorough program in Secretarial Science. The staff increased to fifteen in 1928 and in the same year Business Administration was elevated to the status of a "school," although it functioned within the College of Sciences and Arts until 1940 when it was given independent status. Economics continued as a separate department in the College of Sciences and Arts until the two disciplines were merged in 1948 by Dr. M. W. Lee into the School of Economics and Business. It was given college status in 1963 with Dr. Eugene Clark functioning as the first dean. More recently the name was changed to the College of Business and Economics.</p>

<p>Sue Durrant was born in Salt Lake City, UT in 1937. She earned a bachelor's degree
from the University of Utah (1959), a master's degree from Washington State
University (1962) and a Ph.D. from The Ohio State University (1976).</p>
<p>Durrant joined the faculty at Washington State University in 1962. She served as the
head coach for women's volleyball from 1962 to 1975, as the instructor for the Fish
Fans synchronized swim group from 1962 to 1968, and as head coach for women's
basketball from 1971 to 1982. In addition to her coaching and teaching duties,
Durrant was instrumental in implementing the provisions of Title IX at Washington
State University, serving on numerous committees. She helped establish the Northwest
College Women's Sports Association (NCWSA) and was its president in 1970-71. This
organization became Region IX of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW). Title IX, passed in 1972, guaranteed women equal access to athletic
opportunities. In 1978 Durrant became one of the lead plaintiffs in the case Blair
v. WSU, in which student athletes and faculty members sued the university for equal
opportunities for women. The case was tried in 1982. The initial decision, though in
favor of the plaintiffs, exempted football from the calculations. This decision was
appealed to the WA state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that
football must be included.</p>
<p>In 1983 Durrant became the first delegate from Washington State University to the
Bryn Mawr Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration. From 1986 to 1989
she served as faculty representative to the state legislature in Olympia, and in
1986-1987 she was president of the Association for Faculty Women (AFW) at WSU. From
1990 to 1992 she served as chair of the Washington Council of Faculty

<p>The organizational role of the Washington State University News and Information Service, sometime known by its former name of News Bureau, was to provide media agencies with informational stories concerning all aspects of university activities. These activities involve students, faculty, and staff that have contributed newsworthy accomplishments while connected with Washington State University. The activities are divided into general sports and news releases. A number of university-related activities are covered by the WSU News Bureau. These include information files about individuals who have worked for Washington State University, sports and news releases for each year that extensively cover athletic-oriented activities, workshops, conferences, organizational groups, concert series, committees, speeches, theatrical productions, referendums, initiatives, as well as correspondence files and back-to-school stories. Over the years there have been a large number of editors of this organization: Alice Webb (1920s), Herbert Jenkins (1930s), Maynard Hicks (1940s &amp; 1950s), Dennis Morrison (1950s &amp; 1960s), and Richard Fry (1970s &amp; 1980s). Since the 1980s, the director has been Barbara Petura, with Al Ruddy, Sue Hinz and others serving as writers and editors. Other records are located at the WSU Libraries as record group Archives 65, WSU News Bureau releases from 1918 to 1977 and WSU 115, news releases from the early 1920s, located with University Publications.

<p>A University Architect served as the construction officer at Washington State
University from 1911 forward. The modern form of the office dates from 1947 when it
became a full-time, staffed administrative department. In 1967 the University
Architect office was renamed as Facilities Planning, and then to Facilities
Development in 1993. In 2001 it was renamed as Capital Planning. While Capital
Planning is responsible for major planning and development, smaller projects are
conducted by Facilities Operations. Facilities Operations descended from the
Physical Plant in 1998, which in turn descended from Building and Grounds in 1967.
While each line of programs has existed separately, some migration in function has
occurred over the years. The primary difference between Capital Planning and
Facilities Operations is the cost of the project in question - initially items
costing less than $1,000,000 were assigned to Fac Ops, and those costing more to CP.
By 2009, this break point is between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000. </p>

She pursued her education and passion for nursing throughout her life with constant studies and efforts to develop the field of professional nursing in Washington. Hilda Roberts served in numerous national, state, and local nursing organizations and worked to expand the field of nursing during its formative years.</p>
<p>Hilda became an assistant professor and director of the School of Nursing at Washington State College (WSC) in 1948. She worked with both the Deaconess and St. Luke’s hospital divisions of the WSC nursing school in the 1940s and 1950s. At WSC and later WSU Hilda Roberts worked in Community College outreach, the College Transfer program, the WSU Extension Program, curricula design, and many other efforts that encouraged the development of the WSU Nursing School and nursing in Eastern Washington. Hilda Roberts also actively participated in numerous local, state, and national nursing organizations that were coming into their own during the postwar period and represent the core of the profession today. These organizations include the American Nurses Association, the National League for Nursing, the Washington State Nurses Association, the Whitman County Nurses Association and the Washington/Alaska Regional Medical Program.</p>

<p>The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of Washington State College (now Washington State University) was established in 1895. It provided the women of the college a place to worship, held bible classes, and located housing and employment. It also served as a social organization that cooperated with the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of Washington State College. A popular social event in the 1910s-1930s was the conferences held at Seabeck, (located on Washington's Hood Canal). Topics at Seabeck focused on issues of the YWCA's and YMCA's of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>During the 1940s, the chapter concentrated on global issues. For example, the YWCA had plans to send care packages overseas although the lack of funds prohibited such action. In the 1950s-1960s, the organization studied politics and world relations, presenting programs on various subjects, including the war in Vietnam and the Democratic system. In 1969, the YWCA adopted the imperative "the elimination of racism." Programs of the 1970s and 1980s offered more projects on cultural awareness in the United States.</p>
<p>Membership grew steadily until 1954, peaking in that year with 711 members. In 1972, the membership had dropped to 219 members. The student body provided sole support for the YWCA until 1917 when the University partially funded the secretary's salary. Other assistance was provided by the Helen A. Fuller Endowment Fund established by Fuller in 1929. As of 2012, the United Way supported over 75% of the YWCA budget.</p>

During the First World War, Rounds was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He was discharged as a 1st Lieutenant in April 1919. Rounds began his career in architecture for the firm of Croft and Hoerner Architects,in Minneapolis. In 1923, Rounds joined the WSC Department of Architectural Engineering in 1923, where he served as an assistant professor of architecture and as an assistant designer in the college architect's office. He also joined with his colleague, Stanley A. Smith, in the architectural firm of Smith and Rounds. The partnership designed many residences in Pullman in the late 1920s, along with several sorority and fraternity houses. By the late 1920s, Rounds left his post at WSC to pursue a full-time private architecture practice in Tacoma and Chehalis.</p>
<p>In 1932 he designed the center unit addition to the Pullman High School. In 1934 he returned to the WSC campus to oversee several college building construction project sponsored by the federal Public Works Administration. From 1937 to 1950, Rounds he served as superintendent of the State College's Department of Buildings and Grounds. He retired from WSC in 1958. Fred G. Rounds was a civic-minded resident of Pullman. He joined the local Kiwanis club, serving on numerous committees. He was elected its president in 1943, and in 1955 served as the Pacific Northwest District Governor. In addition, Rounds was an organizer and long-time member of the Planning Commission and the Whitman County Planning Commission. He served on the Pullman School Board and the Pullman Memorial Hospital Board; and he was director of the Pullman-WSC Civil Defense program and chairman of the Pullman Chamber of Commerce.

<p>The Alternatives for Washington (AFW) program began in 1974 and concluded with a final report in early 1977. AFW involved Washington citizens in community-based social planning; it was funded with grants from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Pacific Northwest Regional Commission in the US Department of Commerce, and administered by the state's Office of Program Planning and Fiscal Management.</p>
<p>Governor Daniel J. Evans launched the AFW program in January 1974 with the mission first to ask Washington citizens what they wanted the state to be like in 1985 and then to involve them in actualizing that vision by identifying the costs and necessary trade-offs. Workshops, seminars, and community meetings across the state inaugurated the program and reached 60,000 citizens in the first year. In 1975 the 150-person statewide AFW task force analyzed and evaluated responses and compiled a report that identified eight public policy areas for Phase Two. Phase Two returned with costs attached to proposals and queried citizens to identify acceptable trade-offs to preserve "our magnificent Northwest life-style" (Alternatives for Washington, Vol. I, Rpt. 1, May 1975). Claiming to have involved 100,000 people over its three years, AFW concluded in January 1977 with the issuance of a final report An Agenda for the Future: A Citizens Report on Alternatives for Washington.</p>
<p>Several departments at Washington State University assisted with conducting meetings, collecting and analyzing responses to opinion polls, and producing media presentations. These included Cooperative Extension, whose relevant records are contained in Archives 225, along with the Department of Rural Sociology (especially faculty members John M. Wardwell and Don A. Dillman), the Social Research Center, and Radio-Television Services. Besides this collection, WSU-held media associated with the project include photographs and a 16-mm film in Archives 225 (see below) and two 3/4-inch videotapes entitled "Alternatives for Washington: A Future Tense" in WSU Libraries Media Materials Services that are an "enhanced" slide show on the background and purpose of AFW with photographs from public meetings. Note that Archives 225 contains slides that may be the originals used in this slide show.</p>
<p>The films in this collection are assumed to be footage shot by WSU Radio-Television Services that was then used to create three AFW-associated films identified in WorldCat as WSU-produced and held only by the Washington State Library: Alternatives for Washington [1974?], Issaquah, a Beginning: Alternatives for Washington [1974?], and The First Year: Alternatives for Washington [1975?].</p>
<p>Alternatives for Washington was a 12-minute introduction to the AFW project; Issaquah, a Beginning: Alternatives for Washington documented 1974's twelve-day citizen panels and public meetings in Issaquah and was released in 27-minute and 20-minute "short" versions; and the 26-minute The First Year: Alternatives for Washington summarized the Phase I results including the areas of concern based on the 1974 citizen surveys and is included in Archives 225.</p>
<p>This collection's films were stored at Teknifilm, Inc. in Portland and sent to WSU Libraries in 2001 after Oregon Historical Society acquired the company's collection. Teknifilm offered complete film processing from 1964 to 1998. WSU Radio-Television Services presumably sent film footage shot for AFW to Teknifilm to be developed and perhaps for post-production work. This collection seems to consist of what remained at Teknifilm: footage used in a WSU-production, but not the final prints.</p>

Germany invaded and occupied Hungary in 1944. Following World War II, Valko was
appointed to lead the Office of Social Administration in Hungary's Ministry of
Social Welfare, but stepped down as Soviet influence spread throughout the country
in late 1945. In 1946, he served as the director for the Central Institute of
Farmers' Co-operatives, and also taught at the University of Szeged. In 1848, after
the Hungarian Communist Party took control of Hungary's co-operatives, Valko and his
wife, Helena, escaped to Switzerland. They immigrated to the United States a year

<p>Rexford F. Daubenmire was born 12 December 1909 in Coldwater, Ohio. He graduated from
Butler University with a bachelor's degree in 1930, the University of Colorado with
a master's degree in 1932, and received a doctorate from the University of Minnesota
in 1935 in botany under William S. Cooper. He subsequently taught at the University
of Tennessee for a year then the University of Idaho for a decade before accepting a
position with Washington State College (later Washington State University) in 1946.
He remained with WSU for 29 years and was professor emeritus of botany after his
retirement in 1975. Daubenmire also held short appointments with several other
universities and agencies, including at the Organization of Tropical Studies in
Costa Rica, the United States Forest Service, and the Sierra Club. Daubenmire was a
member of the Pacific Northwest Science Association, the American Society of Range
Management, and the Association of Southeastern Biologists. In 1967 he served as
president of the Ecological Society of America and received the society's Eminent
Ecologist Award in 1980, among other honors. Upon his retirement in 1975, Daubenmire
moved to Florida with his wife, Jean, where he continued to research and publish
until his death on 27 August 27 1995. </p>
<p>Daubenmire was widely recognized as one of the leading scholars in the field of plant
ecology during his time. In the 1950s, he introduced a classification scheme for
forest and grassland vegetation that the United States Forest Service later adopted.
The Daubenmire system emphasized habitat, rather than what vegetation currently
existed due to fire and human activity, such as ranching and farming, frequently
altering native vegetation. Daubenmire also made significant contributions in
explaining the relationship between vegetation and environmental conditions for a
better understanding of ecological succession, the migration of plant species in
North America over time, the range of tree species, and the impact of fire on plant
communities. </p>
<p>Daubenmire published over 100 works in the field of plant ecology, including three
widely used textbooks: "Plants and Environment: A Textbook of Plant Autecology,"
first published in 1947 and revised twice, served as standard text in agronomy,
botany, and forestry classes and was translated into several languages, including
Polish and Spanish; "Plant Communities: A Textbook of Plant Synecology," published
in 1968, also became standard reference for ecologists; and finally "Plant
Geography: with Special Reference to North America" published in 1978.</p>
<p>Known affectionately as "Dauby" by his former students, Daubenmire supervised over 35
doctoral and 18 master's students in the field of botany during his tenure at WSU,
many of whom later took positions as professors and ecologists within universities
and government organizations around the world. The Department of Botany and the
School of Biological Sciences recognize Daubenmire's contribution to the field and
to WSU with the Rexford Daubenmire Award in Botany. (see PC 122)</p>

<p>A University Architect served as the construction officer at Washington State University from 1911 forward. The modern form of the office dates from 1947 when it became a full-time, staffed administrative department. In 1967 the University Architect office was renamed as Facilities Planning, and then to Facilities Development in 1993. In 2001 it was renamed as Capital Planning. While Capital Planning is responsible for major planning and development, smaller projects are conducted by Facilities Operations. Facilities Operations descended from the Physical Plant in 1998, which in turn descended from Building and Grounds in 1967. While each line of programs has existed separately, some migration in function has occurred over the years. The primary difference between Capital Planning and Facilities Operations is the cost of the project in question - initially items costing less than $1,000,000 were assigned to Fac Ops, and those costing more to CP. By 2009, this break point is between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000.</p>

<p>The Museum of Anthropology, Washington State University, is a federal archaeological
repository and contains both ethnographic and archaeological research collections.</p>
<p>The museum had its beginnings in 1894 when Charles R. Conner, president of the Board
of Regents of what was then Washington State College, acquired 2 "carloads" of
museum specimens while attending the Chicago World's Fair. These items were combined
with other materials on campus to form the core of the Washington State College
Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>During 1949-1950, the Natural History Museum was divided by discipline, and
anthropological specimens were transferred to the Department of Anthropology. Some
of the ethnographic materials were in display cases in Todd Hall on campus from 1951
to 1963, but most were placed in storage in the Todd basement. In 1963, the
displayed materials were also put in storage.</p>
<p>All these materials remained in storage until September 1968, when they were
transferred to the new Museum of Anthropology in the neighboring building, Johnson
Tower. Most historic artifacts held by the anthropology department were transferred
to "well-established historical collections in the Northwest Region" in accordance
with a directive from the university president.</p>
<p>The museum in Johnson Tower was extensively remodeled in 1975. In 1984 the museum
(along with all the branches of the anthropology department) moved to its current
space in College Hall. Currently, the public area of the museum is 2,500 square
feet, with a preparation room and an environmentally controlled storage vault
equipped with a "movable aisle" storage system.</p>

<p>The YWCA of Washington State College was established in 1895. It provided the women of the college a place to worship, held bible classes, locate housing and employment. It also served as a social organization that participated with the YWCA of Washington State College. A popular social event in the 1910's-1930's were the conferences held at Seabeck, (located on Washington's Hood's Canal). Topics at Seabeck focused on issues of the YWCA's and YMCA's of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>During the 1940's the chapter concentrated on global issues, the YWCA had plans to send care packages overseas although the lack of funds prohibited such action. In the 1950's-1960's the organization studied politics and world relations, presenting programs on various subjects, including the war in Vietnam and the Democratic system. In 1969 the YWCA adopted the imperative "the elimination of racism". Programs of the 1970's and the 1980's offered more projects on cultural awareness in the United States.</p>
<p>Membership grew steadily throughout the years, peaking in 1954 with 711 members. In 1972 the membership had dropped to 219 members. The student body provided sole support for the YWCA until 1917 when the University partially funded the secretary's salary. Other assistance was provided by the Helen A. Fuller Endowment Fund established by Fuller in 1929. Presently, the United Way supports over 75% of the YWCA budget.</p>

<p>Carl William Sharsmith was born in New York, New York in 1903. He studied botany at
the University of California in the 1930s and received the Ph.D. in 1940. He held a
position combining duties as herbarium curator and botany instructor at Washington
State University from 1937 to 1939. From 1940 to 1946 he was with the University of
Minnesota, and from 1950 onward at San Jose State College. His principal interest
was in alpine vegetation. </p>
<p>Sharsmith's years at Washington State proved to be a frustrating time. He found
himself required to teach many classes, while also attempting to complete a doctoral
dissertation and administer a herbarium with a large backlog of work. He
inadvertently became involved in a quarrel with the university administration when
the University President cancelled planned field trips. He also felt a sense of
isolation at Pullman, where he was far from the alpine vegetation which held his
major interest. Moreover, the lack of cultural opportunities, especially
performances of serious music, added to this feeling of isolation. After two years
he left this position. Ironically, many of the problems which had vexed him, and
which had also prompted his immediate predecessors to leave Washington State, were
then alleviated by changes in the policies regarding research, teaching, and
administration of the herbarium.</p>

<p>John A. Simms, born ca. 1827, traveled to California in 1850 in the wake of the Gold Rush from his home in Leonardtown, Maryland. Within a year, however, he moved on to Oregon where he lived during most of that decade. In 1858 he moved from The Dalles to Walla Walla in the Territory of Washington. There in partnership with A. H. Reynolds and Captain F. T. Dent (brother of Mrs. U. S. Grant) Simms in 1859 built and operated one of the first flour mills in the region. That same year he was appointed by the Territorial Legislature to be an interim justice of the peace until elections could be held. During the Civil War years it appears Simms made his living by providing flour to settlers and especially to miners on their way into the gold fields at Oro Fino. </p>
<p>Simms was a member of the nine-man Territorial Council (upper house) where he represented Clark, Skamania, Klikitat, Walla Walla, and Spokane counties. He held this position from 1861 to 1862. Evidence from Owen's <title>Journals and Letters</title> tells us that Simms raised cattle and was regarded as a quiet, intelligent, and scrupulously honest man. During this time he had married Lucy McFadden, daughter of O.B. McFadden who had come from Pennsylvania to serve as an appointed judge in both the Oregon and Washington Territories. </p>
<p>Simms left for the east in 1868 in order to secure a federal appointment as Indian Agent in Washington Territory. By the spring of 1869 he was successful in gaining this commission and returned to eastern Washington to take up his duties in the Spokane-Colville region. </p>
<p>A disagreement over policy, in September, 1872, led to the resignation of W. P. Winans and the appointment of Simms as Winans' replacement. Simms' first assignment, the one Winans refused to carry out, was to convince the Spokane tribes that it was in their best interest to relocate to the newly formed Colville Reservation in the northern part of the territory and thus give up the improvements they had made to the land in the Spokane region. It was at this time that Simms assumed the position of principal Indian Agent at the Colville Agency. He held this position until 1883. John A. Simms died in Spokane September 1, 1890. </p>

<p>The ASWSU (Associated Students of Washington State University) Activities Center serves the university by organizing, directing and generally over-seeing many campus-related student group activities. Administering of student organizations includes constant evaluation and advisement. </p><p>The Activities Center was established with approval of the Board of Regents in the Spring of 1947 in answer to student and faculty demands. It began operation during the fall semester of that year. The goal of the Activities Center was to enable a joint student-faculty coordination and participation in student and campus life. The student-faculty cooperative effort was to be augmented by a staff of professionals through whose help the Activities Center was "to bring efficiency and direction by coordinating and guiding existing student organizations, by assisting new groups in developing new programs, an by aiding individual students in planning a balanced program of activities." (As observed in a Review of Student Activities Center Program, April, 1948). </p><p>At the time the Activities Center was organized, most of the social activities and student involvement in campus life were coordinated by living groups. As students' living arrangements gradually became more diffuse, the Activities Center became a more important central focal point coordinating their activities. The Activities Center, therefore, became a place of general guidance, assistance and counseling for student committees and concerns. Furthermore, it became a central repository for committee records where evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluations of past activities could be used for recommendations of procedures for future efforts. In this regard, on an annual basis, evaluative reports are filed with the Activities Center so that evaluations of the programs can be made; these reports are filed by Committee Chairmen, as well as by faculty advisors to individual committees. </p><p>The Activities Center also played a supplemental role in reorganization of the student government. Prior to the formation of the Activities Center, and for some time after it began, the major student government organizational structure was the class governments. However, in time, and especially during the decade of the 1960s, the ASWSU (an organization of all students) superseded the class government system, and the class governments were discontinued in 1968. For the Activities Center this has meant that the role of the students, in directing and actually involving themselves in the workings of the Activities Center, has increased. What was once a joint student-faculty arrangement, in conjunction with professional administrators, has become more of a joint effort between students and professionals.</p>

<p>Radio services at Washington State University date to 1922, when station KFAE began
in December, 1922; that subsequently became KWSC and then KWSU in 1969 (after
Washington State College had become Washington State University ten years earlier in
1959). In about 1950, it instituted a "tape network," locally produced programs
which were distributed on recording tape to commercial and non-commercial
broadcasters in the state. When the National Public Radio network began in 1971,
KWSU was one of the initial members. Through the 1980s, translator stations were
established throughout parts of the Washington, and in adjacent Idaho and Oregon,
and a network of stations based out of WSU and soon including Tri-Cities (KFAE),
University of Idaho (KUID) and others began to form. This network of stations took
the name Northwest Public Radio. Programming for these radio stations has long been
a mix of local programming and programming acquired from the various public
broadcasting networks and program distribution services.</p>

<p>The Washington State University Agriculture Research Center (ARC) is a part of WSU’s College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences (CAHNRS). The ARC began in 1892 as the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station, then an element of the Washington Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science, now Washington State University. Located near Pullman on a farm donated to the state, the station became the site of agricultural instruction and experimental work conducted by the staff of the station and the faculty of the College of Agriculture. It soon extended to branch stations across the state. In 1946 it became part of the Institute of Agricultural Sciences, and in 1965 it was integrated into the newly-organized Agricultural Research Center (ARC) of the College of Agriculture. </p><p>Washington State’s commodity commissions are “industry-funded state agencies that promote and fund crop research and/or the marketing of crops.” The commissions are considered governmental agencies as they are state-mandated, but they are governed and funded by growers under the supervision of the state Director of Agriculture.

<p>William Band was born in Liscard, Cheshire, England, on August 27, 1906, one of two sons born to William D. Band and Amy L. Cooke. He attended Liscard High School, where he excelled in Mathematics, and graduated in 1922 after satisfying the exams for the Higher School Certificate. At the University of Liverpool, which he entered in the fall of 1923, he concentrated in the study of physics and graduated with honors in 1926, winning the Oliver J. Lodge Prize. He became a candidate for the MsSc degree and graduated in 1927.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Band served in China at Yenching University, a position he favored over study for a PhD at Cambridge. While on a short trip back to England in 1931, he married Claire May Edwards, whom he had met while teaching Sunday School at Liverpool. They arrived at Yenching on August 31, 1931, shortly before the Japanese invaded Manchuria on September 18. He was Chairman of the Physics department at Yenching until 1944, where, besides teaching quantum mechanics and relativity, he developed a research program for the MS degree.</p>
<p>Yenching University was founded in 1916 by John Leighton Stuart as a missionary institution in the continued effort to spread Christianity through education in China, under auspices of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States and the Division of Foreign Missions of the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church of the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Band's service at Yenching was interrupted as a result of the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. Band and his wife were evacuated by the Chinese Communists with whom they spent over two years on a thousand mile journey to freedom until they reached Chunking in 1944. A book, <title>Dragon Fangs</title>, based on their diaries of wartime experiences in China, was published in 1947. It was published later in the United States under the title <title>Two Years with the Chinese Communists</title>.</p>
<p>Back in England on furlough, William Band was awarded his PhD by the University of Liverpool as a result of his research in physics. In 1946 he was granted a fellowship at the Institute for the Study of Metals of the University of Chicago where he stayed until 1949. In 1949 he moved to Washington State College as Professor of Physics. During each summer between 1955 and 1966 he worked as Senior Physicist at the Poulter Laboratories of the Stanford Research Institute, on the theory of shock propagation in solids. He was appointed Chairman of the Department of Physics at Washington State in 1960, and served in this position in 1968, continuing his research activities until well after his retirement in 1971, and publishing extensively in all the major professional journals. In 1972 he was honored by colleagues from all over the world for his Physical Cluster Theory. He also published an introduction to mathematical physics and an introduction to quantum statistics. He was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and Physical Society, London, and Fellow of the American Physical Society. William Band died in 1993.</p>
