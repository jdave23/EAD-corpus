			<p>The Washington State University Faculty Executive Committee (FEC), under the name
				Executive Committee of the Faculty of the State College of Washington, was first
				organized in January 1934. From this beginning two long-standing concerns of the
				committee were evident: academic tenure and faculty salaries. Other matters of
				concern to the faculty were also quickly brought before the committee. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Because of what were termed "practical difficulties" encountered by the committee, it
				nearly ceased operations during 1936 and 1937. In late 1937 the committee proposed
				its own dissolution and the establishment of a Faculty Advisory Committee. By vote
				of the faculty this was done and the Faculty Advisory Committee was established in
				October, 1937. The change in name was meant to be a change in function. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In 1945, as a result of the reorganizations proposed by the Committee of Forty, the
				Faculty Executive Committee was re-established and took over the functions of the
				Faculty Advisory Committee. Recent accounts of the history of the committee refer to
				the 1945 body as the "first" establishment of the committee. In each case the
				records of the preceding body were transferred to its successor. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>In the fall of 1971, with the establishment of the University Senate and the
				subsequent reorganization of the committee structure, the FEC was again dissolved.
				Its functions were divided between the Faculty Affairs Committee of the University
				Senate (which did not begin operations until the following spring) and the
				faculty-elected Faculty Status Committee. This split assigned personnel arbitration,
				a major function of the FEC, to the Faculty Status Committee. Other matters,
				formerly the responsibility of the FEC, were turned over to the Senate's Faculty
				Affairs Committee. These included policy recommendations on appointments, promotion,
				tenure, leave of absence, standards of performance, professional ethics, faculty
				rights and responsibilities, academic freedom and faculty compensation. All of these
				were given on-going consideration as revisions were proposed to the Faculty Manual.
				Between the demise of the FEC and the establishment of the Faculty Affairs Committee
				these matters were also handled by the Faculty Status Committee.</p>
