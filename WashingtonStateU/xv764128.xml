      <bioghist encodinganalog="545">
    
<p>Edward Bennett (1927-2013) was born in Dixon, Illinois, to John Francis and Marguerite Marion Moore Bennett. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Butler University in 1952, and received both his Masters and Doctorate in History from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1956 and 1961 respectively. Dr. Bennett came to Washington State University as a Professor of History in 1961 after briefly serving as an instructor at Texas A&amp;M. During his time at WSU, he served as chair of the Norman and Laura Graebner Prize committee for the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations, held a position on the executive council of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Society, and received the WSU Faculty of the Year Award in 1979. Between 1967 and 1970, he also served as President of the Faculty Representatives for the Pacific-8 Athletic Conference (today the PAC-12), and was appointed to the Theodore Roosevelt Awards Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Dr. Bennett was one of ten American scholars selected by the American Historical Association and the American Council of Learned Societies to work with scholars from the U.S.S.R. in an cooperative examination of the two nations' relations in 1985. Dr. Bennett authored and co-authored eight books on American diplomatic history, and following his retirement in 1994, created the Edward and Margery Bennett Scholarship for graduate students studying diplomatic history in the Department of History at WSU. </p>  </bioghist>
