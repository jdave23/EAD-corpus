			<p>Rexford F. Daubenmire was born 12 December 1909 in Coldwater, Ohio. He graduated from
				Butler University with a bachelor's degree in 1930, the University of Colorado with
				a master's degree in 1932, and received a doctorate from the University of Minnesota
				in 1935 in botany under William S. Cooper. He subsequently taught at the University
				of Tennessee for a year then the University of Idaho for a decade before accepting a
				position with Washington State College (later Washington State University) in 1946.
				He remained with WSU for 29 years and was professor emeritus of botany after his
				retirement in 1975. Daubenmire also held short appointments with several other
				universities and agencies, including at the Organization of Tropical Studies in
				Costa Rica, the United States Forest Service, and the Sierra Club. Daubenmire was a
				member of the Pacific Northwest Science Association, the American Society of Range
				Management, and the Association of Southeastern Biologists. In 1967 he served as
				president of the Ecological Society of America and received the society's Eminent
				Ecologist Award in 1980, among other honors. Upon his retirement in 1975, Daubenmire
				moved to Florida with his wife, Jean, where he continued to research and publish
				until his death on 27 August 27 1995. </p>
			<p>Daubenmire was widely recognized as one of the leading scholars in the field of plant
				ecology during his time. In the 1950s, he introduced a classification scheme for
				forest and grassland vegetation that the United States Forest Service later adopted.
				The Daubenmire system emphasized habitat, rather than what vegetation currently
				existed due to fire and human activity, such as ranching and farming, frequently
				altering native vegetation. Daubenmire also made significant contributions in
				explaining the relationship between vegetation and environmental conditions for a
				better understanding of ecological succession, the migration of plant species in
				North America over time, the range of tree species, and the impact of fire on plant
				communities. </p>
			<p>Daubenmire published over 100 works in the field of plant ecology, including three
				widely used textbooks: "Plants and Environment: A Textbook of Plant Autecology,"
				first published in 1947 and revised twice, served as standard text in agronomy,
				botany, and forestry classes and was translated into several languages, including
				Polish and Spanish; "Plant Communities: A Textbook of Plant Synecology," published
				in 1968, also became standard reference for ecologists; and finally "Plant
				Geography: with Special Reference to North America" published in 1978.</p>
			<p>Known affectionately as "Dauby" by his former students, Daubenmire supervised over 35
				doctoral and 18 master's students in the field of botany during his tenure at WSU,
				many of whom later took positions as professors and ecologists within universities
				and government organizations around the world. The Department of Botany and the
				School of Biological Sciences recognize Daubenmire's contribution to the field and
				to WSU with the Rexford Daubenmire Award in Botany. (see PC 122)</p>

			<p>Most of the materials in this collection are Daubenmire's publications, many of which
				are numbered and total over a hundred. The collection also contains research
				materials pertaining to ecology and botany, mainly in the Pacific Northwest, but
				also addresses topics in Costa Rica, and includes notes, charts and graphs,
				articles, journals, as well as teaching materials. Additionally, the collection
				includes incoming correspondence, Daubenmire's curriculum vitae, a scrapbook from
				his graduate students, passports, photographs, conference programs and event
				pamphlets, a bound copy of his report "Vegetation of Eastern Washington and Northern
				Idaho" for the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station, and awards from the
				Society of American Foresters, Northwest Scientific Association, Ecological Society
				of America, Society for Range Management, Sociological Society of America, and the
				Nature Conservancy.</p>
