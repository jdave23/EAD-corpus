  		<p>Washington State University as an institution dates to 1890, when it was authorized by the newly-formed State of Washington. WSU's history is documented in numerous pieces of film and video, the oldest known being film footage of the Jan. 1 1916 "Rose Bowl" football game played in Pasadena, California.</p>

	 	<p>The collection comprises audio and video produced by, for, or about Washington State University, dating from 1930 up to 2005. However, the majority of the media is from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Included in the collection are news stories, promotional videos, recordings of significant performances, events, and speakers, and unfinished stock footage used in creating these and other productions. Video found here was created by numerous sources, notably WSU's various news services and its campus television and radio stations. Many of the items were created by non-WSU organizations, either in the form of news (or other) stories about the school, or in the form of promotional or other materials contracted to other institutions by campus departments.</p> 
	 	<p>It is important to be aware that much of the description of this collection comes from the labels on the media or the containers they came in; it was not possible to view all the materials to determine accuracy of the labeling. As a result, users may discover upon viewing these items that their contents do not match their labels, and a few items have been discarded since this collection was created after we discovered the actual contents were not related to Washington State University. In some cases duplicate copies of materials are retained; this is primarily due to the significance of the material in question and the ongoing deterioration of electronic media, as well as due to the fact that uncertain labeling means items may not match their description, and that similarly (but not identically) named items may not actually be the same thing.</p> 
	 	<p>The majority of the collection is video recordings, primarily VHS tapes and U-matic 3/4" tapes. Other videotape formats include S-VHS, M II, Betacam, BetacamSP, and one open reel 1" Type C. Other non-tape video include digital media on DVD, CD, and MiniDV; and film in 16mm and Super 16mm.

	 <arrangement encodinganalog="351" id="a4"> 
	 	<p>The collection is arranged in seven primary series, plus two significant subseries. Due to the disparate sizes of the different forms of media, organization within each series is frequently by media type. Within each media type, organization is primarily chronological, with undated materials ordered alphabetically at the end.</p> 
	 	<p>The description of each item includes what information we have on it, followed by the format of the item, followed by length of the recording (or the tape) if known.</p> 
	 	<p>The seven series are: </p> 
	 	<p>Series 1, Speakers and Presentations: Audio/video of presentations which occurred at or are associated with Washington State University. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 2, Recruitment and Promotional Material: Audio/video created for the express purpose or recruiting students and/or faculty to come to WSU, or to promote WSU to students, alumni, or the world in general. Though not labeled as its own subseries, the final box in this series contains the longer and more significant films. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 3, Campus Stock Footage / B-Roll: This is primarily non-completed material; original footage taken for use in creating other works. There are two subseries within this series. Subseries 3.1 contains materials collected by Andrews Greenspan and Associates in 1994, and Subseries 3.2 contains what appears to be footage of archival materials, probably filmed in WSU's Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections or similar facilities. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 4, Libraries: Footage from the construction of the Holland and Terrell Libraries, or presentations and materials related to the Libraries. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 5, Performing Arts and Fine Arts: Musical or artistic performances and shows preformed at/by or relating to Washington State University. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 6, WSU-Produced News Stores and Other Materials: Audio/Video news stories produced and aired by the various WSU media outlets, as well as other materials produced by campus organizations. </p> 
	 	<p>Series 7, News Footage and Produced Programs from Non-Campus Sources: News stories produced and aired by regional news media not affiliated with WSU, but relating to the school. Also included are a small number of non-news productions which are assumed to have WSU ties. </p> 
	 	<p>As noted above, description (and thus organization) was based upon labels, not upon viewing. As dates or further information about items is uncovered that will be edited into the description below, which may result in oddities, such as dated items appearing in the sequences of undated materials.</p>

	 	<p>The materials in this collection came from a number of disparate accessions which had been transferred to Washington State University Libraries' Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections (MASC) over a period of years. Collections which were part of the original organizing process include: UA1985-54, UA1989-18, UA1995-01, UA2001-10, UA2002-05, UA2003-02, UA 2004-12, UA2005-09, UA2005-15, UA2006-07, UA2006-11, UA2006-13, UA2007-02, UA2008-15, and UPC-0007. The majority of those collections come from WSU News Services, the Office of the President, University Relations, the Instructional Media Center, and WSU Events.</p>

	 <processinfo encodinganalog="583" id="a20"> 
	 	<p>Processing of this collection was begun in 2010 by Scott Stratton, continued in 2011-2012 by Susan Vetter, and completed in December 2014 by University Archivist Mark O'English.</p>
	 </processinfo> 
	 <relatedmaterial encodinganalog="5441_" id="a6"> 
	 	<p>Several other MASC collections were processed (at least partially) out of the same accessions as these materials. These include:</p>
	 	<p>Archives 320. "WSU Presents" Recordings, 1992-2004.</p>
	 	<p>Archives 325. “The Great Russian” Production Films, 1960.</p>

	 	<p>SC 013. Eastern Washington Historical Media Collection, 1928-1987.</p>
