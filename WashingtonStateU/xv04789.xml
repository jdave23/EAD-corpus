      <p>Rupert Croft-Cooke was born June 30, 1903 in Edenbridge, Kent, and was
		  educated at Tonbridge School and Wellington College. He began teaching when he
		  was seventeen. He went to Paris that year as a private tutor, then spent two
		  years in Buenos Aires, where besides teaching English he founded and edited the
		  journal 
		<title>La Estrella</title>. In 1925 he returned to London and pursued a
		career as a free-lance journalist and writer. Soon after, he opened a bookshop
		in Rochester, Kent, and took up the antiquarian book trade. At the same time he
		also entered the field of broadcasting, giving a series of radio talks on
		psychology. In 1930 he went abroad again, spending a year in Germany, writing,
		and later lecturing in English in Switzerland and Spain. He joined the British
		Army in 1940 and saw service in Africa and India. After his discharge in 1946
		he returned to writing and produced several works reflecting his military
		experience. He became the book critic for 
		<title>The Sketch</title> in 1947, a position he held until 1953. He died
		June 10, 1979.</p>
      <p>One of the most prolific writers for the British mass market in the
		  20th century, Croft-Cooke produced countless magazine and journal articles and
		  more than 125 books--everything from co-books to political commentary, from
		  books about circuses to steamy romances. His greatest success, however, came in
		  the genre of detective fiction; he published nearly thirty detective novels,
		  mysteries and thrillers.</p>
      <p>His first book, 
		<title>Songs of a Sussex Tramp</title>, a collection of poetry, was
		published in 1922, when he was nineteen. When, shortly after the appearance of
		his Songs, another of his works precipitated a suit for slander, his publisher,
		in order to recoup losses he had suffered, forced Croft-Cooke to produce ten
		books without renumeration. After a self-imposed two year-long exile in
		Argentina, he returned to England in 1925. He continued to write and his work
		appeared in the literary magazines New Writing, Adelphi, Chapbook, The New
		Coterie and English Review. In the late 1920s several of his pieces were
		published in the American magazine, Poetry.</p>
      <p>With the coming of the Great Depression in the 1930s, however,
		  Croft-Cooke rejected the "cult of poetry and literature" and embraced the "cult
		  of experience." Characterizing himself as a "writer for the middle class," he
		  produced numerous works in diverse genres for the mass market. In addition to
		  more than twenty volumes of autobiographical writing and several romantic
		  novels, he also wrote books on travel, food and wine, circus life and gypsies.
		  He explored the politics of the Hitler era, creating a near best-seller in 
		<title>The Man in Europe</title>, as well as 
		<title>Rule Britannia</title>, and 
		<title>The Last Days of Madrid</title>. Croft-Cooke's greatest popularity
		with both British and American readers was based on his detective fiction and
		thrillers. Using the pseudonym Leo Bruce, he wrote two series of detective
		novels. The first, begun in 1936, was based on the adventures of Sergeant Beef,
		a bumbling village policeman. His second sleuth was introduced in 1952. This
		new hero, Carolus Deane, a witty and urbane gentleman, was the antithesis of
		Sergeant Beef. Both series of novels created Croft-Cooke's greatest literary
		success.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351">
      <p>The papers of Rupert Croft-Cooke consist of two series, Correspondence
		  and Writings. The Correspondence series consists of personal letters written by
		  Croft-Cooke. The letters are arranged alphabetically by recipient and
		  chronologically within the subseries. The bulk of the letters are written to
		  Joseph Susei Mari, Croft-Cooke's secretary and companion of more than twenty
		  years.</p>
      <p>The Writings series, most of which is undated, is organized into
		  Poetry and Prose. The Poetry subseries is organized into two major works--" 
		<title>More Tales of a Wicked Uncle</title>" and " 
		<title>Uncle Nick</title>"--followed by Titled Poems and Untitled Poems.
		The material in Titled Poems is arranged alphabetically by title of the piece.
		In a few instances, two or more titled pieces have been written on one sheet of
		paper. These pages have been filed after the titled pieces and arranged
		alphabetically by the title of the first poem on the page. Material in Untitled
		Poems is arranged alphabetically by the first or key word in the first line of
		the poem.</p>
      <p>The Prose subseries consists of Book Reviews; Book Schemes; Books,
		  Short Stories and Essays; Plays; and Miscellany. The material in these groups
		  is arranged alphabetically by title of the work. The Book Reviews are arranged
		  alphabetically by the last name of the author whose work is reviewed rather
		  than by the title of the review. The Miscellany series consists of short
		  reviews of Croft-Cooke's novels which were published in the 1970s, and portions
		  of untitled essays. This material is arranged chronologically. Most of the
		  titled pieces in the Prose subseries include a holograph and a typescript copy
		  of the work. Notable in this section are six holograph chapters and fourteen
		  typescript chapters of Croft-Cooke's novel 
		<title>Conduct Unbecoming</title> (1975).</p>
