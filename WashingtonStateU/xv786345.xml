         <p>The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of Washington State College (now Washington State University) was established in 1895. It provided the women of the college a place to worship, held bible classes, and located housing and employment. It also served as a social organization that cooperated with the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of Washington State College. A popular social event in the 1910s-1930s was the conferences held at Seabeck, (located on Washington's Hood Canal). Topics at Seabeck focused on issues of the YWCA's and YMCA's of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
         <p>During the 1940s, the chapter concentrated on global issues. For example, the YWCA had plans to send care packages overseas although the lack of funds prohibited such action. In the 1950s-1960s, the organization studied politics and world relations, presenting programs on various subjects, including the war in Vietnam and the Democratic system. In 1969, the YWCA adopted the imperative "the elimination of racism." Programs of the 1970s and 1980s offered more projects on cultural awareness in the United States.</p>
         <p>Membership grew steadily until 1954, peaking in that year with 711 members. In 1972, the membership had dropped to 219 members. The student body provided sole support for the YWCA until 1917 when the University partially funded the secretary's salary. Other assistance was provided by the Helen A. Fuller Endowment Fund established by Fuller in 1929. As of 2012, the United Way supported over 75% of the YWCA budget.</p>
