  		<p>Joanne Washburn (b. 1937) received a Bachelor of Science in 1959 from the University of
  			Connecticut, followed by a Master of Science from Washington State University in 1963. Both
  			degrees were in Physical Education. She worked at Washington State University for 38 years.
  			She began her career at WSU in 1966 as an instructor in the Physical Education (PE)
  			department. She was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1970, and later to Associate
  			Professor. She served as Assistant Women's Athletic Director and Director of Women's
  			Athletics. She was a faculty member at WSU when Title IX was passed in 1972, and in 1979 she
  			was one of 13 coaches who, along with 39 student athletes, filed a lawsuit against WSU for
  			failing to comply with Title IX (Blair v. Washington State University). She retired in
  			2004.</p>
