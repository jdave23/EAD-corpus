      <p>Francis E. Warren, a Massachusetts native, emigrated to Wyoming in 1868. He began work in
        the mercantile business, soon becoming a partner and then owner of several businesses and
        ranching properties. While increasing his business holdings, Warren became involved in
        politics and government. He was a governor of the Wyoming Territory and the first governor
        of the state of Wyoming. He stepped down as governor after being elected one of Wyoming's
        first United States senators. Warren was a leader in Wyoming politics and business and in
        the U.S. Senate until his death in 1929.</p>
      <p>Francis Emroy Warren was born in Hinsdale, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, on June 20,
        1844. He attended public schools and Hinsdale Academy. At the outbreak of the Civil War he
        enlisted in Company C, Forty-ninth Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and served as
        a private and non-commissioned officer. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor "for
        gallantry on the battlefield at the siege of Port Hudson".</p>
      <p>In 1868 Warren emigrated to Wyoming, which was then a part of the Dakota Territory, where
        he worked in a furniture store for another Massachusetts native, A. R. Converse. By 1871 he
        became a partner, with the firm's name changing to Converse and Warren. In 1877 he bought
        Converse out and changed the company's name to F. E. Warren and Company, later Warren
        Mercantile Company.</p>
      <p>In 1883 Warren formed the Warren Live Stock Company which grew to be one of the most
        important ranching operations in the state, encompassing some 150,000 deeded acres. Warren
        owned several parcels of real estate in Wyoming and a number of other companies including
        the Cheyenne and Northern Railroad and the Brush-Swan Electric Company, which provided the
        first electric power to Cheyenne.</p>
      <p>In addition to his business interests, Warren was active in politics. He was a member of
        the Cheyenne City Council from 1873 to 1874 and was instrumental in securing the first
        lighting system for Cheyenne. In 1873 he was elected to the Council of the Territorial
        Assembly, where he served from 1873 to 1874 and from 1884 to 1885. He was council president
        during his first term.</p>
      <p>Warren served as territorial treasurer in 1876, 1879, 1882, and 1884, and as chairman of
        the Republican Territorial Central Committee. He was elected mayor of Cheyenne in 1885 and
        was appointed territorial governor of Wyoming by President Chester A. Arthur to fill the
        unexpired term of William Hale. He took the oath of office February 28, 1885.</p>
      <p>During his tenure Warren called for federal troops to protect Chinese workers during the
        riots in Rock Springs, Wyoming, on September 2, 1885. He also instituted a quarantine on
        cattle from all states and territories in which a pleuro-pneumonia was thought to have
        existed. He served as governor until November 11, 1886, when he was removed from office by
        President Grover Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Warren was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. He was
        appointed territorial governor for a second time by President Benjamin Harrison, taking the
        oath of office April 9, 1889, and serving until October 11, 1890, when he was elected the
        first governor of the State of Wyoming. He took office on October 11, 1890, and resigned
        November 24, 1890, after having been elected by the State Legislature as one of the first
        two U.S. Senators from Wyoming. He served until 1893 and was reelected in 1895 and served
        until his death in 1929.</p>
      <p>From his first term in the Senate, Warren was one of its leaders. Between 1891 and 1893 and
        1895 and 1899 he served as chair of the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Public
        Lands. He worked closely with Wyoming's other senator, Joseph M. Carey, in supporting the
        Carey Act for the reclamation of public land. Following the passage of this act, Wyoming was
        the first state to begin the reclamation of arid land. In 1896 Warren offered an amendment
        to the rivers and harbors bill which provided funding for a survey of rivers in Wyoming and
        Colorado to determine reservoir sites. Along with Carey, Warren was known as a founding
        father of irrigation in the West.</p>
      <p>Warren served as chair of the Military Affairs Committee from 1905 to 1911. During that
        period he worked with Secretary of War Elihu Root to reorganize the army, raise military
        pay, and establish a General Staff. As the ranking minority member prior to World War I, he
        supported the national defense and the selective service acts.</p>
      <p>From 1921 until 1929, Senator Warren was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of
        the most important Senate committees. Here he supported reduced government expenditures and
        stiffer tariffs, especially those which protected the farm and livestock industries.</p>
      <p>At his death on November 24, 1929, in Washington, D.C., Warren had served as Senator for
        thirty-seven years, the longest service record in the United States Senate to that time.</p>
      <p>Francis E. Warren married Helen M. Smith on January 26, 1871, and before her death in 1902
        they had two children, Helen Frances (Frankie) and Frederick Emroy. Senator Warren was
        remarried on June 28, 1911, to Clara LeBaron Morgan.</p>
      <p>Helen married General John J. Pershing. Fred E. Warren became vice-president of Warren Live
        Stock Company in 1913 and replaced his father as president upon his death in 1929. He
        retained this position until his own death in 1949. Fred Warren was followed by his son
        Francis Emroy.</p>
      <p>To maintain control of his many business interests while away from home, Warren relied
        heavily on two men. W.W. Gleason was general manager of Warren Live Stock and ran the
        operation while Warren was in Washington, D.C. Hiram Sapp was Warren's executive secretary
        and served as liaison between Warren and his companies and acted as a troubleshooter while
        Warren attended the Senate.</p>

      <p>The bulk of the F.E. Warren Collection was given to the American Heritage Center in two
        groups, the first in 1940 and the second in 1944. Small additions have been made since that
        time, and preliminary processing was done.</p>
      <p>In 1992 the collection was reprocessed by a team of student interns. Material has been
        organized in groups and series according to original indications wherever possible. Two
        cubic feet of bills and receipts and one cubic foot of printed material have been separated.
        The material has been microfilmed for preservation.</p>
      <p>In October 1995, a second addendum of materials were donated to the American Heritage
        Center by Mrs. Paul Smith and Evelyna Smith Herman. This material has been arranged
        alphabetically. This material has not been microfilmed.</p>
      <p>More material for this collection was received from Janet Reed Dodson in July 2020.</p>
