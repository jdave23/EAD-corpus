  <bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
  	<head>Biography of Duncan Renaldo</head><p>Renaldo (1904-1980) was an actor noted for his most popular role as the "Cisco Kid," whom he played in twelve films and in 156 television episodes. He was orphaned at an early age and raised by relatives in Europe. Renaldo began his acting career in the United States in the 1920s on stage and in silent movies. Because of Renaldo's own uncertainty surrounding the facts of his birth and nationality, he became involved in a trial in 1931 relating to his legal status and citizenship. He was later charged with making false statements on his passport and served eighteen months in prison. Renaldo was formally pardoned by President Roosevelt and released in 1936.</p>
  	<p>Renaldo managed to regain status as an actor and was cast in several films including "For Whom the Bell Tolls" in 1941. In 1946 he was offered the film role of the "Cisco Kid" and went on to play the role on radio and television.</p>
