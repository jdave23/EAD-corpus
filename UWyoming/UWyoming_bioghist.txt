<p>Francis E. Warren, a Massachusetts native, emigrated to Wyoming in 1868. He began work in
the mercantile business, soon becoming a partner and then owner of several businesses and
ranching properties. While increasing his business holdings, Warren became involved in
politics and government. He was a governor of the Wyoming Territory and the first governor
of the state of Wyoming. He stepped down as governor after being elected one of Wyoming's
first United States senators. Warren was a leader in Wyoming politics and business and in
the U.S. Senate until his death in 1929.</p>
<p>Francis Emroy Warren was born in Hinsdale, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, on June 20,
1844. He attended public schools and Hinsdale Academy. At the outbreak of the Civil War he
enlisted in Company C, Forty-ninth Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and served as
a private and non-commissioned officer. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor "for
gallantry on the battlefield at the siege of Port Hudson".</p>
<p>In 1868 Warren emigrated to Wyoming, which was then a part of the Dakota Territory, where
he worked in a furniture store for another Massachusetts native, A. R. Converse. By 1871 he
became a partner, with the firm's name changing to Converse and Warren. In 1877 he bought
Converse out and changed the company's name to F. E. Warren and Company, later Warren
Mercantile Company.</p>
<p>In 1883 Warren formed the Warren Live Stock Company which grew to be one of the most
important ranching operations in the state, encompassing some 150,000 deeded acres. Warren
owned several parcels of real estate in Wyoming and a number of other companies including
the Cheyenne and Northern Railroad and the Brush-Swan Electric Company, which provided the
first electric power to Cheyenne.</p>
<p>In addition to his business interests, Warren was active in politics. He was a member of
the Cheyenne City Council from 1873 to 1874 and was instrumental in securing the first
lighting system for Cheyenne. In 1873 he was elected to the Council of the Territorial
Assembly, where he served from 1873 to 1874 and from 1884 to 1885. He was council president
during his first term.</p>
<p>Warren served as territorial treasurer in 1876, 1879, 1882, and 1884, and as chairman of
the Republican Territorial Central Committee. He was elected mayor of Cheyenne in 1885 and
was appointed territorial governor of Wyoming by President Chester A. Arthur to fill the
unexpired term of William Hale. He took the oath of office February 28, 1885.</p>
<p>During his tenure Warren called for federal troops to protect Chinese workers during the
riots in Rock Springs, Wyoming, on September 2, 1885. He also instituted a quarantine on
cattle from all states and territories in which a pleuro-pneumonia was thought to have
existed. He served as governor until November 11, 1886, when he was removed from office by
President Grover Cleveland.</p>
<p>Warren was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at Chicago in 1888. He was
appointed territorial governor for a second time by President Benjamin Harrison, taking the
oath of office April 9, 1889, and serving until October 11, 1890, when he was elected the
first governor of the State of Wyoming. He took office on October 11, 1890, and resigned
November 24, 1890, after having been elected by the State Legislature as one of the first
two U.S. Senators from Wyoming. He served until 1893 and was reelected in 1895 and served
until his death in 1929.</p>
<p>From his first term in the Senate, Warren was one of its leaders. Between 1891 and 1893 and
1895 and 1899 he served as chair of the Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation of Public
Lands. He worked closely with Wyoming's other senator, Joseph M. Carey, in supporting the
Carey Act for the reclamation of public land. Following the passage of this act, Wyoming was
the first state to begin the reclamation of arid land. In 1896 Warren offered an amendment
to the rivers and harbors bill which provided funding for a survey of rivers in Wyoming and
Colorado to determine reservoir sites. Along with Carey, Warren was known as a founding
father of irrigation in the West.</p>
<p>Warren served as chair of the Military Affairs Committee from 1905 to 1911. During that
period he worked with Secretary of War Elihu Root to reorganize the army, raise military
pay, and establish a General Staff. As the ranking minority member prior to World War I, he
supported the national defense and the selective service acts.</p>
<p>From 1921 until 1929, Senator Warren was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of
the most important Senate committees. Here he supported reduced government expenditures and
stiffer tariffs, especially those which protected the farm and livestock industries.</p>
<p>At his death on November 24, 1929, in Washington, D.C., Warren had served as Senator for
thirty-seven years, the longest service record in the United States Senate to that time.</p>
<p>Francis E. Warren married Helen M. Smith on January 26, 1871, and before her death in 1902
they had two children, Helen Frances (Frankie) and Frederick Emroy. Senator Warren was
remarried on June 28, 1911, to Clara LeBaron Morgan.</p>
<p>Helen married General John J. Pershing. Fred E. Warren became vice-president of Warren Live
Stock Company in 1913 and replaced his father as president upon his death in 1929. He
retained this position until his own death in 1949. Fred Warren was followed by his son
Francis Emroy.</p>
<p>To maintain control of his many business interests while away from home, Warren relied
heavily on two men. W.W. Gleason was general manager of Warren Live Stock and ran the
operation while Warren was in Washington, D.C. Hiram Sapp was Warren's executive secretary
and served as liaison between Warren and his companies and acted as a troubleshooter while
Warren attended the Senate.</p>

<head>Biography</head><p>Garrett W. Price was born in Bucyrus, Kansas in 1895. Garrett's father was a doctor and his practice took the family to several Western states, finally settling in Saratoga, Wyoming. Early on, Garrett showed an aptitude for drawing. His first cartoon was published by the "Saratoga Sun" in 1912. He entered the University of Wyoming in 1912 where he studied for two years before entering the Chicago Institute of Art. After graduating from there he was hired by the Art Department of the "Chicago Tribune" where he worked from 1916 to 1925. He illustrated stories for the Sunday Magazine, made two cartoons daily for the sports column, made one illustration a day for a serial, and laid out the roto section. Garrett also contributed some poetry to the "Tribune", but never under his own name. During World War I, he also found time to be the editorial cartoonist for the "Great Lakes Navy Bulletin". He then decided to move to New York to work as a freelance artist. He had much success furnishing cartoons, illustrations, and cover art for the the fledgling magazines "Life" and "The New Yorker". He also contributed to "Look", "Colliers", "Harper's Bazaar", "Saturday Evening Post", "Good Housekeeping", "Promenade", "Esquire", and others, but his most important work was with the "New Yorker", which put him under contract. He worked with "The New Yorker" for more than forty years giving them nearly 100 covers and several hundred cartoons. While living in New York he met Florence Semler. They were married in 1928 and continued to live in New York until they moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they spent the remainder of their days. When "Look" and "Colliers", two of Garrett's mainstays, shut down, Garrett began to submit more of his work to "Saturday Evening Post" and "Sports Illustrated". He also found time to illustrate several children's books and do a weekly cartoon for the Westport "Town Crier" called "Price Tags". Garrett spent the last few years of his life painting watercolors and relaxing in his Connecticut home. He died in 1979. </p>

<p>Between 1906 and 1953, the market for horses declined and sheep and swine growers gradually drifted away to form their own national organizations, leaving behind a membership consisting primarily of cattlemen and cattlemen’s associations. In recognition of this, the American National Live Stock Association changed its name to the American National Cattlemen’s Association (ANCA) in 1953.</p>
<p>In 1977, ANCA merged with the National Livestock Feeders Association, and changed its name to the National Cattlemen’s Association (NCA). By this time, the NCA represented a membership from all facets of the cattle industry. In 1996, NCA merged with the National Beef Council to form the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA).</p>
