  	<head>History of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey</head><p>Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was an oil company and holding company during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was originally formed in 1882 as a refining and marketing arm of the Standard Oil Trust.  When the Standard Oil Trust was broken up under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act in 1892, the trust was reorganized as Standard Oil Interests.  Taking advantage of New Jersey laws that allowed corporations to own stock in other corporations, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey became a holding company that effectively replaced the Standard Oil Trust.  In this capacity, it provided administrative coordination to Standard Oil Interests and held stock in forty-one other oil companies.  In 1911, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was split off from its subsidiaries by order of the U.S. Supreme Court under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.  Between 1911 and 1973, the company operated as an international oil company in its own right, producing and marketing petroleum products under a number of brands, including Esso, Enco, and Humble.  It also controlled a number of other oil companies, including Humble Oil and Refining Company, Carter Oil Company, Imperial Oil Limited, and Standard of Louisiana.  In 1973, Standard Oil of New Jersey changed its corporate name to Exxon to provide uniform branding of its products.</p>
