<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>George Fox College (GFC), Newberg, Oregon, was originally established in 1891 as Pacific College. Public and press confusion with other colleges prompted the name change in 1949. George Fox College was chosen to reflect historic and religious ties to the founder of the Friends (Quaker) Church since the college has strong ties to that body. In 1995, with the acquisition of Western Evangelical Seminary in Portland, the name of the college was changed to George Fox University.</p>
<p> After World War II the Board of Trustees and administration took steps to implement strategic plans that enlarged facilities, salaries, and improved academic offerings. As the curriculum developed, the education, fine arts, and engineering majors attracted a larger student body.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s a Peace Learning Center, Tilikum retreat center, English Language Institute, all at the Newberg campus, and an extension center in Kotzebue, Alaska, were established. A degree-completion program for adults began in 1986 and remote campus locations were added in several Oregon cities and in Boise, Idaho. In 1989 the college acquired an established clinical psychology program from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary in Portland. Plans for masterâ€™s programs in education, business management, and Christian studies began at this time. While the main emphasis had been on academics, GFC also participated in collegiate sports throughout its history.</p>

<p>Oregon Yearly Meeting of Friends Church (OYM) was established in 1891 at Newberg, Oregon. In 1974 the name was changed to Northwest Yearly Meeting of Friends Church (NWYM) to reflect the congregations of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington states. Friends (Quakers) first arrived in Oregon in the mid-1800s, but it was not until 1878 that application was made to officially recognize Chehalem Monthly Meeting. By 1891 several churches had been formed in Oregon and Washington, so application was again made and Oregon Yearly Meeting was formed. Idaho churches applied to OYM in 1906 for official recognition as a Quarterly Meeting located near Boise.</p>
<p>The first Yearly Meeting sessions provided for the organizational structure by establishing boards, committees, clerks, and delegates to oversee pastoral and church extension, foreign missions, education, publishing, peace and arbitration--all continuing Friends concerns. The <title altrender="italic">Discipline of Oregon Yearly Meeting of Friends Church</title> was approved in 1895 and 600 copies were printed. Today the 2009 document, <title altrender="italic">Faith and Practice: A Book of Christian Discipline</title>, unites Friends across the NWYM.</p>
<p>The peace testimony of Quakers has been emphasized by committee and member practice through relief work, independent pursuits, and in conjunction with other yearly meetings and national organizations.</p>
<p>Education has a traditional emphasis within NWYM. At the first Yearly Meeting session reports were given about the progress of three institutions already established by Oregon Quakers: Friends Pacific Academy (1885) and Pacific College (1891), both located in Newberg, and Friends Polytechnic Institute (1892), located in Salem. Greenleaf Academy, near Caldwell, Idaho, was established in 1908. At present Greenleaf Friends Academy still continues and George Fox University in Newberg maintains strong connections with NWYM. Camping was another focus on wellbeing promoted by early Friends that continues to the present. Five camp and recreational sites located throughout Idaho, Oregon and Washington are affiliated with NWYM, providing programs and facilities for members and other participants of all ages.</p>

<p>Levi Talbot Pennington lived from 1876 to 1975, from 1911 to 1941, he served as president of Pacific College, which later came to be known as George Fox University. Throughout his life, he was a follower of the Quaker tradition, which can easily be seen in most of the collection, particularly in regards to his poems, letters and personal notes. During his life, he was married twice, and authored several books, including three collecting his poetry and one reflecting on his life. When he passed away, he had just turned 99 years old. After his passing, Pennington was survived by his children, including daughter Mary Beth Pennington, his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren.</p>
