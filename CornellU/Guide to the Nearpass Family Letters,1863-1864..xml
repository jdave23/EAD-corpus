         <p>A section in 
		<title>The History of Wayne County, N.Y.</title> on Arcadia (now Newark and Palmyra) has a Civil War soldiers' list in which Philip Nearpass appears. He belonged to the Union Army, Company I, 17th Cavalry and was enlisted in l86l and killed on August 20, 1864. The letters are to his sister Libbie Nearpass who lived in Arcadia. Elbridge G. Austin who is mentioned in one of Philip Nearpass' letters also appears on the soldiers' list; he belonged to Company E, lllth Infantry, n.d. The owners of the original letters, Mr. and Mrs. Scheer of Fairville, N.Y. are the descendants of the Austin family of Arcadia.</p>

         <p>: The four letters in this collection were written in 1863 and 1864. Three are from Philip Nearpass, a Union soldier, to his sister Libbie Nearpass of Arcadia, N.Y. (now Newark and Palmyra). The last is from Jacob Wentzel, also a Union soldier, to Libbie Nearpass, presumably written after Philip's death.</p>
         <p> Philip asks for news from home, health and welfare of friends and family, and tells of battles and the long marches he has gone through. In his third letter he is dismayed that he has received no word in return from Libbie, their mother, nor any other family. Other names appear in the fourth letter. </p>
