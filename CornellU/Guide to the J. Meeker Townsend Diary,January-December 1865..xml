         <p>Meeker Townsend was a 13-year-old boy at the time he wrote his diary and resided in Townsendville, Seneca County, N.Y. His father was John Townsend (b. May 18, 1810) and his mother was Emeline Meeker. He was the eighth of nine children and apparently became a medical doctor. (See 
		<title>History of Seneca County, N.Y.</title> 1786-1876. Philadelphia, 1876.)</p>
      </bioghist>
      <scopecontent encodinganalog="MARC 520">
         <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
         <p>The diary contains brief daily accounts (3 to a page) of the boy's daily activities consisting mostly of school, church meetings, chores, purchasing food and supplies, and visiting friends as well as what visitors his family received. It covers January to December of 1865 with some months apparently torn out. The condition of the diary is poor and since much is written in pencil, whole sections are illegible. Since Meeker was quite young when these accounts were written there are no real insights of depth, but only simple accounts such as, "Attended school today." Much of December is used for itemized lists of goods with prices and there are five poems or notes written to him by friends and family in the "Memoranda" section.</p>

               <p>Contents: The diary starts out on Sunday, January 1st and there is mention of a Rev. Hitchcock preaching. Most of the winter he attended school where he did well, saw his best friends, the Colemans, bought "dride appals and got 12 cents and 1/2 per pound there was 477 pounds $59.62" with his "Pa" in Trumansburg and wrote about heavy snow and other weather. He mentioned his mother and brothers and sisters, Helen, Robert, Ida, and Lewis. His chores consisted mainly of thrashing flax which he often stayed home from school and church to do. He often missed Sunday meetings because of visitors who were frequently in his home. He mentions his own sheep who gave birth a few times during the early spring, his grandpa's death on March l4th, and building fires at the schoolhouse.</p>
