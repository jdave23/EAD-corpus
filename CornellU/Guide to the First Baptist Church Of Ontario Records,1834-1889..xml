         <p>The Ontario Baptist Society was organized in December 1832 and included members from the towns of Ontario and Walworth. The society incorporated into a church in 1877 under the 1876 New York State statute for legal incorporation of Baptist churches.</p>
         <p>The meeting house of the Baptist Church is preserved by the Ontario Historical Society in its Heritage Square in Ontario. They are not at present completely sure which meeting house this is since several are mentioned in the record book.</p>

               <p>Contents: Minutes of trustees' and members' meetings. In December of 1832 a membership meeting was held to organize the society and elect trustees. No trustees' meetings were held between 1845 and 1849 but resumed in 1850 when they decided to repair the meeting house. Various decisions were made regarding subscriptions, pew rents, renting or buying, and the parsonage. In 1872, a committee of women was assigned the task of looking into renting "the Whittleton House" for the use of the pastor.</p>
               <p>In 1874, the church was in debt and was forced to sell land. In 1877, they decided to incorporate into the "Ontario Baptist Church." In 1881, the church building was too dilapidated to be used for meetings and the trustees decided to sell this building and the surrounding land and to buy the proo-perty of the "Free Advent Church" in Ontario Village. The lists at the end of the volume include: a list of trustees with names and dates, beginning in 1834; a list of members with dates, beginning in 1832; a list entitled "Names of the proprietors of the Baptist meeting house," with dates, names, and amount of slip. A sheet is filmed at the end of the volume entitled "Names of the members of the Ontario Baptist Society and the time of becoming Such Formed the 29th day of December 1832." with dates and names.</p>

It includes such statements as an intention "to walk together in Christian love" etc. Later they state that they will "be just in our dealings, faithful in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment, to avoid all rattling backbiting and excessive anger to abstain from the sale and use of intoxicating drinks..."</p>
