         <p>The Mead's Creek Baptist Church formed in Monterey village, Orange township, on July 15, 1837, as an off-shoot of the Baptist Church of Hornby(see Record #6074), at a conference of local Baptist churches including those of Hornby, Catlin, Campbell, Jersey, Bath, Dix, Orange and Reading. The Mead Creek's church adopted the Articles of Faith of the Hornby Baptist Church, and at a Council of Baptist churches (including those above plus others) convened on August 26, 1840, it was declared an independent church. A Covenant and Declaration of Faith were adopted, and the church's goverance structure was altered slightly. Funds for preaching services were raised by a Home Missionary Society (established June 19, 1841) subscriptions by "Equality," and grants from the Steuben Baptist Association. Membership fluctuated between 100 to 60 members during the 13 years covered in this
		  collection.</p>

         <p>This collection contains two covenant meeting minute books (1837-1843, and item 1850-1857). Both include erratic (and often undated) entries that appear to be from the 1860's through 1890's. The first book is paginated through page 113, and the second has few page numbers.</p>

               <p>Until 1840 when the church was legally recognized as a separate church, minutes are of conference meetings. Their contents are the same as the covenant meeting minutes which begin on page 48. They record baptisms, confessions of faith, receiving new members, election of clerks and choice of moderators, granting letters of dismission, appointments to committees, election of deacons, the "lead of minds" of the members, synopses of brief sermons given a communions and baptisms, and invitations from other churches regarding council meetings. In addition to regular covenant meetings, special meetings are recorded with unfinished business concerning finances, conflicts between members, confessions of transgressions, exclusions, and committee reports. All entries are signed by the church clerk. </p>
