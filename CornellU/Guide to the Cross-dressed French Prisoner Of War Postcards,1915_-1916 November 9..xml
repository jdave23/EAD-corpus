			<p> Written by Tristan Bernard (1866-1947), the play "Les deux canards" is a comedy
				about battling right-wing and left-wing newspapers secretly overseen by the same
				editor. It was first produced in Paris in December 1913. When it was reprised in
				Paris in 2008, media reports incorrectly indicated that it hadn't been presented
				again since the original production. </p>
