         <p>Established in 1800, the original church was built in 1809-1811. A new church was built in the 1870's. A portion of the congregation seceded in 1829 to form the Associated Reform Church (records at Geneva Historical Society); another in 1845 to become the Protestant Reformed "Dutch" First Congregational Church of Geneva (some on microfilm, majority in Presbyterian Church), and yet another in 1857 to form the Westminster Church.</p>

         <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
         <p>The First Presbyterian Church of Geneva Records, 1808-l884, 14 vols., mainly document session meetings from 1808-1865. Although the church was established in 1800, there are no records until 1808. Several groups branched off to form new churches: Associated Reform Church, 1825 (records at Geneva Historical Society); Protestant Reformed "Dutch" Church, 1845-1853 (some on microfilm, majority in Presbyterian Church basement); Westminster Church, 1857-1859 (locations of records unknown). All records received have been microfilmed and the originals returned to the church.</p>
         <p>The records include Articles of Faith, Covenants, and the mintues which include: names of individuals who received baptism, examples of the church functioning as a court, names of persons admitted to the church and how they were admitted (i.e. by letter, certificate, or on examination), names of persons suspended or excommunicated from the church.</p>
         <p>There are also two volumes of unarranged memorabilia (1798-1877) which include: correspondence between various church members, receipts of payments made to pastors, accounts of monies collected from the General Assembly to finance the building of the second church, and records of trustees meetings.</p>
