He received his early education at the Ovid Academy and his B.A. from Union College. He received his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1849. Dr. Joy was active in public affairs
				and served as both alderman and mayor in Marshall. At the time of his death, he was a health officer in that city. He was also at different times a member of the American Academy of Medicine, and State Medical Society of Michigan, as well as president of the United States Pensions Examining Board and president of the Calhoun County
				Medical Society.</p>
               <p>Scope: Henry Joy's Travel Journal (2 vols., April 23 - June 4, 1844) was written during his travels through the mid-western United States. Joy makes comments on everything he sees on his journey and minutely describes the places he has seen. Most of his traveling was done by boat, but he also used the stage coach
				and traveled on foot or horseback through other areas. He also describes the hotels he sleeps in and places where he dines.</p>
               <p>Contents: A list of towns, villages and cities that Joy passed through and the number of miles he traveled each day, criticisms of inns and taverns in which he ate, descriptions of conversations with people he
				met along the way (in a stage coach ride from Cleveland to Pittsburgh one of the passengers he mentions is a former senator from Ohio, Mr. Spaulding): descriptions of towns he passed through and any interesting sights found in the town, discussion of the Pennsylvania Dutch and their farming methods, an account of a sermon he heard
				preached by H. B. Stove's husband, description of an iron works, a glass works, and a nail factory, comments pertaining to historical sites he visited, names of persons he had introductions to in various cities, and drawings of historical sites (stone house where an abolitionist was shot in Alton, 111.).</p>
