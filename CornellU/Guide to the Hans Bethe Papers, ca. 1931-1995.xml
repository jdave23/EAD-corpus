         <p>Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) was among the most prominent physicists of the twentieth
            century, most famous for his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II, and for
            his Nobel prize-winning work on solar energy (1967).</p>
         <p>Physicist, Cornell University professor of physics, Nobel laureate.</p>
         <p>Born in Strasbourg, Bethe studied physics at Frankfurt and under Arnold Sommerfeld at
            the University of Munich. In 1930 he received a fellowship to Cambridge. He began his
            professional career at universities in Germany, and also worked with Enrico Fermi in
            Rome in the early 1930's. Although Bethe did not consider himself a Jew, his mother had
            Jewish ancestry, and thus he was removed from his university position at Tuebingen under
            the Nuremberg laws once Hitler came to power. He emigrated first to a position at
            Manchester, and then to Cornell University in 1935, where he would teach for the rest of
            his career.</p>
         <p>In his early years at Cornell, Bethe formulated his theory of how stars produce energy,
            an achievement that would win him the Nobel Prize in 1967. Further notable
            accomplishments included his work on the Lamb Shift, his famous three-part summary of
            nuclear physics, and his post-retirement collaboration with Gerry Brown on supernovae
            and neutrinos.</p>
         <p>During World War II, he headed the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National
            Laboratory as part of the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. Despite his
            concerns about escalating the nuclear arms race, he assisted in the development of the
            Hydrogen bomb in the 1950's. Through these experiences, he became a vocal adversary of
            the nuclear arms race and control, opposing programs such as the Strategic Defense
            Initiative, and arguing in favor of anti-proliferation and test ban treaties, including
            SALT I and II. He was also an impassioned supporter of nuclear power as a solution to
            American energy needs. He was involved in policy throughout his adult life, as a science
            advisor to several presidents, as someone who frequently testified before Congress on
            issues of scientific importance, and as an advocate for the role of scientists in public
            affairs.</p>
         <p>He also performed extensive consulting work for the U.S. government and American labs,
            such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
            and the Oakridge and Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. He also did consulting work for
            businesses such as Avco. Such consulting work generally related either to nuclear
            energy, or to defense.</p>
         <p>After immigrating to the United States, he reconnected with Rose Ewald, daughter of his
            earlier physics mentor, Peter Paul Ewald. They married in 1939, and had two children,
            Henry and Monica. He retired from Cornell in 1975, but continued his astrophysics
            research and continued to be an expert on thermonuclear processes, shock waves, and
            neutrino reactions.</p>
         <p>Bethe died at age 98 in 2005, having continued to participate in scientific study and
            policy until late in his life.</p>

         <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
         <p>Papers consist of Bethe's calculations, notes, and correspondence with colleagues
            concerning nuclear physics, solar, stellar, and nuclear energy, radiation, conduction in
            metals, quantum mechanics, the recommendation of physicists for various positions and
            grants, administration of the Cornell University Physics Department, Cornell courses,
            arms and arms control, underwater explosion research, nuclear test ban, and other
            topics; reports and hearings of the Atomic Energy Commission; Navy research reports;
            President's Science Advisory Committee memoranda; phonograph album of a television
            interview with Bethe concerning scientific education in the United States; articles,
            reprints, lectures, and textbooks by Bethe and others; reviews of professional writings;
            Ph.D. theses from the Cornell Physics Department; an engraving and two posters of Bethe
            used to advertise the Lauritsen Memorial Lecture for 1980; and correspondence received
            when Bethe won the Nobel Prize. Collection includes material on Strategic Defense
            Initiative, the H-Bomb and the Anti-Ballistic Missile, the end of the Cold War, and
            supernovae. Correspondents include Kenneth T. Bainbridge, Niels Bohr, Gregory Breit, Lee
            A. DuBridge, George Gamow, R. Clifton Gibbs, Emil J. Konopinski, Sigurd Kohler, Irving

            J. Robert Oppenheimer, George B. Pegram, Isidor I. Rabi, Morris E. Rose, Bruno Rossi,
            Harlow Shapley, Eugene Paul Wigner, Robert Wilson, and Victor Weisskopf.</p>
         <p>Records created or assembled by Hans Bethe. The collection includes correspondence;
            drafts and copies of Bethe's articles; articles and publications gathered for his
            research; notes and calculations; material related to arms control and nuclear energy
            advocacy, including copies of congressional testimony; meeting minutes and memoranda
            related to Cornell University and the physics department, and material assembled for
            teaching, such as overhead transparencies; clippings; transcripts of oral history
            interviews; and material relating to Bethe's consulting work, including memoranda from
            the President's Science Advisory Committee and Navy research reports.</p>
         <p>His research topics include nuclear physics, astrophysics, radiation, quantum mechanics,
            and metal conduction. Other topics include policy, and materials related to the history
            of physics and science, including research, biographies of other physics luminaries, and
            interviews with Bethe. Some Bethe interviews are printed, five are on videocassette, and
            one is on a phonograph.</p>
         <p>While material in the collection dates back to the 1930's, the bulk of it dates from
            1950-2000. Bethe actually assembled some of the earlier material later. For instance, he
            later collected photocopies of his old letters from the 1930's, some of which were
            photocopied from other archives.</p>

               <p> This series contains material related to research Bethe conducted, mostly while
                  at Cornell or after his retirement. Topics particularly well-represented include
                  nuclear physics, astrophysics and quantum mechanics. To maintain Bethe’s original
                  order, sometimes items are grouped together as Bethe grouped them to protect the
                  relationship between the documents. For instance, a selection of research on a
                  topic such as pulsars may be kept together regardless of format type (notes,
                  articles by others, etc.), if Bethe organized them that way. The Research series
                  excludes research, papers and talks specifically related to policy, such as energy
                  policy or arms policy--for such material, please see the Policy series.</p>

               <p> This series includes Bethe’s documents on issues of public policy, particularly
                  regarding science and technology. This series includes material related to policy
                  in the broadest sense, including his arguments on the ethical and social
                  responsibilities of scientists and his work on presidential advisory committee. It
                  contains his work on arms control, including nuclear testing bans and
                  non-proliferation, and his advocacy related to energy policy. Documents range from
                  correspondence, to relevant articles and papers, to copies of speeches and talks,
                  to material from advocacy organizations of which Bethe was a member. </p>

                  <p> Contains Bethe’s policy work on energy. (For his research and consulting
                     related to nuclear energy, please see the consulting series). It consists
                     mostly of advocacy for nuclear energy as a solution to U.S. energy needs, but
                     also includes material on nuclear waste disposal, the energy crisis of the
                     1970’s, alternative energies and cold fusion. It also includes records
                     pertaining to advocacy organizations of which Bethe was a member, most
                     significantly Americans for Energy Independence (known originally as AEI and
                     later as AFEI) and Scientists for Enlightenment on Nuclear Sources of Energy
                     (SENSE). (Bethe served as president of SENSE). Includes talks, papers and
                     op-eds, testimony, and correspondence. </p>

               <p> At various times, Bethe collected documents related to the history of science and
                  of physics, including events in which he participated, such as the development of
                  the Atomic Bomb. This material was gathered after the events, rather than as they
                  were unfolding. Files include articles on and obituaries for Bethe’s physicist
                  colleagues, some of which Bethe wrote, and includes photocopies of old documents
                  sent to Bethe, such as his earlier correspondence with figures such as P.P. Ewald.
                  Especially numerous are the interviews and material in conjunction with the
                  anniversaries of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Also includes several drafts and papers
                  on the history of physics by Sam Schweber. This series includes articles and
                  papers, photocopies of old documents, oral history transcripts, and
                  correspondence.</p>

                     Includes several files on the Sudoplatov controversy, in which a former Soviet
                     spy claimed that Oppenheimer and other prominent Manhattan Project participants
                     had shared classified information with the Soviets. Also includes material on
                     the controversy over whether the German physicist Heisenberg intentionally
                     sabotaged Nazi efforts to create an atomic bomb, including discussion
                     surrounding the Farm Hill Transcripts. </p>
