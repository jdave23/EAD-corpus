         <p>The First Baptist Society of Geneva was formed in August 1825 and the records of the Society begin on the 29th of that month. The church was incorporated in 1839 when a church building was purchased from the Presbyterians. The church was a member of the Ontario Baptist Association and the Ontario Baptist Ministerial Conference. In addition, the church established its own missionary society auxiliary to the Baptist Association and maintained a Bible tract society and a temperance organization. A social aid society was formed in November 1855. There was considerable revival activity in the church, most notably in the winter of 1838-1839 and from November 1842 to March 1843.</p>

               <p>These minutes begin with an entry at the organization of the church on August 29, 1825, detailing the various official appointments of the church (moderators, trustees and Sunday school class leaders) and deal with the church's finances. The minutes are followed by three pages of lists of children, school lessons and notes on the church building. Following this is a page entitled "The records of the board of Trustees of the first Baptist Society in Geneva," which cover only four pages, the last page being a series of figures (March 29, 1827-Oct. 16, 1830). They cover various appointments to the Board and notes on church finances.</p>

The records include appointments to various church offices, organizational resolutions and some brief notes on church finances. Of particular note in the minutes are entries interspersed between 1831-1838 concerning black members, including entries referring to a partition constructed between blacks and whites, a resolution to give the gallery over to black use, concluding on June 3$ 1837 when the church's black members receive permission to form their own church. Another entry of note (Sept. 2, 1826) notes the formation of an auxiliary to the Ontario Baptist Association to spread the Gospel "and promote Indian reform."</p>

               <p>These minutes include the appointments of church officials (moderators, conference delegates, trustees and Sunday school class leaders), dealing additionally with some church finances and church discipline. There is significant revival activity, particularly during November 1842-March 1843.</p>
               <p>Entries on the activities of the congregation focus heavily on concerns for unity within the church. A noteworthy entry (March 4, 1848) contains the report of a "Vigialance Committee" stating that many in the church were "Unworthy members making use of their standing in the church to accomplish unholy objects" and called for strict discipline." The committee concluded its extensive report by saying "in our humble opinion this church cannot reasonable expect the blessing of God."</p>
