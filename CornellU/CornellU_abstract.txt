Eichel suggests that with a technique called Coital Alignment Technique (CAT) heterosexual couples can overcome the two most common sexual problems: premature ejaculation and lack of female orgasm. Eichel argues that sexologists plan to use sex education to normalize bisexuality and pedophilia and ultimately to "disenfranchise sexual intercourse, the institution of marriage."

<abstract>Invented by Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1877, the praxinoscope was an animation
device, the successor to the zoetrope. It used a strip of pictures placed around the
inner surface of a spinning cylinder. An inner circle of mirrors was placed so that
the reflections of the pictures appeared more or less stationary in position as the
wheel turned. The viewer looking in the mirrors would thus see a rapid succession of
images, producing the illusion of motion. </abstract>
<abstract>Photograph viewer in the form of a wooden box covered in velvet, containing
two rollers, with a viewing window on the top. By turning one of two knobs on the
front of the device, the viewer can move forward or back through a roll of
photographs on the two rollers. The roll contains many reproductions of engravings
or lithographs in addition to (unidentified) portrait photographs. The images are in
carte de visite format, but inserted into a continuous roll of paper photo frames.
