			<p>The Presbyterian Church of Dansville was organized on March 25, 1825 by members of
				the Presbytery of Bath, and was received under the care of that Presbytery on August
				30th of that year. The church had eleven members, nine of whom were from the First
				Church in Sparta and two of whom were from Buffalo. In 1826 when the church
				transferred to the Presbytery of Ontario, the church had 32 members.</p>
			<p>The congregation worshipped in various school houses until 1831 when a church costing
				$3,500 was built. Land for the building and $1,000 was donated by Joshua Shepard. In
				1840 dissatisfaction arose and a separate church called the First Presbyterian of
				Dansville was formed. In 1842 they completed a church which burned in 1854, after
				which the group met at a hall or at the Lutheran church. After 1855 when the
				minister left the group, there was no regular pastor or preaching. The two churches
				were reunited at the solicitation of the Presbytery on January 15, 1861 after which
				they went by its former name.</p>
