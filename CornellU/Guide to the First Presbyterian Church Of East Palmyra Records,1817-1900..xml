         <p>In 1783 the church began to meet in the school house and was the first church to be constituted vest of the pre-emption line. It began as a Congregational church and in 1807 it became Presbyterian and joined the Geneva Presbytery. A new meeting house was raised. In 1842 that building was torn down and the materials were used in the construction of a new building. See the accessions folder for a more detailed history and p. 147,

         <p>This collection consists of two volumes: 1817-34 and 1834-1900. The records prior to 1817 were lost. These volumes consist of session minutes and some membership information, however, there may have been a register, since there are no marriage records.</p>

               <p> Contents: Session minutes which record attendance, the election of deacons and elders, the examination of members prior to admission; church discipline on cases including intoxication, lying, swearing, quarreling, failure to attend worship services, working on the sabbath, not honoring the marriage vow, contention, running a bad house, and dancing. Minutes were read and approved by the Presbytery at regular intervals. Following the minutes is a copy of the Church Covenant and the Articles of Faith and a list of church members with dates of dismission or death. In 1817 the eastern part of the church split to form a separate church.</p>

               <p> Contents: Session records, 1834-1900, contain material similar to that in the first volume. In 1834 there was a revival (pp. 2-21), and on Dec. 3, 1834 (p. 4) the church voted a commitment to temperance. On Feb. 1, 1847 (p. 40) there is a report to the Presbytery. Following the minutes are statistical reports to the Presbytery, 1857-60, "additions," 1898-99; dismissals, 1898-99; baptisms, 1898-99; deaths, 1898-99; and a list of contributions to Benevolent enterprises by the church, 1855-98. In the back of the volume is a list of names of members of the church containing name, death date, date of admission after 1838, and date of dismission or expulsion and a list of baptized children and their parents; and a copy of the Confession of Faith.</p>
