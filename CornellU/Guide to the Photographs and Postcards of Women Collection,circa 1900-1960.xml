                  <p>13 images on a variety of themes, all unidentified, and not necessarily related to each other. Two are of solitary women, one of which is a woman sitting on a log in a forested area, wearing a long skirt, cardigan, and blouse with man's tie. A few photos show groups of women wearing ornate hats. One may be a valentine. Several look like family pictures, of sisters, or mother and daughter.</p>

                  <p>Advertised on eBay as "Lesbian Interest, Old Photo Album All Women," the album is indeed entirely photographs of girls and women, both young and old, dating from circa 1910-1957. Their relationships are unknown. Ten photos are of two women together. Others are possibly mothers and daughters, grandmothers and daughters, and groups of friends, as well as photos of individuals. They are mostly informal shots; just a few are studio portraits. One is marked "Black's Studio, Wewoka, Okla." Names are written on the back of only a few photographs. They are: Mary L. Irwin, Jan Rorke?, and Mrs. Brenner.</p>
