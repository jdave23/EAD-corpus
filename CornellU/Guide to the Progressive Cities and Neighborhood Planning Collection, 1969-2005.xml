			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>The Progressive Cities and Neighborhood Planning Collection, collected by Pierre
				Clavel, documents a significant group of city planners, other city and state
				officials, cities and professional organizations that made contributions to urban
				governance and the physical and social quality of urban life in the period from 1970
				through the 1990s.</p>
			<p>The Progressive Cities and Neighborhood Planning Collection constitutes a subset of
				the City and Regional Planning Archives in the Cornell University Library. That
				collection is most extensively described in a catalogue for the exhibition, "Urban
				America: Documenting the Planners" compiled by Cornell archivists Elaine Engst and
				Thomas Hickerson in 1985. That catalogue referenced 91 collections of papers and
				records held by the Department of Manuscripts and University Archives, Cornell
				University Library. The catalogue organized the material by periods: "The
				Beginnings", starting at about the start of the 20th century, "Planning in the
				Twenties," "Planning and the New Deal," and "Contemporary Planning," encompassing
				the postwar period through the 1960s. The last of these periods specified such
				topics as housing legislation, urban renewal, Philadelphia, PA, Regional Plan
				Association, Shopping Centers, Historic Preservation, American Planning Association,
				and Planners and Social Action. </p>
			<p>The current set of materials complements these earlier ones by covering a significant
				group of city planners, other city and state officials, cities and professional
				organizations that made contributions to urban governance and the physical and
				social quality of urban life in the period from 1970 through the 1990s. </p>
			<p>In the context of the earlier materials and their organization, the Progressive
				Cities and Neighborhood Planning Collection reflects the concerns that were nascent
				in the "Planning and Social Action" grouping for the 1960s period. In the 1960s what
				the planners experienced and contributed to was a set of social movements, typically
				in protest of the effects of many urban programs of the time like urban renewal and
				the highway program. Paul Davidoff and Walter Thabit were major leaders, -- though
				there were dozens of others, professional planners but also citizen activists. Books
				like Lily Hoffman, The Politics of Knowledge (1989), Robert Goodman, After the
				Planners (1972), and Martin and Carolyn Needleman, Guerillas in the Bureaucracy
				(1974) give some of the background. </p>
			<p>What happened after about 1970 was the transformation of social movement energy to
				the attempt to capture real institutions and operate them in service of similar
				causes -- social justice, equality, and neighborhood "rights" not to have their
				communities destroyed. Prominent -- perhaps the most prominent -- examples were the
				takeovers of city governments by movement activists, now typically calling
				themselves "progressives", and the creation of neighborhood based community
				development corporations, often alongside grassroots based planning exercises such
				as those Reardon pioneered in East St. Louis and New York City. </p>
			<p>The current collection is organized around cases of such developments in
				institutions. "Planning" is the way in to each topic, but by no means all of what is
				covered. And along the way, papers, articles, interviews and occasional video tapes
				of a gallery of actors is touched on, some heroic -- Nick Carbone and John Alschuler
				in Hartford; Norman Krumholz, Ernie Bonner, Roldo Bartimole, and Dennis Kucinich in
				Cleveland; Derek Shearer, Ruth Goldway, Denny Zane in Santa Monica; Eve Bach, Gus
				Newport, Veronika Fukson, and Ed Kirshner in Berkeley; Peter Dreier, Mel King in
				Boston; Rob Mier, Art Vazquez, Doug Gills, Kari Moe, Bob Giloth, Liz Hollander in
				Chicago. </p>
			<p>It is important that this collection is about cities and neighborhood institutions as
				much as it is about the people. For as they shifted from movement base to the more
				formal institutions of government or neighborhood development corporation, they
				encountered and mastered new challenges: formalization toward organizations with
				rules and traditions; the challenge of opening their work to a broader clientele --
				e.g. the whole city -- while maintaining their original purposes. In the process
				they rose to new levels as individuals, and their institutions developed new
				capabilities. It is arguable that cities, for example, developed enhanced capacities
				to act as units representing all of their citizenry as a result of the entrance into
				government of "progressives" in the 1970s and 1980s. </p>

			<head>ORGANIZATION</head>
			<p>The collection is organized into separable "Series." Most series identify with
				particular cities or neighborhoods within cities. Some are organizations, and others
				are individuals. Major resources include Berkeley, Burlington, Chicago, Boston,
				Hartford, Santa Monica and Cleveland. There is minor coverage for other places:
				Sheffield and London, UK; Madison, Wisconsin. There are also series for
				organizations: The Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies was prominent
				supporting the work of many of the cities and individuals listed here between 1985
				and 1985, and successor organizations continued in one form or another - it held
				national and regional conferences during this period, that supplement the particular
				city materials listed here, and widen coverage to many dozen additional places.
				Planners Network is another organization for which material is collected here. The
				Paul Davidoff and Walter Thabit papers reflect Suburban Action and Planners for
				Equal Opportunity, respectively. </p>

				<emph render="bold">
					<ref target="s1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series I: Santa Monica,
						California </ref></emph>
				<lb/>Major changes in Santa Monica city government began when in 1979 Santa Monicans
				for Renters Rights (SMRR) succeeded with a rent control initiative; that election
				also brought in two city council members. In 1981, SMRR in coalition with the city's
				Democratic Club and other groups won majority control and implemented steps to
				control development and open city administration to popular participation.</p>
			<p>The Cornell collection includes extensive local newspaper coverage for 1984-1988;
				eighteen transcripts of interviews of local officials and activists, and 48
				documents ranging from draft memoranda and papers to official city reports.</p>
			<p>The experience of progressive government in Santa Monica is referenced in a number of
				books. See Stella Capek and John Gilderbloom, Community versus Commodity : Tenants
				and the American city (1992), and Mark Kann, Middle Class Radicalism in Santa Monica
				(1986).</p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series II:
						Great Britain</ref></emph>
				<lb/>The Cornell collection includes material from other countries, and there are
				efforts underway to build on contacts and research on Sheffield and London (U.K) in
				the 1980s by Robert Kraushaar and Pierre Clavel. They have deposited a preliminary
				set of materials from these and other UK places, at total of 258 pieces: documents,
				interviews and not easily accessible articles.</p>
			<p>The British cases had a great deal of published analysis and history. See the
				journal, Local Economy, and such volumes as Maureen Mackintosh and Hillary
				Wainwright A Taste of Power: the politics of local economics (1987).</p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series III:
						Berkeley, California</ref>
				</emph>
				<lb/>Berkeley had created a liberal city council regime in the 1960s, but its
				administrative style, dependent on a city manager form of government, clashed with
				expectations for participatory reforms and redistributive programs that emerged from
				civil rights and student movements. An "April Coalition" won city council seats
				beginning in 1969, and was able to generate support by putting initiatives on the
				ballot. By 1979 the Berkeley radicals, now having adopted a formal structure as
				Berkeley Citizens Action (BCA) won a working majority of the city council. Under
				Mayor Gus Newport (1979-86) and Lonnie Hancock (1986-94) the city continued its
				progressive reforms.</p>
			<p>The Cornell collection derives from research by Pierre Clavel and others, and
				includes 29 interview transcripts, 45 key city documents, and 174 news clippings
				covering the years from 1974 to 1996.</p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s4" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series IV:
						Hartford, Connecticut </ref>
				</emph>
				<lb/>In 1969, after the resignation of four members of the city council and summers
				of rioting made the city seem unmanageable, the Democratic Party leadership
				appointed young activist Nicholas Carbone to the city council, where he quickly
				asserted leadership. As majority leader for the next decade, Carbone presided over a
				series of development agreements that reserved developer profits for city residents,
				supported the nationally recognized Hartford Food System, and created a number of
				city practices that favored poor residents.</p>
			<p>The Cornell collection comes from research done by Pierre Clavel in the 1980s, and
				includes interview tapes and transcripts, 93 news clippings from local and other
				sources, and 68 other documents. </p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s5" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series V:
						Cleveland, Ohio</ref>
				</emph>
				<lb/>Cleveland's "progressive city" experience - apart from the period of Tom
				Johnson's mayoralty in 1900-1908 - is best known for the tumultuous term of populist
				Dennis Kucinich in 1977-79. There was also the liberal mayoralty of Carl Stokes in
				1967-71, the grass roots organizing supported by the Catholic diocese in the 1970s,
				the community development organizations that flourished from the 1970s at least
				through 2005, the investigative journalism of Roldo Bartimole reflected in his
				bi-weekly or monthly Point of View, and the work of city planner Norman Krumholz
				with the city and later at Cleveland State University's College of Urban Affairs. </p>
			<p>The Cornell collection derives initially from research by Pierre Clavel in the 1980s,
				and includes interview tapes and transcripts, 24 key city documents, a number of
				news clippings covering mainly the period 1968-1979, and many issues of Point of
				View.</p>
			<p>The best published treatment of the Cleveland politics in the Kucinich years is Todd
				Swanstrom, The Crisis of Growth Politics (1985); and on Krumholz' planning it is
				Norman Krumholz and John Forester, Making Equity Planning Work (1990).</p>

			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s6" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series VI:
						Burlington, Vermont </ref></emph>
				<lb/>Socialist Bernie Sanders surprised Burlington by winning election for Mayor by
				ten votes in 1981, ushering in a period of progressive control of the city that was
				still in effect in 2005. After a year of fierce opposition from the city council,
				Sanders was able to implement reforms, notably through the establishment of a
				Community and Economic Development Office (CEDO) in 1983, and the appointment of
				several key administrators. One result was a set of "good government" reforms:
				treasurer Jonathan Leopold found ways to save the city significant expenses; and
				Sanders opened up city hall to citizen participation. There were also new citize3n
				boards and commissions. There was a program to train women in the construction
				trades and place them in jobs. The city also exerted control on development in new
				ways. Most striking may have been the housing programs promoted by CEDO, in concert
				with the Burlington Community Land Trust, which created "permanently affordable"
				units and generated community support for city housing policies.</p>
			<p>In the 1990s Sanders' successor as mayor, Peter Clavelle, consolidated progressive
				initiatives. Major features that distinguished the city included city composting and
				recycling facilities, continued housing development and a host of other
				innovations.</p>
			<p>The collection includes interview tapes and transcripts, 52 key city documents, and
				over 500 news clippings.</p>
			<p>Several books have appeared reporting on progressive government in Burlington. See
				Greg Guma, The People's Republic : Vermont and the Sanders revolution (1989); and
				John Davis, The Affordable City (1994). Cornell thesis treatments include Renee
				Jakobs, Planning and politics : a case study of progressive city administration in
				Burlington, Vermont, 1981-1983 (1984); Catherine Hill, Bernie Sanders, the working
				classes' candidate (1989) and Maile Deppe, Reinventing local government : creating a
				culture of concern, participation, and decision-making a case study of Burlington,
				Vermont (2000).</p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s7" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series VII:
						Chicago and Harold Washington</ref>
				</emph>
				<lb/>Washington was known as Chicago's first African American mayor (1983-87), and
				as a reform mayor who presided over a drastic reduction in patronage jobs, the death
				of "the machine as we knew it" in the face of massive city council resistance, a
				period called "council wars." Washington's innovative, neighborhood oriented
				economic policy is less well known. City planner Robert Mier and a set of local
				academics and activists had created the Rehab Network and the Community Workshop in
				Economic Development, and these and their ideas infused Washington's campaign. Mier
				later became Commissioner of Economic Development, and many others became involved
				in administrative posts or in continued neighborhood activism pressuring the city
				administration. </p>
			<p>Research by Kenneth Reardon, Xolela Mangcu and Pierre Clavel, and contributions from
				many others are reflected in the Cornell collection. At this time there are 40 city
				documents and other items from the neighborhood movement, 32 news clippings covering
				mainly the years 1980-1988; and eight longer manuscripts and published articles.
				There is also a 25 minute video, "Harold Washington and the Neighborhoods," produced
				by Wim Wiewel and Pierre Clavel in 1991.</p>
			<p>There is a good deal of retrospective work on the Washington mayoralty. For a general
				treatment see Gary Rivlin, Fire on the Prairie (1992). There is a number of books.
				See Pierre Clavel and Wim Wewel, eds., Harold Washington and the Neighborhoods (New
				Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1991) for chapters by five persons who
				worked in city government under Washington, and five community activists and
				academics. Joel Rast, Remaking Chicago : the political origins of urban industrial
				change (1999), recounts the development of a neighborhood oriented economic policy
				and its promulgation for a number of years in the successor mayoralty of Richard M.
				Daley. Robert Mier's Social Justice and Local Development Policy (1993) recounts
				Mier's work, with co-authors from among his colleagues. See also Norman Krumholz and
				Pierre Clavel, Reinventing Cities: Equity Planners Tell Their Stories (Philadelphia:
				Temple University Press, 1994) for chapters by Mier, Kari Moe and Art Vazquez; and
				Cornell doctoral theses: Xolela Mangcu, Harold Washington and the cultural
				transformation of local government in Chicago, 1983-1987 (1997); and Kenneth
				Reardon, Local economic development in Chicago 1983-1987 : the reform efforts of
				Mayor Harold Washington (1990). </p>
			<p>Other archival sources include the "Harold Washington Neighborhood Papers"
				collection, at the Chicago Historical Society, and collections at the Harold
				Washington Library in Chicago.</p>
			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s8" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series VIII:
						Boston Under Raymond Flynn</ref>
				</emph>
				<lb/>Boston's population had tired of "liberal" politics under the 16 year mayoralty
				of Kevin White when, in 1983, South Boston populist Ray Flynn and African American
				"rainbow coalition" advocate Mel King reached a dead heat in the preliminary mayoral
				election. Flynn prevailed in the general election, ushering in more than a decade of
				effort to implement redistributive programs, notably around affordable housing, by
				taxing and otherwise extracting surplus from the city's booming office and upscale
				housing development. The key innovation was "linkage," a formalization of
				Hartford-style development agreements that assessed a square foot development
				exaction on large projects. General acceptance of that led to a series of other
				programs and policies that gave Flynn momentum and a national platform to argue for
				similar policies in the face of conservative national governments. </p>
			<p>King's "rainbow coalition" had remained in opposition to Flynn, pushing for community
				control. Later it seemed to decline under successor mayor Thomas Menino. But waves
				of immigration had made Boston a "majority-minority city" after 2000, and a set of
				ethnically diverse new political faces gave the rainbow coalition new currency. </p>
			<p>The collection reflects research and interviews done by Pierre Clavel and Ken Reardon
				between 1986 and 2004; a substantial number of interview transcripts, documents,
				press clippings and articles that were projected for indexing in 2006.</p>
			<p>There is a dearth of published accounts of Flynn's mayoralty. Who Rules Boston (1984)
				provides background from the point of view of local activists. There is a series of
				articles by Peter Dreier, who was Flynn's Director of Housing. The best critical
				piece is Marie Kennedy, Chris Tilly and Mauricio Gaston, "Transformative Populism
				and the Development of a Community of Color" in Dilemmas in Activism: Class,
				Community and the Politics of Local Mobilization, edited by Joseph Kling and
				Prudence Posner. Philadelphia: Temple University Press (1990).</p>

			<p>
				<emph render="bold"><ref target="s9" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series IX:
						Other Places </ref></emph>
				<lb/>A number of other places in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America
				experienced the sorts of government reform that happened in the cities with major
				representation in this collection. It is our intent to get a selection of materials
				from the main such places: Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver in Canada; Bologna and
				other Italian places, and selected Latin American cities. </p>
			<p>Madison, Wisconsin is a notable U.S. case for which we have minor coverage, but its
				longtime progressive mayor Paul Soglin and current progressive David Cieslowitz
				require a further effort. Other places had notable representation in the Conference
				on Alternative State and Local Policies in the 1970s, and we are compiling the work
				of that organization, indicated separately below.</p>
			<p>There is some published work on these places: Max Jaggi et al, Red Bologna (1977) was
				a well known early example; Daniel Chavez and Benjamin Goldfrank, eds., The Left in
				the City (2004) is a recent review of developments in Latin America. On Canada, see
				Warren Magnusson, The search for political space : globalization, social movements,
				and the urban political experience (1996).</p>

				<lb/>While in "Progressive Cities" neighborhood activists ran for elective office
				and won control of city governments, an equally important shift in local government
				practice is represented in thousands of "neighborhood planning" experiences -- such
				activities as community organizing, city government inspired participatory
				neighborhood planning, and the emergence of community development corporations and
				allied organizations. Research and involvement by Kenneth Rearcon in East St. Louis
				and several New York City neighborhoods and Pierre Clavel in Community Development
				Corporations in Youngstown, Ohio, Wiscasset, Maine, and elsewhere have formed the
				initial basis for these collections, supplemented by a number of dissertations and

				consists of digitized documents from the physical collection, as well as additional
				material.</p>
			<p>Much of the background of city policy and neighborhood planning relevant to these
				cities is contained in collections acquired at various times as part of the larger
				City and Regional Planning Archives at Cornell. This larger grouping is documented
				in Urban America: Documenting the Planners, by Elaine D. Engst and H. Thomas
				Hickerson, catalogue for a 1985 exhibition at the Olin Library. The relevant
				collections or papers are listed in the Documentation Newsletter, Cornell University
				Libraries, Department of Manuscripts and University Archives, Vol. XVI, No. 1
				(Spring 1990), "Collections on City and Regional Planning," pp. 8-23, which lists
				some 170 separate collections acquired by that date. </p>
			<p>Of particular relevance to the Progressive Cities and Neighborhood Planning
				collection would be the papers of Charles Abrams, Paul Davidoff and Walter Thabit.
				The Abrams collection has received extensive documentation. See Charles Abrams:
				Papers and Files - A Guide to the Microfilm Publication. (Ithaca, NY: Department of
				Manuscripts and University Archives, Olin Library, Cornell University, 1975).</p>
