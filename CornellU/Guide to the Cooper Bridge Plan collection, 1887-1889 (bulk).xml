            blueprints of railroad bridges, including ones designed by Theodore Burr, Timothy
            Palmer, Lewis Wernwag, and Albert H. Fink. Correspondents include the American Society
            of Civil Engineers; D.M. Stauffer, editor of Engineering News magazine; H. Bissell,
            chief engineer, Boston and Maine Rail Road; A.J. Swift, chief engineer, Delaware &amp;

            and T.R. Lawson, his assistant; Henry McCormick Jr., president of Harrisburg Bridge
            Company; and the Lehigh Valley Rail Road Company. The collection includes several items
            about the work of Theodore Burr and Timothy Palmer, earlier civil engineers who had each
            designed a number of railroad bridges.</p>

         <p>For Series III, entries appear in alphabetical order by working title. Original titles,
            whether or not they are the same as the working title, appear in quotation marks,
            following the working title. Original titles include both those that actually appear on
            the piece itself, and those that, at some point in the collection's history, had been
            noted on the verso of some untitled pieces. Working titles were determined according to
            the following criteria:</p>
         <p>1. Proper name of bridge, if that is either the same as, or appears in, the original
            title of the item, e.g., Blue River Bridge for "General Plan of Blue River Bridge";
            also, if the proper name is known, even if it is not explicit on the item<lb/>2. Proper
            name of bridge *type* (or of eponymous individual) if that is either the same as, or
            appears in, the original title, or is known, e.g., Pratt truss bridge for "Plan of draw,
            Newburyport ..."; Fink triangular truss bridges … for "Bridges on the B. &amp; O. ... by
            Albert Fink"<lb/>3. Name of town or of waterway; e.g., Easton bridge for "Highway
            bridge...at Easton, Pa."; Jones' Falls bridge for "N. C. Ry. Bridge over Jones'
            Falls"<lb/>4. Name of railroad, if that is the most prominent or the only proper name in
            the original, e.g., New York Central &amp; Hudson River RR...Bridge for "N.Y.C. &amp;
            H.R.R.R. ... Bridge #307"<lb/>5. Bridge type or bridge part, in absence of any proper
            names</p>
         <p>Entries that are part of composite items (more than one bridge per plan) are indicated
            as such. Dimensions of each item are in approximate inches. </p>
         <p>Note: Graphics that appear in Theodore Cooper's paper, *American Railroad Bridges*
            (Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, 1889) are indicated by: [ARB
