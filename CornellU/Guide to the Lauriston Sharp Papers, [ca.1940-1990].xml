      <p>Anthropologist and Goldwin Smith Professor of Anthropology and Asian Studies, emeritus,
        Cornell University.</p>
      <p>Lauriston Sharp received in B.A. in 1929 at the University of Wisconsin. He studied in
        Vienna and at Harvard University where he received his master's degree in 1932 and his
        doctorate in 1937. His early field training in anthropology was in the American Southwest
        and Plains areas and in the Berber regions of eastern Algeria. He began his specialization
        in the cultural anthropology of Far Eastern and Pacific peoples at the University of Vienna.
        From 1933 to 1935 Sharp was a Fellow of the Australian National Research Council and
        Lecturer in Sydney University, and he carried out field research among tribes in northeast
        Australia, especially the Yir Yaront. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1936, helping to set
        up a combined department of anthropology and sociology. During World War II he was assistant
        chief, Division of Southeast Asian Affairs in the State Department, where he dealt
        particularly with Thailand and Indonesia. Upon returning to Cornell he organized a teaching
        and research program in applied anthropology which included the Cornell Thailand Project. He
        directed a multidisciplinary effort to chart the impact of change and modernization on Bang
        Chan, a rice-growing village on the central plain. He also organized Cornell's area and
        language program on Southeast Asia and served as its first director from 1950 to 1960.</p>
