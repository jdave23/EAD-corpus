         <p>Photo album mostly comprised of pictures of women who appear to be in their thirties, who lived in California, and who were engaged in a variety of athletic and dramatic feats. Of the 305 photos, the majority date from 1921 to 1929. Only two photos are annotated with a name; both are "Rose." It appears that Rose may have been in a relationship with another woman featured in the album. There are 154 individual portraits of this second woman, and 24 photos of the two together. Three of the photos of the couple show Rose or both of them in male attire. In the album there are 6 other photos of women in various male attire.</p>
         <p>In the photographs, Rose, the other woman, and their friends are seen dancing (on point and in balletic poses, in hawaiian skirts, with tambourines, and Russian dancing), dressed like gypsies and Native Americans, playing the saxophone, twirling a lasso, climbing trees, doing cartwheels, handstands and other gymnastic moves, bicycling, playing tennis and volleyball, and fishing. They are in the yard, at the beach, or other outdoor spots, including Crater Lake, redwood forests, Mount Shasta, Santa Cruz, Emerald Bay, Las Turas Lake, Castle Rock, Sequoia, Klamath River, Kaweah River, Sacramento River, Carmel, and a Los Angeles public beach.</p>
         <p>There are 23 group shots, dated 1915, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1934. The same women appear in various shots. In some, they are wearing matching outfits of shorts or bloomers and white sailor tops. They hold a basketball in one.</p>
         <p>There are also 50 pictures of Rose or other women solo; 3 pictures of a blond girl maybe 3 or 4 years old; 11 pictures of cats; 13 pictures of places; and 21 pictures of gardens with gnomes and other small sculptures, including presumably the home garden of Rose and her partner.</p>
