<p>Rachel Aimee cofounded $pread magazine with Audacia Ray in 2004 and was an
editor-in-chief for four and a half years. The magazine was published independently

Independent Press awards in 2005 as Best New Title and Award for Best Online
Political Coverage. Subtitled "Illuminating the Sex Industry," it was a forum for
writing by sex workers and advocated for their rights. In March 2015, the Feminist

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Adeline Cleveland Hosner (1809-1882) was the sixth of twelve children born to Josiah Cleveland and Fanny Lathrop. She lived in Mecklenburg, Tompkins County, the entirety of her adult life. At a Methodist revival camp-meeting in 1824, Adeline, then fifteen years old, with a brother and a sister experienced religious conversion. She married Isaac Hosner in 1833 at age twenty-four, bore eleven children, seven of which survived to be adults. Her concern for the physical and spiritual welfare of her family vas paramount through successive trials of sickness, death and personal conflicts. She wrote of raising the money to buy her sons' drafts in the Civil War over slavery, constantly concerned herself with the irreligious state of her husband's soul, and shoved a profound sense of responsibility for her own moral and spiritual self. She quoted the Bible and sermons she heard often
and wrote poetry as veil, reflecting on her life as a Christian woman. The first entry in her diary is in March 1833, and the last is dated August 7, 1882.</p>

<p>Afrika Bambaataa is an American disc jockey, singer, and songwriter from the South Bronx, New York. Often called the “Godfather” of Hip Hop, Bambaataa has helped to define Hip Hop since it emerged in the South Bronx in the 1970s. One of a handful of Hip Hop's 1970s originators, Bambaataa gave Hip Hop its name, and was the first to define its core artistic elements - DJing, rapping, break dancing, and graffiti art - under one cultural umbrella. His cultural organization, the Universal Zulu Nation, has helped to spread Hip Hop culture throughout the world. His genre-defining 1982 song "Planet Rock" and subsequent electro-funk tracks have become icons of hip-hop and electronic music. In 2007 he was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Albert Hazen Wright was born August 15, 1879, in Hilton, NY. His
parents were Delos C. Wright and Emily Hazen. He had one younger sister named
Mabel. He attended Hilton High School, in Hilton, NY, Brockport Normal School
and eventually Cornell University. It was at Cornell where he met Anna Maria
Allen whom he married on June 25, 1910. Wright was a Cornell University
professor and herpetologist.* He earned his PhD in vertebrate zoology in 1908.
He and his wife were interested in the study of amphibians. In 1949, they
co-authored the books Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada and
Handbook of Frogs and Toads of the United States and Canada. The book
Life-Histories of the Frogs of Okefinokee Swamp, Georgia: North American
Salientia (Anura) No. 2 was written by Albert Hazen Wright and J. Whitfield
Gibbons. The Cornell University's herpetology collection is now one of the
largest of its kind in the nation. "The major strengths of the collection,
amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians
from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of
the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated
elsewhere." </p>
<p> Between 1921-22, A.H. Wright worked and studied in a part of Georgia
known as the Okefenokee Swamp. He befriended Frances Harper who did extensive
research on the culture and live of people who lived in the Okefenokee Swamp
(See this website
<extref href="http://sherpaguides.com/georgia/okefenokee_swamp/sidebars/francis_harper.html" show="new">http://sherpaguides.com/georgia/okefenokee_swamp/sidebars/francis_harper.html</extref>
for information on the Francis Harper Papers, which are housed in the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (#3638)). In 1945, the book Our
Georgia-Florida Frontier: The Okefenokee Swamp, its History and Cartography. .
. was written by A.H. Wright. He also authored of "Pre-Cornell and Early
Cornell VIII" as well as numerous other histories on various aspects of Cornell
University. He also spent a lot of time on genealogical research related to the
Wright family.</p>
<p>Wright was an honorary member of the International Ornithological
Congress. And in 1959, he was elected the 2nd vice president of the Dewitt
Historical Society. After years of research and writing, he died in Ithaca, NY
in July of 1970, at the age of eighty-one. </p>

<p>The aim of the Cornell Peru Project was to conduct an experiment in applied anthropology dealing with social and cultural change among the Indian serfs of the Andean hacienda (an agricultural manor) of Vicos, located in the Callejon de Huaylas of Peru. It also was to give training to social scientists in applied field work in anthropology. The Peruvian Indian Institute, a semi-autonomous agency attached to the Ministry of Labor and Indian Affairs, collaborated in this project. Cornell University, under Professor Holmberg's direction, leased the Vicos hacienda for a five year period. During that five year period from 1951-1956, the Vicos community changed from one of serfdom under the rule of a "patron," to that of an autonomous, self-governing and economically viable community. After the five year period, Cornell continued as advisor to the Vicos community and to the Peruvian Ministry of Labor and Indian Affairs until 1965. Another division of the collection, the
Cross-Cultural Methodology Project, was composed of the records of a group of social scientists at Cornell University who obtained funds from the Carnegie Foundation of New York to carry out a comparative study of social science methods in different areas of the world. A Peruvian phase of this study was carried out by Professor Rose Goldsen at Vicos, Peru in 1952-1953. Dr. Max Ralis was involved with this study in Thailand and India.</p>

<p>Alvin Howard Sanders (1860-1948) was the son of James Harvey Sanders,
a renowned livestock author and founder of the leading livestock journal,
<title>The Breeder's Gazette</title>.</p>
<p>Alvin attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York from 1878 to
1879. His father, then editor of the
<title>National Livestock Journal</title> in Chicago called upon his son
to help him in the editorial office. In 1881, Alvin graduated from the Union
College of Law and received his license from the state of Illinois in 1882.</p>

<p>James Sanders founded
<title>The Breeder's Gazette</title> in Chicago on December 1, 1881.
Alvin decided to join his father in his new endeavor and was employed on the
staff as co-editor. He married Elizabeth A. Hildebrand of Chicago on April 25,
1882. By 1892, Alvin had become editor and owner of
<title>The Breeder's Gazette</title>.</p>
<p>On February 20, 1900, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Alvin
Sanders as a member of the American delegation to the Paris Exposition.</p>
<p>Atter the Union Stock Yards opened in Chicago, Arthur G. Leonard,
Robert Ogilvie, and Alvin Sanders formed the Saddle and Sirloin Club located at
the Stockyard Inn in 1903. On the club walls were portraits of the important
persons in the livestock movement. In Alvin's book,
<title>At the Sign of the Stock Yard Inn</title>, he wrote about the
lives of Robert Bakewell, Thomas Bates, Amos Cruickshank and others.</p>
<p>On August 16, 1905, a convention was held at the Illinois Theater in
Chicago which was attended by leading commercial and agricultural
organizations. It was here that the American Reciprocal Tariff League was
formed. Alvin was elected chairman and held this position until 1909. During
his service, he corresponded with President Theodore Roosevelt regarding
foreign trade agreements with the United States.</p>
<p>President William Taft appointed a Tariff Board in September 1909
which included Henry C. Emery, professor at Yale; James B. Reynolds, Assistant
Secretary of Treasury; and Alvin Sanders.</p>
<p>Alvin wrote many livestock books which included such works as
<title>A History of Aberdeen- Angus Cattle</title>,
<title>Red White and Roan</title>,
<title>Short-Horn Cattle</title>, and
<title>The Story of the Herefords</title>. In 1917, he published in
collaboration with Wayne Dinsmore,
<title>A History of the Percheron Horse</title>. The French government
awarded him with the Cross of Officer Merite Agricole in appreciation for his
work.</p>
<p>Over the years, he was awarded many awards and honors. He received the
degree of Doctor of Agriculture from the University of Illinois in 1906. In
1911, he was presented with the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from Kenyon
College. Alvin was also awarded the Chevalier of the Order of Leopold from the
King of Belgium for his contribution in promoting interest in scientific stock
breeding.</p>
<p>He was a member of many different agricultural organizations. He was
made president of the Saddle and Sirloin Club in 1915. Governor Frank O. Lowden
appointed him a member of the Illinois Board of Agricultural Advisors in
1917.</p>
<p>Alvin Sanders retired from
<title>The Breeder's Gazette</title> journal in 1927. The livestock
journal continued to be published by different editors until it went out of
business in 1964.</p>

<p>Alvin Orloff played a major role in the Popstitutes, an influential San Francisco
queer performance group and punk band founded in 1986 by Michael Collins ("Diet
Popstitute"), Brad Kellogg ("Bad Popstitute"), and Orloff ("Remix von Popstitute").
He was also important in Playstitute, a production company that brought
genderbending and avant-garde plays and musicals to established theatrical spaces in
San Francisco, and Klubstitute, a long-running weekly club that featured underground
queer performance in a variety of genres. Orloff also served as an impresario and DJ
at Baby Judy's, a queer dance club held weekly in San Francisco's Mission District
from 1994 to 1996. Michael Joseph Collins, aka Diet Popstitute, was a performance
artist, musician, theater producer, and club entrepreneur. Born in 1958, he died in
1995 at the age of 37. In the late 70s, Diet moved to San Francisco and became known
in the Punk Rock scene. He wrote poetry, which later developed into his song lyrics.
In 1986, he co-founded the musical and queer performance art group The Popstitutues
with Alvin Orloff, aka Remix von Popstitute, and Brad Kellogg, aka Bad Popstitute.
Stage shows featured choreographed dances, costumes, and props, and promoted The
Popstitutes belief in sexual liberation and self expression. While such shows were
message-driven comedy, The Popstitutes musical style was impossible to categorize.
In 1990, The Popstitues opened Klubstitute, a floating queer oriented nightclub and
cabaret. Diet kept the tone of the club playful and yet avant garde, as the M.C. and
booker. Because of Diet's generosity in allowing anyone to perform, Klubstitute
became known as a breeding ground for new talent, as well as a space in which anyone
of any sexual orientation could go to have some fun. In 1992, Diet founded
Playstitute, a queer oriented theater production company. He died in 1995 of AIDS.
Orloff, aka Remix, inherited Diet's unpublished scripts, lyrics, performance notes,
and personal notebooks, which are included in the collection. Remaining active in
San Francisco's cultural life, Remix has since published three novels, 'I Married an
Earthling' (2000), 'Gutterboys' (2004), and 'Why Aren't You Smiling?' (2011) through
Manic D Press.</p>

<p>The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences was founded
in 1909 as the American Home Economics Association. The Association had its
origins in the Lake Placid Conferences that were held from 1899 to 1908 with
the aim of becoming “a kind of clearinghouse for all the schools and teachers
of home economics.” They hoped their audience would include the “professional
worker in the home and institutional household, and all, whether students,
scientists, or practical persons, who are interested in the improvement of
living conditions.” The conferences were first convened by Ellen Richards and
others interested in the emerging field of home economics. Ellen Richards is
considered to be the founder of the American Home Economics Association and was
a pioneer in home economics as a field of scientific study and social reform.
The involvement of these early professional home economists in sanitation and
public health, child development, scientific nutrition, functional home and
environmental design, education, and household management set the stage for the
endeavors of professional home economists in the following years.</p>

<p>The Ithaca Branch of the American Association of University Women was founded in

including Helen Magill White, Anna B. Comstock, Margaret K. Carleton Farrand, and
Jennie Farley. The AAUW's Legal Advocacy Fund grew out of the Ithaca Branch's
fundraising for the legal expenses of the Cornell Eleven from 1980-1984.</p>
<p>The City Federation of Women's Organizations was founded in 1910 by a group of women
"concerned with education, recreation, philanthropy, health, safety and civic
betterment." Initially it provided housing for women as well as coordination among
the dozens of women's organizations in Ithaca. For many years it owned the Women's
Community Building downtown, which included meeting rooms, a small library, and an
auditorium for community events. Since the 1960s, the number of local women's
organizations in the CFWO has shrunk to about a dozen. The Women's Community
Building was sold in 2012 to make room for an apartment building to provide
much-needed affordable housing. The CFWO now administers an endowment to help
support the work of its member organizations.</p>

<p>American Studies 2001 (AMST 2001) The First American University is a course
taught by Cornell University historian Corey Ryan Earle, Class of 2007, that teaches
the history of Cornell University and encourages students to document an aspect of
past or present Cornell through the course assignments. The title of the course
derives from educational historian Frederick Rudolph calling Cornell University
"the first American university," referring to its unique role as a coeducational,
nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student
body. In this course students explore the history of Cornell, with a focus on the
pledge of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White had to found a university where "any
person can find instruction in any study." The course covers a wide range of topics
and perspectives relating to the faculty, student body, evolution of campus, and
important events and eras in Cornell history. Stories and vignettes provide
background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus
traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. The
course also offers a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects
of the university.</p>

<p>Andrew D. White was born in 1832 in Homer, New York. He attended Geneva College, (now
Hobart College), Geneva, New York, and Yale University, graduating in Yale's class of
1853. After teaching history and English literature at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, he was elected to the New York State Senate, and served as senator for the
Syracuse area from 1864 to 1867. There he met Ezra Cornell, and as chairman of the
Senate Education Committee, he became involved in efforts to charter Cornell University
as the state's land grant college. The bill chartering Cornell University was passed in
April 1865; White became the University's first president in 1866. White was
instrumental in developing the history and political science departments at Cornell, and
took special interest in the library and the architecture of the new university. His
20-year tenure as University president was interrupted by a visit to Santo Domingo with
a Presidential commission in 1871, by a European tour from 1876 to 1878, and by a term
as United States Minister to Berlin from 1879 to 1881. White resigned the University
presidency in 1885, and traveled extensively in Europe. After the death of his first
wife, Mary Amanda Outwater, he gave a lecture tour in the United States, returned to
Europe, and finally joined Willard Fiske for a journey to Egypt, Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>In September 1890, White married Helen Magill, the daughter of Swarthmore College
President Edward Hicks Magill, and the first woman to receive the Ph.D. in the United
States. White served in many diplomatic roles, as Minister to Russia from 1893 to 1894

<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Arch Brown attended Northwestern University where he studied
under the legendary Alvina Krause and was graduated with a B.S. in Theatre and Television.
Almost immediately after graduation, he was invited to move to New York City to join the
staff of The Circle in the Square Theatre where he became the Design and Technical Assistant
on Children of Darkness, The Quare Fellow and Our Town. During his early years in New York
he also designed several musical revues at The Duplex, The Showplace and Upstairs at the
Downstairs. He has also worked as a steel warehouse foreman, an insurance adjuster and a
model. In retailing he was a display director, a fashion coordinator and a merchandise
manager. He was the designer for the D'Arni-Gould Sportswear line. With his life-partner,
Bruce Allen Brown, he was a real estate investor in New York City and owner/manager of Sea
Park St. Croix, a hotel in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Arch Brown's still photographs and
collages have appeared in Mandate, Honcho, The Village Voice, Michael's Thing and The Union
Seminary Quarterly Review and at The Underground Gallery. His essays and reviews have
appeared in The Advocate, The Villager, Manhattan G.A.Z.E. and he had a regular column on
"Television and Society" in the New York Native. He was the founder of G-MAN, The Gay Men's
Arts Network and, in memory of Bruce Brown who died in 1993 of a brain hemorrhage, he
sponsored The Arch and Bruce Brown Foundation which gives grants to gay-positive arts
projects based on history. Arch Brown's double biography of his life with Bruce was
published in Longtime Companions by Haworth Press. Brown first came to broad public
attention through his films. During gay liberation's closet-busting first decade, Brown's
homoerotic films (including Four Letters, Pier Groups, The Super, Trips, Harley's Angels,
Longjohns, The Tool Man, After the Fall, The Leather Bond, Dynamite!, All Tied Up, Rough
Idea, and Woodshole achieved an international following and superb reviews. His film "The
Night Before" was on Variety's 50 top-grossing films in the nation for 5 weeks. Brown's film
Tuesday was the only gay film included by the First New York Erotic Film Festival in its
nation-wide release of winning films. The distributors were charged with promoting
obscenity. His film "Sunday" won first prize in the Park Miller Eros Competition. Brown also
has directed several documentary films on art and culture including a series on English as a
Second Language for New York University. In 1979, at the suggestion of a friend who
recognized the wit in his films, Brown turned to playwriting. His first play, News Boy, was
produced later that year by The GLINES, went on to a full Off-Broadway mounting at the
Player's Theatre and had nine productions across the country over the next 15 years. Brown's
play, FREEZE! won the 1998 Eric Bentley Playwriting Prize. Other published and/or produced
plays include; Two Married Men, Samson, Sex Symbols, Brut Farce, Seeing Red, Breakfast with
Ferkin and Frank, Doubletalk and Ships That Piss in the Night. Arch Brown died peacefully at
his home in Palm Springs on September 3, 2012. Taken from the Arch Brown website

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette was born at
Chavaniac, Auvergne, in 1757, to an old, illustrious family of the provincial and
military nobility. He lost both his parents early: his father was killed by the
British at the Battle of Minden when Lafayette was two years old (1759), and when he
was thirteen and attending the prestigious Collège de Plessis in Paris both his
mother and grandfather died (1770). The latter's death left Lafayette with a sizable
inheritance: he was actually the richest bachelor in France. In 1771 Lafayette
became one of the King's Musketeers, beginning the military career he had always
envisioned for himself. In February of 1773 he moved to Versailles as a protégé of
Jean de Noailles, the Duc d'Ayen, becoming a lieutenant in the Noailles Dragoons in
April and promoted to captain one year later, shortly after his arranged marriage to
the Duc d'Ayen's daughter, Adrienne de Noailles on April 11, 1774. And yet,
Lafayette's chances at obtaining a position matching his wealth and status were
curtailed by the prevailing reformist mood and when the Ministry of War cut costs
and suppressed his regiment, he was relegated to reserve status (June1776.)</p>
<p>Lafayette first heard of the American revolt in 1775, at a dinner given by his
commander the comte de Broglie in Metz. Inspired to serve the American cause though
he knew very little about America beyond what he had read in Raynal and what he
heard from Franklin, Lafayette managed to sign on as a future major-general in the
American army in December 1776. But although by this time the French government was
sending covert aid to the Americans in the hope of securing French trade interests
(the "arms-for-tobacco deal"), Lafayette had to buy his own ship,<emph render="italic">La Victoire</emph>. It sailed from Spain on April 20, 1777 and
arrived at North Island, South Carolina on June 13, 1777. Initially disappointed to
find himself a general without a command, Lafayette was to return to France in 1782
having earned<emph render="italic">gloire</emph> for himself as well as liberty for
the American colonies.</p>
<p>When Lafayette met George Washington on July 31, 1777, it was the start of a famous
and long-lasting friendship, often described as a "father-son relationship."
Lafayette first saw combat at Brandywine (September 11, 1777). The leg wound that he
got there lent him military credibility, and he received command of the Virginia
division of the Continental Army, with which he spent the winter at Valley Forge
under nearly unlivable conditions. In 1778 Lafayette took part in battles at Barren
Hill and Monmouth Court House and served with the Continental detachment in Rhode
Island in conjunction with d'Estaing's expeditionary force. Earlier that year,
Congress had chosen Lafayette to lead a campaign into Canada, but the campaign was
ultimately abandoned as unfeasible.</p>
<p>Lafayette returned to a France that was now officially an ally of the United States
at the beginning of 1779. He was thus in France for the birth of his son George
Washington Lafayette, as he had not been when Adrienne de Lafayette gave birth to
their second daughter, Anastasie (1777), and buried Henriette, their first (1778).
During this year at home, in addition to pleading the American cause to his
compatriots, Lafayette was appointed to the French army as it prepared to invade
England. The invasion never came about, and Lafayette was in America again by April
1780. In February 1781, Lafayette led a detachment against troops led by the traitor
Benedict Arnold. Later that year he commanded forces against Cornwallis in the
decisive campaign of the American war.</p>
<p>Lafayette returned to France in 1782 a popular hero and lobbyist for American
economic interests. He accepted the position of quartermaster general of a
Franco-Spanish expeditionary force that was headed for British Canada, and then the
position of<emph render="italic">maréchal de camp</emph> in 1783, the year peace was
officially declared in the United States. His second daughter Virginie was born in
September. In these inter-revolutionary years, Lafayette energetically involved
himself in the liberal causes of his day. He had been a member of the Freemasons
since 1775 but in 1782 publicly identified himself with this network of secret
societies that, with the literary salons of the day, formed pockets of free thought
within the ancient regime and eventually espoused liberal politics. Lafayette
devoted himself especially to the causes of toleration for French Protestants, whom
he visited in Cévennes in 1785. In one of his most original enterprises, he also
purchased a plantation in the French colony of Guiana which was to be the site of an
experiment in gradually emancipating black slaves so as to maximize both their
chances at integration into free society, and their productivity and birth rate.
Madame Lafayette oversaw the management of the plantation after the death of its
appointed manager, Richeprey, in 1786. During the 1780s, Lafayette's international
popularity was evidenced by his first "American Tour" in 1784 and an "European Tour"
in 1785, the highlight of which was a personal meeting with the "enlightened despot"
Frederick II of Prussia.</p>
<p>Lafayette's role in the French Revolution was conditioned by the several aspects of
his public identity, as paternalistic aristocrat, enthusiastic defender of freedoms,
self-serving hero, and soldier. In 1787 and 1788, Lafayette attended sessions of the
Assembly of Notables, called at this time to resolve pressing taxation issues. To
the Assembly Lafayette brought his call for the civil rights of Protestants (an
Edict of Toleration was in fact enacted in November of 1787). In 1789 Lafayette
represented the nobility when he was elected deputy to the Estates General, a long
inactive governing institution which now joined with the Third Estate to become the
National Assembly. Lafayette presented the "<emph render="italic">Déclaration de
droits de l'homme et du citoyen</emph>" to the Assembly on July 11, 1789, and
was chosen vice-president of the National Assembly on the eve of the Fall of the
Bastille. In the turbulence that followed, Lafayette was proclaimed commandant of
the Garde Nationale, with the charge of keeping order in the streets of Paris, a
task in which his popular sway among the moderate bourgeoisie aided him. The Guard
escorted the King and Queen to Paris in October of 1789. On July 14, 1790, he
presided at the Fête de la Federation.</p>
<p>Criticism of Lafayette intensified when he ordered his men to fire on the unruly
crowd at the Champs de Mars in 1791. In October of that year Lafayette
resigned as commandant of the Garde Nationale of Paris. In 1792 he became a
commander in the war with Austria, which began in April. Lafayette's censure of the
increasing influence of Jacobinism, and his basic inability to understand political
trends, placed him at odds with both the government and the opposition. He was
publicly accused of plotting to march on Paris with his troops. On August 19, 1792,
the National Convention, formed after the arrest of Louis XVI on August 10, replaced
Lafayette with Dumouriez, who dumbed him "a traitor" after he emigrated. Lafayette
was in fact intercepted by the Austrians and imprisoned for five years -- first at
Wesel, then at Magdebourg, Neisse and Olmütz. Adrienne Lafayette and the children,
who had been experiencing the revolution from the provinces, joined him in prison in
1795. Adrienne herself had been in jail in France, and had survived the guillotining
of her mother, grandmother and elder sister. The Lafayette family was more
fortunate; save George who was staying in America, they together bore two more years
of imprisonment. Freed in 1797, Lafayette remained on the list of proscribed<emph render="italic">émigrés</emph>, living in exile in Holstein and Holland until
1799. Adrienne, meanwhile, was in France (1797-1799) trying to get permission for
her husband's return and to recover part of her inheritance: the Directory had
confiscated and sold all of Lafayette's properties in Bretagne and Auvergne except
for the house at Chavaniac.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the Consulate in November 1799 (the "18th Brumaire") the
political climate in France changed enough that Lafayette was able to repatriate. He
retired to La Grange (part of Adrienne's inheritance), where, during the years of
the Consulate and Empire (1800-1815), he led a relatively private life, pursuing the
interest in modern agriculture that he had developed in prison, and absorbed in the
day to day management of his estate and of his financial crises: Lafayette's
extremely generous financing of two revolutions, in combination with the loss of his
properties, left him deep in debt. In 1804 the American government expressed their
gratitude for Lafayette's contribution to the Revolutionary War by granting him a
tract of land in Louisiana, but this gift, like the Florida Lands granted him later,
in 1824, turned out to be something of a liability, in that his attempts to sell
portions of it to his creditors embroiled him in lawsuits and the lands themselves
were, in some cases, already occupied by settlers. Adrienne, in ill health since her
imprisonment, died in 1807.</p>
<p>With the Restoration (1815-1830) Lafayette was once more drawn into political life,
in the liberal opposition. In 1815 he served several terms in the Chamber of
Deputies, and insisted on Napoleon Bonaparte's abdication. Lafayette played a
leading role in the "Glorious Revolution" of July 1830 and found himself again
commandant of the Garde Nationale. He was now in his seventies. His decision to
support the duc d'Orléans' accession to the throne seemed to some a betrayal of his
role as defender of the republican ideals.</p>

<p>During the Restoration years La Grange became a mecca for Lafayette's many admirers.
His popularity grew even more with his American Tour of 1824-1825 as city after city
hailed Lafayette as almost another "Father of Our Country."</p>
<p>Finally, in the last years of his life, Lafayette, still true to his motto, "<emph render="italic">Cur non?</emph>" supported national insurrections in Belgium
(1830) and Poland (1831). He had followed Belgian politics since 1789 when the
Brabant revolted against Austrian domination, and the chief of the Flemish Catholic
party, Van der Noot, was in contact with the French government through the mediation
of Lafayette. As the President of the<emph render="italic">Comité Central en Faveur
des Polonais</emph> (1830-1832), Lafayette was active in fundraising and in
publicizing the plight of Poland and its refugees. He also during this time
corresponded with many members of the Carbonari, revolutionary Italians involved in
the 1831 uprising. Lafayette died in Paris on May 20, 1834.</p>

<p>The Associated Gas and Electric Company (AGEC) was a utility holding company which went
bankrupt in the 1930s. It was reorganized under the supervision of the courts and was
broken down into smaller companies by government order. The company originated as the
Ithaca Gas Light Company of Ithaca, N.Y. in 1852. Soon after 1900, its owners began
securing control of surrounding properties and the company was incorporated in 1906.
There were fourteen subsidiary companies, all but two of which were located in New York;
the largest and most important were the Ithaca Gas Light Company and the Homer and
Cortland Gas Light Company. Through mergers among its operating companies, the numbers
were reduced to four - the Homer and Cortland Gas Light Company, the Ithaca Gas Light
Company, the Ithaca Electric Light and Power Company, and the Norwich Gas and Electric
Company. These companies were consolidated in 1916 under the name of the New York State
Electric and Gas Corporation.</p>

Feeney's commitment to Giving While Living, the belief that people of wealth should use it to better the world during their lifetimes, has influenced Atlantic's grant making choices as well as the decision to limit Atlantic's life to a fixed term. The Atlantic Philanthropies will make final grants by December 31, 2016 and plans to close its doors in 2020, by which time nearly $8 billion will have been invested in people, programs, and capital projects around the world.

as the Baptist Society of Altay. The Society was officially constituted as a church on
June 1, 1825. Until 1831 the church had no settled pastor and relied upon two
licentiates. In 1842 the congregation built a church at a cost of $2,000. It was
repaired and enlarged in 1861, and repaired again in 1874. In 1860 the church changed

Apparently a number of congregations from the area around Hornby Forks including Dryun, Jersey, Catlin, Mead's Creek, Campbell (then West Hill) and Erwin had formed congregations which contributed members to the Hornby Church at its formation between 1825 and 1838. In 1840 the Mead's Creek Baptist Church was set off from Hornby as a separate congregation. The church originally belonged to the Steuben Association but by 1847 had joined the Chemung River Baptist Association which met in Hornby in 1860.

The Mead Creek's church adopted the Articles of Faith of the Hornby Baptist Church, and at a Council of Baptist churches (including those above plus others) convened on August 26, 1840, it was declared an independent church. A Covenant and Declaration of Faith were adopted, and the church's goverance structure was altered slightly. Funds for preaching services were raised by a Home Missionary Society (established June 19, 1841) subscriptions by "Equality," and grants from the Steuben Baptist Association.

<p>Filmmaker and writer Barbara Rubin (1945-1980), born in Cambria Heights, Queens, NY, was 17
when, not long discharged from a Connecticut institution, she began working for Jonas Mekas at
the Film-Makers' Cinematheque in New York in 1963. Using a 16mm camera lent to her by Mekas, she
began filming Christmas On Earth in the Lower East Side apartment of Tony Conrad and John Cale
at 56 Ludlow Street, where Sterling Morrison and Lou Reed later lived (and, first recorded "All
Tomorrow's Parties"). Christmas On Earth is sexually explicit to a degree surprising for its
time. The film - more technically a cinematic "performance" - typically screened as per her
instructions on two projectors with a contemporary rock radio soundtrack. During the next few
years she was an active participant in the New York underground art scene, where she introduced
Allen Ginsberg to Bob Dylan, and Andy Warhol to the Velvet Underground, at whose Exploding
Plastic Inevitable performances she both participated and projected her film. Rubin filmed the
Velvets in an early performance in 1965; however, the footage is now lost. She drew up plans for
sequels to her film but these were never filmed; one of her synopses (which she sent to Walt
Disney), proposed a plot wherein French author Jean Genet (playing himself, but as a Bowery bum)
is rescued from his situation by fairies. While there were a handful of additional screenings
before the end of the 1960s, soon after joining a Hasidic sect, Rubin instructed Mekas to
destroy her film. He didn't, and later she agreed that Christmas On Earth could again be shown,
as it has been regularly since 1983. After giving up filmmaking she married and moved to France.
She died in 1980, age 35, after giving birth to her sixth child.</p>

in 1974 in Philadelphia of eleven women by four inactive priests was deemed "irregular"
in that it was done without approval of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church.
Subsequently, Schiess and her attorney Constance Cook began a law suit against the
Bishop of the Diocese of Central New York, Ned Cole, charging him with sex
discrimination for refusing to recognize her ordination and preventing her from assuming
the position of a parish priest. The suit was discontinued when the General Convention

<p>Big Table was a literary periodical that published and promoted progressive, modernist,
and Beat prose and poetry. It ran for five issues from 1959 to 1960 and was the subject
of a 1960 obscenity suit. The journal originated as an offshoot of The Chicago Review
after the University of Chicago suppressed the Winter 1959 issue, which was to contain
ten chapters of William S. Burrough's Naked Lunch, as well as new work by Jack Kerouac
and Edward Dahlberg. The publication ran into legal difficulties after the U.S. Post
Office deemed it "unmailable" due to its "obscenity and filthy contents." Eventually a
judge ruled in favor of the magazine and ordered that the Post Office Department allow

<p>Benjamin Bristow Adams was born to Crawford Cadwallader and Ada G. Harrison Adams in Washington, D.C., November 11, 1875. He, three younger sisters and one younger brother were left fatherless in 1885. From the age of ten he was forced to help support his family and was frequently boarded out to relatives on a Virginia farm with his younger brother. He attended Central High School in Washington from 1890-1892 and advanced in the school cadet corps. In 1892 he

left school to become co-founder and editor of a weekly magazine, the "Pathfinder." The magazine began as a weekly news review for children but evolved into a paper for the benefit of "current events" teachers.</p>
<p>In 1896 Bristow left for the west to start college at the newly established university of Stanford. He paid his trip west with money earned during summers as a lifeguard at the Washington Public Bathing Beach, Big Basin. He intended to work for his room

and board at college; tuition was free. He entered Stanford by exam, not application. Consequently he attended under the status of a special student. He concentrated in drawing and painting his first two years, and English in his last two. He was to have graduated in 1900 as an English major with a concentration in drawing, but because he was short one credit he was not given a diploma. In 1906 David Starr Jordan, professor and president of Stanford, awarded Bristow his

belated diploma despite the lack of one credit.</p>
<p>During his college years Bristow pursued his interests in art and journalism. At the end of his freshman year, David Starr Jorden, chairman of the Bering Sea Fur Seal Commission, appointed Bristow artist for the commission. For five months, Bristow made observations and sketches of the fur seals of the Pribilof Islands. These sketches were later used to illustrate the commission's three volume report. Bristow had

pursued his art training some years before at the Spring Garden Institute in Philadelphia and the Corcoran Art School in Washington, D.C. While at Stanford, he studied at the Barron Studios.</p>
<p>Following his journalistic bent to pay his room and board, Bristow did writing by correspondence for the Seattle Post Intelligencer and the Boston Transcript. Bristow also edited all of the Stanford publications, without monetary recompense, during his four years at that

institution. He also founded and edited the "Stanford Chaparral," 1898-1900, the first college humor magazine in the west.</p>
<p>After completing four years of studies at Stanford Bristow returned to work on the "Pathfinder" in Washington, D.C. He continued to work as a free-lance writer and illustrator for magazines including "McClure's," "Everybody's," "Country Life in America," and the "Washington Star."</p>
<p>In 1902 he married Luella Farmer whom he had met in a

freshman art class at Stanford. They had conducted their courtship through extensive correspondence since 1900. Soon after marrying they had four children: Eleanor, Gertrude, Everett and Benjamin Bristow II. The growth and development of the family is documented in the correspondence.</p>
<p>In 1904 Bristow became vice president of H. M. Suter Publishing Company where he designed a series of college athletic posters, edited "Forestry and Irrigation," forerunner "American

Forests" and was managing editor of a weekly news review, "Washington Life" later called "American Spectator."</p>
<p>Bristow was asked to join the U.S. Forest Service in 1906, in their office of Information. There he edited bulletins and issued news reports. From the information he absorbed editing and writing articles on forestry, he was able to pass the civil service technical forestry examination. Subsequently he became a forestry assistant in the Choctawatchee

National Forest in west Florida. There he was involved in introducing exotic tree species: eucalyptus, Australian wattle, cork oak and French maritime pine. As a result of his work and research in this area Stanford elected him to Sigma Xi, an honorary scientific organization.</p>
<p>While in the forestry service, Bristow became a member of the Society of American Foresters, and was elected to the post of secretary and representative. In this capacity he attended the

dedication of Fernow Hall at Cornell in May 1914. He spent the summer of 1914 visiting many of the state and national forests in the Rockies and far west as a forest examiner.</p>
<p>November 1914, Bristow accepted a position at Cornell University as a full professor in the Agricultural School and department head in charge of publications and information. . As a professor he started courses in journalism, advertising and publicity, and forestry and conservation. Bristow,

familiarly known as B.A. by generations of Cornellians, became an immediate favorite with the students. He encouraged their friendship through his weekly Monday night open house or "at homes" at 202 Fall Creek Drive. There students congregated in the second floor study listening to anecdotes of Bristow's travel, discussing current events, airing their problems and enjoying Mrs. Adams' delicious home-made hot chocolate and cookies.</p>
<p>Aside from professorial tasks,

Bristow started the mimeograph news service and supervised the Extension Publications and the Experiment Station Bulletins. During the thirty years he taught and edited at Cornell, the University won more awards for excellence of the printed word than any other Land Grant College.</p>
<p>Combining his love of students with his love of journalism, Bristow became a member of the board of directors of the "Cornell Daily Sun" and unofficial advisor to the "Cornell

Countryman" and the "Cornell Widow." Bristow pursued many other jobs and activities relating to his journalistic interests while a forester and professor. In 1909 he was a public director of the National Milk Show and Dairy Exposition in New York City; in 1923 he served in the same capacity for the World's Dairy Congress. During World War I in 1918, Bristow took a temporary leave from the University and joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture's campaign for

stimulation of food production. From that work he progressed to the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff of the Army, where he was engaged in counter-espionage and counter-propaganda, as liaison officer with the Commission on Public Information, The Department of Justice, and the Military Morale Branch. In 1921 he wrote Fanner's bulletin 1202, "An Agricultural Almanac" for the U.S. Department of Agriculture For six months in 1930, he taught a conservation

and natural resources course at the University of Hawaii. In the early thirties he was made regional director for the Federal Writer's Project (WPA) in New York. He retained this position until he was dismissed by Henry G. Alsberg, for unsuccessful completion of work. Actually he was dismissed for charging Wallace Miller, who posed as a Stanford graduate, with being a communist and recommending his removal from the project. This affair got wide publicity and brought

Bristow into the national headlines. Finally, in 1939, Bristow was given an reward for appreciation of service by the New York Press Association.</p>
<p>Bristow pursued interests aside from journalism in his spare time. He had gone out for track while in college and retained an active interest in the sport while at Cornell. He was a referee for over 30 years, officiating evening games in full evening dress tails, white tie, white gloves, and top hat. In 1924 he visited

England with the Cornell and Princeton track teams as they competed against Oxford and Cambridge. In 1926 Bristow visited continental Europe, studying farming and agricultural techniques.</p>
<p>Bristow's artistic and literary talents allowed him to earn enough money to pay for two trips around the world. In 1930 he traveled around the world north of the equator, in 1937-1938 he traveled around the world south of the equator. From the great variety of experiences of his

travels, Bristow gave years of monthly talks over WGY in Schenectady, entitled "The World and Us." He also broadcast a weekly book review, "Let's Read a Book" over the Cornell Radio Station for over fifteen years.</p>
<p>Bristow retired in 1943 but was immediately reappointed by the Trustees for an additional year of service. He was made Professor Emeritus in 1944 and once again recalled to serve through 1945. In July 1945 he was asked to teach courses in the summer

session. In 1938, 1939, and 1941 he also taught a summer session in Extension Methods conducted by Colorado State College at Fort Collins. There he taught editing, extension writings and publicity methods in extension.</p>
<p>Bristow had planned for years to spend his retirement doing oil painting and gardening. Although he did manage to do one art show, he was never able to pursue this interest as much as he liked. He became alderman for the Ithaca Town Council, then

acting mayor of Ithaca for seven years, retiring the year before his death. He also founded and edited the "Cornell Plantations," a quarterly publication from 1942-1956. These activities plus his obligations in radio broadcasting, and numerous duties and organizations to which he belonged amply filled his time. Among the various honorary organizations and clubs which he belonged to during his life were: National Press Club; Society of American Foresters (Secretary,

1913); New York Press Association (life membership and Director-at-large); Sigma Delta Chi, professional journalism society (National Honorary President, 1920); American Association of Agricultural College Editors, (president, 1921); American Association of Teachers of Journalism; Sigma Xi; Alpha Gamma Rho; Epsilon Sigma Phi; Savage Club of Ithaca.</p>
<p>B.A. died, after a year of illness in a nursing home, in November 1956. He was survived by his wife, Luella, four

children and four grandchildren.</p>

<p>The Brotherhood winery was established by a European emigre, John
Jaques, who produced the first commercial vintage in 1839 under the label
"Blooming Grove Winery". Brotherhood has been in continuous operation since
that time. In 1858 the property and winery was deeded to Mr. Jaques' three
sons, John Jr, Oren, and Charles, and renamed "Jacques Brothers' Winery". In
1886, Charles, the last surviving brother, sold the winery to a father and son,
Jesse M. and Edward R. Emerson. They renamed the winery Brotherhood. Jesse
Emerson and his son expanded the facility, adding the "landmark" stone building
with additional underground cellars that are the largest in the country.
Edward, who was author of "The Story of the Vine", was in control of the winery
in 1919 when prohibition was enacted. Having survived prohibition by the sale
of sacramental wine, the winery again changed ownership around 1921. Louis
Farrell and his son Louis L. Jr acquired a controlling interest in the
Brotherhood Winery and ran it until 1947 when Louis Farrell Sr. died. His son
died shortly thereafter, and the Winery was then managed by three Farrell
cousins, one of whom, Francis Farrell, led the Winery into the post-WWII era.
The winery underwent dramatic changes - major expansion, the beginning of a
visitor tour operation and the creation of a broad range of award-winning
wines. Brotherhood remained a "family business" until a change of ownership in
January of 1987. Brotherhood Winery is listed in the New York State Register of
Historic Places and is listed as a National Historic Landmark and uses the
slogan "America's Oldest Winery".</p>

In the days preceding legal distribution of male erotica, his photographs were instrumental in defining and refining the aesthetics of male homoerotic photography in the United States."</p>

<p>A biologist, researcher, and founder of the Mariposa Education and Research
Foundation, Voeller died from AIDS-related complications on February 13, 1994 at his
home in Topanga, Calif. Voeller was perhaps best known for coining the acronym AIDS
for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome," a term he used in objection to the
disease's earlier label, GRID, or "gay-related immune disorder." From 1961 to 1972,
he held various positions on the faculty of Rockefeller University. A prominent gay
rights activist, Voeller helped found the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) in 1973 and
with Jean O'Leary, served as first co-directors. He also served as President of the
Gay Activists Alliance in New York City. In 1980, Voeller established the Mariposa
Foundation based in Topanga, to conduct human sexuality research, placing special
emphasis on reducing the risks of sexually transmitted diseases. At the time of his
death, Voeller's research with the Mariposa Foundation centered on the reliability
of various brands of condoms in preventing the spread of diseases. A result of this
research was a study funded in part by the American Foundation for AIDS Research and
the National Institutes of Health, that ranked 31 brands of condoms under various
conditions. Voeller was also conducting viral leakage studies for the recently
approved "female" condom.</p>
<p>Mariposa also worked to protect research material on the social and political aspects
of sexuality. Aware that papers, books, and ephemera on the lesbian and gay rights
movement were in particular danger of being lost or destroyed, a network of
volunteers searched for and gathered such material together. As this collection
grew, Voeller and his friend David B. Goodstein began to consider how to ensure its
preservation and professional care, make it more widely accessible for scholarship,
and increase its visibility. They believed that the time had come for a major
research library to take up the project of documenting sexuality. The gift of the
Mariposa archives to Cornell University Library in 1988 launched such a program --
the Human Sexuality Collection.</p>

<p>Carl E. Ladd was Director of Extension and Dean of the New York State
College of Agriculture at Cornell.</p>
<p>Carl Edwin Ladd was born 25 Feb. 1888 in McLean, Tompkins County, New
York, at the farm of his parents, Arnold D. and Mary E. (Mineah) Ladd; he was
their second son and the youngest of three children. Both parents were natives
of Tompkins County; his father was descended from Daniel Ladd, who came from
England to Massachusetts in 1634. Carl attended local schools and at fifteen
entered the nearby Cortland (N.Y.) Normal School, from which he graduated in
1907. After a year as school principal in South Otselic, N.Y., he enrolled in
the College of Agriculture at Cornell University. He received a B.S. degree in
1912 but stayed on for graduate study in the department of farm management,
specializing in cost accounting under the direction of Prof. George F. Warren,
whose economic ides he was to share, during the agricultural crisis of the
early 1930s. He received the Ph.D. in 1915. </p>
<p>That year Ladd became director of the New York State School of
Agriculture at Delhi, one of six regional schools recently established to
provide a two year program in applied agriculture. In 1917 he assumed overall
direction of the six schools as specialist in agricultural education in the
State Education Department at Albany. Two years later, he became director of
the State School of Agriculture at Alfred, N.Y. Ladd returned to Cornell in
1920, as extension professor of farm management. He was made director of
extension work for the College of Agriculture and the College of Home Economics
at Cornell in 1924. </p>
<p>Carl Ladd’s career was build upon identification with the interests of
New York agriculture. He regarded the extension service as a vehicle for
transmitting the needs of the farmer to the college and as an agency for
formulating research programs to meet those needs. As director of extension he
worked closely with the State Farm Bureau Federation, using its county units as
local bases of operation for the College of Agriculture; through this structure
extension specialists were made available to individual farmers for
consultation. Under Ladd, Cornell also continued its policy of aiding farmer
cooperatives such as the Dairymen's League.</p>
<p> In 1932 Ladd became dean of the colleges of agriculture and of home
economics and director of the agricultural experiment station at Cornell. A
skilled administrator and mediator, he set up meetings at the college between
farmers and the businessmen who supplied their needs. Recognizing the trend
toward specialization in agriculture, he altered the focus of extension work
from general farming to particular commodities. He also kept Cornell in the
forefront of agricultural research, concentrating on such problems as better
food packaging, dehydration, and the artificial breeding of livestock. He set
up a special interdepartmental research and extension projects designed to
expand the market for potatoes, an important state product, and encouraged the
development of the frozen food industry in New York State. </p>
<p>Ladd's influence in agricultural matters extended beyond the campus.
He had become widely known to the farming public at large through the columns
of the "American Agriculturist," edited by his close friend Edward R. Eastman.
Sensitive to the techniques of public relations, he maintained contacts in
Albany and Washington and with the newspaper publisher Frank Gannett. Ladd
served as secretary of the State Agricultural Advisory Commission under Gov.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later as chairman; he became chairman of the New
York State Planning Council in 1936; and he was a director of the Federal Land
Bank at Springfield, Mass., a major source of credit for Northeastern farmers.
</p>
<p>Ladd's reaction to the agricultural program of the New Deal was
ambivalent. He supported the Agricultural Adjustment Act as a temporary
expedient and recognized the need for some government assistance, but objected
to the degree of central planning envisaged by the Roosevelt administration. As
new federal agencies concerned with the farmer were created, Ladd sought with
considerable success to have them administered by the existing network of
county agents that made up the extension service of the various land-grant
colleges. The matter was formalized at a conference in 1938 between
representatives of the colleges and the federal Department of Agriculture at
which a compromise (the "Mount Weather Agreement") was worked out by Ladd. </p>
<p>While still active as dean, he died on 23 July 1943 of a coronary
attack at the age of fifty five and was buried at McLean, New York. </p>

<p>Thomas Chaffee came from England in about 1633 and settled in Hingham, Massachusetts.
He had two sons, Nathan and Joseph. Joseph married Ann Martin in 1669, and they had
nine children. One son, James, was married twice and had 20 children. Most of them
moved to western New York, many settling near Attica. The second son, Nathan, son of
James' first wife, Berea Hayden, married Priscilla Wedge of Woodstock, Connecticut,
and they later moved to Brookfield, Massachusetts. Their son William married Rachel
Rice in 1807. In 1817 William and Rachel moved to a farm south of Attica. The couple
had nine children (excluding one who died in Massachusetts). At least one child,
Edward Franklin Chaffee, remained in or near Attica his entire life. He taught at
and was a principal of the Attica Union School, and helped to pass legislation to
make it a free school.</p>
<p>Edward Chaffee also wrote local history articles for the local press. He married
Harriette E. Jones in 1845, and they had six (surviving) children: Mary Abigail,
William Franklin, Harriette Emeline, Eliza Rosette, Katie Evangeline, and Nellie
Josephine.</p>

<p>Charles (Chasen) Gaver, the eldest of three children, was born in 1953 in Wooster, Ohio
to Richard and Helen Gaver. After taking a B.A. from The College of Wooster in Ohio,
Gaver worked as a per diem paralegal at the Federal Trade Commission in Washington,
D.C.</p>
<p>Gaver identified himself foremost as a "performance poet." In 1978 he received one of
the first grants awarded to an openly gay artist dealing with gay subject matter from
the District of Columbia's Commission on Arts and Humanities. Gaver was also the
recipient of larger grants in 1981, 1986, and 1987, which enabled him to collaborate
with colleagues as well as to document his performances using photographs and
video/audio cassettes. In 1977 Gaver began writing sporadically for <title>The
Washington Blade</title>; ten years later his book reviews would become a regular
feature. In addition, Gaver wrote novels, essays, plays, poems and short stories, many
of which were loosely autobiographical. Gaver's interest in human relationships and his
identity as a gay man were common themes in his work.</p>
<p>Although Gaver spent most of his later life in the D.C. area, he made several trips
abroad, notably one to Morocco in 1982 where he was introduced to the ex-patriot writer
Paul Bowles. Correspondence between Gaver and Bowles dates from 1982-1987.</p>
<p>Gaver was also involved in two organizations; the National Organization for Women
(N.O.W.) for which he started a chapter while attending The College of Wooster, and the
Washington D.C.-based artists collective Black Artists/White Artists. He also
participated in Young Audiences, a performing arts program for inner city children.</p>
<p>In 1987 Gaver was diagnosed with AIDS and began extensively documenting his life with
the illness in "Fever Journal," a narrative account including clippings and
correspondence from October 1987-June 1988, and the medical notebooks, dated 4/17/87 -
1/31/89 and 2/2/89 - 3/10/89 which listed Gaver's daily food and drug intake as well as
his temperature and diminishing body weight. Gaver died of complications due to AIDS in
Washington, D.C. in March 1989.</p>

<p>As early as 1804 the Reverend Anthony Houty of Dryden, a German Reformed clergyman, preached for the German Evangelical Christians of Fayette in private homes, barns or in schoolhouses. With encouragement from their pastor, Lot Merkel, on December 26, 1809 the church was formally organized at a meeting of German Reformed and Lutheran residents held in the Burgh school house in Fayette. The members, who had resolved to build a church, completed a 22 x 28 foot log building by January 7, 1813.</p>
<p>On April 22, 1821 the Reverend Diedrich Willers of the German Reformed Synod of the U.S. entered upon his pastorate, which continued until 1882. In 1823 the church built a stone structure at a cost of $3,000 which was dedicated on June 6, 1825. A German week-day school was taught in the church's buildings from time to time until 1830. Until 1855 both the German Reformed and Lutheran congregations used the building, either alternately or simultaneously. After that it was maintained by the Reformed Church alone.</p>
<p>The church belonged to the Western New York Classis of the Reformed Church of the U.S. until 1882, when it asked to be transferred to the East Susquehannah Classis because they conducted their business in English. That same year the church was remodeled and a tower and a belfry were added.</p>

<p>For over 45 years, Knoebel made significant contributions to LGBT history, first as a
pioneer gay activist in New York City from 1969 to 1976 and then during his 33-year
career as a senior executive with the publishers of the national gay and lesbian
newsmagazine, The Advocate, OUT, and other LGBT magazines from 1979 to 2012.</p>
<p>Born in Waukesha, Wisconsin in October 1947, Knoebel attended the University of
Wisconsin/Madison when that campus was a nationally-recognized hotbed of
anti-Vietnam war protests. After graduating in June 1969, he moved to New York City
to attend graduate school in comparative literature at New York University.</p>
<p>As a young gay man in New York during the politically charged post-Stonewall era,
Knoebel quickly became an early member of New York’s pioneering Gay Liberation
Front. From November 1969 onwards, Knoebel participated in many GLF protest
demonstrations as well as the first Gay Pride March in June 1970. As a member of the
GLF 95th Street Gay Men’s Living Collective from June 1970 through January 1971,
Knoebel worked with this close-knit housing commune on many GLF projects, helped
form numerous gay men’s consciousness-raising groups and spoke at colleges and other
venues with the GLF speaker’s bureau. The collective also helped to organize the
August 1970 Times Square demonstration that ended with several days of riots in the
Village, participated in the week-long protest occupation of NYU’s Weinstein Hall,
and helped to establish GLF’s first community center on West 3rd Street.</p>
<p>Along with many other GLF groups from around the county, the 95th Street Collective
also attended both sessions of the 1970 Black Panther’s Revolutionary People’s
Constitutional Conventions in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Knoebel was one of
three GLF members who met with Huey Newton following the release of his important
essay, “A Letter to Revolutionary Brothers and Sister about the Women’s Liberation
and Gay Liberation Movements,” which is considered the first pro-gay, pro-woman
proclamation to come out of the radical black civil rights movement.</p>
<p>As a member of the cells, “Femmes against Sexism” and “Gay Male Group,” Knoebel
advocated a close affinity between gay liberation and radical feminism. He
subsequently joined Steven Dansky and Kenneth Pitchford in founding the Effeminists,
a group of gay men who opposed sexism, and co-authored the group's influential
statement of purpose, “The Effeminist Manifesto” which has been widely reprinted.
The group published its own magazine, Double F: a Magazine of Effeminism, from 1972
to 1976 which gave voice to the group’s often controversial politics about gay men
in support of feminism.</p>
<p>During this period, Knoebel had worked in magazine circulation and marketing jobs for
a succession of small New York publishing companies. Moving to San Francisco in
1978, Knoebel was at work in the city at another publishing job on the day that
Harvey Milk was assassinated and he attended numerous marches and protests that
followed.</p>
<p>In 1979, Knoebel was hired as marketing director of The Advocate by its high-profile
publisher, David Goodstein, and tasked with expanding the magazine’s fledgling 7,000
member subscriber base. Starting from scratch, Knoebel wrote and mailed The
Advocate’s first national direct mail campaigns. For many LGBT Americans, their
first experience of receiving a piece of gay-oriented direct mail was from ones that
Knoebel mailed for The Advocate. Within the next decade, subscribers increased to
over 70,000. In his eventual 30+ years with the publishing firm, Knoebel produced
and sent out over fifty million pieces of direct mail promoting the firm’s gay
magazines, books, mail order catalogs and other products.</p>
<p>In 1984, Knoebel started a new gay men’s erotic-focused magazine line for the
company, including Men, Freshmen and Male Pictorial magazines and served as their
publisher for several years. These titles proved to be an important profit source
for the company and supported the money-losing Advocate during the worst years of
the AIDS epidemic. After David Goodstein’s death, Knoebel served as the president
and was part-owner of The Advocate from 1987 to 1992.</p>
<p>Following another ownership change, Knoebel returned to New York continuing with The
Advocate as VP Consumer Marketing and was instrumental in The Advocate’s purchase of
its New York-based rival, OUT magazine. Knoebel also served as president of The
Advocate’s subsidiary, Triangle Marketing Services (TMS), a New York-based mailing
list management and brokerage firm that worked with a wide range of LGBT business
and non-profit organizations in their direct mail efforts and helped raise sizeable
money for many clients including major AIDS charities, as well as LGBT arts and
political action groups. Knoebel ended his long career with The Advocate in 2012
after 33 years and six-ownership changes.</p>
<p>Knoebel’s writings from the GLF era appeared in GLF’s newspaper, Come Out!, and in
early gay liberation anthologies, including “Out of the Closets: Voices of Gay
Liberation” edited by Karla Jay and Allen Young. Over the years, Knoebel has given
many interviews and spoken on numerous panels concerned with gay history and
politics. See:
http://stonewallrebels.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/40-years-after-stonewall-part-3-john-knoebel </p>
<p>Post Advocate, Knoebel continued to help document gay history as an editor of
Christopher Street Press, an e-Book publishing venture founded in 2011 by Steven
Dansky to preserve and re-issue important LGBT historical documents from the early
gay liberation movement. Among Christopher Street Press’s first publications were
“Hot August Night/1970, The Forgotten LGBT Riot,” and “The Come Out! Reader,” a
facsimile edition of all of the issues of GLF’s pioneering newspaper, Come Out! ,
which Knoebel co-edited.</p>
<p>In 2013, Knoebel and Dansky partnered again to found a new project, OUTSpoken: Oral
History from LGBTQ Pioneers. Initially focused on preserving the stories of the
pioneers who gave birth to the modern LGBTQ movement in the decade following the
1969 New York City Stonewall Rebellion, OUTSpoken has now collected many dozens of

<p>Clarence Arthur Perry, Cornell University Class of 1899, was employed by the Division of Recreation of the Russell Sage Foundation from 1909 to 1937, when that department closed. He lived in Forest Hills Gardens, a residential unit planned by the Sage Foundation. In January 1924 he devised his Neighborhood Unit theory defining a neighborhood as the area served by an elementary school and bounded by arterial roads; this theory was published in study number 7 of the Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs. Perry also wrote REBUILDING OF BLIGHTED AREAS (1933); PLANNING IMPROVEMENT OF YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD (1935); and HOUSING FOR THE MACHINE AGE (1939). He lectured on his planning theories at New York University, Harvard University, and to various other groups.</p>

<p>Clarence B. Moore was a wealthy amateur archaeologist from Philadelphia who crisscrossed
the rivers of the southeast each year in his steam-powered paddleboat, the Gopher,
excavating sites near the shores in states ranging from Alabama to Tennessee. During his
twenty years of investigations, Moore explored an astounding number of archaeological
sites. He published the results of his investigations regularly, translating the field
notes he kept in small journals into the larger, neatly written notebooks that he later
used as the basis for his publications. During his excavations, Moore uncovered many
artifacts associated with Indian burials that later ended up in museums. These artifacts
are now subject to repatriation by tribal members working to reclaim their sacred
heritage. Natives and non-natives alike rely on Moore's field notes, which can provide
important clues about the history of an artifact, helping to further repatriation
claims.</p>

<p>Religious services were conducted regularly in Prattsburg by the Reverend John Niles,
first in a barn owned by Jared Pratt, and after 1806 in a log meeting house. A
church was officially organized by the Reverend Timothy Field of Canandaigua on June
26, 1804. In 1806-1807 a large number of settlers from Connecticut, mostly
Congregationalists, joined the church, necessitating an enlargement of the meeting
house in 1808. On November 16, 1807 the Society incorporated as Presbyterian and
Congregationalist under the Plan of Union. By 1809 the Church's membership had
increased from its original membership of 15 to 61. In 1813 the church was received
into the Presbytery of Geneva. When the Geneva Presbytery divided in 1817 the church
became part of the Bath Presbytery. Revivals occurred in 1830, 1831, and 1832 and by
1839 the church had 240 members. A parsonage was bult in 1832-1833 and the church
was enlarged in 1820 and again in 1845. Other revivals occurred in 1842-43, 1846,
1849, 18501851, 1854, 1858, 1868, 1873 and 1875.</p>

interdisciplinary materials research and education while addressing fundamental
problems in science and engineering that are important to society. The center
undertakes materials research of a scope and complexity that would not be
feasible under traditional funding for individual research projects or small
groups.The mission of CCMR is to advance, explore and exploit the science and
engineering of advanced materials. The unifying theme of current research is
the study of materials purposefully structured at the nanoscale (near-atomic
dimensions) and to be world leaders in the design, control and understanding of
the behavior of both crystalline and disordered nanomaterials. This objective
is pursued through fundamental experimental and theoretical studies of the
assembly and processing of nanomaterials and of their resulting behavior.</p>

Work of the committee was coordinated by the Community Dispute Resolution Center, an independent Ithaca-based non-profit organization A consensus agreement in 1998 set the direction for an innovative approach to replacing Cornell's existing incinerator with a tandem of alternative technologies. A CCWMAC subcommittee spent three months writing a final report that the committee adopted Oct. 8, when it also approved a set of recommendations for further waste minimization at Cornell. In 2010 Cornell's incinerator at the College of Veterinary Medicine was officially shut down and replaced with a new digester for disposing of animal remains.The new system is part of a Waste Management Facility project that also includes removing the incinerator and installing a steam sterilization and shredding system for disposing of the university's medical waste, which will be completed in 2010. In 2011 A new Rotoclave (rotating autoclave) at Cornell's Waste Management Facility was dedicated, promising to dispose of the university's medical wastes in a safe, environmentally friendly manner, while saving energy</p>

<p>Columbia University's Student Homophile League (SHL), the first college or university
student group for gay issues, was founded in October 1966. On March 5, 1968, Jearld F.
Moldenhauer, a student at Cornell University, wrote to the business manager of
Columbia's SHL, who was using the pseudonym Stephen Donaldson, and stated that he was
"seriously considering an attempt to organize a Cornell chapter of the Student Homophile
League." Cornell's Scheduling Coordination and Review Board (SCARB) recognized the group
in May 1968, and Cornell's Student Homophile League became the country's second gay
student organization.</p>
<p>To protect privacy, Moldenhauer arranged for Cornell's SCARB to recognize the group
without submitting names of its members. Father Daniel Berrigan of Cornell United
Religious Work agreed to sign on as the Cornell group's first faculty advisor. The first
widely advertised meeting took place Nov. 21, 1968. Moldenhauer, Janis Kelly, Robert
Roth, Janet Hadda, and Pauline Layton were active members and officers during the first
few years. Victoria (Vicky) Mead was an officer in the 1978/1979 and 1979/1980 academic
years with Alan Evan Cherry, whose 1986 memorial service program is included in the
files she donated.</p>
<p>Cornell's SHL brought its first outside speaker to campus, Dr. Franklin Kameny, on Sept.
23, 1969. His lecture, "The Homosexual Dilemma: What Every Heterosexual Should Know,"
drew an audience of 150. This was followed by an October 23 lecture by Barbara Gittings,
"The Lesbian Speaks for Herself," that drew 350 people. In February 1970, through the
efforts of then president Robert Roth, Ithaca's leftist print shop, Glad Day Books,
printed the first issue of Cornell SHL News. A basement bar named Morrie's started
having gay nights and became a social space for SHL members. The Gay People's Center was
an affiliated project.</p>
<p>In 1971, a tradition of celebrating May Gay started and has continued since. Sometime
after 1984, the celebration was moved to April because of the early ending of the school
year and became known as Gaypril.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Name changes:</emph>
</p>
<p>In September 1970, the SHL changed its name to the Gay Liberation Front. Around 1973,
the name changed to Cornell Gay Liberation. Sometime between 1973 and 1979, a group
called United Sisters co-sponsored dances with Cornell Gay Liberation. In September
1979, Cornell Gay Liberation became GAYPAC (Gay People at Cornell) and a group named
Cornellesbians had formed.</p>
<p>In 1984, the following groups existed at Cornell: GAYPAC, LAGPAD (Lesbian and Gay
Political Action Discussion Group); Cornell Women's Center; GBLOC (Gays, Bisexuals, and
Lesbians of Color); Gay Peer Counselors; Lambda Law Students; and Cornellesbians.</p>
<p>By 1989, GAYPAC had become the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Coalition, an umbrella group
including GBLOC and LBQ (Cornell Lesbian, Bisexual, and Questioning Women, formerly
Cornellesbians). In 1997, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Coalition
included: BRIDGES (Bisexuals Reinventing Definitions of Gender and Sexuality); Dialogue
(religious discussion group); Safe Space (a coming out support group); ZAP!; LBQ; MSM
(Men Supporting Men); and Mosaic (formerly GBLOC).</p>
<p>GUAH (Greeks United Against Homophobia) and Out in the World (the graduate and
professional students' LBGT social group) are independent of the Coalition.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">The use of pseudonyms:</emph>
</p>
<p>It will be helpful for researchers to know the pseudonyms used by a few of the early
Student Homophile League leaders.</p>
<p>Jearld (Jerry) F. Moldenhauer '68 sometimes used the name Robert Hermann or Robert
Herrman, and later, Joel Morrison.</p>
<p>Robert Roth '71 sometimes used the name Robert Russell.</p>
<p>SHL's national chairman was Columbia student Bob Martin, sometimes known as Stephen
Donaldson.</p>

<p>The Cornell Migrant Program Campus Collection adds to the existing
Cornell Migrant Program Records (#23-13-3160) which documented the Wayne
County, NY office of the Cornell Migrant Program. The Cornell Migrant Program
was established in 1971 after a period of intense pro-farmworker advocacy by
students and outside forces. Cornell had maintained a migrant labor camp in
Wayne County, but bulldozed it to the ground in an attempt to quell the
controversy. The Wayne County office was the center of activity for the program
throughout its history, expanding gradually from a county-based effort to a
state-wide one, closing in 2004 after Cornell's decision to move the farmworker
program from the College of Human Ecology to the College of Agriculture and
Life Sciences.</p>

<p>Cornell students created Direct Action to Stop Homophobia (DASH) in the spring of 1999
after the Cornell Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Coalition folded the semester
before. The Coalition was the decendant of the original Student Homophile League, the
second gay student organization in the country. DASH had a political focus and revived
the earlier ZAP! panel program as its educational arm. DASH inherited the Coalition's
offices and its records. The name may have come from something students saw in the
records about an earlier group with the same acronym. The organization ceased in fall
1998. In spring 1999, two new groups formed: Haven, an umbrella group for social support
groups, and Direct Action to Stop Homophobia (DASH) for political and educational
activities.</p>
<p>DASH was active sporadically and held occasional office hours. In 1999, it organized a
"Live Homosexual Acts on Campus" event, for which queers and allies performed "live
homosexual acts," such as gayly talking on a phone or bisexually shaking hands with
passersby, and passed out cards explaining that actions generally do not have sexual
orientations. It resurrected "Gay Jeans Day" and several times advertised with posters
"If you support LGBT rights, wear blue jeans on Wednesday." Follow-up information
explained "You never know who's LGBT or who supports LGBT rights; you can't tell by
looking." One of the Gay Jeans Days prompted the Cornell Review to respond with
"Conservative Khakis Day." In spring 2000, DASH held a National Day of Silence rally on
Ho Plaza. In fall 2000, DASH sponsored a blood drive, "Give Blood because We Can't,"
paired with a letter-writing campaign to the American Red Cross and the Federal Drug
Administration. DASH was mostly inactive during 2002, until students revived it in
spring of 2003. It held an action to bring attention to violence against transgender
people. It ceased in spring 2006.</p>

<p>Cornell University is the land grant institution for New York State. The University was founded in 1865, and much of its original land and endowment came from the Morrill Land Grant Act. In subsequent years, the State Legislature established four statutory colleges at Cornell: Veterinary Medicine in 1894; Agriculture in 1904; Home Economics (now Human Ecology) in 1924; and Industrial and Labor Relations in 1944. While the statutory colleges are affiliated with the State University system and receive state funding , they are not state-run. </p>

He was a staff member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radiation
Laboratory from 1941 to 1943, and later served as a technical advisor at Air
Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. At the end of the war, he joined the
staff of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. In 1946 he came to Cornell
University as an assistant professor of physics and helped design the Cornell
Synchrotron. During his time at Cornell, he co-authored a textbook,
<title>Introduction to Electromagnetic Fields and Waves</title>. He was
appointed associate professor of physics in 1947, became a full professor in
1956, was named chairman of the Physics Department in 1956, and became Dean of
the College of Engineering in 1959. Dale Corson served as Provost of the

<p>Upon retiring from the Cornell administration, Corson continued to
work as a consultant in the fields of engineering and physics, and he was
involved in many national and international efforts. He founded the
Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable, and he headed a study
sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences,
<title>Scientific Communication and National Security</title> (1982). It

<p>David Goodstein was born in Denver, Colorado in 1932. After graduating from Cornell
University in 1954 he earned an LLB degree from Columbia University. He practiced for a
time in New York City as a criminal attorney. In 1960 his career moved to Wall Street,

defeat a 1978 initiative that would have banned homosexuals from teaching or working in
public schools. In the early 1980s, Goodstein made a highly successful national tour to
establish a network of gay political fundraisers. He was also the founder and chairman
of the Whitman-Radclyffe Foundation, a gay service organization dealing with drug abuse.
In 1975 Goodstein bought the <title>Advocate</title>, a Los Angeles-based gay magazine.
Within ten years it was the largest circulation gay news magazine in the country. He
served as president of Liberation Publications, Inc., publisher of the
<title>Advocate</title>. He also founded the "Advocate Experience," an EST-derived
workshop designed primarily for gays and lesbians. He also served as a member of the

<p>David Tibet (né David Michael Bunting) is a musician, poet, visual artist, and
publisher best known as the primary member of the music group Current 93. Tibet has
been an influential underground figure since the early 1980s. Working initially in
London's industrial music scene, Bunting--rechristened David Tibet due to his
ownership of Tibetan musical instruments--performed with Psychic TV and 23 Skiddoo.
In 1983, he began his own project, using the name Dogs Blood Order before settling
on the Aleister Crowley-inspired name Current 93. The group's first single,
"LAShTAL" (1983), was conceived by Tibet and John Balance as a one-off Crowleyan
magical ritual on record. Soon after, Tibet began working with Steven Stapleton, who
had been conducting surrealist musical experiments for several years under the name
Nurse With Wound. Current 93's early work is heavily experimental, featuring
distorted howling and tape loops. Perhaps owing to the growing list of collaborators
(including Douglas P. of Death in June and Rose McDowall of the pop group Strawberry
Switchblade), Tibet's music soon became more tonal and song-based, with a heavier
emphasis on Tibet's poetic, mystical, and apocalyptic lyrics. Later musical
collaborators such as Michael Cashmore, James Blackshaw, and Ben Chasny have led to
even greater compositional intricacy in Current 93's music. Albums such as Thunder
Perfect Mind, Of Ruine or Some Blazing Starre, and Black Ships Ate the Sky have been
described as "apocalyptic folk," mixing Tibet's idiosyncratic lyrical outlook with
music inspired by the British folk revival of the 1960s-70s. Other recordings in the
collection include Perdition edition, Bite sized beasts, and Flawed existence.</p>
<p>In addition to his music, Tibet is a publisher, operating the Ghost Story Press from
1993-2004 to publish limited-edition reissues of Victorian ghost stories and
supernatural literature. Durtro Press, founded in 1994, publishes reissues as well
as work by more recent authors such as Thomas Ligotti, Baby Dee, and Tibet himself.
Durtro was renamed Coptic Cat Press in 2008. Tibet is also active as a visual
artist, with solo exhibits at the Isis Gallery (London) and White Columns (New
York).</p>

<p>Deep Springs College, founded in 1917 by power and mining magnate L. L. Nunn, is located
thirty miles from the nearest town, in a high desert valley of eastern California. Mr. Nunn
wished his students to learn the value of service and practical knowledge as well as be able to
work uninterrupted by the distractions of modern society and learn that freedom requires living
in accordance with the ideals and duties of one's community. Each of the 26 male students
experiences a broad seminar-style education based on the "three pillars of Deep Springs":
academic pursuits, the labor program, and self-governance. Following their time at Deep Springs
most students transfer to other institutions of higher learning to earn college degrees.</p>

<p>A former actress and advertising account executive, in 1974 Dell Williams founded Eve's
Garden, a business guided by a feminist and sex-positive philosophy that offered for
sale vibrators, books, and other products to enhance and liberate women's sexuality. At
first, she operated a mail order business, and later she also opened a storefront in New
York City. The first store of its kind, Williams advertised it as a "feminist sexuality
boutique and mail order catalog created by women for women and their partners." Williams
was influenced by the writing of Wilhelm Reich and the work of sexuality educator Betty
Dodson and by her experience organizing a Women's Sexuality Conference for the New York

<p>Denis Iliin, the ancestor from whom the Denissoffs trace their

descent, left his home in Novgorod because of religious persecution during the

reign of Alexis (1645-1676) and settled in Five Huts, a village in the Don

region. During Peter the Great's expedition to the Black Sea (1696), he stopped

at Five Huts and ordered Denis and several of his fellow Cossacks to join the

expedition. Peter was favorably impressed by Denis, and rewarded him for his

brave conduct during the attacks on the Azov fortress. Subsequently, Denis was

made Ataman (chief) of the Cossacks in the region. Originally independent

frontiersmen, the Cossacks became an important and privileged element in the

Imperial Russian Army as the Empire expanded. The Denissoff family remained

prominent in military service throughout the 18th and 19th centuries; Il'ia

Fedorovich Denisov (1718-1792) distinguished himself in the war against Prussia

(1756-1763), and received a gold medal from the Empress Maria-Theresa. Fedor

Petrovich Denisov (1732-1803) participated in numerous campaigns during the

reign of Catherine the Great, who made him a general of cavalry and gave him

the title of Count and 1,200 serfs along with various awards. Adrian Karpovich

Denisov (1763-1841) took part in the historic march of Marshall Suvorov across

the Alps and retired at the rank of Lieutenant General in 1825. Vasilii

Avksentiievich Denisov (1788-1829) pursued Napoleon's army beyond the Rhine in

1812. Although the family is most noted for its military service, Vasilii

Il'ich Denisov has a most distinguished civil career as a Senator and a member

of the State Council. His son Il'ia left Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution.

With the death of Il'ia Denisov in 1971, these family papers passed to his son,

Basile A. Denissoff. </p>

(1973), M.A. in English (1976), and Ph.D. in English (1978), all from Cornell University, coincided with her emergence as a lyric poet whose sensibilities are reminiscent of Thoreau, Whitman, and A.R. Ammons, among others. During the late 1970s and 1980s, Ackerman published three volumes of poetry and a verse drama, all with William Morrow. Ackerman gained recognition for her for creative non-fiction with the publication of

<title>A Natural History of the Senses</title> in 1990, a work which combines keen observation and research with autobiographical insight. In <title>A Natural History of Love</title> (1994), and, most recently, <title>A Slender Thread</title> (1997), Ackerman continues her meditative exploration of the interconnection between the natural and human worlds. She has extended her readership with the publication of two non-fiction books for children: <title>Monk Seal Hideaway</title> (1995) and <title>Bats: Shadows in the Night</title> (1997). Her poetry appears in numerous anthologies and her prose is commissioned by a variety of magazines including <title>National Geographic</title>, <title>New Woman</title>, <title>The New Yorker</title>, and <title>Victoria</title>.</p>

<p>Edward J Wormley (he preferred to omit the period), who worked for Dunbar Furniture from
1931 to 1968, is considered one of the major 20th century designers of American
modernist furniture. His partner Edward Crouse was a professor of journalism and drama
and the theater director at the University of Georgia, at Athens, 1930-1946. Two
published works on Wormley include: <title>The Dunbar Book of Contemporary
Furniture</title> (Berne, Indiana: Dunbar Furniture Corporation, 1956), not included
here, and <title>Edward Wormley: The Other Face of Modernism</title> (New York:
Lin-Weinberg Gallery, 1997), copy in the collection.</p>
<p>Edward J Wormley was born to Edith and Myron J. Wormley on December 31, 1907 in Oswego,
IL, moving with his parents to nearby Rochelle, IL at age two. Edward Cass Crouse was
born to Annie and Harvey Crouse on October 25, 1908 in Kansas City, MO. After his mother
passed away in December 1918, Crouse and his two sisters, Frances and Margaret, were
invited to come and live with their uncle and aunt, William and Margaret Landon, in
Rochelle, IL. It was in 1919 that the Crouse children moved and that Crouse and Wormley
met and became dear friends.</p>
<p>As a child, Crouse played at designing stage sets and putting on small theater
productions for his family. Wormley likewise showed an early talent for the work that
was to become his career, taking correspondence courses from the New York School of
Interior Design while still in high school. Both were involved with theater at Rochelle
Township High School, playing Persian boys in a 1923 production of In the Garden of the
Shah. Several of the other boys whose names are listed in the programs Crouse saved
remained friends of the pair for many years.</p>
<p>Crouse graduated in 1925 and that fall he enrolled in the journalism program at the
University of Wisconsin. He sang in the Glee Club and pledged the Delta Upsilon
fraternity, writing home to Wormley about his courses and activities. Wormley,
meanwhile, graduated in 1926 and enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago with money
given to him by Nellie Wormley Herren, his father's second cousin. At the end of a three
terms, however, Wormley's funds ran out and he was forced to look for work.</p>
<p>He found it at the interior design studio of the Marshall Field &amp; Co. department
store, which after two years sent him to the Berkey &amp; Gay Furniture Company, the
store's custom furniture supplier. His designs for Berkey &amp; Gay were never
produced--and he was in fact laid off after only a year--because the Depression was
forcing the company to make cutbacks (it eventually folded). Wormley's former supervisor
at Marshall Field then introduced him to Homer Niederhauser, president of Dunbar
Furniture Company. In 1931 Wormley accepted a position as Dunbar's furniture designer,
an arrangement that proved to be beneficial and lucrative for both Wormley and Dunbar
for nearly thirty years. Wormley took up residence in Chicago (the location of one of
Dunbar's major exhibition spaces) and designed at least two and sometimes four lines of
20-25 original pieces of furniture for Dunbar per year while still finding time to do
independent designing and consulting for other companies including Rand McNally,
Lightolier, and Macy's departmnent store.</p>
<p>Crouse graduated from Wisconsin in 1929 and found work as a copy editor at the Racine,
WI <title>Times-Call</title>, but soon landed a teaching position at the University of
Georgia at Athens. In addition to teaching journalism, Crouse was appointed director of
the University Theater and the university's dramatic ensemble, the Thalian-Blackfriars.
He staged three productions a year from 1930 until he was called up for military service
in World War II.</p>
<p>During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the relationship between the two men was delicate
and amorphous. It's fairly clear that the two were physically involved to some extent by
1927, but Crouse's letters to Wormley from this and subsequent years indicate
substantial uncertainty and shame. Crouse repeatedly wrote of his desire to be "Regular"
while simultaneously expressing his despair of ever finding a woman he could stand to
marry. Crouse dated women and even occasionally lectured Wormley in his correspondence,
exhorting him to try harder to overcome his "abnormality." Our knowledge of Wormley's
view of the affair is limited to references in Crouse's letters because Crouse
apparently did not begin collecting his friend's correspondence until 1930, but it
appears that Wormley accepted his attraction to men much earlier than Crouse and with
somewhat less difficulty. Despite Crouse's anxieties over "the sex-stuff," the two men
professed love for one another, spent nearly all their vacations together, and talked
constantly of one day living together permanently. Eventually, Crouse came to terms with
his sexuality and despite the fact that neither man expected monogamy of the other or
practiced it himself, they enjoyed a steadfast, loving, passionate, and committed
relationship for the next four decades.</p>
<p>Throughout their association, Crouse and Wormley greatly enjoyed travelling together.
The two men toured Europe, the West Indies, Mexico, and the United States, taking
numerous photographs to record their experiences.</p>
<p>By the early 1940s, Wormley was well-known in the furniture business. His designs
garnered critical acclaim and sold extremely well: Dunbar Furniture Company had grown up
from obscurity largely thanks to his work. In 1939 Crouse was appointed head of the
newly-formed drama program at the university, and after taking a year's leave to do
graduate coursework in theater at Yale, continued to successfully direct the University
Theater and Thalian-Blackfriars. The war, however, brought a temporary change of
occupation to both men: in 1942 Wormley accepted a position as head of the furniture
division at the Office of Price Administration in Washington, while Crouse put his
belongings in storage and headed to Camp Campbell, KY for basic training. Crouse was
eventually promoted to the rank of captain, and served as Theatrical Entertainment
Director for the U.S. Army base in Greenland from 1943 to 1945.</p>
<p>When the war ended, Wormley moved to New York City and opened a private firm, Edward
Wormley and Associates, retaining Dunbar as his major client. This enabled him to
undertake large-scale remodeling and redesign projects for private clients while
continuing to produce critically lauded and commercially successful furniture designs
for Dunbar, including the 1957 Janus line, which comprised 70 items. He lectured widely
and in 1955 began teaching at the Parsons School of Design. Upon his discharge from
active duty in January 1946, Crouse returned to the University of Georgia; but in the
same year he sought and obtained a position in the drama department of Syracuse
University. Soon displeased with Syracuse, he left within a year and went to work for
Wormley. Sketches in the collection demonstrate Crouse's talent as a designer and
draftsperson, and he remained with Edward Wormley and Associates until his
retirement.</p>
<p>When Crouse came to work for Wormley, the couple realized their lifelong goal of living
together, moving into a country house in Weston, CT and adopting a series of pet corgis.
In 1968, both Crouse and Wormley retired permanently to Weston, living quietly and
traveling together until Crouse's death from cancer in 1975.</p>
<p>After Crouse died, Wormley became somewhat more reclusive, though he still saw some
friends and continued to travel. By the time of Wormley's death in 1995, his name was no
longer quite so well-known (partly due to the fact that Dunbar folded in 1993), but a
1997 exhibition of Wormley's work and the detailed accompanying catalog (a copy of which
can be found in the collection) was an important step in reintroducing Wormley and his
work to the design community. A small number of Wormley's most famous designs, including
the Teardrop Chair, Listen-to-me Chaise, and Tete-a-tete Sofa, are currently being
rereleased by a new company, DUNBAR Furniture, cementing Wormley's place in modernist
design history.</p>

<p>Edwin Griswold Nourse was born in Lockport, New York on May 20, 1883, and grew up
near Chicago, Illinois. He received undergraduate training at Lewis Institute (now
the Illinois Institute of Technology) and Cornell University, and received his Ph.D.
in Economics and Sociology from the University of Chicago in 1915; his dissertation
was published as a Hart, Schaffner and Marx prize essay under the title The Chicago
Produce Market. He was an instructor in economics and sociology before joining the
Institute of Economics to direct its agricultural studies. When the Institute became
part of the newly formed Brookings Institution in 1927, he became Director of the
Institute, and from 1942-1946 he also served as Vice President of the Brookings
Institution. In 1946 President Truman named him the first Chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers which was created by the Employment Act of 1946. He later became
Vice Chairman of the Joint Council on Economic Education. A leader in the economics
profession, he was President of the American Farm Economic Association (1924) and
the American Economic Association (1942). From 1925-1946 he was active in the Social

<p>Edward Davis Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 to December 10, 1978), better known as Ed
Wood, was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor,
who made a number of low-budget genre films and published pulp novels under various
names. Ed Wood's fiction is as strange, idiosyncratic and out of step with his times
and mores as his infamous movies. His novels inter-splice erotic segments with
lengthy philosophical, sociological and psychological discourse. Rudolph Grey's
biography "Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr." (1992) and
Tim Burton's biopic "Ed Wood," which earned two Academy Awards, brought attention to
his life and work. He died in 1978 of an alcohol-induced heart attack and has since
achieved cult status.</p>

<p>Born Eleanor Poorman in Portland in 1909, Hamilton grew up in Oregon. While a college
student, she decided to devote her life to improving women's experiences with love
and sex. After graduating from the University of Oregon in 1930, she spent a career
as an educator and psychologist in New York and California. She helped young women
get contraceptives in the 1940s, arranged private, semi-open adoptions long before
they became legal, participated in the Kinsey report on Americans' sex lives, and
studied the work of Wilhelm Reich. She wrote a sex-and-love column for Modern Bride
magazine in the 1960s, published several books (Partners in Love, Sex Before
Marriage), and talked about sexuality on television talk shows including Phil
Donahue and Johnny Carson. In 1932, she married Albert Edward Hamilton who nicknamed
her Ranger. They raised children. After he died in 1969, she moved to California and
had two relationships with women. She returned to Oregon in 1995 and died in
2008.</p>

<p>Professor of household economics and household management, New York State College of Home Economics at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Wiegand graduated from Cornell in 1938, worked several years as a home demonstration agent in county extension programs
in New York State, and returned to Cornell, receiving her M.A. (1949) and Ph.D. (1953). Her doctoral dissertation on the use of time
by New York State homemakers provided not only descriptive data but the basis for quantifying their work contributions with current data.
She was involved in teaching and research at Michigan State University for three years following completion of her Ph.D. Upon her return
to Cornell, she moved through the ranks of assistant professor (1957) to professor (1964) as an extension specialist in family economics
and home management. She was named professor emerita in 1981.</p>

<p>Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1869 to General James Biddle and the former Ellen McGowen, Ellen McGowen Shipman went on to become one of the leading landscape architects of the first half of the 20th Century.
Shipman left Radcliff after one year and married Louis Shipman an aspiring playwright. The two lived for a time in Plainfield, New Hampshire near the Cornish Artist Colony that had grown up around the sculptor Augstus Saint-Gaudens.
It was here that Shipman was influenced by a group of artist gardeners and also where she would meet the landscape architect Charles Adams Platt. After her marriage dissolved in 1910, Shipman went on to collaborate with Platt for a number of years, eventually creating her
own practice and moving to Beekman Place in New York City in 1920. While the 1920s were the busiest for Shipman, with commissions decreasing dramatically in the depression years of the 1930s, Shipman would design gardens from her townhouse overlooking the East River for the next 30 years.
The majority of her designs were done in the English style but she is most noted for her use of "painting" the landscape with plants and flowers as well as her use of border plantings to create a sense of
private space. It is unfortunate that since many of her commissions were for grand estates and her plantings particularly labor intensive to maintain, many had disappeared within her own lifetime and very few of have survived to the present day.
Examples of her existing gardens include the Edison and Ford Winter Estate in Fort, Myers, Florida and Stan Hywet Hall in Akron, Ohio. Ellen McGown Shipman died in March, 1950.

In 1863-1864 she worked in a large camp for freed slaves in Arlington, Virginia, teaching them to read and write. With her father's aid, she opened an African-American school in 1867 at Heathsville, Virginia. She continued throughout her life to support this and other African-American schools in the South. In 1882 she took over the Sherwood select school until it was taken over by the New York Board of Regents in 1927. Howland was also active in reform movements such as women's suffrage, and peace and temperance organizations. Her niece, Isabel Howland, daughter of William and Hanna

<head>ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY</head>
<p>Incorporated in 1990 as the result of a merger between two statewide organizations: the
New York State Lesbian and Gay Lobby based in Albany, and FAIRPAC based in New York
City. The Empire State Pride Agenda is a political organization that lobbies the New
York State government for legal protection and equal rights for lesbians, gay men, and
bisexuals. Libby Post and Mark D'Alessio were the Pride Agenda's first co-chairs of the
Board, and Richard D. Dadey, Jr., the first executive director (following Lisa Parrish
as acting executive director for three months). The new organization was more successful
at fundraising. </p>
<p>Maintaining offices both in Albany and New York City, the first issue the Pride Agenda
tackled was the creation of a New York City council district drawn in a way that
included enough gay and lesbian supportive voters to make the election of a lesbian or
gay city councilperson a possibility. This was achieved in 1991.</p>
<p>The Pride Agenda adopts legislative agendas each year and has lobbied on the state level
for a bias-related violence bill, a civil rights bill, and a domestic partnership bill.
The organization endorses pro-gay candidates for local and state office, and remains
active in New York City politics. In July 1998, New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani
signed into law legislation recognizing domestic partners in New York City.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE AND CHRONOLOGY</head>
<p>Ezra Cornell was born on January 11, 1807 at Westchester Landing in the town and
county of Westchester, New York. His parents, Elijah and Eunice, were members of the
Society of Friends, and Ezra and his ten younger siblings were raised as Quakers.
During his childhood, Cornell lived in Westchester, Tarrytown, and Westfarms in
Winchester County, and in English Neighborhood, Bergen County, before the family
settled in DeRuyter, New York. Opportunities for formal education were limited. From
the age of thirteen to seventeen Cornell attended school three months each
winter.</p>
<p>From the time he was six years old, Cornell helped in whatever way he could in his
father's pottery business. At age twelve, he began to work on the family farm in
DeRuyter, and at seventeen learned carpentry skills when his father erected a new
building for the pottery. In 1825 Cornell constructed a two story house for his
parents and family.</p>
<p>Cornell left home in the spring of 1826. He found work in Syracuse as a journeyman
carpenter. He helped build sawmills and worked as a contractor getting out timber
for shipment by canal. From Syracuse he moved on to Homer, New York where he worked
in a shop that produced wool-carding machinery. In his free time, he studied
mechanics handbooks.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1828 Cornell arrived in Ithaca, the town he would make his permanent
home. He first found work as a carpenter, before being hired as a mechanic by Otis
Eddy to work at his cotton mill on Cascadilla Creek. On Eddy's recommendation,
Jeremiah S. Beebe then hired Cornell to repair and overhaul his plaster and flour
mills on Fall Creek. During Cornell's long association with Beebe he designed and
built a tunnel for a new mill race on Fall Creek, a stone dam on Fall Creek (forming
Beebe lake) and a new flour mill. By 1832, he was in charge of all Beebe's concerns
at Fall Creek.</p>
<p>Ezra Cornell married Mary Ann Wood on March 19, 1831. He bargained with Beebe for a
building lot and acreage for a garden and orchard at Fall Creek where he built a one
and a half story frame house. In this house, the <emph render="italic">Nook,</emph>
Cornell and Mary Ann began housekeeping in the summer of 1831. The <emph render="italic">Nook</emph> remained their home for more than twenty years and
nine children were born there. Of these, three sons died in infancy and the eldest
daughter died at fifteen. Three sons and two daughters were raised to adulthood.</p>
<p>In the 1830's, Ezra Cornell also became active in local politics and speculated in
real estate. As Ithaca's prosperity began to decline in the late 1830's, Beebe and
other prominent Ithaca businessmen decided to send a representative to New York City
and New England to lay before capitalists and manufacturers the advantages of Ithaca
as a manufacturing site, particularly for cotton and woolen mills. A firm believer
in Ithaca's potential as center for trade and industry, Cornell made the trips East
representing Ithaca in 1840 and 1841.</p>
<p>When Beebe sold his milling concerns in 1839 and 1840, Cornell left his employment
and turned to farming. He had an interest in sheep raising and in agricultural
experimentation. After several years of farming Cornell looked to other ways to make
a living. In 1842 he purchased the patent for the states of Maine and Georgia for
Barnaby and Mooers side hill plow. He hoped to make a profit by selling the patent
rights county by county to machinists or merchants who would manufacture and sell
the plows locally. In the spring of 1842 he left for Maine. After several months of
traveling and selling in Maine, Cornell returned to Ithaca for a brief visit before
leaving for Georgia in January of 1843. Cornell did not meet with a great deal of
success in this business, but made the most of his travels as he passed (often on
foot) throughout the counties of Maine and Georgia. He recorded keen observations of
the land, the people, and the industries.</p>
<p>Through his meeting with F.O.J. Smith, editor of the <title>Maine Farmer,</title>
Cornell became associated with the infant telegraph industry. Following the
appropriation by the U.S. Congress of $30,000 for the laying of a test telegraph
cable between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Smith had taken a contract from the
inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse, to lay the lead pipe which enclosed the telegraph
wires. In the summer of 1843, on his second trip to Maine, Cornell visited Smith's
office and found him struggling to design a machine to lay the cable underground. At
Smith's request, Cornell created a machine that would both dig the trench and lay
the cable. Samuel F. B. Morse came to Maine for a demonstration of the machine. He
approved of it and Cornell was hired to lay the cable for the test line. Although it
was eventually decided to string the cable on poles, this introduction to the
telegraph convinced Cornell of the value and potential of the technology referred to
as "lightning." His belief in its success led to decades of involvement in the
industry. As construction foreman, operator, promoter, superintendent, builder,
owner, and stockholder Cornell helped the telegraph expand from the eastern seaboard
into the midwest.</p>
<p>Reinvestment of all earnings and endless work and travel kept Cornell on the verge of
poverty and exhaustion for years, but his belief in the telegraph was steadfast.
With the consolidation of lines into the Western Union Company in 1855, Cornell was
in a position to appreciate profit. At the age of forty-nine, he decided to withdraw
from further telegraph line building and active management, but his faith in the
success of the telegraph continued and he held on to the Western Union stock from
which his fortune would come. For years he was the largest stockholder of the
Western Union Company.</p>
<p>Returning to Ithaca, Ezra Cornell again became actively involved in farming and
politics. In 1857 he purchased a farm of about 300 acres adjoining the village of
Ithaca. He moved his family there and named the farm Forest Park. He planted
orchards, conducted agricultural experiments, and raised shorthorn cattle and sheep.
He was an active member of the New York State Agricultural Society, and as President
of this organization attended the International Exposition in London. Cornell and
his wife also made an extensive tour of England, Scotland, Wales and Europe. He was
elected to the New York State Legislature in 1862 and served six years, two on the
Assembly and four years as Senator. His greatest concerns in the Legislature were
agriculture and education.</p>
<p>Ezra Cornell's increasing fortune and determination to put the money to some good use
led him to various acts of philanthropy. He established the Cornell Public Library,
which opened in Ithaca in 1866. His interest in public education and acquaintance
with Andrew Dickson White focused his philanthropy on education and led to the
establishment of Cornell University, which opened to students in 1868. Cornell
applied the same commitment and determination that had led to his success in the
telegraph industry to the planning of the University. From his active involvement in
the use of the college land scrip available through the Morrill Act to the design of
the campus buildings, Cornell never ceased his efforts to create a great
university.</p>

<p>Before the Methodist Episcopal Church was built and opened in 1828-29, several different circuit preachers served the church organization in Ovid. Prior to 1820, Ovid was a charge on the Seneca circuit, but in 1820 it appears in the General Assembly records as a distinct appointment served by Rev. William Fowler. He formed the first class in the same year, consisting of eight people, one of whom was a black women named Lydia Demond. The Methodist Church at Sheldrake was under the same administration until about 1887 (not represented in this collection). Similarly, in 1836 and 1837 Ovid and Trumansburg villages united on the Seneca cir-cuit as a single charge. Until 1858-59 the Methodist Episcopal Church at Ovid was in the Geneva District, but was moved to the Elmira District shortly afterward, then moved back to Geneva in 1860-61, and moved yet again to Elmira in 1863. In 1876 the church went into debt $9,010, but managed to pay it off by October 1877.</p>

<p>On February 13, 1842 residents of Corning and vicinity who belonged to the Baptist Church of Campbell and Erwin requested that they be given leave to form themselves as a separate church. The request was granted and on August 24, 1842 a council was convened and the church was organized with 24 members. For the first few years the congregation met in the Episcopal Church, in the members' homes, in a hall rented for 50 cents a meeting, or in the Methodist chapel. A house of worship, begun in 1849, was dedicated on May 8, 1850. There is a gap in the records from May 4, 1861 until January 2, 1864, indicating perhaps the effects the war had on those at home.

apparently organized in 1821 and in 1822 built a log meeting house on West Hill
which was destroyed by fire in 1833. In 1835 a frame church was built. In this
building the church worshipped until 1842, when the membership divided into four
parts. This church, which remained with the house of worship, was known as the First
Baptist Church of Prattsburg. Before the division the church was quite prosperous
and had a membership of 209 in 1838. This was the result of a revival in 1837 under
the leadership of Rev. T.S. Sheardown. Over 100 were added to the church that year,
98 by baptism. After 1842 each part of the church declined and only one, the Baptist
Church of Prattsburg Village (Collection #6135) survived. The First Church survived
only 5 or 6 years and eventually sold the meeting house to the Methodists. The

<p>The First Congregational Church of Christ in Danby was organized as a Presbyterian church in 1807 based on the "Plan of Union." The Presbyterian form of government was dropped in 1867, and the Congregational form took its place. The early records refer to the church as the Congregational Church in Spencer, New York. The church building was erected in 1820, and in 1879 was the oldest building in Danby. A Sabbath school was opened in 1828.</p>

As a part of the Plan of Union, the church was under the care of the Lyons Presbytery until it fully adopted a Presbyterian governance structure in 1891 when its name changed to "The First Presbyterian Church of Marion." As early as 1835, this church had passed anti-slavery and temperance resolutions making breach of these causes for exclusion from membership.</p>

<p>The First Congregational Church of Augusta and Easton (or Eastown) was organized on November 28, 1802 by the Presbyterian missionary Reverend Jedediah Chapman. Later as town and county boundaries changed, it was clled the First Congregational Church of Augusta and Gorham, and by 1868 called the First Congregational Church of Rushville in Yates County. It belonged to the Ontario Association of Congregational Churches and Minsters until that organization dissolved in 1813, and then joined with the Presbytery of Geneva until 1855. On March 20th of the same year, an ecclesiastical Council of Congregational ministers was called to install a new pastor. Twenty-nine members lodged a protest against these proceedings on the grounds that such action was illegal and in contempt of the Geneva Presbytery. Subsequently on May 5, 1855 the church resolved to dissolve its connection with the
Presbytery and in 1865 delegates were appointed to the National Council of Congregational Churches.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1799 public notice was given for a meeting to be held on January 2, 1800 to elect trustees for a "Presbyterian Church to be established in the village of Lyons in the town of Sodus." Services were first held in a farm and later in a storehouse which was moved to a lot "set aside for gospel purposes." On October 23, 1809 Rev. John Lindsley, a missionary of the General Assembly organized the church further, and the session began meeting. Until 1820 the original name of the First Presbyterian Church in Sodus was retained. At that time the legislature was petitioned to change the name to the First Presbyterian Church and Society of Lyons.</p>

church was founded until 1870. The early Presbyterians had joined the Congregational
Church for worship. Early in 1870 the congregation of this church had outgrown the
church building, so property for a new building was purchased on March 16, 1870.
During meetings held on April 26th and May 2nd it was decided to make the new church
Presbyterian. Until the completion of the new building in 1871, services were held

<p>The church was organized July 1, 1811 in Knoxsville as the Presbyterian Church of Painted Post, and admitted to the Presbytery of Geneva in 1812. The ultimate result of at least two subsequent changes in Presbytery boundaries was the church's membership in the Chemung Presbytery. In 1843, the congregation's name was changed to the present one. Considerable controversy involving a temperance resolution, discussion of church governance, structure and personal differences among the membership resulted in the dismission of forty-six members who organized and built a second church in 1845, again called the Presbyterian Church of Painted Post. The two churches were reunited by act of the Presbytery in 1849, but evidently continued to worship separately. During the winter of 1863-1864 a revival assisted by the Evangelist Rev. O. Parker increased membership and helped finance the
construction of a stone church which was completed in 1867.</p>

<p>The First Religious Society Compact of Middletown formed by thirteen settlers in 1800
was the first church in the area now known as Naples. Religious services were held
as early as 1789, and the first ordained minister visited the area in 1792. The
impetus for the formation of the society came in 1796 when Reverend Bushnell
conducted a series of revivals. The officiating ceremony held in 1800 upon
organization of the church was conducted by a visiting missionary, the Reverend
Samuel Fuller. At this time, the church acknowledged itself a member of the Ontario
Association. The church was without a denominational name due probably to the
differing views of the members although it was entered on early county records as
Congregational. In 1815 the Geneva Presbytery was formed uniting various
organizations including the Ontario Association. Upon entrance into this presbytery,
the church adopted a presbyterian form of church government. In 1824 the first
church building was erected. In 1850 another church was built in a more central
place. This was destroyed by fire in 1874. A third building was erected and the

<p>On March 27, 1843 a portion of the congregation of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Seneca Falls seceeded and organized the First Wesleyan Society of Seneca Falls at the school house. They built a church costing $1770 on a lot costing $600 at the corner of Hynderse and Fall Streets. That same year, many congregationalists who had joined the Presbyterian Church after their church had disbanded, withdrew over the question of American slavery and joined the Wesleyan church. In 1852 an effort was made to revive the Congregational church, and Rev. B.F. Bradford, who had served the Wesleyan church for 3 years was called to the pastorate. For a year and a half the group worshipped in the concert Hall, but Mr. Bradford's health was impaired, and the group disbanded. Most of the group returned to the Wesleyan congregation where they remained until 1869 when Rev. Lyle, the minister,
left the Wesleyans after being foiled in an attempt to transform that church into a Congregational church. Mr. and Mrs. Jabez Matthews and Abram Failing were prominent members who went back and forth between the two groups. The Congregational group called themselves the First Congregational Church of Seneca Falls, and met in the Good Templar's Hall in December 1869 with 63 members.</p>
<p> The split left the Wesleyans with only 60 members down from a high of 200 in 1862, but by 1875 the church was strong enough to dedicate a new church, valued at $14,500. The Sunday School was active, and the church possessed a library of 550 volumes. </p>

<p>On Oct. 3, 1970, around 100 people turned out for the first meeting of what was to become in
1973 the Gay Alliance of the Genesee Valley – an event hosted by University of Rochester
students Bob Osborn and Larry Fine with guest speakers from Cornell University, Ithaca’s chapter
of the national Gay Liberation Front, and the Buffalo chapter of the national Mattachine
Society, The new group called itself the Rochester Gay Liberation Front, the Rochester chapter
of a group that started in N.Y.C., at Cornell and at University of Rochester after the Stonewall
Riots in 1969. During the first year of the group’s existence, around 200 men and women, the
majority of whom were non-students attended meetings and dances.</p>
<p>Because the majority of members were non-students, the Gay Liberation Front had left the
University of Rochester campus in 1972. Later the Gay Alliance moved into a space in the Genesee
Co-op, a renovated 19th century firehouse on Monroe Ave., where it stayed until a building at
179 Atlantic Ave. was purchased in 1990 to serve as the first Community Center.</p>
<p>In February 1973, a group of lesbians within the GAGV decided to split off and form their own
group, GROW (Gay Radical Organization for Women), which became the Lesbian Resource Center
(LRC), active until the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Gay lawyers and others helped to incorporate the GAGV by 1973, with the idea that the Alliance
would be an umbrella organization for gay groups. The Speakers Bureau was founded by Karen
Hagberg in 1970. The Bureau’s goal was to seek an accurate portrayal of gays in the media and to
educate community groups about gay and lesbian people. Its efforts continue today.</p>
<p>The Empty Closet, which had begun its existence as a four-page ditto in January 1971, went to
mimeograph in 1973, the first in a long series of format changes and technical upgrades, which
continue to this day.</p>
<p>The mid ’80s was the time when the HIV/AIDS epidemic became the central gay male issue, and in
Rochester as elsewhere, gay men (as well as lesbians and bi and transgender men and women) began
the work of building grassroots organizations, like AIDS Rochester and Helping People with AIDS,
to cope with the crisis locally and supply services for people living with HIV</p>
<p>The first Rochester Pride March took place on June 28, 1989. The Pride March, now the Pride
Parade, continues today as a program of the Gay Alliance. By the late ’80s, the GAGV began to be
seen as a service organization or human services agency, and the long process of transition
began. Simultaneously, the Rochester queer community was growing and expanding its horizons. The
Gay Alliance of the ‘80s began its emphasis on working with queer youth, who previously had no
support whatsoever. The needs of the growing community meant that the GAGV had to become more of
an institution than a grassroots activist organization.</p>
<p>The first big issue of the ’90s involving the GAGV was the fight for domestic partnership
benefits for City of Rochester employees and their partners. The Alliance under the leadership
of Lloyd Gray was part of a coalition of gay groups and individuals, and heterosexual allies,
who led an intense campaign in 1994 to pass the legislation. City Council approved the measure
after a heated debate. Also in 1994, the GAGV won its lawsuit against the City of Rochester,
which had denied the non-profit group tax exemption. As a non-profit, the Gay Alliance primarily
does social and cultural work and in the ‘90s it began to do its political work in a different
way. The new mission statement made it clear that the agency is dedicated to empowering
individuals and dealing with heterosexism and homophobia through education, support groups and
advocating for an end to discrimination </p>
<p>Over the past decade the organization has shifted focus from grassroots political activism to
the realities of creating a permanent community institution. In 2004, the Alliance moved from
the tiny, outgrown Atlantic Ave. storefront to space at the Auditorium Center, 875 E. Main St.
The Gay Alliance staff has grown over the years, enabling a dozen major programs to spring up
which strive to meet the needs of everyone from teenagers to hate crime victims to families to
elders. The Youth Group observes the Day of Silence each year and now takes youth on local
college tours, as well as providing all kinds of supportive and empowering social activities and
groups. Rainbow SAGE is in the process of becoming part of the Gay Alliance, in order to make
its services to our elders as powerful and effective as possible. Trainings, InQueery events and
Speakers Bureau presentations send our message throughout greater Rochester, to mainstream
businesses, colleges, churches and service providers, as well as to LGBT individuals who need
information, support and connection to their community. </p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Professor Emeritus G. Coleman Woodbury, age 91, passed away on August 27, 1994 after a long and very distinguished career as a teacher, researcher, and activist in planning, housing, and urban problems. </p>
<p>Professor Woodbury was a Northwestern University Ph.D. and Rhodes Scholar. As a student of the pioneering land economist Richard Ely, Professor Woodbury became interested in housing, and in 1931 became Executive Secretary of the Illinois Housing Commission. The work of that commission led to legislation enabling Illinois cities to establish housing authorities to build housing for low income persons. </p>
<p>In 1933 he became Associate Director of the National Association of Housing Officials, and joined a group of distinguished housing reformers who worked to bring about federal funding for low income housing. Professor Woodbury was one of the three-person team that drafted the legislation that established the nation's public housing program (Housing Act of 1937). He was also a member of the first advisory counsel to the Federal Housing Administration. </p>
<p>Subsequently, he worked with the National Resources Planning Board, and during World War II served as Assistant Administrator of the National Housing Agency, which facilitated construction of housing to support the war effort. </p>
<p>From 1948 to 1951 Professor Woodbury directed the Urban Development Study producing an influential and critical two-volume evaluation of the nation's urban problems and approaches for dealing with them. This study became a classic in the field of urban problems and city planning. </p>
<p>After World War II Woodbury came to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he remained, except for three years as Charles D. Norton Professor of Regional Planning at Harvard. Initially in Political Science, he continued the seminar established by John M. Gaus. He became chairman of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning when it was established in 1962. His search for an appropriate role for government in dealing with housing and other urban problems was the focus of his teaching. His wide experience and narrative style gave professional students a clear awareness of the nature of city politics. </p>
<p>In 1966 President Johnson appointed Woodbury to the National Committee on Urban Problems, chaired by Senator Paul Douglas. It studied reforms in low-income housing programs, zoning and other land-use controls in building and housing codes, and taxes affecting housing. Its 1968 report,

<title>Building the American City</title>, made a number of bold recommendations for dealing with problems of poverty and race in metropolitan areas. Woodbury was called by Lloyd Rodwin of MIT "one of the ablest and most respected of this country's housing and planning experts." He was an unusually effective, applied academic in the Progressive tradition of the Midwest.</p>

<p>The first George Clarke of record was born in England in the early 17th century. His
grandson, also named George, born 1676, was appointed Secretary of the Province of
New York in 1703. In 1724, he and his wife, Anne Hyde, purchased land in Hempstead,
Long Island and built an estate named Hyde Park. He was Acting Governor of New York
from 1736-1743, and during this time acquired over 120,000 acres of land. George's
children did not remain in New York; his eldest son returned to England, two other
children had close ties with Jamaica, and another died on an expedition to Oswego in
the mid-eighteenth century. In 1806, George Hyde Clarke (b. 1768) settled in New
York on lands he and his brother inherited from their grandfather and great uncle.
Some of his tenants contested his claim to the land, resulted in a six year legal
battle which the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Clarke's favor in 1818 (JACKSON VS.
CLARKE). Documents Clarke accumulated concerning this case are included in the
collection. In 1817 Clarke purchased land on the north shore of Otsego Lake, near
Cooperstown, New York, and engaged architect Philip Hooker to design Hyde Hall. The
last years of his life were spent constructing and furnishing Hyde Hall. His son,
George Hyde Clarke (b. 1822), was one of the largest landowners in the state, but
suffered a reversal of fortune when his crop speculations suddenly failed. He
eventually went bankrupt, and Hyde Hall fell into disrepair.</p>
<p>His son, George Hyde Clarke (b. 1858), bought Hyde Hall and became a gentleman
farmer. After Clarke's death in 1914, his son, George Hyde Clarke (b. 1889), also
became a gentleman farmer, residing at Hyde Hall. In 1963, Hyde Hall and the
surrounding 600 acres were purchased by the state, and became Glimmerglass State
Park. When plans were made to demolish the mansion, the Friends of Hyde Hall formed
to preserve the building, its furnishings, and papers. Hyde Hall is currently
maintained by the Friends of Hyde Hall, and is undergoing restoration through
funding provided by the New York State Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>

<p>George W. Remaily was a viticulturist, notably of winter hardy table grapes. He studied at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1933-35 and was known as a landscape artist before he was recognized as a viticulturist. In the 1960s he moved with his wife to Hammondsport N.Y. from Bucks County, Pa., in order to continue grape breeding experiments and to collaborate with staff at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, N.Y. Over the course of his life and well into his 80s, he collected over 2000 cultivars on both his Pennsylvania and New York properties to use for his many crosses. The focus of his work was crossing Vinifera seedless table grapes varieties with native seedless varieties in order to create winter hardy seedless table grapes. This accomplishment was a first in viticulture. His vineyard had a large collection of American, Asian and European hybrids, comprising a collection of root stock used throughout the world. For many years, he was
associated with the Experiment Station at Geneva, where a vast collection of his originations were evaluated, resulting in such named varieties as Einsett Seedless, Marquis (currently in Stark catalog), and Remaily Seedless. During his tenure with the station, as the leading authority on indigenous species, he was invited to write a paper for the United Nations defining grape germ plasm.</p>

<p>Gerard Hendrik Matthes was born on March 16, 1874, in Amsterdam,
Holland. He and his twin brother, Francois Emile, travelled to the United
States in 1891 to attend M.I.T. In 1895 Gerard became a draftsman and
instrumentman with Alexis H. French, the Town Engineer for Brookline,
Massachusetts. Gerard became a naturalized citizen in 1896. His appointment
with the U.S. Government as Hydrographic Aid, U.S. Geological Survey in 1897
started an association with government service that lasted forty-five years.
Francois became the Chief Topographer for the U.S. Geological Survey. Gerard
Matthes' projects included an investigation of the sources of pollution and
power potential of the Potomac River in 1897. In 1898 he was sent to
southeastern Colorado to make plane table surveys of reservoir sites and learn
about irrigation practices. He did a topographical survey of reservoir sites
and much mapping of Colorado and Arizona in 1899.</p>
<p>In 1901 Matthes went on an expedition to Sumatra to observe a solar
eclipse. In 1902 he was in charge of the computation division of the Water
Resources Branch and helped in designing the first hydroelectric plant on the
Susquehanna River. Also in 1902, he was selected by the Secretary of the
Department of the Interior as the first Commissioner of the Reclamation
Service. The need for construction of public works in the Oklahoma Territory
brought him to Oklahoma in 1903 as the municipal engineer. In 1904 he married
Mary Bewick. The first irrigation storage dam was completed by the Reclamation
Service in 1906. Matthes resigned from the Reclamation Service and accepted a
position with the Colorado Power Company. He was appointed Division Engineer
for the Pennsylvania Water Commission in 1914, and was in charge of flood
inventory. In 1915 he joined the staff of the Miami Conservancy District in
Ohio.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the first water resources investigation for
improvement of navigation, control of floods, development of hydroelectric
power, and utilization of mineral resources in 1920. Along with the Tennessee
Valley Authority Matthes first used aerial photography in this investigation.
In 1923 he became a consultant for Fairchild Aerial Surveys, Inc. in New York
City. He was appointed to the Committee on Photographic Surveying of the Board
of Survey and Maps of the Federal Government in 1925.</p>
<p>As a U.S. Army Engineer Matthes was sent to Norfolk, Virginia in 1929.
Along with General Ferguson, President of the Mississippi River Commission,
Matthes, as Principal Engineer, took an inspection trip of the Mississippi
River in 1932. In 1936 the largest hydraulic river model was built by the
Waterways Experiment Station and in 1942 Matthes was made first Civilian
Director of this department. He was made Water Consultant for President
Roosevelt's National Resources Committee in 1936. As a consultant about flood
control to the U.S. Army, Matthes was sent to Dennison, Texas in 1943. Also in
1943 Matthes was made an honorary member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers who also awarded him the Norman Medal in 1950. In 1945 he retired
from federal service. Until 1953 Matthes remained president of the Rocky
Mountain Hydraulic Laboratory at Allenspark, Colorado. He also continued to be
a consultant for private and corporate projects until he died on March 3,
1959.</p>

<p>Gladys Adelina Lewis was born in Los Angeles on May 23, 1891 and died
in 1975 in San Francisco. She was a writer and forceful personality who lived
in Paris, New York, San Francisco, Hollywood, and Portland, Oregon, moving in
artistic and queer circles in the first half of the twentieth century. The
child of a prominent Los Angeles family, Lewis was the guinea pig for her
mother Selma's experimental and, at the time, well-publicized child-rearing
methods, which included mandatory reading of Byron, vigorous exercise, and a
stringent diet. Lewis published a poem in a local Los Angeles newspaper at age
nine, and at thirteen a poem she wrote attracted the attention of American poet
Ella Wheeler Wilcox. From that early age she went on to write fiction, poetry,
musicals, and film scripts, using the pseudonyms Georges Lewys and Serge G.
Wolsey. Lewis achieved notoriety with
<title>The Temple of Pallas-Athenae</title> (which she claimed to have
written at age nineteen), a defense of eugenics which violated contemporary
obscenity laws and was subsequently banned from the mails.
<title>Call House Madam</title> (1942), a fictionalized tell-all of
Hollywood madam Lee Francis, suffered the same fate, but was reprinted and
reissued numberous times for 20 years. Lewis' collection of poetry,
<title>The Epic of Verdun and Ballads of France</title>, was enshrined
with great pomp and ceremony in the war monument at Verdun in 1931, a publicity
stunt that Lewis herself masterminded.</p>
<p>Lewis was a prolific writer and a shameless self-promoter. She honored
libraries world-wide with presentation copies of her books; her correspondence
includes letters showing that she nominated herself for the Nobel Prize; she
was given the Key to the City of San Francisco in 1935; she adored photographic
portraits of herself; she embellished; and she died in obscurity. In life, she
was best known for frank works that sorely tried American attitudes about sex,
and for a litigious streak that frequently placed her in court, most notably on
the losing end of a $1,250,000 plagarism lawsuit against Eugene O'Neill. In
numberous interviews included in the collection, Lewis refers to herself as a
classicist, but the breadth of her work reveals a truly multi-faceted artist,
with early poetry published in
<title>Pagan</title> magazine demonstrating a deciededly modern and
experimental slant. Additionally, Lewis was a patriot, and staunch defender of
Allied forces; there are many rousing war poems in her early work. As much
interested in monetary gain and fame as she was in literary virtuosity, Lewis'
archive includes drafts for scores of films and plays intended to appeal to the
masses, many of them rendered not saleable by racy content. Later work
documents Lewis' exploration of gender role reversals and the sexual subculture
of the 1940s and 1950s. A self-identified lesbian, at least in later life,
Lewis' papers provide valuable insight to the large but mostly invisible queer
community of the straitlaced post-war years, and her writings on the
psychoanalytic theories of the day serve to illuminate some of the birth pains
of that system of ideas.</p>

<p>Gretchen Phillips was born on July 19, 1963, in Galveston, Texas. She attended
Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, where she formed her first
band, The Folk Group, with Sara Hickman. In 1981, Gretchen moved to Austin, Texas,
which was home to a burgeoning punk scene. In 1982, she co-founded the all-female
band Suffer Jets (with Mellissa Cobb, Teresa Taylor, and Edith Frost), and wrote
"The Queer Song." That same year, Gretchen attended the Michigan Womyn's Music
Festival for the first time. When the Suffer Jets broke up in 1983, Gretchen formed
Meat Joy with Teresa Taylor and John Hawkes (nee Perkins). Within a few months,
Teresa would leave to join the Butthole Surfers. That same year, Gretchen wrote a
parodic country song titled "I Spent My Last Ten Dollars (on Birth Control and
Beer)," which would later become a college radio favorite. She returned to the
Michigan Womyn's music festival as a worker in the worker's kitchen, a role she
would continue to fulfill until the festival ended in 2014. In 1985, Gretchen joined
the all-female rock band Girls in the Nose, which was led by lesbian folklorist and
artist Kay Turner. She also co-founded Two Nice Girls, a folk-tinged band that
featured Laurie Freelove and Kathy Korniloff. Both bands were explicitly lesbian.
Two Nice Girls toured the US and Canada many times throughout the late 1980s and
early 1990s. In 1987, Two Nice Girls played the first South by Southwest music
festival. In 1988, they signed with Rough Trade records and released 2 Nice Girls
(1989), Like a Version (1990), and chloe liked olivia (1991). In 1991, they received
a GLAAD Media Award for positive portrayals of homosexuality. Also in 1991, Gretchen
became lovers with English professor and cultural critic Ann Cvetkovich, whose
writing focuses on some of the same themes that animate Gretchen's own work:
feelings, pleasure, and community. After Two Nice Girls broke up in 1992, Gretchen
continued to grow as a musician and multimedia artist. In 1993, Girls in the Nose
played for an estimated 1,000,000 people at the March on Washington for Lesbian,
Gay, and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. Gretchen's subsequent musical projects have
included the country gospel band Gretchen Phillips Ministries, the eclectic dyke/fag
duo Phillips and Driver (with Dave Driver), rock bands such as The Gretchen Phillips
Xperience and Lord Douglas Phillips (with Terri Lord and Darcee Douglas), as well
as Gretchen's Disco Plague (It's Infectious!), an improvisational disco group with a
rotating cast of players that includes Jenny Hoyston from Erase Errata and Thor
Harris (Swans, Stick People).</p>

<p>G. William Skinner was born in Oakland, California, in 1925. From 1942-43, he attended
Deeps Springs College (California), then joined the Navy V-12 Program at Missouri Valley
College for two years before completing 18 months of instruction in Chinese at the U.S. Navy
Oriental Language School at the University of Colorado. He then completed his Bachelor's
degree at Cornell University (1946-47) with Distinction in Far Eastern Studies.</p>
<p>Skinner then went on to pursue doctoral studies in anthropology at Cornell University, with
an interest in market towns and their regions in China. He began fieldwork at Gaodianzi,
near Chengdu, Sichuan Province, in 1949, but this was disrupted when the Communists won the
civil war in China. Skinner was forced to leave his fieldsite in January, 1950, and was
confined to Chengdu until August, when he was allowed to leave China.</p>
<p>With the closing of China, Skinner shifted his attention to Chinese communities in
Southeast Asia, with an initial field survey conducted in 1950. This was followed by a
doctoral project on the Chinese of Thailand, completed in 1954 while he was also Field
Director of the Cornell Southeast Asia Program in Bangkok (1951-55). Subsequently, he joined
the Cornell Modern Indonesia Project as a Research Associate, and was in Indonesia from
1956-58 to conduct research on the Chinese of Indonesia and oversee related projects. </p>
<p>From 1958-60, Skinner was Assistant Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, before
returning to Cornell as Associate Professor of Anthropology (1960-62) and then Professor of
Anthropology (1962-65). It was during this time (1964-65) that he published his much
celebrated "Marketing and Social Structure in Rural China" as three articles in successive
issues of the Journal of Asian Studies, which established him as a preeminent scholar of
China.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Skinner was appointed Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University
(1965-89) and the University of California, Davis (1990-2005). He was also President of the
Association of Asian Studies in 1983. Besides being noted as an eminent anthropologist of
China, Skinner was best known for his work on the dynamics of social structure and space,
which he applied to the study of China, Japan and France using geographic information system
techniques. His work on hierarchical regional systems was also instrumental in the shaping
of the China Historical Geographic Information System, which provides a database of
populated places and historical administrative units throughout Chinese history.</p>
<p>The Skinner papers deposited with Cornell University mainly come from the Southeast Asia
phase of his career. These include research materials collected for his seminal works on the
Chinese of Thailand and Indonesia. These materials not only informed Skinner's understanding
of Chinese culture and kinship dynamics, but also demonstrated his early interest in mapping
sociological data onto geographical frameworks.</p>

<p>Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) was among the most prominent physicists of the twentieth
century, most famous for his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II, and for
his Nobel prize-winning work on solar energy (1967).</p>
<p>Physicist, Cornell University professor of physics, Nobel laureate.</p>
<p>Born in Strasbourg, Bethe studied physics at Frankfurt and under Arnold Sommerfeld at
the University of Munich. In 1930 he received a fellowship to Cambridge. He began his
professional career at universities in Germany, and also worked with Enrico Fermi in
Rome in the early 1930's. Although Bethe did not consider himself a Jew, his mother had
Jewish ancestry, and thus he was removed from his university position at Tuebingen under
the Nuremberg laws once Hitler came to power. He emigrated first to a position at
Manchester, and then to Cornell University in 1935, where he would teach for the rest of
his career.</p>
<p>In his early years at Cornell, Bethe formulated his theory of how stars produce energy,
an achievement that would win him the Nobel Prize in 1967. Further notable
accomplishments included his work on the Lamb Shift, his famous three-part summary of
nuclear physics, and his post-retirement collaboration with Gerry Brown on supernovae
and neutrinos.</p>
<p>During World War II, he headed the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National
Laboratory as part of the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. Despite his
concerns about escalating the nuclear arms race, he assisted in the development of the
Hydrogen bomb in the 1950's. Through these experiences, he became a vocal adversary of
the nuclear arms race and control, opposing programs such as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, and arguing in favor of anti-proliferation and test ban treaties, including
SALT I and II. He was also an impassioned supporter of nuclear power as a solution to
American energy needs. He was involved in policy throughout his adult life, as a science
advisor to several presidents, as someone who frequently testified before Congress on
issues of scientific importance, and as an advocate for the role of scientists in public
affairs.</p>
<p>He also performed extensive consulting work for the U.S. government and American labs,
such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)
and the Oakridge and Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. He also did consulting work for
businesses such as Avco. Such consulting work generally related either to nuclear
energy, or to defense.</p>
<p>After immigrating to the United States, he reconnected with Rose Ewald, daughter of his
earlier physics mentor, Peter Paul Ewald. They married in 1939, and had two children,
Henry and Monica. He retired from Cornell in 1975, but continued his astrophysics
research and continued to be an expert on thermonuclear processes, shock waves, and
neutrino reactions.</p>
<p>Bethe died at age 98 in 2005, having continued to participate in scientific study and
policy until late in his life.</p>

<p>Harland Bartholomew was born near Boston, Massachusetts in 1889 in the community of
Stoneham, though his family moved shortly thereafter to a farm in New Hampshire. Although he
enrolled in Rutgers civil engineering program, due to lack of funds, Bartholomew left after
two years. He obtained work at the New York District of the Corps of Engineers then with
E.P. Goodrich, a civil engineer active in the "city efficient" approach to city planning.
There, Bartholomew was assigned to Newark, New Jersey, where he would be involved in
preparing a city plan. Next, Bartholomew worked as a consultant and wrote about the new
field of American city planning. In 1915, he moved to St. Louis, where he was hired to
prepare a comprehensive city plan. By 1919, Bartholomew had enough expertise to found
Harland Bartholomew Associates and hired architects, civil engineers and landscape
architects to assist him in preparing comprehensive city plans for local governments. During
the period of his greatest professional contributions, 1919-1962, Bartholomew carried on a
three-part career simultaneously. He was Director of Planning at Newark, 1913-1916, at St.
Louis, 1916-1953 and Washington, 1953-1962. Simultaneously, he was partner-in-charge of
Harland Bartholomew and Associates for 42 years from 1919 to 1961. Finally, Bartholomew
became a teacher of city planning at a number of American colleges.</p>

<p>Hedda Morrison was born Hedda Hammer in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1908. As a young child
she contracted polio, which caused her to walk with a limp. In 1929 she completed her
secondary education at the Queen Katherine Convent (Königen-Katherina-Stift Gymnasium
für Mädchen) in Stuttgart, and was sent to the University of Innsbruck in Austria to
study medicine. After a few months she persuaded her parents to allow her to enroll in
the State Institute for Photography in Munich (Bäyerische Staatslehranstalt für
Lichtbildwesen in München).</p>
<p>After completing her studies, Hedda found paid work difficult to find as a result of the
Depression. She decided to travel to China in 1933 in response to an advertisement in a
photography journal. Between 1933 and 1938 she managed Hartung's, a German-owned
commercial photographic studio in Peking. After her contract there expired in 1938, she
continued to work as a freelance photographer. Hedda's photographs of Peking were well
known, and she sold many prints and albums to wealthy overseas visitors as
souvenirs.</p>
<p>In 1940 Hedda met Alastair Morrison and they married in Peking in 1946. Due to the
increasing instability of the political situation in China, they left Peking soon after.
The Morrison's spent six months in Hong Kong before relocating to Sarawak, in the
north-west of the island of Borneo, where Alastair was appointed to the British Colonial
Service and later became a district officer. Throughout her 20-year residence in
Sarawak, Hedda accompanied Alastair on all his official journeys and made numerous
independent photographic tours. From 1960-66 Hedda was employed by the Sarawak
government to work part-time in the photographic section of the Information Office is
Kuching. Her duties included taking photographs, establishing a photographic library and
training government photographers. Hedda wrote two major books on Sarawak,
<title>Sarawak</title> (1957) and <title>Life in a Longhouse</title> (1962).</p>
<p>In 1967 the Morrisons settled in Canberra, Australia. Hedda died in Canberra in 1991, at
the age of 82.</p>

<p>Hiram G. Hotchkiss was born in Oneida County, New York, on June 19, 1810. His father, Leman Hotchkiss, moved the family to Phelps, Ontario County, New York, in 1811 and became the pioneer merchant of that region. Upon his death, Hiram and
his brother Leman managed the business. After expanding their milling operation, Hiram began to develop an essential oil industry. Hiram moved to Lyons, New York, in 1843, where he began cultivating peppermint, and gradually gained control over the farm supply of mint and over the oil market. Leman remained in Phelps, and carried on his
own oil business. Both had general stores, dealt in wheat, flour and produce, and established banks in their respective towns. Hiram became a powerful businessman, controlling prices of western peppermint crops and successfully marketing his product in the United States and Europe. His essential oils garnered many awards, including first
prize medals at world's fairs and exhibitions held in England, Germany, America, France and Austria. Hiram Hotchkiss died in 1898, and his sons Calvin and Hiram Jr., took over the business.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Foundation</emph>
</p>
<p>The Human Rights Campaign Fund (HRCF) was founded by Stephen Endean in 1980 as the United
States' first gay and lesbian political action committee (PAC). Like other PACs, it started
raising and contributing money to the campaigns of candidates likely to advance the group's
interests. In its case, the mission was to advocate for gay and lesbian civil rights "by
supporting and educating candidates for federal elective office." <emph render="super">1</emph>
</p>
<p>The organization was created partly in response to the successes of anti-gay groups,
including the Moral Majority and the National Conservative Political Action Committee. In
July 1980, HRCF registered with the Federal Election Commission and in November 1980, HRCF
made its first campaign contribution to Jim Weaver, D-Ore., who defeated his Moral
Majority-supported opponent. HRCF aggressively pursued "the goal of basic human rights
through modern political methods" and wanted to help "bring the gay movement into the
mainstream of the American political process." <emph render="super">2</emph>
</p>
<p>Distinctly bipartisan from its beginning, an early brochure explained, "The Campaign Fund's
mission is simple: to provide financial support on behalf of the gay and lesbian community
to candidates of both parties, Republicans and Democrats, who pledge their support of gay
civil rights legislation."<emph render="super">3</emph> In its early years, HRCF got the
support of famous activists and cultural celebrities, including Tennessee Williams, Joan
Baez, Cesar Chavez, and Gloria Steinem.</p>
<p>The organization was officially incorporated in the District of Columbia as a non-profit
political committee on April 14, 1982. The incorporators of the organization were Steve
Endean, Gilberto Gerald, and Farley Peterson. The initial Board of Directors at the time of
incorporation were Virginia Apuzzo, Jerry Berg, John Campbell, Dallas Coors, Steve Endean,
Gilberto Gerals, Ethan Geto, Rev. Elder Jerri Ann Harvey, Jim Hormel, Paul Kuntzler, Bettie
Naylor, Lois Galgay Reckitt, Jerry Weeler, and Kerry Woodward.<emph render="super">4</emph>
</p>
<p>In September 1982, HRCF held its first large fund raising dinner at the Waldorf Astoria,
featuring former Vice President Walter Mondale. Throughout its history, HRC annual dinners
have been a staple of the organization's fundraising apparatus.</p>
<p>As a result of effective fundraising techniques, during the November 1982 election cycle
HRCF managed to raise nearly $600,000 and contributed $140,000 to 119 congressional
candidates, 81% of whom won their races.<emph render="super">5</emph> Following the 1982
election, HRCF became the 17th largest independent political action committee in the United
States.<emph render="super">6</emph> In 1987, they raised more than $1,360,000.<emph render="super">7</emph> In 2005, donors contributed a record $35.9 million.<emph render="super">8</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Gay Rights National Lobby</emph>
</p>
<p>In November 1985, HRCF merged with the Gay Rights National Lobby. The Gay Rights National
Lobby (GRNL) had been incorporated in the District of Columbia on August 15th, 1976.
According to the articles of incorporation, GRNL was created for "the purpose of lobbying,
at the Federal government level, for civil rights and other Federal legislation pertinent to
gay people."<emph render="super">9</emph> The original incorporators of the organization
were Roy Birchard, R. Adam DeBaugh, Franklin E. Kameny, Paul J. Kuntzler, and Richard G.
Maulsby.</p>
<p>At its inception, GRNL's founders expressed their intention to focus on areas of concern
for the gay and lesbian community "including, but not limited to, public and private
employment, housing, the use of public accommodations, licensure, immigration and
naturalization, taxation, the Armed Services, and the criminal code."<emph render="super">10</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1978, after moving to Washington, D.C. from Minnesota, Steve Endean became the executive
director of GRNL. During its nine year history, GRNL focused on several legislative issues
on the federal level, lobbying for the passage of a lesbian/gay civil rights bill, increased
AIDS funding, and the revision of immigration laws to remove provisions discriminating
against gay and lesbian immigrants. </p>
<p>In 1982, GRNL became one of the first gay and lesbian organizations to be admitted to the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a "broad coalition of religious, labor, women's, and
minority groups working on civil rights at the federal level."<emph render="super">11</emph>
In 1982, after extensive negotiations between GRNL and officials from the American
Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), delegates at the AFSCME
convention approved an endorsement of gay civil rights legislation at all levels of
government.<emph render="super">12</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1983, conflicts with other activists, including the Advocate publisher David B.
Goodstein, led to Endean's resignation from both HRC and the Gay Rights National Lobby.</p>
<p>In 1985, after accumulating a large financial debt, GRNL merged with the Human Rights
Campaign Fund to ensure the survival of GRNL's mission and maximize the effectiveness of
both organizations.<emph render="super">13</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Think Tank: Right to Privacy Foundation</emph>
</p>
<p>The Right to Privacy Foundation (RPF) was incorporated on July 14th, 1981, and its first
President was Steve Endean, who had also served as first president of GRNL. The organization
was incorporated by Steve Endean, Franklin Kameny, and Rev. Lawrence Uhrig. Endean, Uhrig,
and Kameny also served as the organization's first Board of Directors. In April 1983, RPF's
Board of Directors included Rev. Don Eastman, Doug Elwood, Stephen Endean, Meryl Friedman,
Nath Rockhill and Tony Silvestre.</p>
<p> According to the articles of incorporation, the purpose of RPF was to "engage in research,
sponsor research and publish educational materials concerning the public policy implications
of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation." <emph render="super">14</emph>
</p>
<p>In a press release from GRNL announcing the creation of the organization, the author
describes the importance of RPF's mission, asserting that "there is no single organization
devoted solely to providing the unique educational research service required to effectively
address the public policy questions surrounding national legislation of concern to lesbians
and gay men."<emph render="super">15</emph>
</p>
<p>Though RPF's history was brief, the organization conducted extensive research on
anti-discrimination in employment, the federal Gay Civil Rights Bill, and HIV/AIDS
discrimination. The organization essentially functioned as a think-tank, analogous to large
conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Free
Congress Foundation, the bipartisan Brookings Institution, and the progressive People for
the American Way. </p>
<p>Records of the Right to Privacy Foundation from 1981 to 1989 are part of the Human Rights
Campaign Records. In some ways, the RPF was a predecessor to the Human Rights Campaign's
educational endeavors.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Educational Units of the HRC: Human Rights and Health Fund/The Triangle
Institute (TTI)/Human Rights Campaign Foundation</emph>
</p>
<p>In October 1986, HRCF expanded its organizational activities with the creation of the Human
Rights and Health Fund, a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization that supports the
work of HRC through research, educational efforts and outreach. This branch of HRCF was
"formed for the charitable and educational purposes of conducting research and educating the
public on the social, economic, and health issues gay men and lesbians."<emph render="super">16</emph> In March 1988, HRHF officially changed its name to The Triangle Institute
(TTI). </p>
<p>During its early years, HRHF/TTI was engaged in several major projects. The electoral
research project (ERP), was one of the organization's first projects. According to one
information packet distributed by the organization, the ERP's objective was to "explore the
impact of gay rights and AIDS related issues on voting behavior and candidates for elective
office." </p>
<p>Another major project of HRHF/TTI was the MEDPAC project, focused on reliable information
dissemination related to the AIDS crisis. According to a Board of Director's report from May
1988, "MEDPAC is a press packet which provides up-to-the-minute, authoritative, and
comprehensive coverage of medical aspects of the AIDS crisis. Its distribution is to
medical, legislative, service provider, funding, and other personnel who need such
information but may not have ready access to it."<emph render="super">17</emph>
</p>
<p>HRHF/TTI also advocated for and facilitated the creation of academic and professional gay
and lesbian caucus networks. In 1993, when the National Coming Out Day Project (NCOD) merged
with the HRCF, NCOD became part of TTI. </p>
<p>In 1995, TTI became the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In 2006, the Human Rights
Campaign Foundation was engaged in several projects related to research, public education
and programming. These projects included the Historically Black Colleges and Universities
Outreach Program, the Family Project, the Workplace Project, the National Coming Out
Project, the Religion and Faith Program, and the HRC Research Institute.<emph render="super">18</emph>
</p>
<p>While some analysts have observed that "there is a frustrating division in the progressive
world between organizations that do grassroots or community organizing and those that do
analysis and policy development,"<emph render="super">19</emph> HRC has focused substantial
attention in both directions. In 1995, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force also took
this step and formalized its research activities by forming the NGLTF Policy Institute, a
separate, non-profit organization to serve as a national information clearinghouse and
resource center dedicated to educating and organizing around lesbian and gay men's issues.
People for the American Way, formed in 1980, is another example of a large progressive
organization tackling both political and research functions.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Fairness Fund/Speak Out</emph>
</p>
<p>In January 1988, HRCF further increased the scope of its organizational activities with the
acquisition of Steve Endean's Fairness Fund (FF). Endean had created the Fairness Fund (FF)
in December 1986 to provide letters and mailgrams on behalf of concerned individuals to
political leaders with the intention of influencing federal legislation relevant to the gay
and lesbian community. When the Fairness Fund merged with HRCF, its name changed to Speak
Out. When Steve Endean returned in 1988, the HRCF created a Field Division for grassroots
organizing.</p>
<p>Speak Out, like the Fairness Fund before it, generated mailgrams and letters to members of
congress in high volume at pivotal moments in the legislative process. According to the
agreement reached between HRCF and FF in 1988, HRCF asserted that their legislative agenda
would be "substantially enhanced by the ability to generate, in a rapid and effective way, a
'public outcry' when necessary."<emph render="super">20</emph>
</p>
<p>The method of grassroots political lobbying through sponsored mailgrams and letters was
first developed by the women's movement during the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) campaign and
became an effective means of political lobbying throughout the Fairness Fund's and Speak
Out's history.<emph render="super">21</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">1989 Organizational Change</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1989, HRCF was reorganized into two distinct entities, a political membership
organization known as the Human Rights Campaign Fund and a political action committee known
as HRCF-PAC. In the same year, the Board of Directors approved the lesbian program of HRCF
in an attempt to further develop HRCF's representation of lesbian issues and lesbian
constituency.<emph render="super">22</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">1990 Legislative Successes</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1990, several significant pieces of legislation from HRCF's political agenda were
approved by the federal government. The Americans with Disabilities Act, which included a
provision preventing discrimination based on HIV/AIDS status, CARE-Ryan White Comprehensive
AIDS Resource Emergency Act, and the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act were all important
pieces of legislation that were made possible, in part, by the efforts of HRCF. At the
invitation of President George H.W. Bush, HRCF representatives attended the signing ceremony
of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act.<emph render="super">23</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Presidential Politics</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1992, HRCF supported its first presidential candidate, governor of Arkansas Bill
Clinton. During the election, HRCF contributed $3 million dollars to Clinton's campaign. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">1995 Organizational Change</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1995, under the guidance of Executive Director Elizabeth Birch, HRCF underwent several
significant changes. The name of the organization was officially changed from the Human
Rights Campaign Fund to the Human Rights Campaign and the Triangle Institute became the
Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In addition, HRC adopted its current logo, a new
positioning statement, and a new vision statement.<emph render="super">24</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">New Building in 2003</emph>
</p>
<p>HRC purchased and renovated the building at 1640 Rhode Island Ave., N.W., in Washington, DC
for its national headquarters. It dedicated the new space on National Coming Out Day,
October 11, 2003. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">2005 Organizational Change</emph>
</p>
<p>In 2005, the Executive Director's position was redefined as a President. The Communications
Department became the Communications and Marketing Division, the Education Department became
the Public Education and Outreach Division, and both Divisions came under the Vice President
for Programs. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">HRC in 2007</emph>
</p>
<p>In January 2007, HRC described its mission as:</p>
<p> "...by inspiring and engaging all Americans, ... to end discrimination against GLBT
citizens and realize a nation that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all."<emph render="super">25</emph>
</p>
<p>Contributing to the campaigns of candidates who will support GLBT civil rights is still a
focal point of HRC's work. In addition, "HRC works to secure equal rights for GLBT
individuals and families at the federal and state levels by lobbying elected officials,
mobilizing grassroots supporters, educating Americans, ...and partnering with other GLBT
organizations."<emph render="super">26</emph> HRC concentrates on creating effective
education and outreach programs. Major issues include equal rights and benefits in the
workplace and ensuring families are treated equally under the law. </p>
<p>In 2007, "the Human Rights Campaign, the largest national gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender advocacy organization, envisions an America where GLBT people are ensured of
their basic equal rights, and can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the
community. HRC has close to 600,000 members - all committed to making this vision of
equality a reality."<emph render="super">27</emph>

Massillon, Ohio, and went on to graduate from Columbia University in 1947, and then earn his
master's degree and a PhD in Geophysics there. In 1968, after years of research, Oliver
published a paper entitled "Seismology and the New Global Tectonics," that made a
groundbreaking argument for the existence of continental drift, now known as plate
tectonics. In 1958, while in a New York State seismic station, Oliver observed a seismic
wave generated not by an earthquake, but by a nuclear bomb test in Nevada. Overnight he
became an authority on the subject, which led to his being an adviser to the White House on
the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty later than year, and a delegate to negotiations in Geneva in
1959. In 1971, Jack Oliver became the chair of the Department of Geological Sciences at
Cornell University, and is known to have transformed the department from obscurity into a

<p>The Schurman family was of Dutch descent, and after flourishing in
America, was forced to leave New York for Canada during the American Revolution
due to its Loyalist sympathies. Born on May 22, 1854 in Freetown, Prince Edward
Island, Canada, Jacob Gould Schurman early in his life demonstrated himself as
a talented student, and he earned a series of scholarships. After attending the
Prince of Wales College and Acadia College in Nova Scotia, he graduated in 1877
from the University of London with first class honors in mental and moral
science, attending other lectures at Manchester New College on mental and moral
philosophy and religion. He then studied philosophy for a year at Edinburgh
while simultaneously studying in London, earning there an M.A. and D.Sc. with
distinction, in 1878. Schurman then studied philosophy in Berlin, at Göttingen,
and at the University of Heidelberg. While in Berlin he made the acquaintance
of Andrew Dickson White, ambassador to Germany and president of Cornell
University</p>
<p>In 1880, Schurman returned to North America to become a professor of
English literature at Acadia College. From 1882 to 1886 he was professor of
English literature, rhetoric, and metaphysics at Dalhousie University.</p>
<p>From Dalhousie, Schurman moved to Cornell University, where he served
as a professor of Christian ethics and moral philosophy. His work at Cornell
came under the close sponsorship of University Trustee and benefactor Henry W.
Sage. When in 1890 Sage endowed the School of Philosophy, Schurman was
appointed dean. Two years later, in 1892, as Charles Kendall Adams ended his
troubled presidency of Cornell, Schurman became the third president of the
university, serving until 1920.</p>
<p>Schurman's stewardship of Cornell was characterized by the extensive
growth of the University's facilities, and its shift from a privately endowed
institution to its current coalition of state and private funding. Throughout
the twenty eight years of his presidency, Schurman was a proponent of academic
freedom and an advocate of a generally liberal intellectual atmosphere on
campus. During his presidency of Cornell, Schurman's scholastic pursuits and
writings gradually moved away from philosophy and toward public and
philanthropic endeavors. He became a presence in the national and New York
State Republican Parties, identifying himself with Charles Evans Hughes, and it
was thought that only his Canadian birth prevented him from seriously pursuing
the presidency of the United States. While still president of Cornell, Schurman
served as chairman of a commission examining social and political life in the
Philippines in 1899. In 1912 and 1913, he was minister to Greece and
Montegnegro during the Balkan Wars. In America, he served as vice president of
the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1915, and was a member of the
New York State Food Commission in 1917-1918</p>
<p>Upon leaving Cornell, Schurman went to Japan and the Far East, and
then served as minister to China from 1921 to 1925, a time of war and great
political upheaval. His pattern of finding himself in tumultuous times
continued when he served as the American ambassador to Germany from 1925 to
1930. The honor that was due him for his efforts to rebuild the University of
Heidelberg translated into popularity with the centrist forces in the Weimar
Republic.</p>
<p>After a lectureship in California and additional travels and writing
on international subjects, Schurman died in New York in 1942.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL APPRECIATION</head>
<p>Schurman and Heidelberg</p>
<p>February 8, 1986 was celebrated as Schurman Day at the University of
Heidelberg. More than forty years after his death, Jacob Gould Schurman's
influence was still strong at the university he had cherished as no other.
Schurman arrived in Heidelberg 1878, and it was there that his intellectual
foundations found their bearings. Philosophy in Germany in the late eighteenth
century was a cultural passion. Innovation and intense activity in
philosophical dialogue combined with the spectral setting at Heidelberg
influenced Schurman forever. At the age of seventy three, in 1928, Schurman
undertook to acknowledge his appreciation to the university by leading an
effort to raise funds for its growth. In many of his speeches concerning the
campaign, he acknowledged that he had gone to Heidelberg, in part, because
there was no American university that could provide the kind of passionate
liberal learning and moral philosophy for which he yearned. Schurman first
obtained from John D. Rockefeller $200,000, and eventually raised almost
$600,000. The monies were used to erect a new lecture hall, called the "New
University." Schurman's passionate crusade of vigorous fundraising was a fervid
moment in a otherwise decorous and sober public life. By an abiding association
of Heidelberg and his own intellectual flourishing, sentiment combined with his
usual practical skill to result in the marshalling of forces and finances to
noble effect</p>

<p>James Law was one of the first faculty members of Cornell University, the first dean of
the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, and a pioneer in veterinary medicine
and public health in the United States.</p>
<p>Law was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, February 13, 1838. He was educated at Edinburgh's
Veterinary College and the medical school at Edinburgh University. He received
additional training in France at the veterinary schools in Alfort and Lyons. When Andrew
Dickson White approached him in 1868 to join the faculty at newly founded Cornell
University, Law was an experienced teacher and practitioner with a firm belief in sound
scientific training for veterinarians. Law brought his beliefs to fruition at Cornell
through high entrance requirements, rigorous courses, and exacting state licensing
requirements. </p>
<p>Law was also a leader in public health. His work on tuberculosis, foot and mouth disease
and other epizootics had a profound effect on animal and human health in America. His
fight against superstitious animal care practices rampant in rural America also had
significant influence. His <title>Farmer's Veterinary Advisor</title> was read widely by
practitioners and lay people alike for its practical and medically sound advise on the
treatment of common ailments.</p>

<p>Jim Houck is the Principal Investigator for the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument on Spitzer, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility formerly called SIRTF.
Spitzer was launched on August 25, 2003, and is the fourth and last of NASA's Great Observatories, the others being Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), and Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facilities (AXAF). Jim pioneered the use of mid-infrared spectrometers to determine the physical
conditions inside a wide variety of astronomical objects from the giant planet Jupiter to distant galaxies. Early in his career he built infrared instruments
launched on sounding rockets for brief, five minute peaks at the sky from above the atmosphere. Among the results from that work were the first discovery of the
very high luminosities of star forming regions in our galaxy. These results were challenged in the literature until they were solidly confirmed by the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) more than ten years later. Jim was a member of the science team that launched IRAS in 1983. In addition to IRAS and IRS, Jim also
led the Cornell development of the state-of-the-art instrumentation for the 5-meter telescope at the Palomar Observatory. The first major instrument developed at
Cornell for this site was SpectroCam, a thermal infrared camera and spectrograph operating near the diffraction limit of the telescope.</p>

<p>John Lyon Collyer (1893-1979) was born at Chelsea-on-Hudson, New York in 1893, to a
family of shipbuilders and boat operators. He attended Cornell University and
graduated in 1917 with a degree in mechanical engineering. During these years he was
a member and later coach of the crew team. He took a job with Bethlehem Steel in
their Wilmington shipyards. In 1923, he accepted the vice-presidency of the
English-owned Dunlop Tire and Rubber Company in Buffalo, New York, and worked his
way to the position of co-managing director of Dunlop's international operations. In
1930 he married Georgia Forman Elliott, a widow with two children. Collyer and his
wife had a daughter, Georgia, in 1930. At this time he moved to England, continuing
to work for Dunlop until 1939, when he moved back to the U.S. to assume the
presidency and chief executive position at B.F. Goodrich Co., in Akron, Ohio. He
contributed greatly to the development and production of synthetic rubber, a
material in great demand in World War II. Collyer served in this position with
Goodrich for 25 years, and was on the board of directors of several corporations,
including Cornell University. A benefactor of Cornell, he gave the Collyer Boathouse
on Cayuga Lake inlet. Collyer died in 1979 at Vero Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>City planner, landscape architect.</p>
<p>John Nolen attended the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Ph.D. in 1893, and for
the next ten years worked as secretary of the American Society for the Extension of
University Teaching. In 1903 he enrolled in the newly established Harvard School of
Landscape Architecture, receiving an A.M. in 1905. He established an office in
Cambridge, where he and his associates branched out into city planning as well as
landscape architecture. Over the course of his career, Nolen participated in 400 public planning projects and works of landscape architecture, and replanned
50 cities in 20 states. Travel and field work were important aspects of his career. He used visual media, including glass slides, extensively.
He was a frequent lecturer on city and town planning, and
was active in many professional organizations, including the American City Planning
Institute (later called the American Institute of Planners, now known as the American Planners Association), American Civic Association (now
Urban America), American Society of Landscape Architects, American Society of
Planning Officials, International Garden Cities and Town-Planning Federation,
National Conference on City Planning (now Urban America), and the Town Planning
Institute of England.</p>

<p>John P. Watson was a pomologist at the New York State Agricultural
Experiment Station in the Department of Horticultural Sciences. His career as a
fruit breeder at the Experiment Station in Geneva began in 1950. He worked with
varieties of grape and plum for New York and the Northeastern United States.
Watson was in charge of the care of seedling vineyards and assisted in planning
and making crosses of potential grape varieties. During his 37 years at the
Station, he was involved in the introduction of 17 varieties of grape,
including Cayuga White, Einset Seedless, and Chardonel and the Iroquois,
Seneca, Oneida, and Mohawk plums. In 1988, a new raspberry introduced by the
Geneva Station was named Watson in his honor. Watson retired as a Senior
Research Support Specialist in 1987, the year he was also named Most
Outstanding Employee at the Experiment Station.</p>

<head>REMARKS OF THE DONOR, SARAH JOHNSON</head>
<p>It is an accident of birth that my sister and I had these documents in our possession.
It is not, however, an accident that we have chosen to donate them to the Carl A. Kroch
Library here at Cornell. Over the years my sister and I have had a number of discussions
about the deposition of these papers. Our first concern was preservation. Here in this
facility our family records will be stored in a climate-controlled vault, kept as safe
as humanly possible from floods, fire, earthquakes, and insects. Second, we wished to
make the documents available to others. Here scholars and students will have the
opportunity to work with the original documents rather than from a microfilm or xerox
copy of them. Already undergraduate students have had a chance to read the family
correspondence of John and Abigail Adams in its original form. Holding such a document
in one's hands can alter one's sense of history; legendary figures come alive, they
become human. And we could not have asked for greater access than to have the letters
posted on the world-wide web. Kroch has admirably addressed our fundamental
concerns.</p>
<p>Equally important to us was the character of the institution in which we placed the
documents. It is understandable that so much of the interest in the collection is
focused on the Adams' letters. But the Adamses, distinguished though they were, are only
one branch of our family. The letters they wrote originated in Quincy, but their
destination was Utica, New York. The history of the other branches of our family is
embedded in that of this region. The archives here at Kroch already contain evidence of
their presence here, their ties through marriage, commerce, politics and friendship with
other families in the area. One of those many ties was to the Cornell family itself. Our
grandfather's sister, Mary Savage Johnson, was a friend of Ezra Cornell's daughter, as
the inscription in Mary Emily Cornell's autobiography testifies.</p>
<p>Beyond what the documents may reveal about specific individuals and Upstate New York,
the collection also reveals, in our view, something about our nation. Three branches of
our family were victims of religious persecution. Abigail Adams' ancestors were Puritans
who set sail for the New World on the Mayflower; the Savages were French Huguenots; and
the Johnsons were Sephardic Jews. All were driven from their homes at some point in
their history and came here, we imagine, in search of peace and tolerance, conditions
necessary for them to prosper. Let us hope that our country continues to extend this
promise to people of all religious and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>On a very personal level this occasion is a somewhat sad one for me. My sister and I
have no children. Those of you who have children and grandchildren can envision your
family extending into the future, while our immediate family stands behind, not in front
of us. Last fall I carried the two tin boxes containing the fragile paper relics of our
ancestors to this Library and left them here. By placing these papers in the care of one
of the finest research libraries in the world, my sister and I believe we have ensured
that the children of the future, both those who can trace their ancestors back
generations and those who do not know even their parents' names, will be able to examine
the papers and learn something about who we are as a people.</p>
<p>The sadness I have occasionally felt over relinquishing these papers has been outweighed
a thousandfold by the pleasure I have received as a consequence of this gift. It has
been great fun working on the collection with the superb staff of this facility. The
reactions of students and others who have seen the papers have been tremendously
gratifying. And it has given me special satisfaction to make this gift to Cornell.
During quieter moments, usually on my walk home from campus, I look around and feel the
same wonder I felt when I first arrived. I have been so fortunate to be a member of this
community of scholars striving for intellectual excellence. Cornell is a truly
extraordinary institution. My sister and I could have found no finer home for our
family's papers.</p>
<p>By placing these papers in the care of one of the finest research libraries in the
world, we have attempted to ensure that they will be preserved and that others will have
access to them. We have entrusted them to Kroch with the hope that the children of the
future, both those who can trace their ancestors back generations and those who do not
know even their parents' names, will have the opportunity to study them and learn
something about who we are as a people.</p>

<p>Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual At Large representative on Cornell's Student Assembly and
leader of the Men Supporting Men support group for gay/bi/questioning men coming out
of the closet in 1992-1993. In the US Presidential election, where Democratic
candidate Bill Clinton had promised to end the ban on gays in the military if
elected. The specter of AIDS hung over the community as well, as many students had
friends and relatives who had succumbed to the disease. Barrios remembers that
students perceived that gay issues were beginning to be talked about earnestly by
the public at large, but that this also caused tension among the substantial segment
of the population that remained intolerant towards gays. On campus, there were 12
LGBT student groups, chief of which was the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Coalition run
by Demetri Moshoyannis and Rebecca Rugg. The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual At Large seat
on the Student Assembly that Barrios filled had not seen much use since its
creation.</p>

<p> Cornell University received the heart of Jumbo the elephant about 1889 in association
with specimens acquired by Professor Burt Green Wilder. It no longer exists. According to
the journal American medicine, Volume 7, 1904, Professor. Burt G. Wilder was planning to
dissect the heart of Jumbo with a group of students. This article also gives the
dimensions of Jumbo's heart as, 28 inches long x 24 inches wide, with walls of the
artery 5/8 of an inch thick, large enough to contain an ordinary heart, and those of the
ventricle 3 inches thick. The weight was given as around 40 pounds. The specimen jar
that housed at least a portion of Jumbo’s heart is still stored at the Cornell Veterinary School. It was
featured in an exhibition in the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections. The jar was found empty in the basement of Stimson Hall by Dr. Howard Evans in the 1940s. It had a label attached saying Jumbo's heart. The jar lid has loops in the glass designed for hooks to suspend the specimen.</p>

<p>Benoist La Forte was a government administrator in France's newly

nationalized gunpowder industry during the period of the Revolution. Born in

Grenoble in 1761, he gave up practicing law in 1784 in order to study the

manufacture of gunpowder under the Commission of gunpowder (<emph render="italic">Régie des poudres et salpêtres</emph>), the governmental body

which had supplanted the private monopoly in 1775. Beginning in 1786 La Forte

held a series of government posts: he served briefly as comptroller for the

<emph render="italic">département</emph> of Montpellier, and then as

<emph render="italic">commissaire</emph> at Clermont-Ferrand, a post he held

through July 1787. In August of that year he was named <emph render="italic">commissaire des poudres et salpêtres</emph> for La Rochelle,

remaining there until November 1793, when the <emph render="italic">Régie des

poudres</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Comité de Salut Public</emph>

appointed him Inspector and then, in <emph render="italic">An</emph> III,

Inspector General for Vaucluse and neighboring <emph render="italic">départements</emph>. La Forte's promotion to Inspector

occurred around the same time that the <emph render="italic">Régie</emph>,

renamed <emph render="italic">l'Agence des poudres et salpêtres</emph>, was

undergoing substantial reforms in order to meet the demands of the Revolution

and the European war. On December 4, 1793, the National Convention, on the

recommendation of the <emph render="italic">Comité de Salut Public</emph>,

inaugurated a program of highly regulated de-centralization which required all

Frenchmen to participate in the production of gunpowder according to fixed

guidelines. The recently-annexed territory that became the

<emph render="italic">département</emph> of Vaucluse in 1793, rich in

saltpetre and furnished with several functional powder mills, promised to be an

especially exploitable area of France, and La Forte, apparently a valued

administrator, was named inspector for Vaucluse and given wide-ranging powers,

which increased in the following year. La Forte remained Inspector General

until May 1797 when, despite the protests of his superiors, he resigned his

post.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p> Born in New York City in 1901, Laura (Riding) Jackson occupies the American literary
landscape of the Twentieth Century as a poet, critic, and author increasingly concerned with
language "as the natural human truth-system." She is best known for her association with the
Fugitives in the 1920s, her personal and literary partnership with Robert Graves between
1925 and 1938, and as editor of Epilogue. Yet, as a modernist poet, a critic whose work was
at the base of the New Criticism, and in her editorial work, she engaged in a relentless
dialogue with scores of poets, authors, and critics of the Twentieth Century, which she
pursued until her death in 1991. The Laura (Riding) Jackson and Schuyler B. Jackson
Collection fully documents the strength of her dedication to the search for the sources of
meaning, as well as her appeal to those who worked with her.</p>

<p>Anthropologist and Goldwin Smith Professor of Anthropology and Asian Studies, emeritus,
Cornell University.</p>
<p>Lauriston Sharp received in B.A. in 1929 at the University of Wisconsin. He studied in
Vienna and at Harvard University where he received his master's degree in 1932 and his
doctorate in 1937. His early field training in anthropology was in the American Southwest
and Plains areas and in the Berber regions of eastern Algeria. He began his specialization
in the cultural anthropology of Far Eastern and Pacific peoples at the University of Vienna.
From 1933 to 1935 Sharp was a Fellow of the Australian National Research Council and
Lecturer in Sydney University, and he carried out field research among tribes in northeast
Australia, especially the Yir Yaront. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1936, helping to set
up a combined department of anthropology and sociology. During World War II he was assistant
chief, Division of Southeast Asian Affairs in the State Department, where he dealt
particularly with Thailand and Indonesia. Upon returning to Cornell he organized a teaching
and research program in applied anthropology which included the Cornell Thailand Project. He
directed a multidisciplinary effort to chart the impact of change and modernization on Bang
Chan, a rice-growing village on the central plain. He also organized Cornell's area and
language program on Southeast Asia and served as its first director from 1950 to 1960.</p>

<p>Antoine Laurent Lavoisier was born in Paris in 1743. He was the son of Jean Antoine
Lavoisier, a lawyer, and Émilie Punctis, who belonged to a wealthy Parisian family, and
died when he was two. Then he attended the Collège Mazarin where he studied classics and
mathematics. In 1763, he passed the Bachelor of Law degree. At this time he got
interested in mineralogy and chemistry and attended Rouelle's classes. In 1766-1767, he
went on some field trips with Jean Etienne Guettard, to study the stratigraphy of soils
and make an inventory of the mineralogical resources of France. </p>
<p>In 1768, he was admitted to the Académie des Sciences, where he presented his research
on the chemical analysis of water. The same year, he entered the Ferme Générale, a
private company in charge of collecting indirect taxes for the king. Lavoisier became
first an inspector of one of the Ferme Générale commissions, the Tobacco commission,
where his supervisor was Jacques Paulze. On December 16, 1771, Lavoisier married his
thirteen-year-old daughter, Marie-Anne-Pierrette Paulze, who was also the grandniece of
the powerful Abbé Terray, the Controller General of Finance. In 1775, Lavoisier entered
the Régie des Poudres et Salpêtres, a private company responsible for the production,
control and refining of saltpeter and the manufacture of gunpowder in France. As a
Fermier Général and a member of the Régie des Poudres et Salpêtres, Lavoisier became
interested in economic theories, physiocratic ideas, agronomy, and public finance.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, from 1772, Lavoisier studied pneumatic chemistry, the chemistry of
gases, borrowing experimental facts from English scientists, like Priestley. In 1773, he
published the <title>Opuscules physiques et chimiques</title>, where he considered
atmospheric air as a mixture, that established his reputation as a chemist. In the
1770's, he discovered that the components of air were mainly oxygen and nitrogen, and
defined combustion and calcination as chemical reactions. Then, with Guyton de Morveau,
Berthollet and Fourcroy he elaborated a new method of chemical nomenclature, giving
chemistry a clear language, published in 1787 under the title of <title>Méthode de
nomenclature chimique</title>. At least, in 1789, his <title>Traité élémentaire de
chimie</title> explained the essential points of the new chemistry, like the
composition of air and water and the law of the conservation of matter in chemical
reactions, and depicted the experimental methods of a real scientific approach. The
thirteen plates illustrating the work had been engraved by Marie-Anne Lavoisier</p>
<p>In 1789, Lavoisier failed to be elected at the Estates General, and steered clear of
political affairs. He resigned from his office at the Ferme Générale shortly before its
abolition in 1791, but was considered as an consultant in financial affairs and became
the director of the Discount Bank, and a commissioner of the Public Treasury, and
expressed many ideas about the reforms of French public finance and taxation. At the
same time, he took part to the major reform of the unification of the weights and
measures system. But, as a former Fermier Général and like his peers, among them his
father-in-law, Jacques Paulze, he was arrested in 1794. They were accused of exactions
and embezzlement and transferred to the Conciergerie. On the 19 floréal an II (May 8,
1794), they were all sentenced to death and executed.</p>
<p>After Antoine Laurent Lavoisier's death, his properties were consficated by the State.
In 1795, after a campaign, Marie-Anne Lavoisier obtained the restoration of her
property. In the same time, she published an edition of Lavoisier's works. In 1805, she
married an American scientist, Benjamin Thomson, who had become Count Rumford in
1791.</p>

<p>The Leavitt family began farming and raising crops near Gabriels in 1888, when Lyman Leavitt moved from Bloomingdale. However, the deed for the farm was not registered until 1890. His son, Arthur, joined him after taking ''short courses'' at Cornell University. Around 1915, Arthur Leavitt took over the farm. Potatoes and seed potatoes were the main crops. There was only enough livestock to meet the needs of farming (work horses) and the family (a milk cow and a beef cow). In 1937, Arthur purchased a large barn from the Rockefellers at Bay Pond, dismantled it, and brought it to Gabriels. He also bought a small barn, which he used to store pieces of the larger barn over the winter, and then in 1938 erected what became known as The Big Barn. In 1939, Arthur's son, William, completed his education at Cornell University and joined in farming with his father. In 1976, Leavitt Farms was incorporated. Between 1920 and 1980 the farm grew to approximately 700 acres, harvesting 400 +/- acres of potatoes. William married Lenore Newell from Keeses' Mills (daughter of Pauline and Harold Newell). William and Lenore had three boys: Robert, Arthur and David. For a short period of time, all three sons farmed in Gabriels. David left to teach and then do administrative work in NYS Dept. of Corrections. In 1997, potato growing ceased when Robert and his wife, Mary Lou, left to start their own farm up north in Churubusco. Arthur remained on the farm taking care of other crops and developing a gravel mine on the property. In 2015, Ralph Child, scion of another well-known potato farming family in Franklin County, bought a large portion of Leavitt farm and returned it to potato growing. Arthur continues to grow hay and sell gravel and stone.</p>

<p>In 1792, Colonel John Lincklaen, who was an agent for the Holland Land Company, went
to central New York to see some of the company tracts of land, including the present
township of Cazenovia. Colonel Lincklaen made a temporary encampment at the foot of
Cazanovia Lake, and later founded a village on this spot. There, in 1807, he built a
federal mansion called "Lorenzo." He and his wife, the former Helen Ledyard of
Aurora, New York, had no children, but they adopted Mrs. Lincklaen's brother,
Jonathan Denise Ledyard (1793-ca.1874) and made him their heir. After the death of
Colonel Lincklaen, Jonathan Ledyard took over the management of the Holland Land
Company's affairs and eventually purchased their interests and property. Jonathan
married Jane Strawbridge of Philadelphia and their eldest son was named Lincklaen
Ledyard. In an attempt to perpetuate the name of the family benefactor, he had his
name legally reversed to Ledyard Lincklaen, but his only child was a daughter, Helen
Lincklaen, who married Charles S. Fairchild, the secretary of the treasury under
President Grover Cleveland. On the death of Mrs. Fairchild in 1931, Lorenzo was
willed to her cousin, Mrs. Eliphalet Remington, who died in 1953, leaving it to her
brother, George S. Ledyard, the present occupant with his son, John Ledyard.</p>

<p>Ernst Curtius (1814-1896) was an eminent philologist and archeologist.
From 1844-50 he served as tutor ("Zivilgouverneur") to Prince Friedrich von
Hohenzollern, afterwards Emperor Friedrich III. He was also professor of
classical philology, archeology, and eloquence at the Universities of Göttingen
and Berlin. In 1874 Curtius concluded an agreement with the Greek authorities
by which the excavations in Olympia were entrusted exclusively to the Germans.
What he found there ultimately led to the re-institution of the Olympic Games
by Baron Pierre de Coubertin in 1894.</p>
<p> His grandson Ernst Robert Curtius (1886-1956) was a foremost literary
scholar of the 20th century. The son of high-ranking civil servant, he grew up
in Alsace, a French province annexed by the Reich between 1871 and 1918, and
was thus bilingual in German and French -- and also fluent in English, Italian,
and Spanish. Under the aegis of Strasbourg Professor Gustav Gröber, he devoted
his doctoral dissertation to editing an Old French epic, but his
"Habilitationsschrift" in Bonn was on the contemporary French critique
Ferdinand Brunetière: thus emerged the two paths, i.e. the study of "medieval
literature" and the critical appraisal of recent works, that he was to follow
throughout his life. Curtius rejected Brunetière’s "scientific" method, instead
favoring intuition, attention to nuances, and "elected affinities" as the most
meaningful avenues toward literary knowledge. After being mobilized and wounded
in Poland during World War I, he obtained a tenured position at the University
of Bonn in 1916. Eevn though he considered the politicization of spiritual and
intellectual life as a betrayal of the truly independent thinker, his scholarship
in the 1920s often
seemed to support a political, pan-European
agenda: "Der Europagedanke, he would say, mußte geistig gebaut werden. Dazu
wollten meine Bücher helfen." Curtius took part in international symposiums in
Pontigny (Burgundy) and Colpach (Luxemburg); was in touch with the Austrian
prince von Rohan (who had launched an "Europäische Revue" in 1925, and would
join join the Nazi Party in 1938); and corresponded with Parisian intellectuals
of all stripes, despite the divisions generated by two wars (1870-71, 1914-18).
The exchange slowed down considerably after 1933 however, and not only because
of the passing of his beloved Catherine Pozzi (1882-1934), a poetess and
former lover of Paul Valéry who wrote scientific articles and translated the
poetry of Stefan George. Curtius dedicated to her his essay, "James Joyce’s
Ulysses" (1929) and also corresponded with Pozzi's son, Claude Bourdet, a young
engineer who would become a major figure of the Resistance and create the
weekly "L'Observateur" (after 1964 "Le Nouvel Observateur.") In 1931, Catherine
Pozzi wrote to Curtius: "In Frankreich scheint das Geistige noch in keiner
Gefahr zu stehn, wie bei Ihnen." Indeed, with Hitler leading the new Reich,
life became almost impossible for German intellectuals. A fervent patriot and a
Stoic, Curtius decided to stay in Germany and to focus
on medieval and Renaissance literature, where less political interference would
be encountered. Despite his commitment to "European unity" he would
reject any "collaboration" between Germany and France after 1940 -- to the disappointment of his admirer Jacques
Benoist-Méchin (1901-1983), a brilliant journalist, military historian, and Proust scholar who
occupied a number of high positions in the Vichy regime. In 1950, back from the
Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, Curtius wrote to Anne
Heurgon-Desjardins: "Les querelles franco-allemandes m’ennuient. Je considère
ces deux peuples comme des collégiens mal élevés qui se chamaillent. J’ai fait
métier de rapprocheur pendant vingt ans. J’ai maintenant droit à la
retraite."</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Liberty Hyde Bailey was instrumental in separating Horticulture from Botany and
establishing it as a distinct scientific pursuit. He was a botanist, horticulturalist,
plant breeder, traveler and plant explorer, outstanding teacher, astute and successful
administrator, lobbyist, rural sociologist, prolific writer and superb editor,
environmentalist, philosopher, poet, and visionary.</p>
<p>Born on a farm in Michigan in 1858, Liberty Hyde Bailey graduated from the Michigan
Agricultural College with a degree in botany. After working with the renowned botanist
Asa Gray at Harvard, he returned to Michigan to teach horticulture and landscape
gardening. In 1888, he came to Cornell to build a new curriculum in practical and
experimental horticulture. In 1904, the Legislature passed a bill establishing the New
York State College of Agriculture at Cornell, and Liberty Hyde Bailey became its first
dean. In that role, he established new departments to complement existing fields of
study, and appointed Cornell's first women professors. In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt
appointed him to chair a presidential Country Life Commission. </p>
<p>Bailey retired from Cornell in 1913, but continued his scientific, practical, and
philosophical pursuits, and made his home in Ithaca for the rest of his life. He wrote
and edited numerous books, from textbooks to essays and poems. He traveled extensively
on botanical collecting trips, and continued his studies of palms, blackberries, grapes,
cabbages, pumpkins and squashes. During his lifetime, he received innumerable awards and
honors. Liberty Hyde Bailey died in 1954 at the age of ninety-six.</p>

<p>Los Crudos was a Chicago-based Latino hardcore punk band, founded by Martín Sorrondeguy, who also served as its lead singer. The band played together from 1991-1998, after which Sorrondeguy moved to San Francisco and founded the queercore band Limp Wrist. Los Crudos engaged with progressive cultural and political issues, including Latino and immigrant rights, anti-racism organizing, feminism, critiques of violence in gang culture, sexuality, and critiques of mainstream popular culture. Los Crudos also identified publicly as a straight-edge band that rejected alcohol and drug use, as part of the group's broader insistence on political awareness and resistance to the stupefying effects of contemporary consumer culture.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>FUERTES, LOUIS AGASSIZ (February 7, 1874-August 22, 1927), artist-naturalist, was born at
Ithaca, N.Y. His father, Estevan Antonio Fuertes, was a descendant of a prominent
Spanish family. His mother, Mary Stone Perry Fuertes, of Dutch and English ancestry, was
born in Troy, N.Y. His talent in drawing and his love of birds began to show at an early
age and developed without particular encouragement from parents or friends. By the time
he was eight or nine years old he had definitely focused his attention upon painting
birds, and when he was fourteen, according to an autobiographical sketch, his career was
definitely settled. He received his education in the public schools of Ithaca, N.Y.,
then in 1892 accompanied his parents to Europe and spent the year in a preparatory
school in Zurich, Switzerland. On his return he entered Cornell University and was
graduated with the class of 1897. In 1894, while on a glee club trip to Washington,
D.C., he met Elliott Coues and showed him some of his paintings. The encouragement which
he received from the ornithologist was apparently a deciding factor in his career.
Following his graduation from Cornell he spent a year studying with Abbott H. Thayer,
which improved his technique very materially, and with him and his son, Gerald Thayer,
he went to Florida in the spring of 1898 . This was the first of a series of expeditions
which widened his knowledge of the birds of North America. In 1899 he went to Alaska
with the famed Harriman expedition, and two years later be visited western Texas and New
Mexico with a party from the United States Biological Survey. With Dr. F.M. Chapman,
curator of birds at the American Museum in New York City, between 1902 and 1913 he
visited the Bahamas, the Pacific Coast, the prairies of Saskatchewan and the Canadian
Rockies, the Cuthbert Rookery in Florida, Yucatan and eastern Mexico, and Colombia,
South America. In addition to these expeditions Fuertes visited Jamaica on his wedding
journey in 1904; the Magdalen Islands and Bird Rock in 1909 with Leonard Cutler Sanford;
and after a dozen years spent mostly in his studio at Ithaca, in 1926-27 he made an
expedition to little-known parts of Abyssinia with Dr. Wilfred H. Osgood for the Field
Museum of Natural History in Chicago. From 1923 to 1927 he was lecturer in ornithology
at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Fuertes was a tireless worker in the field and never lost an opportunity to add to his
collection of birds or sketches. At the time of his death he left a collection of some
3,500 beautifully prepared bird skins and over a thousand field and studio sketches of
more than 400 different kinds of birds. His greatest collection, however, was the series
of mental images of each bird which seemed to be indelibly impressed upon his mind with
all the accuracy of a photographic plate. When examining a bird, his concentration was
supreme; he was oblivious to everything about him; and during these moments, apparently,
details of pose and expression were so fixed in his mind that years afterwards he could
reproduce them with his pencil and brush without the slightest hesitation. His
paintings, which illustrate most of the leading bird books published between 1896 and
1927, are characterized by a beauty of draftsmanship and a devotion to truth which are
manifested not only in the accuracy of every detail of plumage and form, but in the
perfection attained in reproducing the characteristic attitudes and expressions of each
species. On June 2, 1904, Fuertes was married to Margaret F. Sumner of Ithaca, by whom
he had two children. He was killed in a grade-crossing accident in 1927.</p>

by the Scott family and their partners in Illinois and Iowa land by purchases from the
federal government, private individuals, and the Illinois Central Railroad. Scott
established himself in the midst of the holdings in McLean County, Illinois as a
frontier landlord. In 1856 he laid out the town of Chenoa at the intersection of the
Chicago, Alton, and St. Louis Railroad with the Toledo, Peoria, and Warsaw. He founded
the McLean County Coal Company at Bloomington, Illinois in conjunction with Adlai Ewing
Stevenson and others and established the <title>Bloomington Bulletin</title>, a
Democratic daily. Upon Scott's death in 1891, Mrs. Julia Green Scott inherited the lands
and took an active part in management of the holdings. She also became prominent in her
work for the Daughters of the American Revolution, serving as president general of the
organization from 1909-1913. Upon her death in 1923, the original holdings, diminished

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</head>
<p>Jean-Fréderic Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas (1701-1781) was a powerful figure in France during the reign of Louis XV, overseeing the administration of both the Royal court and the French Navy during his extended terms as Secretary of the Royal Household (1715-1749) and Secretary of the Navy (1723-1749).</p>
<p>Born into a family of the highest nobility, Maurepas inherited these administrative positions almost as a birthright; they had been held by his grandfather, Louis de Pontchartrain (eventually Chancellier de Pontchartrain), and his father, Jérôme Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain. Maurepas' career began during a "golden age" of French commerce. As Secretary of the Navy, his working philosophy was that the power and security of France depended on the state of its commerce. Accordingly, much of the Navy's activity under Maurepas was aimed at protecting and expanding French foreign and colonial trade. Maurepas' passion for foreign affairs in general, encouraged by his administrative jurisdiction over certain areas of diplomacy and colonial government, led him to overshadow the Foreign Secretary. By the mid 1740s, however, shrinking funds combined with years of war with England had greatly reduced French commerce and the Navy's ability to protect it.</p>
<p>The last ten years of Maurepas' term as Secretary of the Navy were dominated by efforts to manage the escalating English threat to France and her colonies, by the War of Austria Succession (1740-1748), and finally by official war with England (1744). The English threat nudged France into commercial and military co-operation with Spain, at war with England since 1739, and precipitated the involvement of France in the Stuart cause, the Navy planning two ultimately aborted expeditions to Scotland (1743-44) to aid "The Young Pretender". As a member of the Conseil d'en Haut, Maurepas carried his naval experience and agenda to the Aix-la-Chapelle peace negotiations that followed the War of Austrian succession, proposing that any treaty ought to protect France's commercial interests.</p>
<p>Maurepas' ministry promoted improvements in maps, navigation and shipbuilding, and directed expeditions with purely scientific motives to Greece, Peru and the Far East. As Secretary of the Royal Household, Maurepas acted as a patron of the arts, managing the affairs and settling the disputes of the Comédie Française and the Académie Royale. In the latter part of his career, as a minister under Louis XVI, Maurepas remained close to the court. He was responsible for appointing positions in foreign affairs, the royal household and the treasury. Among his nominees was Necker, whom Maurepas dismissed in 1781 for his reformist tendencies.</p>

Brother H.M. Ripley took over the circuit and under his ministry a church of 150
members was built and dedicated that same year under Pastor Amos Worchester. Later
in 1858 under R.N. Leeke this church had the largest revival in the vicinity with
400 conversions. In October 1864 the charge was first referred to as the Hamburg
Eden charge in the quarterly conference minutes. In October 1866 the Hamburg and
Eden charges divided, with Coopers Ridge (after July 29, 1870), Potters Green
(services discontinued July 1867), Abbotts Corners, and Whites Corners falling under
Hamburg's jurisdiction. Later Water Valley and Town of Armor were included. A new
church was started November 10, 1884, which ran into trouble when the contractors
refused to complete the work and had to be taken to civil court.</p>
<p>In July 1884 a distinction was further made between the charges of East Hamburg and
Hamburg. On January 30, 1886 the Hamburg-Buffalo district of the Genesee Conference
was officially recognized. On May 9, 1887 the new church was finally dedicated in
Hamburg. The Town of Armor appeared on this charge September 18, 1896 and in 1906 it
became the Hamburg-Amor charge, temporarily. Another new building was started on
March 2, 1909 and was not completed at the end of the records in 1927. The town of
Armor was dropped from the charge on September 14, 1917. On April 2, 1926 the church
in Hamburg's name was officially changed from the Second Methodist Church to the
Hamburg Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>What is presently called the Lansing United Methodist Church once included Methodist Episcopal charges at North Lansing, West Dryden, Ludlowville and Lansingville. Classes at each of these towns were at one point a circuit whose minister held services at all of their churches. The classes of the Asburg church at Lansing and the Methodist Episcopal church at West Dryden are listed in this register. The Asburg church's class formed in 1797, built its "Red Meeting House" in 1811, and when it burned, built a new church in 1844. The West Dryden Methodist Episcopal class formed in 1811 at what was then known as Fox's Corners, and built its church in 1832. Members of the Lansing Methodist Episcopal church are included in membership lists in the register. During the years 1794-1797 three Methodist classes formed in Lansing, joined in 1797 and built the first frame church in the Genesee
circuit.</p>

In July 1810 the Genesee Conference was organized at the store-house of Daniel Dorsey, a prominent member of the parish. Gideon Draper was the presiding elder, Francis Asbury the presiding bishop.</p>
<p> In 1810 it vas voted to sell the old meeting house and $743.96 was raised to construct a new church which vas usable by 1813 and completed in I8l8. This structure vas demolished in 1851 and a nev building constructed. The debt from this church vas not paid until 1857. </p>

<p>The Methodist Episcopal Church of Mecklenburg originated about 1823 in a Methodist Episcopal class near the McIntyre Settlement on the Ulysses Circuit, Genesee Conference. A division of the Ulysses Circuit in 1843 prompted the annexation of the Mecklenburg charge to the Enfield Circuit in 1844. The charge included appointments at Mecklenburg (where the church was located), Little Flatts (or Cayutaville) and Allen's.</p>
<p>A subsequent division or reorganization placed the Mecklenburg charge on the Hector Circuit in 1846. In 1849, the Mecklenburg charge was organized into a station "by itself," with a full-time pastor. (For a more thorough history, see item 3 in this collection.)</p>

<p>Late in 1821 or early in 1822 itinerant Methodist ministers Reverend Loring Grant and
Asa Bell riding the Geneva Canandaigua circuit, visited an already organized class
in Naples. The church was incorporated in 1822, meeting in the home of an original
member until 1825 when a meeting house was built and dedicated. According to a
church history, revivals in 1831 and 1842 increased the membership necessitating a
larger meeting house which was dedicated in 1851. Almost immediately a subscription
for a chapel to be added to the church was circulated and in the same year it was
built and dedicated. From 1825-1850 the Naples church was a station on the Geneva
Canandaigua circuit, which included Hunt's Hollow and Garling House. After 1867 these
became out-charges to the Naple church. Due to a vehement anti-slavery, pro-John
Brown sermon, Reverend Isaac Gibbard was removed from the pastorship in 1859 or
1860. A trustee, William Marks, was reputedly involved in the underground railroad
which passed through the town.</p>

<p>In 1812 a small class existed at Seneca Falls on the Seneca Circuit. It joined with another class at Black Brook, and by 1830 the class numbered twenty-five of whom only one was a freeholder. The group had incorporated in 1829 as the Seneca Falls Methodist
Episcopal Church and had begun to build a meeting house on donated land. When work on the church stalled because of lack of money, the minister recommended abandoning the project, but members suceeded in enclosing the roof and building seats. Revival meetings were held in the structure and seventy new members were added to the
congregation. In 1834 land was donated for a parsonage. In 1843-44 a portion of the congregation seceeded and organized themselves as the Wesleyan Methodist Church (Collection #6049). In 1857 the church was remodeled. In 1865 a few members left to join the Free Methodist Movement. In 1871 the old church was torn down and a new building
dedicated on July 24, 1872 was constructed. In 1876 the church had 230 members and 50 probationers and 250 scholars in the Sunday School.</p>

<p>Meyer Howard "Mike" Abrams was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on July 23, 1912, in
a Jewish-American middle-class family. He went to Harvard where he majored in
English literature -- though, interestingly, the Harvard Album for 1934 mentions
"law" as his "avocation". Fellow-students included future New York Times foreign
affairs columnist Cyrus L. Sulzberger (1913-93) and future historian and Librarian
of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin (1914-2004). This is also in Harvard that Abrams met
his wife of 71 years, Ruth Claire Gaynes (1917-2008), with whom he would have two
children. His first book -- a revised version of his senior's thesis -- was
published in 1934 (and reprinted in 1970): "The Milk of Paradise" was about "four
eminent English authors [who] were addicted to opium": Coleridge, Crabbe, de
Quincey, and Francis Thompson. Young Abrams claimed that "a knowledge of the opium
world is essential to complete understanding of their work." After one year at the
university of Cambridge as a Henry Fellow, he returned to the United States, but
"because there weren't jobs anywhere [during the Great Depression], [he] decided to
stay on as a graduate student at Harvard." During World War II he conducted
classified research at Harvard's Psycho-Acoustics Laboratory, helping the military
solve problems in voice communications by developing highly audible military codes
and tests to select personnel with the ability to recognize sounds in a very noisy
background. He came to Cornell in 1945 as an assistant professor in the English
Department, and was promoted associate professor in 1947 and full professor in 1953.
In 1960 he became the first Frederic J. Whiton Professor of English Literature and
in 1973 succeeded to the Class of 1916 Professorship until his retirement in 1983.
Among his students over the years were literary critics Harold Bloom '51; E.D.
Hirsch '50; and novelist Thomas Pynchon '59. Abrams continued to lecture at Cornell
and remained a visible and active participant in campus life, giving the keynote
lecture at a 2005 James Joyce conference as well as public talks on English poetry
in 2008 and 2010, and also attending English department events and Big Red football
games. In addition to his service at Cornell, he was a Fulbright Lecturer at the
University of Malta (1953), a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in
Behavioural Sciences at Stanford (1967-88), a Visiting Fellow at all Souls College,
Oxford University (1977), a member of the Founders' Group of the National Humanities
Center, and was named Chairman of the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress
in 1984. "The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition"
(1953) was cited in 1957 in a poll of 250 literary critics and scholars as one of
the "five works published the last thirty years which... have contributed the most
to an understanding of literature." Also in the late 1950s, Abrams was approached by
the W.W. Norton Company about compiling "a definitive anthology of English
literature". The resulting book sold millions of copies, and remains an enduring
reference for high school and college students. Abrams was general editor of the
"Norton Anthology" through seven editions from 1962 to 2000. His other books include
“Natural Supernaturalism: Tradition and Revolution in Romantic Literature” (1971) ;
"The Glossary of Literary Terms," first published in 1957; and "Wordsworth: A
Collection of Critical Essays" (1972). In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded him
the National Humanities Medal "for broadening the study of literature." Mike Abrams
died in Ithaca on April 21, 2015.</p>

<p>Michael J. Williams was born in Virginia on 4 February 1958. After graduating from San Francisco State University in 1985, he took a Masters degree from the University of California at Davis. He was chair of the Gay Rights Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. Williams died of AIDS related causes on 23 April 1991.</p>
<p>The collection consists entirely of notebooks kept by Williams from 28 December 1980 through 8 May 1990, and is comprised of diary entries, astrological charts, calendars, outgoing and incoming correspondence, postcards, poems, photographs, lists, and such pieces of attached ephemera as tickets, programs, and invitations. The latter notebooks have few diary entries, and consist chiefly of correspondence, calendars, and postcards.</p>
<p>The diary entries and correspondence feature Williams' reflections on and expressions of gay life and love, his work in and doubts about graduate school, his love of nature and care for the natural environment, and his attention to friendships and family relations. A principal topic of the notebooks and the diaries is AIDS and the effects of the disease on his friends and in the gay community. There are several AIDS death notices in the notebooks. The notebooks chronicle Williams' coping with the AIDS related illnesses and death of his lover Mike Kurtz, and include Williams' thoughts on the disease. As he has elsewhere apostrophized the moon in letters in his diary, Williams also addresses Kurtz some time after the latter's death. After his own contraction and treatment of the disease, Williams describes the effects on his life of testing positive for HIV, .... He participated

in the University of California at San Francisco's AIDS Behavioral Research Project, and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation's Study of the Costs of AIDS Patients.</p>
<p>Throughout the notebooks, his family is sympathetic, especially his father and his sister; his chief correspondent is a woman who was his first girlfriend. Williams' infatuation with a man named Tony is also chronicled in letters to and from the subject, and in diary entries. Williams' concerns with the moon and its influence on him are carefully noted, both in prose and in detailed charts. He is addressed in several pieces of correspondence as Wander-Moon, or Wander, Wander, and Wanda-Luna.</p>

field projects, collecting seismological data, including the western USA and the southwest
Pacific (Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu). When his Ph.D. advisor at Columbia, the late Professor Jack
Oliver, moved to Cornell University in 1971, Muawia joined him as a research scientist and
subsequently became a full professor. He taught in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences and served as the Associate Director of the Institute for the Study of the Continents
(INSTOC). He also served in 1978-1980 as an associate professor and chairman of the Department
of Geophysics at the Faculty of Earth Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
In 2009 he retired and became a professor emeritus.</p>
<p>The focus of Barazangi's research at Cornell was on seismotectonics at regional and global
scale, including seismicity of the earth, geometry and structure of subducted plates at
converging plate boundaries, intraplate structure and tectonic activities, active continental
collisions zones, historical earthquakes, paleoseismology and trenching of active faults, and
evaluation and assessment of earthquake hazard. He also initiated and participated in the
development of a comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) for the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA). More information can be found at: <extref href="http://atlas.geo.cornell.edu" show="new">http://atlas.geo.cornell.edu</extref>.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE </head>
<p>Myron G. Fincher was born in Corfu, New York, on November 25, 1898 to Charles Colby
Fincher and Cora (Ross) Fincher. He was the youngest of five children. He graduated from
high school at the age of sixteen, then worked a number of odd jobs for a year. Then, in
1916, he decided to attend Cornell University's New York State Veterinary College. Upon
graduation in 1920, Fincher was offered a position in the College as an instructor in
the Department of Medicine and Obstetrics. He earned a Master of Science degree, worked
through the ranks, became full professor in 1938, and in 1942 was named Chair of the
Department of Veterinary Medicine and Obstetrics and Director of the Ambulatory Clinic,
a position he held until his retirement in 1965.</p>
<p>Fincher was also the director of the New York State Mastitis Research and Control
program. In 1946, New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey asked Fincher to create the
program, and Cornell was given a large sum of money to implement it. Fincher set up a
number of laboratories in order to regulate the mastitis research in the state. The
program now operates as <extref href="http://qmps.vet.cornell.edu/" show="new">Quality
Milk Production Services</extref> in the College's Diagnostic Laboratory. </p>
<p>Fincher retired from Cornell in 1965, in order to help found a new veterinary college at
Ahmadu University in Northern Nigeria, with funding from U.S.A.I.D. (United States
Agency for International Development ). From 1965-67, he served there as head of the
Department of Surgery and Medicine. When he returned from Nigeria he became a consultant
for the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He
maintained this position until he retired in 1971.</p>
<p>During his career he was widely consulted for his research on the diseases of horses and
cattle, specifically in his areas of expertise, infertility and mastitis. He was active
in the state, national and international professional organizations, and received many
distinguished awards and honors, including the AVMA's Borden Award in 1954, and the New
York State Veterinary Medical Association's Veterinarian of the Year in 1963. </p>
<p>Fincher died at the age of 83 on March 2, 1981, in Syracuse, New York. He was survived
by his wife, Evelyn (Davis) Fincher and his three daughters, Joyce, Myra and Esther. He
is memorialized at the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine with an annual prize
awarded to a fourth-year student who has demonstrated the best work in courses dealing
with large-animal obstetrics and reproductive disorders</p>

<p>Natalie Whitford Uhl was born in 1919 and educated at Rhode Island
State College and at Cornell University, where she worked with Arthur J. Eames.
She received an M.S. in 1943 and a Ph.D in 1947 with a dissertation on the
floral morphology and anatomy of the Helobiae. In 1963, she began working as a
Research Associate for Harold E. Moore at the Bailey Hortorium at Cornell. They
published numerous papers on palm anatomy and morphology. After Moore's death
in 1980, Uhl continued their work on Genera Palmarum, a comprehensive review of
the taxonomy, morphology and anatomy of all genera of palms, with the
collaboration of John Dransfield. The work was finally published in 1987. Uhl
formally retired in 1987, but maintained her activities in instruction,
graduate student supervision, curation, and research. She undertook the first
family-level cladistic analysis of the palms, the first study to use molecular
data to study higher-level relationships in the palms. She also co-edited the
journal Principes (now Palms) from 1979 to 2000. In 1981, she was appointed as
Associate Professor at Cornell and taught Applied Plant Anatomy for many years.
In 2002, she was awarded the Asa Gray Award byt the American Society of Plant
Taxonomists in recognition of her outstanding accomplishments.</p>

<head> ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY</head>
<p>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) was founded in New York City in 1973 as
the National Gay Task Force (NGTF) and quickly became a central force in lesbian and gay
movement politics. At a time with vibrant grassroots gay liberation and lesbian feminist
activism, the Task Force sought to introduce a vehicle for organizing at the national
level. Founding members included Howard Brown, Martin Duberman, Barbara Gittings, Ron
Gold, Franklin Kameny, Nathalie Rockhill, and Bruce Voeller. In 1977, the Task Force
arranged with President Jimmy Carter's assistant Midge Costanza for an historic first
White House meeting with representatives of several gay organizations. From its
beginnings, the Task Force defined as its primary goal the creation of a society in
which lesbians and gay men could live openly and free from violence, bigotry, and
discrimination. Over the last quarter century, NGLTF has lobbied, organized, educated,
and demonstrated for full gay and lesbian civil rights and equality, taking on anti-gay
and anti-lesbian forces among medical specialists, employers, the military, and the
media. The areas in which the NGLTF concentrated its wide-ranging efforts included the
following: </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Psychiatry</emph>
</p>
<p> In the early 1970s, the NGLTF staffed educational booths at American Psychiatric
Association conventions and took an active role in lobbying the APA to remove
homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. In 1978, it urged the U.S. Public
Health Service to stop certifying gay immigrants as "psychopathic personalities." Ron
Gold played a key role. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Employment and Military Service</emph>
</p>
<p> In an effort led by board member Frank Kameny to end employment discrimination against
lesbians and gay men, the NGTF successfully pushed in 1975 for the U.S. Civil Service
Commission to rule that gay people can serve as federal employees. In the late
seventies, NGTF staff conducted a survey of corporate hiring policies (called Project
Open Employment) to determine whether U.S. employers explicitly barred discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation. This survey was followed a few years later by another
of municipal police departments. These efforts were complemented by a 1985 victory in
the U.S. Supreme Court decision of NGTF v. Oklahoma, which overturned a law prohibiting
gay teachers from discussing gay rights. In 1988, the NGLTF started the Military Freedom
Project to end discrimination against lesbian and gay male members of the U.S. Armed
Forces, and it protested the 1993 "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Civil Rights</emph>
</p>
<p> In the 1970s, the NGTF also began to monitor local, state, and federal battles over gay
and lesbian civil rights, developing large clippings files that focused on key issues
and individuals. These files include clippings on such adversaries as Anita Bryant, who
led the campaign against a pro-gay and lesbian rights bill in Dade County, Florida, as
well as then-California governor Ronald Reagan, who had proposed an anti-gay amendment
to California's state constitution. These records further recount, among other matters,
the Task Force's introduction in 1975 of the first federal lesbian and gay civil rights
bill, its 1981 campaign to defeat the anti-gay Family Protection Act, its efforts
starting in 1986 with the formation of the Privacy Project to repeal anti-gay sodomy
laws, and its support in 1992 of local opposition to anti-gay referenda in Oregon and
Colorado. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Feminism</emph>
</p>
<p> NGTF women played a critical role in winning support from the mainstream women's
movement for lesbian and gay rights. They campaigned successfully for a lesbian rights
resolution at the 1975 national convention of the National Organization for Women. In
1977, co-Executive Director Jean O'Leary and women board members obtained endorsement of
lesbian and gay rights from the U.S.-sponsored conference for International Women's Year
in Houston, Texas. O'Leary was the only openly lesbian delegate on Carter's
International Women's Year Commission. At the conference, 130 openly lesbian delegates
attended. In 1993, NGLTF enlarged its work on lesbian concerns by coordinating the first
congressional briefing on lesbian health issues. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Gays and Lesbians on Television and in the Arts</emph>
</p>
<p> Recognizing the benign neglect, if not outright threat to gays and lesbians from how
they were represented in the arts, the NGTF closely monitored the images of gay men and
lesbians within the world of television, stage, and screen. This resulted in the
creation of the Gay Media Task Force, which took on as one of its primary missions the
lobbying of major television networks to improve their coverage of lesbian and gay
issues. In the world of the arts, the Task Force actively opposed the anti-gay
restrictions on grants from National Endowment for the Arts proposed in 1990. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Anti-Gay and Lesbian Violence</emph>
</p>
<p> The Task Force has concentrated on preventing and bringing attention to anti-gay
violence over the years. In 1982, it began its Anti-Violence Project, directed by Kevin
Thomas Berrill from the project's beginnings until 1994. In its most focused
data-gathering effort to date, the NGLTF set up a telephone crisis line designed to
provide assistance to people who had been harassed or assaulted, as well as lay the
groundwork for a comprehensive study of violence against lesbians and gay men. NGLTF's
Anti-Violence Project produced reports that were regularly cited as authoritative on the
subject of homophobic violence. In 1987, the Task Force helped secure passage by the
U.S. House of Representatives of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, the first federal law
to address sexual orientation, which was signed into law in 1990. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">AIDS</emph>
</p>
<p> The onset of the AIDS epidemic led to an unforeseen array of political struggles in the
early and mid-1980s. NGTF responded early in the developing crisis, pushing for a
statement on national blood policy in 1983 and obtaining the first federal funding for
community-based AIDS education in 1984. NGTF was instrumental in negotiating FDA
approval of the first HTLV-III antibody test. It also ensured that the test was to be
licensed only to professional physicians and that it was always to be accompanied by an
explanation of the limits of its accuracy and usefulness. This push for quality medical
care also brought the benefit of doctor-patient privilege, which proved an enormous boon
in light of the sudden explosion in AIDS-related discrimination. NGLTF's files on
AIDS-related discrimination -- home evictions, school expulsions, and job terminations
-- grew with alarming speed in the early years of the epidemic. This wave of
discrimination was met by an uncoordinated and seemingly reluctant response to the
epidemic at the federal level. In 1985, NGLTF executive director Virginia Apuzzo would
testify before a U.S. Congressional hearing on the abysmal failure of the federal
response to AIDS. In 1991, NGLTF staff briefed the Congressional Black Caucus on the
issue of AIDS and people of color. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Political Activism</emph>
</p>
<p> Although the politics of the epidemic absorbed uncounted days and hours of energy at
NGTF, the organization continued to grow and change. In 1985, NGTF officially became the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a move that marked both the specificity of lesbian
life and politics and the coalition between lesbians and gay men. Although the name
change cost NGLTF some gay male members, it sought to rectify matters by publicly
stating the hope that gay men and lesbians could work in tandem as independent but
related activists. One year later, NGLTF officially moved its offices from New York to
Washington, DC, setting itself up more squarely in the midst of a specifically national
lesbian and gay politics. </p>
<p>The development of a genuinely national purview at NGLTF involved more than mere
relocation. By the mid-1980s it had become normal for NGLTF staff members-especially its
executive directors-to spend entire weeks traveling to local lesbian and gay events,
lending moral support and the promise of political backing to struggles across the
United States. The Task Force helped organize the 1987 and 1993 Marches on Washington to
demand lesbian and gay men's rights and worked to increase the visibility and
participation of lesbians and gay men in the presidential elections at both the
Democratic and Republican National Conventions. In 1988, NGLTF held the first Creating
Change conference to bring together gay and lesbian activists from around the country.
In 1989, NGLTF started publishing campus organizing newsletters and initiated a Lesbian
and Gay Families Project to advocate for family diversity and acceptance. In the 1990s,
NGLTF continued to offer new networking and training opportunities to strengthen local
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered activism in each state. </p>
<p>In 1995, NGLTF evolved further and formed the NGLTF Policy Institute, a separate,
non-profit organization to serve as a national information clearinghouse and resource
center dedicated to educating and organizing around lesbian and gay men's issues. In
1997, NGLTF changed its mission statement to include bisexual and transgendered people
and launched the Federation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Statewide
Political Organizations. </p>

It was a part of the Federation of AIDS Related Organizations (FARO) and sponsored annual conferences for lesbian, bisexual, and gay health workers. The Lesbian and Gay Health Conference and AIDS/HIV Forum provided opportunities to share research data and program expertise. NLGHA created a National Research Institute for Lesbian and Gay Health to assist health professionals in designing research, identifying funding opportunities, and communicating research findings. Located in Washington, NLGHA also advocated at the federal level on health issues facing the lesbian, bisexual, and gay community: breast and cervical cancer; STDs; hepatitis; substance abuse; mental health; lbg-related violence; suicide; and HIV/AIDS. A scholarship in honor of Paul Paroski Jr. was
created and began to be offered to support lesbian and gay medical students in 1991. In 1997, NLGHA published The Gay Men's Wellness Guide: The National Lesbian and Gay Health Association's Complete Book of Physical, Emotional and Mental Health and Well-Being for Every Gay Male.

<p>Born in Cameron, Missouri in 1869, little is known about Allen's early years, education,
and marriage to Sidney P. Allen. She attended the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture
between 1916 and 1919 in Groton, Massachusetts, under the name Beatrice Osborn Allen.
In 1921 she visited gardens in England and Italy, including Gertrude Jekyll’s Munstead Wood.
Between 1921 and the late 1940s Allen maintained a landscape architectural practice based in New York City,
designing residential gardens primarily in the New York and New England area under the name Nellie B. Allen.
Like many graduates of the Lowthorpe program, Allen excelled in the design of Anglo-American-style perennial borders,
such as those at Dellwood, the John Henry Hammond estate in Mount Kisco. Other projects include
the Isabel Dodge Sloane estate on Long Island, Three Waters estate in Gloucester, Massachusetts,
Thornedale in Millbrook, New York, and the Anne Morgan estate in Mount Kisco. She was also a consultant
for the Bishop’s Garden at the National Cathedral in Washington, and designed a parterre garden in
collaboration with Constance Boardman for the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Her gardens were occasionally
featured in House Beautiful, Landscape Architecture, and Country Life in America, but none of her gardens survive. (Taken from The Cultural Landscape Foundation)</p>

Cornell. Her early research dealt with vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12 and
enzymes in choline metabolism, but the majority of her time was spent studying
various aspects of the potato. Dr. Mondy was appointed an associate professor of

<p>Nelson Shaulis graduated with a B.S. in horticulture and an M.S. in agronomy from Pennsylvania State University. He received his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1941. He served as a soil conservationist with the USDA Soil Conservation Service from 1938 to 1944, while he was also an instructor and assistant professor of pomology at Penn State. In 1944, he was appointed assistant professor of pomology at Cornell, and became professor of pomology and viticulture from 1948 to 1967. He retired as professor of viticulture in 1978. His major contributions to the grape industry included a training system for grapes called the Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), which he initiated at the Experiment Station in 1960 and with growers in 1964. He also helped to develop the mechanical grape harvester. Shaulis was named a fellow of the American Society of Horticultural Science in 1972 and in 1997 was the recipient of the Merit Award given by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture (ASEV),

<p>William Goring was a radical anarchist and founding member of the Columbia University
chapter of the New York City League for Sexual Freedom, also called the Sexual
Freedom League, an organization founded in 1963 in New York City by Jefferson Poland
and Leo Koch. The organization promoted sexual activity among its members and
agitated for political reform, especially for the repeal of laws against abortion
and censorship. It contributed to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, a cultural and
political movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to
sexuality and interpersonal relationships. Goring joined the mailing list for the
radical feminist group called the October 17th Movement, named after the date that
women from the New York City chapter of NOW decided to form it. Later known as The
Feminists, the group sought to create a new kind of feminist movement, one with
starkly different attitudes about sexuality and the sexual revolution than those of
the League for Sexual Freedom. The Feminists highlighted the oppressive nature for
women of both male sexuality and existing gender roles. Ti-Grace Atkinson was the
group's central figure and informal leader until she left the group in 1971. Other
prominent members included Anne Koedt, Sheila Michaels, Barbara Mehrhof, Pamela
Kearon, and Sheila Cronan.</p>

<p>Black Mask was a radical group and newspaper created in 1966 by abstract painter Ben
Morea, poet Dan Georgakas, and Ron Hahne. Inspired by the actions of the French
Situationists and Dutch Provos among others, Black Mask produced a ten issue run
newspaper and some broadsheets before going underground. Morea, along with some
others involved with Black Mask emerged as the Up Against The Wall Motherfuckers, a
name taken from the poem "Black People!" by Amiri Baraka (then still known as LeRoi
Jones). In the late 1960s these groups became infamous for actions such as dumping
uncollected trash from the Lower East Side in the fountain at Lincoln Center and
organizing a protest of The Filmore East through a series of free concerts offered
to promote community use of the venue.</p>

<p>Organization founded by Mary Lucinda Bonney and Amelia Stone Quinton in 1879. Initially
named the Central Indian Committee, and then the Indian Treaty-Keeping and Protective
Association (1881-1882), it worked to prevent white settlers from encroaching on
American Indian lands. A reform organization advocating Christianization and
assimilation of American Indians, it was instrumental in the passage of the General
Allotment Act of 1887. Led throughout most of its influential years by the indefatigable
Amelia Stone Quinton, the Association in its heyday had 60 branch organizations in 27
states. Known for its ability to influence Indian policy on a national level, the
organization also supported Christian missions on reservations throughout the country.
Its name changed to Women's National Indian Association in 1882, and its efforts came to
focus largely on Christian missionary work among the Indians and efforts to promote
their assimilation into white society. The organization changed its name to National
Indian Association in 1901. While the organization must have generated a mountain of
correspondence in its 72 years of existence, very little is found among the papers.It
dissolved itself in 1951. </p>

<p> Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) was born when Jeanne
Manford, a New York school teacher, expressed her outrage at her gay son's mistreatment
by local police in a published letter to the New York Post in 1972. The public response
to her statement, "I have a homosexual son, and I love him," was so great that she held
the first support group meeting for parents of gay children in March 1973 at the
Metropolitan Duane Methodist Church in Greenwich Village. By 1976, when the Los Angeles
chapter was started by Adele Starr, numerous groups had formed around the country.</p>
<p>The first national meeting was held in 1979 to coincide with the first March on
Washington for Gay Rights, and Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays was officially
founded in 1981 with its headquarters in Denver, Colorado and was incorporated in 1982.
In 1989, it moved to Washington, D.C. In the 1990s, it added "families" to the
organizational name. In 1997, there were fifteen regions, each headed by a regional
director, over four hundred affiliate chapters, and 70,000 individual members
worldwide.</p>
<p>P-FLAG's three-part mission includes support, education, and advocacy. Its peer group
meetings help what P-FLAGers call "new" parents through their often negative reactions
to and distress about the news that a child is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. P-FLAG also
offers support to individuals whose spouses, parents, or other family members have "come
out" to them. Parents and other family members also benefit from and provide educational
resources which aid in the process of acceptance. Publications, fact sheets, readings
lists, cassettes, conferences, seminars, and speakers bureaus form the backbone of the
educational arm of P-FLAG's mission.</p>
<p>Advocacy often entails applying educational campaigns to points of political leverage
including voting blocks and public bodies. For example, many P-FLAG chapters have become
highly involved in supporting anti-discrimination initiatives and in combating anti-gay
ballot initiatives. P-FLAG chapters also often march in local and national gay pride
parades. On the national level, P-FLAG organized a multimedia public education program
called "Project Open Mind." P-FLAG's national president Nancy McDonald joined other
activists in a meeting with President Bill Clinton to urge him to support programs for
gay youth and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act designed to ban anti-gay bias in the
workplace. P-FLAG collaborates with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the
Human Rights Campaign to push a common agenda.</p>
<p>McDonald credits Executive Director Sandra Gillis with the surge of membership from 1993
to 1997. In this time, the number of affiliate chapters almost doubled.</p>

He remained with the institute when it became an independent research institution and served as a senior researcher until his retirement in 1947. Frequently on loan from the institute to the Federal Housing Authority and the Tennessee Valley Authority, he conducted a TVA study in the 1930s that led to many reforms in its administrative practices. Cornick also helped a number of states reform real estate taxes and develop land value taxation codes. He was an opponent of Richard T. Ely's land speculation

<p>Philip Wagner was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1904, and grew up
in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father was Professor of Romance languages at
the University of Michigan. He received an A.B. degree from the University of
Michigan in 1925, and worked in the publicity department of the General
Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, from 1925 to 1930. In 1930 he moved
to Baltimore, Maryland, where he began work at the Baltimore Sun newspapers. He
was editorial writer for The Sun 1930-1936, London correspondent for The Sun
1936-1937, editor of the editorial page of The Evening Sun until 1943, then The
Sun until 1964.</p>
<p>His interest in grapes and winemaking is evident in a photograph circa
1910 showing him attempting to work a basket press. He became seriously
involved in vineyard cultivation and winemaking after moving to Baltimore
during Prohibition. In 1932 he rented a property in Riderwood, Maryland that
had the remains of a twenty vine vineyard. After working on the vineyard for a
year, he purchased the property and planted his first vines. In 1933, his first
book, American Wines and How to Make Them was published, and it was at the time
the only available book on the subject in English. For a few years he
experimented with grape varieties, and while on assignment in London he
discovered the French hybrids during a visit to an agricultural station in East
Malling. This led to his importing vines from Maurice Baco in 1938, which in
turn led to the nursery that supplied stock for the thousands of Baco vines in
the East today.</p>
<p>In 1940, he and Jocelyn McDonough were married and formed a lifetime
partnership, "J. and P. Wagner, Props.," subsequently expanding the Boordy
Vineyard and establishing the Boordy Winery, the cornerstone for which was laid
in 1943. In 1945, he published A Wine-Growers Guide. This volume became a
crucial reference for grape growers in the East. Philip and Jocelyn traveled
extensively to the wine growing regions of France, Spain, Italy, Portugal,
Yugoslavia, and Russia in their search for disease-resistant varieties of
grapes that would also be suited for cooler climates. After thirty-five years
the winery was sold in 1980, but until 1994 Philip and Jocelyn operated the
vineyard, selling vines and supplies to private individuals and business
concerns before their health became too poor to continue. Philip Wagner died in
1996.</p>

Charles Davenport Champlin and twelve area businessmen. The company was designated as Bonded
Winery No.1 in its state and federal districts. In 1865 Joseph Masson became the wine-maker
and around this time the production of sparkling wine was initiated. This wine, which was
marketed under the brand name Great Western, became the first American sparkling wine to win
an award in Europe. The awards included first prizes in Vienna, 1873; Paris 1889; Brussels,
1897; Paris, 1900; and Brussels in 1910. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the

rencontres. The magazine went out of business in 2003, apparently due to the move of
this activity to the Internet, which happened in France several years later than in
the United States.</p>

<p>Formed in 2002 in New York City, Queers for Economic Justice (QEJ) was a "progressive
non-profit organization committed to promoting economic justice in a context of
sexual and gender liberation." As described on its website, its goal was "to
challenge and change the systems that create poverty and economic injustice in our
communities, and to promote an economic system that embraces sexual and gender
diversity." Distinctive among LGBTQI groups at the time in its foregrounding of
poverty and class, QEJ introduced different solutions to the national discussion of
the queer agenda. On the local level, it spearheaded changes in New York City laws
and policies affecting homeless transgender people and gave tangible assistance to
the City's queer people in poverty. Its work policies and staff reflected its
commitment to being "multi-racial, multi-classed, multi-cultural group of people of
diverse marginalized sexual and gender identities, as well as diverse ages, skills,
educational levels, backgrounds and abilities."</p>
<p>In 2006, while substantial political effort focused on attaining marriage equality,
QEJ brought together twenty-two activists who crafted a report, later signed by
hundreds, that pushed for a wider vision. The report, titled Beyond Same-Sex
Marriage: A New Strategic Vision For All Our Families and Relationships, became
known as the "Beyond Marriage statement." Over time, QEJ published reports on a
variety of topics at the intersection of gender, sexuality, and economic justice,
offering perspectives on homelessness and housing, economic justice, immigration,
drug laws and public health, marriage and other family forms, and welfare. QEJ's
major initiatives included community organizing, research and policy development,
leadership training, education, outreach, legal aid and advocacy, and community
support groups.</p>
<p>Joseph DeFilippis was QEJ's founding executive director. Subsequent leaders were
Kenyon Farrow (2009-2011) and Amber Hollibaugh (2011-2014). Jay Toole served as
QEJ's founding and only Shelter Director, leading the organization's work relating
to housing and homelessness. Among the other LGBTQ, anti-racism, and anti-poverty
activists and scholars engaged with the work of QEJ were Ricky Blum Terry Boggis,
Ann Cammett, Aine Duggan, Lisa Duggan, Kenyon Farrow, Monroe France, Felix Gardon,
Reina Gossett, Richard Kim, Maureen Lane, Ignacio Rivera, Dean Spade, and Jessica
Stern.</p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties, QEJ closed in 2014. The organization's projects in the
areas of housing and work continue through Jay's House, a shelter non-profit
organization in Brooklyn</p>

<p>Rave flyers became one of the most potent symbols of youth culture in the 1990s.
Their bright colors signifying a return to psychedelia, their computer-generated
design a clue to future technology fetishes, their dense text an invitation to a
subculture with its own deities and language. As the popularity of raves grew, it
became essential to create flashy, eye-catching flyers to outdo all the other
flyers. Flyers grew in both size and complexity. Imported from Chicago in the late
1980s, the English Rave scene paired the country's youth counter culture with house
music and Ecstasy and led to a club scene community that could generate parties with
thousands of participants, spilling over from London warehouses to countryside
fields. English DJs developed their own sound, drawing upon American Hip Hop imports
and accessible at-home technologies. The music found its way to radio through pirate
stations, and a few bands like Prodigy and N-Joi were able to crossover to FM pop
stations.</p>

<p>Cinematographer, nicknamed “the ace cameraman of MGM,” and singled out in 1939 by
pioneer film historian Lewis Jacobs as one of America's finest cinematographers.
Born in Ithaca, N.Y., June attended Columbia University (evidently without

and then moved to Hollywood after the war to embark on a career in cinematography.
In the 1920s, he was the cameraman for a “Rin-Tin-Tin” film, and throughout the
1930s and 1940s, he continued to turn out works of distinction at both Goldwyn and
MGM studios. He was nominated for an Academy Award three times, in 1932, 1935, and

<p>Rest of the News was a radical radio news group formed in Ithaca, New
York in 1971. The group produced 10-15 minute broadcasts following the regular
news on WVBR in Ithaca, focusing on significant current topics such as the
Attica Prison rebellion of 1971, the liberation movement in Zimbabwe, the
Native American movement, the War in Vietnam, and other issues. Broadcasts
included interviews with leading participants in these events interwoven with a
script and music. By 1973, ROTN was reaching radio stations across the country
and launched a weekly national subscription service for its news tapes. An
internal split in 1975 led to the moving of ROTN and its files and tapes to New
York City in the middle of the night. The more radical New York contingent
continued broadcasting for about a year, but its strident, rhetorical style
caused radio stations to cancel the service, and the New York program
folded.</p>
<p>The Ithaca faction had meanwhile reorganized and, within a year of the
split, began broadcasting again. The Ithaca program lasted two years longer
than the New York program, but it folded, in part due to lack of outside
support.</p>

<p>Richard David Cushman received an AB in 1962, MA in 1968 and Ph.D. in anthropology from
Cornell University in 1970. His main work was with the Yao tribal people in northern
Thailand, an ethnic group which is mainly located in south China. The Yao have a strong
literary tradition, expressed in Chinese characters but in Yao language; their religious
tradition is apparently something close to Taoism. One of Cushman's main preoccupations
during field work in Thailand in the early 1970s was to collect Yao texts. He collected
these by two main methods: 1) he hired older men to copy their religious texts into
hardbacked notebooks; and 2) when he could obtain access to the original manuscripts, he
photographed them. He also tape recorded Yao music and chanting on reel-to-reel audio
tape.</p>

<p>Colonial Robert J. Foster was an esteemed veterinarian and military officer. He was born on September 27, 1880, in Youngstown, Ohio. He moved with his family to Ithaca, New York, and graduated from Ithaca High School in 1899. He went on to attend the New York State Veterinary College at Cornell University and graduated in 1902 with a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine. Following graduation he taught veterinary science for three years. While teaching at the University of Missouri, he met Miss Alice Ewing Johnson, who was then a member of the freshman class. She was daughter of the late Colonel T.A. Johnson, president of Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. Miss Johnson received her A.B. degree in 1908 and married Robert Foster in June, 1909. </p>
<p>On August 30, 1905, Foster enlisted in the Army as a veterinarian for 12th U.S. Cavalry. When the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps was established in 1916, he became one of the key officers in its development. He moved through the ranks and served in a variety of locales around the globe for nearly thirty years. His accomplishments include organizing veterinary training programs, assisting in the reorganization and refinement of the Veterinary Corps in its first 30 years, and establishing meat and dairy inspection plans for the Army as well as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps. </p>
<p>In 1944, Foster officially retired. Upon his retirement he and his wife settled in San Francisco and enjoyed traveling to such places as Alaska, Africa and Spain. In 1956, he received distinguished service awards from the California Veterinary Medical Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association. </p>
<p>Col. Foster died in California in February 1970.</p>

<p>Robert J. Leach was born on November 4, 1916 in Reading, Massachusetts. He attended
Marietta College in Ohio from 1934-1938 and received his Master's degree in History from
Ohio State University. In 1939, Leach joined the Religious Society of Friends and has
remained active as a Quaker member and elder since that time. Throughout his youth, he
experienced crushes on boys that he tried to ignore, and in 1941, he fell in love with a
man for the first time. They did not, however, get involved. A conscientious objector
during World War II, Leach served in the Civilian Public Service from 1942-1946. From
1946-1950, Leach was an assistant professor of History at Salem College in North
Carolina. In 1950 and 1951, Leach completed all of his course work for a doctoral degree
at the University of Geneva, and in 1951 was appointed head of History at the
International School of Geneva. He has maintained a residence in Switzerland ever since.
He remained at the School for thirty years where he co-founded the International
Baccalaureate Program. His research has included comparative religion and comparative
civilization, although his most recent publications have focused on whaling and
Nantucket Quaker history. <lb/><lb/> In 1953, he married Jean Frances, who had won
Junior Wimbledon in 1938, and who had taught auto-mechanics in the British Army during
the War. He and Jean had two children, David R.F. Leach, in 1954, and Felicity M.K.
Leach, in 1955. David became a lecturer in Molecular Genetics in Scotland at Edinburgh
University, and Felicity became a world level rowing champion and an expert in audio
visual studies. Before Robert and Jean married, he told her that he believed he was
bisexual. Her response was, "That is your business." They were happily married for
almost 28 years. After Jean's death in 1981, Leach identified himself as gay and told
his children and later his grandchildren, all of whom reacted very supportively. He also
sent a "coming out" letter to five hundred friends and acquaintances, about half of whom
Leach claims have avoided him since. From 1981-1982 and 1993-1994, Leach traveled around
the world. The earlier trip gave rise to relationships with two Thai men named Noui and
Toek (last names not provided). Leach's relationship with Toek lasted over four years,
and Toek has since had a sex change operation. The relationship is well documented in
the collection. </p>

<p> Robert Lynch was born with the name Larry O'Neal Lynch on 14 September 1947 near Enfield, in Halifax County, eastern North Carolina. He was the oldest of the five children of Izetta Hedgepeth Lynch and Randolph Lynch. After graduating from Eastman High School in Enfield, North Carolina and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he attended Harvard Law School. After practicing as an attorney in New York City, where he specialized in corporate and securities law, he became involved with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. In August of 1975, he returned to rural North Carolina, living for a time at "Redbird Cabin," a neglected cottage in the woods not far from the home in which he was a child. Lynch referred to this as his "Thoreauvian period"; there, for an especially intensive period of four years, and for the rest of his life, he wrote poetry, kept close and introspective poetic and impressionistic diaries, and researched his complex ancestries. In the 1970s, he

also travelled and hitchhiked in America and internationally, frequently visiting friends in metropolitan areas. In 1979 he moved into "Izetta House," the home in which he had grown up. By 1980 he was referring to himself as Robert Benjamin Richardson Lynch, though his family and those who had known him as Larry, continued to call him that. He also spent periods of a year or less as the Officer of Housing, Economic Development and Cultural Affairs for Princeville, North Carolina, as Development Director for WVSP Public Radio in Warrenton, North Carolina, and as a consultant to the Dance Theatre of Harlem. In the early 1980s, Lynch became involved in studying and collecting folk art, (or primitive art, or <emph render="italic">l'art brut</emph>), which he referred to as "outsider art." As a field collector and dealer, Lynch acquired examples and assembled a large photographic representation of outsider art, and also created a video on the subject. In 1987 he became aware of

having contracted AIDS. Lynch died on 13 March 1989.</p>

<p>Robert M. Palmer was the Given Foundation Professor Emeritus of Music at Cornell
University, where he taught composition and music theory for 37 years. He was born
in Syracuse in 1915. After basic studies in piano, violin, and theory, he entered
the Eastman School of Music in 1934 as a pianist, but soon decided to major in
composition under Bernard Rogers and Howard Hanson. During this period, he also
studied informally with Quincy Porter, who exerted a formative influence on his
style. After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at Eastman, Palmer took
private composition lessons with Roy Harris in 1939 and with Aaron Copland at the
opening session of Tanglewood during the summer of 1940. He taught composition,
theory, and piano at the University of Kansas at Lawrence, before joining the
Cornell faculty in 1943, where he replaced his own teacher, Roy Harris.</p>
<p>At Cornell, Palmer founded the Doctor of Musical Arts program in composition (one of
the first such programs in the United States) and guided it to national prominence
before his retirement in 1980. Among Palmer's former students are Pulitzer-prize
winning composers Steven Stucky and Christopher Rouse, as well as Paul Chihara,
Leonard Lehrman, Jack Gallagher, and the late Brian Israel. Palmer held awards and
fellowships from the National Academy of Arts and Letters (1946), Guggenheim
Foundation (1952 and 1960), Fulbright program (1960), and the National Endowment for
the Arts (1980). His music was commissioned by the Columbia Broadcasting System,

<p>Robert Roth was born in Englewood, New Jersey in 1950. He graduated from the Horace Mann School in 1967, Cornell University in 1971, and the Fordham Law School in 1975. While at Cornell, he was one of the co-founders of the Student Homophile League (later the Gay Liberation Front), which at the time was only the second gay rights organization among U.S. universities. As a lawyer, he specialized in landlord-tenant cases, winning the landmark Chin vs. London Management case in 1982, which ruled that unmarried tenants shared survivors' rights to an apartment. Another courtroom victory established First Amendment rights for the Swedish gay magazine "Revolt," which had been seized by U.S. Customs. In New York City, where he lived, Roth was involved with several legal and human rights organizations, particularly the Bar Association for Human Rights of Greater New York.</p>
<p>a principal project of Robert Roth was the compilation and cataloguing of international gay publications, and the accumulation of information and documents pertaining to the international gay rights movement. In addition to collecting numerous periodicals from many countries and all parts of the world, he corresponded with gay people in developing countries where there was no gay freedom movement, providing contacts and materials to those who might otherwise have had little awareness of or access to the international gay liberation movement. He used his several travels abroad to collect further printed material and publications to broaden his international collection. Many of the publications are very rare, and provide insight into the emerging issues of gay rights throughout the world in the 1970s and 1980s. One component of his international collection is lists and

bibliographies of international gay organizations, and publications. He also corresponded with several leaders in the movement, especially John D. Stamford of "Spartacus," John Hubert and "Paz y Liberacion," and Claude Courouve of "Aleph."</p>
<p>Roth privately published a newsletter (1977-1979), which discussed the international gay rights movement, and was instrumental in promoting and distributing other publications concerned with the issue, particularly "Paz y Liberacion." Under the pseudonym "Calaph Timmerman," Roth published in 1988 an article "Home Remedies for the Holocaust - A Few Simple Techniques for Staying Alive," which was widely distributed. another major undertaking was a microform project with the National Gay Archives and Library, for which he composed an extensive bibliography of gay periodicals and publications.</p>
<p>Roth died of AIDS related causes and Hodgkins Disease in July of 1990. Prior to his death he had been in contact with Brenda J. Marston of the Human Sexuality Collection, and had made arrangements for the gift of his personal papers and international collection.</p>

<p>Robert Rathbun Wilson was born in 1914 in Frontier Wyoming, received an A.B. from the
University of California, Berkeley, 1936, and after studying with Prof. Ernest O.
Lawrence, a Ph.D. in 1940.</p>
<p>He participated in an early effort led by Enrico Fermi at Columbia University to build a
nuclear reactor as part of a joint effort with Princeton University, where he was a
lecturer and assistant professor, 1940-1942. He worked for Princeton University's
reactor project, 1941-1942; becoming technical head of their isotope separation project,
1942-1943, and developing a uranium isotope-separating machine. He moved to Los Alamos
Laboratory in 1943, one of the first to reside there, helping with early organization
and formation of the Cyclotron Group, and becoming Head of the Research Division,
1944-1945. In 1945 he became Associate Professor of Physics at Harvard University where
he designed the 150 MeV cyclotron and suggested radiological use of high-energy heavy
particles for cancer therapy. He also worked on scattering of protons by protons to
higher energies, using the cyclotron at the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley,
1946-1947.</p>
<p>He came to Cornell University in 1947, working on building a series of electron
synchrotrons, beginning with a 300 MeV machine and achieving 10 GeV in 1967. He and his
colleagues made many discoveries regarding the inner structure of the proton including
discovery of the first excited state of the proton and its next two excited states as
well as scattering of electrons by protons. They were able to measure the production of
K-mesons by X-ray beam. Dr. Wilson made the first measurement of the scattering of
protons by the electric field of the nucleus of the atom, continuing this work while
serving as Prof. d'Exchange at the University of Paris, France, in 1956. Also during his
tenure at Cornell he conceived the idea to achieve the result of a high temperature in
plasma by producing an imploding shock wave in an ionized gas through the sudden
application of a strong magnetic field. He was one of the first to use the Monte Carlo
method of mathematical computation, applying it to electron and proton initiated
showers, invented the Quantometer to precisely measure the intensity of high-energy
X-ray beams.</p>
<p>In 1967 he became first Director of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in
Batavia, Illinois. He held this position during its founding and assisted in the design
and construction of the entire complex, which included a 500 GeV proton accelerator. The
most notable of the approximately 250 experiments concerned interaction of neutrinos and
muons at high energy and discovery of the "b quark." He also initiated to design and
construction of the Tevatron, a system of superconducting magnets to raise the energy of
the Fermilab synchrotron to one TeV (1000 GeV). In 1978 he was made Emeritus
Director.</p>
<p>He then held the position of Peter B. Ritzma Professor at University of Chicago,
1978-1980, being named "Emeritus" in 1980. His then became I. I. Rabi Visiting Professor
of Science and Human Relations at Columbia University in 1979; and the Michael Pupin
Prof. at Columbia University, 1980-1982, becoming "Emeritus" in 1982.</p>
<p>During his career he assisted in the design and construction of cyclotrons and
synchrotrons in the United States and Europe and participated in many international
symposia relating to high energy physics. He became a member of the American Physical
Society in 1938, president in 1985; helped found the Federation of American Scientists,
Chairman in 1946 and 1963; was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1957, the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968, and the American Philosophical Society in
1969. He served on the Editorial Board of the magazine Daedalus. He was also affiliated
with many other organizations having to do with teaching physics and high energy physics
research, as well as arts and letters.</p>
<p>He received the Elliot Cresson Award in 1964, National Medal of Science in 1973, Enrico
Fermi Award in 1984, del Gado Gold Medal of Radiology in 1989, and the Gemant Award in
1995. He has received honorary degrees from University of Notre Dame, Sci Dr 1969; North
Central College, ScD 1975; University of Bonn, ScD 1978; Harvard University, Sci Dr
1986, and Wesleyan University, Sci Dr 1987. He co-authored, with Raphael Littauer, the
book "Accelerators" published in 1958.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson has been active in international physics attending numerous meetings
including the conference organizing CERN, 1952, in Copenhagen; one of the earliest in
the USSR, 1954; the Peoples Republic of China, 1974; meetings in New Orleans, 1975;
Moscow, 1976; Hamburg, 1977; and Fermilab, 1978. He participated in the organization of
the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA), of which he was an American
delegate.</p>
<p>While on sabbatic leave in Italy in 1961, Wilson studied sculpture at the Academia Belli
Arte.</p>

<p>As a doctoral student in the History Department of Binghamton University, Rochella
(Roey) Thorpe researched lesbian life in Detroit, 1947-1975. She looked at the quite
separate environments of African-American and white lesbians created in the Post War
era. Within racial groups, lesbians mostly associated with women of similar economic
backgrounds. Rather than finding one homogenous lesbian community, Thorpe found many
different lesbian communities, and looked at the ways these communities and their
survival strategies changed over time.</p>
<p>Her study is based in Detroit, a city that saw great urban growth and racial tension
prior to and during World War II. Women's work in Detroit's wartime factories
represented significant changes for both white and African-American women. After World
War II, the fear of spreading communism in the automobile unions made Detroit the site

<p>In 1968 John and Barbara Williamson, a married couple, purchased a 15 acre estate
known as the Sandstone Ranch in Topanga Canyon outside of Los Angeles. John and
Barbara were interested in revolutionary theories for improving the human condition
and focused their hopes on addressing what they believed were society's false
assumptions about love and marriage. After extensive remodeling, they opened
Sandstone Retreat as a private, secluded commune for adults where nudity and open
sexuality were encouraged. The goal of this group experiment was to explore an
alternative lifestyle in a community where a person's mind, body and sexuality came
together in total abandonment. Sandstone had beautiful views of the Malibu Mountains
and Pacific Ocean. The combination of natural beauty and pleasure were intended to
offer a retreat from artificiality.</p>
<p>Formally known as the Sandstone Foundation for Community Systems Research, Inc.,
research was part of its intentions and purpose. John was an engineer with a focus
on whole systems. He researched why our culture resulted in such misery, unhappiness
and chaos, and he determined that our society's principles were based on false
assumptions, especially those about sex and sexuality.</p>
<p>Sandstone was based on a concept that John and Barbara called, "open sexuality."
Sandstone offered individuals and couples an opportunity to love openly and
unselfishly. John and Barbara's philosophy was one of living with like-minded
pleasure seekers, where married couples could openly share their mates with others
just for the sheer pleasure of it; and could joyfully and freely have sex just
because they wanted to and it felt good, without jealousy and possessiveness. They
believed that this concept wouldn't make couples stop loving one another, when done
with the other's full knowledge and approval; for if you really deeply loved
someone, you would want them to experience all the pleasures life has to offer. They
believed society would have more freedom if people practiced openness and honesty in
their sexual relations and experienced sex with a group of people. They introduced
this idea of "open sexuality" as a viable alternate lifestyle that would change the
way the world viewed marriage, commitments and sexuality. John believed that sexual
democracy is a birthright.</p>
<p>Gay Talese put Sandstone on the cultural map. After living at Sandstone and
experiencing it first hand, he wrote Thy Neighbor's Wife in 1980, an examination of
America's changing sexual culture. Talese writes about John Williamson, "Like the
founding fathers of other utopian settlements in the past, he was unhappy with the
world around him. He regarded contemporary life in America as destructive to the
spirit, organized religion as a celestial swindle, the federal government as
cumbersome and avaricious; he saw the average wage earner as existing only with
detached participation in a computerized society." Robert Francoeur wrote
extensively about Sandstone in his book, Hot and Cool Sex; and in the 1973 edition
of More Joy of Sex, Dr. Alex Comfort discussed the ideas of the Sandstone
Retreat.</p>
<p>Sandstone became one of the hubs of the sexual revolution. Over the years, magazine
articles referred to Barbara as "the most liberated woman in America," a courageous
woman who threw herself into the quest for an alternative lifestyle, a woman
unafraid to say she wanted to change the world. Few women at this time in history
had attempted to go up against the cultural edicts as Barbara did. Media referred to
John as the "king of the sexual revolution" and the "messiah of sex."</p>
<p>In 1973, the Williamsons decided to close Sandstone and set their sights on a bigger
project to influence culture. They aimed to build a tribal community in the
wilderness of Montana to improve humanity and help make the world a better place.
There scientists and religious leaders would work together in planning the future in
order to steer our society to flourish. This undertaking was called Project Synergy,
but the Federal Government claimed the site and prevented any further building. The
idea never came to fruition.</p>
<p>John died March 24, 2013 in Fallon, Nevada where he and Barbara had created Tiger
Touch Sanctuary, a place and home where big cats could safely and lovingly live out
the rest of their lives in peace.</p>

<p>Sarah Brown Ingersoll was born on December 12, 1835 in Cazenovia, New York, the eldest
in a family of three girls. She attended Cazenovia Seminary, where she met Halsey
Fenimore Cooper, and Troy Female Seminary. Halsey and Sarah married in 1855 and moved to
Chattanooga, Tennessee, where they worked together at a newspaper called <title>The
Advertiser</title>, Halsey as the editor and Sarah as the assistant editor. They had
two daughters: Harriet in 1856 and Mollie in 1861. The family fled the Civil War in 1861
and moved to Washington D.C., but returned south to Memphis in 1863. Mollie's death in
1864 cast Sarah into a deep depression and she became gravely ill. Sarah spent two years
recuperating in St. Paul, Minnesota, but her health did not drastically improve until
Halsey moved the family to San Francisco in 1869.</p>
<p> In San Francisco, Sarah taught a Bible Class at the Calvary Presbyterian Church which
became hugely popular, and her class of seven students increased to hundreds within a
few years. In 1879 Sarah founded the <title>Jackson Street Kindergarten
Association,</title> later to be renamed <title>The Golden Gate Kindergarten
Association,</title> and opened the first free kindergarten west of the Rocky
Mountains in San Francisco. The family lived happily in San Francisco until 1879 when
Halsey lost his job with the Internal Revenue Service. Sarah was heavily involved in
many religious, educational, and social justice organizations but did not receive
remuneration for any of these projects. The family experienced a serious financial
strain and had difficulty covering their mortgage payments. In 1885 a group of the
Coopers' friends secretly put together a fund to pay their mortgage in full and were
planning to present it to the family as a Christmas present. Unfortunately, the friends'
effort was in vain. Halsey could not live with the shame of not being able to provide
for his family and tragically committed suicide on December 6, 1885. After a period of
intense grieving, Sarah set out to clear Halsey's name. John Morton, Surveyor of the
Internal Revenue Service, claimed in interviews that he had offered Halsey another
position after removing him from his post as Deputy Surveyor. Sarah wrote and published
a scathing denunciation entitled <title>A Refutation,</title> in which she included
reprints of correspondence between John Morton and her late husband that effectively
disproved John Morton's claims.</p>
<p> Sarah and Harriet continued with their philanthropic pursuits and Harriet quit her
teaching job in order to act as her mother's personal secretary and dedicate more of her
time to Kindergarten and Women's groups. Sarah was a tireless worker; it was unusual for
her to rise much later than 5 o'clock in the morning. In addition to her Bible School
and Kindergarten work, Sarah was also involved with Suffrage and Women's rights
organizations and served as Treasurer for the General Federation of Women's Clubs.
Harriet kept up with her mother's grueling pace for a few years before finally
succumbing to exhaustion. Harriet had suffered from mild spells of melancholia
throughout her life and these became more acute after the death of her father. Sarah was
unwilling to institutionalize her only daughter and instead took it upon herself to care
for her as best she could. Sarah was able to thwart Harriet's suicide attempts for a few
months but Harriet ultimately succeeded in killing her mother and herself on December
11, 1896, the eve of Sarah's 60th birthday.</p>

of a volunteer-run science program at a local elementary school. Founded in 1983,
the Sciencenter operated from storefronts for nearly a decade. In 1993, the museum
opened the first phase of its permanent home. Phase II opened in 1996 and provided
additional program space. Phase III, which opened in 2003, expanded the Sciencenter
to 32,000 sq. ft. During the decade from 1992-2002, 3,400 volunteers donated 50,000
hours of time to construct the Sciencenter. In 2010, the Sciencenter acquired an
additional 8,000 sq. ft. building to support its growing traveling exhibition
program. Today, the Sciencenter is a nationally recognized museum, hosting 100,000
guests in Ithaca each year and reaching over 1.5 million guests worldwide through
our traveling exhibitions and outreach programs. The Sciencenter is accredited by

<p>The Screamers were an American punk rock group formed in 1975 that participated in the first
wave Los Angeles, California punk scene. Often categorized as electropunk, their sound included
a synthesizer (ARP Odyssey) and electric piano (Fender Rhodes). Other punk musicians and bands
have cited the Screamers as a key influence. The group never released an official recording of
any kind, although several bootleg recordings of rehearsals or live performances have since
appeared; they have been called one of the great unrecorded groups in rock history. Artist Gary
Panter's logo for the band, a stylized cartoon of a screaming head with spiked hair, became one
of the most recognizable images to emerge from punk rock.</p>

<p>Lead Belly (Leadbelly), born Huddie William Ledbetter, was a blues musician and a
prominent figure in the early years of the American folk movement. He was
multi-instrumental, but mostly known for his skills on the 12-string guitar. In his
early 20's Lead Belly left home and wandered through Louisiana and Texas earning a
living by playing guitar whenever he could. He played with the blues singer Blind
Lemon Jefferson for a short while.</p>
<p>Lead Belly's temper often landed him in jail. In 1915 he was sentenced to a
chain-gang in Harrison County. In 1918, Lead Belly killed a relative and was sent to
jail for a second time. After writing a song appealing to Governor Pat Morris Neff,
Lead Belly was released having only served 7 of his 35 year sentence. While serving
time in the 1930's for attempted homicide, Lead Belly was discovered by folklorist
John Lomax and his son. Together they recorded hundreds of Lead Belly's songs for
the Library of Congress. Lomax also used these songs for his book, "Negro Folk Songs
as Sung by Lead Belly" (1939).</p>
<p>Upon his release, Lead Belly teamed up with John Lomax, gaining wide recognition
within the recording industry. After a falling out with Lomax, Lead Belly continued
recording his music. He was given a regular radio broadcast on Henrietta Yurchenko's
show on WNYC in New York and toured in Europe. Lead Belly died in 1949 of lateral
sclerosis.</p>

<p>Michael A. McCarthy’s career as an architect spanned more than four decades and produced
a wide variety of buildings for corporate and institutional clients. He also worked on
interior design projects as well as preservation and rehabilitation projects for
buildings belonging to, both, recent and historic past. McCarthy also served on art
advisory committees, most notably that of the Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
<p>Michael Anthony McCarthy was born on July 15, 1934 in Buffalo, New York. In 1957, he
received the Bachelor of Architecture degree at Cornell University, where his fifth-year
thesis project won accolades. In 1957, he worked briefly for the firm Harbach and Clark.
Upon graduation he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Army and chose to do
active duty in the Far East, where he visited places such as Korea, Japan, Hong Kong,
Hawaii, and Macau. After completing his army service, he was granted the Eidlitz
Fellowship, an award administered by the Department of Architecture at Cornell. He then
worked for three years for Foit and Baschnagel, until 1963, when he received the license
to practice architecture in New York State, and became a member of the American
Institute of Architects. He received his M.Arch. degree in 1964 from Graduate School of
Design at Harvard University.</p>
<p> In the autumn of 1964, McCarthy was hired by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), a
leading architectural firm credited with iconic modernist works. McCarthy’s work as a
Junior Designer for the Gordon Bunshaft designed headquarters of the American Can
Company in Greenwich, Connecticut led to his promotion to Participating Associate in
1967, and to Partner in 1973. Worldwide, McCarthy has designed mixed-use, office,
residential, and recreational complexes for sites in Europe, the Far East, the Middle
East, and Latin America. His awareness of and sensitivity to cultures outside the United
States were particularly notable in the Middle East, where he designed interiors for the
Joint Banking Center, the Commercial Bank of Kuwait, the Al Ahli Bank in Kuwait, and the
National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia in New York, among others. His work for the
Chase Manhattan Bank, which he considers as among the most rewarding and satisfying
experiences of his career, consisted of designs for new buildings as well as significant
contributions to the style and experience of their interiors, both through his own
designs and by serving on their art committee. Over the course of his career, he also
contributed to the interior designs of corporate clients, such as General Electric,
Texaco, IBM, and Chrysler. McCarthy’s work with SOM has won many honors and awards. </p>
<p>He served on the Cornell University Council and the College of Architecture’s Advisory
Council endowed a Chair of Architectural Theory at the Cornell University College of
Architecture, Art, and Planning; and gifted to the Cornell University Library of the
drawings, slides, photographs, and other related materials documenting his career as an
architect He regarded the gift of his papers to Cornell as one of the most important
contributions he has made to architectural education. He also provided a research fund
for use of the collection by students and scholars. </p>

<p>In 1989, the New York State Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission, under
federal mandate to find a home for low-level nuclear waste, notified Allegany County
in western New York that it was one of ten counties under consideration. Citizens of
Allegany County successfully defeated the facility through a grassroots movement and
organization, the Concerned Citizens of Allegany County (CCAC), co-founded by
Stephen Myers; a separate organization for civil disobedience, Allegany NonViolent
Action Group (AGNAG); and a legal case on Tenth Amendment grounds relating to the
siting of a nuclear waste facility. A separate Public Health Task Force was also
established to deal with issues of safety, health standards, and environmental
quality. The legal challenge forced New York State to review the challenge posed by
Allegany and Cortland Counties to the constitutionality of the siting process at the
state level.</p>
<p>The issue eventually went to the United States Supreme Court, after three defeats at
the state level and a petition signed by 13,000 residents. The decision, New York v.
U.S. et al., determined that "Congress cannot force states to assume ownership and
liability of low-level radioactive waste within its borders."</p>

<p>The Stevens family documented in this collection can be traced to Otho Stevens of
unknown parentage and birthplace, although it is probable he was born in Great
Britain and certainly died in Hampstead, N.H. in 1771. Descendent and resident of
Pittsford, NY, Robert Croll Stevens, a genealogist and biographer, collected
materials documenting the personal and professional lives of five generations of
Stevens family, beginning with Alden Sprague Stevens, 1795-1874, a member of the
fourth generation of the Stevens family.</p>
<p>Other major members of the Stevens family documented in this collection in descending
order of generation are: Robert (Wadleigh) Smith Stevens, Frederick Charles Stevens,
Robert Sproule Stevens, and the collector himself, Robert Croll Stevens. In
addition, published and unpublished materials relating to members of the immediate
families of these men has been carefully sought and included.</p>

<p>On September 27, 1814 the parish of St. John's was formed by the organization of "the
wardens and vestrymen of St. John's Church in Canandaigua under the supervision of
Bishop J.H. Hobart." The parish's first church building was consecrated December 12,
1816, but as soon as 1822, debt forced the society to advertise it for sale. A gift
of $1500 by the Trinity Church of New York City, and an additional $5000 subscribed
by members and friends of the church made its sale unnecessary. In 1873 this church
was demolished and a new one was constructed.</p>

Vibrations, and in 1984 launched the first U.S. lesbian sex magazine, On Our Backs, with
photographer Honey Lee Cottrell, publisher Deborah Sundahl, and Nan Kinney. Susie served as
the magazine’s editor. An expert on the history of the pornography business and its
censorship, she has reviewed erotic movies and written broadly about sexual issues.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Detailed biography: </emph>Susannah "Susie" Bright (also known as Susie
Sexpert) (born March 25, 1958) is an American feminist, author, journalist, critic, editor,
publisher, producer, and performer, often on the subject of sexual politics. Known for her
founding role in the magazine On Our Backs, she is also an expert on the history of the
pornography business and its censorship and has reviewed erotic movies and written broadly
about sexual issues. She is one of the first writer/activists referred to as a sex-positive
feminist. <lb/>     As a teenager, Bright was active in the 1970s
in various left-wing progressive causes, in particular the feminist, labor, civil rights,
and anti-war movements. She was one of the members of the high school underground newspaper,
The Red Tide, and served as Plaintiff suing the Los Angeles Board of Education for the right
of minors to distribute their own publications without prior censorship or approval.
(Judgement in favor of Plaintiff). <lb/>     She was a member of
the International Socialists from 1974-1976 and worked as a labor and community organizer in
Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Detroit, MI, and Louisville, Kentucky.
<lb/>     Bright was one of the founding members of Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, and wrote under the pseudonym Sue Daniels in both <emph render="italic">The Red Tide</emph> and <emph render="italic">Workers' Power</emph>.
<lb/>     Bright trained with San Francisco Sex Information in
1981. From 1981 to 1986, she worked for and managed Good Vibrations, which Joani Blank had
opened in San Francisco in 1977, the second feminist sex toy shop in the country (after Dell
Williams’ Eve’s Garden). Bright wrote Good Vibrations’ first mail order catalog, the first
sex toy catalog written from a women’s point of a view to a female audience. She founded the
Good Vibrations Erotic Video Library, the first feminist curation of erotic films available
at the time. During this time, she got involved with a group of artists called "Mainstream
Exiles" and co-wrote and starred in two plays: "Girls Gone Bad" and "Knife, Paper,
Scissors." <lb/>     In 1984, she launched the first women-produced
magazine on the topic of sex and erotica, <emph render="italic">On Our Backs</emph>,
"entertainment for the adventurous lesbian," with photographer Honey Lee Cottrell, publisher
Deborah Sundahl, and Nan Kinney. Susie served as the magazine’s editor until 1991. Known as
the "Pauline Kael of Porn" Bright wrote feminist reviews of erotic films for <emph render="italic">Penthouse</emph> Forum from 1986–1989. She was the first mainstream
journalist who covered the adult industry trade, and Bright was the first female member of
the X-Rated Critics Organization in 1986. <lb/>     She taught the
aesthetics and politics of erotic film imagery starting in 1986 at Cal Arts Valencia, and
then in the early nineties at the University of California. Her film-reviews of independent
and mainstream films and videos are widely published, and her commentary on gay film history
are featured in the documentary film <emph render="italic">The Celluloid Closet</emph>.
<lb/>     Bright founded the first women's erotica book-series,
<emph render="italic">Herotica</emph>, in 1988 and edited the first three volumes. <emph render="italic">Susie Sexpert’s Lesbian Sex World</emph>, the first collection of her own
stories, came out in 1990. She started <emph render="italic">The Best American
Erotica</emph> series in 1993, and has edited it annually since then. She published the
only portfolio of lesbian erotic photography, <emph render="italic">Nothing But the
Girl</emph>, co-edited with Jill Posener, with 30 interviews and photographs from
photographers around the world. It won the Firecracker Award and the Lammie Award in 1997.
She was voted into the XRCO Hall of Fame, 5th Estate, in 2005.
<lb/>     Bright worked a screenwriter and film consultant in
several films: <emph render="italic">Erotique, The Virgin Machine, The Celluloid
Closet</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Bound</emph>, and appeared as herself in an
episode of the HBO television series, Six Feet Under. <lb/>     She
started a website in March 1997, and began her blog, <emph render="italic">Susie Bright’s
Journal</emph>, in 2004. <lb/>     Since 2000, she has produced
and hosted a weekly program <emph render="italic">In Bed with Susie Bright</emph> on
Audible, Inc., where she discusses a variety of social, freedom of speech and sex-related
topics. Interviews, book and movie reviews are common, as are letters from listeners.

<p>The Presbyterian Church of Dansville was organized on March 25, 1825 by members of
the Presbytery of Bath, and was received under the care of that Presbytery on August
30th of that year. The church had eleven members, nine of whom were from the First
Church in Sparta and two of whom were from Buffalo. In 1826 when the church
transferred to the Presbytery of Ontario, the church had 32 members.</p>
<p>The congregation worshipped in various school houses until 1831 when a church costing
$3,500 was built. Land for the building and $1,000 was donated by Joshua Shepard. In
1840 dissatisfaction arose and a separate church called the First Presbyterian of
Dansville was formed. In 1842 they completed a church which burned in 1854, after
which the group met at a hall or at the Lutheran church. After 1855 when the
minister left the group, there was no regular pastor or preaching. The two churches
were reunited at the solicitation of the Presbytery on January 15, 1861 after which
they went by its former name.</p>

<p>Underground comix are small press, underground or self-published comic books which
often present alternative or counter cultural viewpoints. Subjects frequently
include alternative lifestyles, satirical challenges to middle-class values and
mainstream culture, with regular appearances of recreational drug use, nudity,
disrespect for authority, rock n' roll, political dissent, or gratuitous sex and
violence. These topics resonated with youth culture of the 1960s and 70s, which set
itself at odds with mainstream adult America. Several of the titles present in this
collection, such as Horseshit, Zap, Snatch, and the SCUM Manifesto, were banned by
various local authorities, resulting in the arrests of some publishers and news

<p>In 1977, eleven states collaborated under the direction of Cornell Professor Kathryn Walker to do time-use surveys. Each state was responsible for collecting the time-use data from residents of their respective state. While there were a set of questions common to all eleven states, each state could add questions on associated issues. The project was funded by an Interstate USDA grant and was sponsored by the Agricultural Experiment Stations of California, Connecticut, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER) has the digitized data collected in the eleven states from the common questions that were used.</p>
<p>This collection contains uncoded data on diet, time-use, gender roles, etc. of Utah families that were surveyed by the Utah component of the 1977 eleven state survey. 210, two parent, two child families, half living in urban areas and half living in rural areas of Utah were surveyed and Professor Jane McCullough of Utah State University was the princiapl investigator.</p>

<head>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE AND CHRONOLOGY</head>
<p>Born September 7, 1913, in Aurora, Illinois, Velma Nacella Young received a two-year scholarship to attend Blackburn College, in Carlinville, IL, in 1935. There, she met Ada Mayer and her husband Hank, a socialist labor organizer. They introduced her to grassroots activism and became lifelong friends.</p>
<p>Velma Young taught at various country schools in Illinois from 1937 to 1940. In 1939, she married William Jerry Tate and took the name Velma Tate. They had three sons, Marshall in 1940 and twins Jerry and Jim in 1942. In 1953, she divorced Jerry Tate and worked to support her sons. The same year, she published her first novel,

<title>Hired Girl.</title> She published her first lesbian novel, <title>Whisper Their Love,</title> in 1957 using the pen name Valerie Taylor and came to be known widely by that name. <title>Whisper Their Love</title> was followed by numerous pulp fiction classics published during the 1950s and 1960s, including: <title>The Girls in 3-B,</title>
<title>Stranger on Lesbos,</title>
<title>A World Without Men,</title>
<title>Unlike Others,</title>
<title>The Secret of the Bayou,</title>
<title>Journey to Fulfillment,</title> and <title>Return to Lesbos.</title>
</p>
<p>She also contributed stories, reviews and criticism to

<title>The Ladder,</title> a national lesbian magazine that debuted in 1956. She published poetry under the name Nacella Young, as well as Valerie Taylor, and romance stories under the name Francine Davenport. Her writing became her career and her means of supporting her family.</p>
<p>Taylor had at least fifty poems published in a variety of venues before Womanpress published

<title>Two Women Revisited</title> in 1976, presenting her poetry along with works by Jeannette H. Foster. She continued to write novels and poetry into the 1990s. Banned Books published a revised and expanded version of <title>Two Women Revisited</title> in 1991. Her more recent books include <title>Love Image,</title>
<title>Prism,</title>
<title>Ripening,</title> and <title>Rice and Beans.</title> Her writing appears in numerous anthologies including <title>Intricate Passions</title> and <title>The Poetry of Sex: Lesbians Write the Erotic.</title> Studs Terkel included an interview with Taylor in his 1995 book <title>Coming of Age: The Story of Our Century By Those Who've Lived It.</title>
</p>
<p>An activist for peace and justice, Taylor was a co-founder of Mattachine Midwest in 1965 and of the Lesbian Writers' Conference in Chicago in 1974. She moved to Tucson in 1978 and became active in a Quaker meeting, environmental activities, and advocacy for the elderly. She had also taken part in grassroots organizing of seniors during her years in Margaretville, NY (1975-1978).</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, although afflicted by health problems, she kept giving public talks and lectures and released several interviews. In 1992, she was inducted into the City of Chicago's Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. She enjoyed the love of several grandchildren.</p>
<p>Taylor was 84 years old when she died on October 22, 1997 in Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p> Veranus Alva Moore was born in Houndsfield (Hounsfield), NY, on April 13, 1859. He was raised in Oswego County, New York. When he was 14 years old, he stepped on a nail which caused an infection that kept him on crutches for the next ten years. During those years, Veranus struggled to finish his education while helping his mother support the family and raise his three younger brothers. </p>
<p>In 1883 he entered Cornell University. His work was so impressive that Dr. Simon Henry Gage recommended him for a position with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry before he had completed his degree. He left for Washington in January 1887, wrote his undergraduate thesis in his spare time, and returned in June to graduate with his class. The following fall he entered Columbian (now George Washington) University. He took classes in the evenings and studied during weekends and vacations and received his M.D. in 1890. </p>
<p>Moore's career centered around the study and control of infectious diseases afflicting food animals. He worked for the Bureau of Animal Industry until 1896, then returned to Cornell to become one of the original six professors of the newly founded New York State Veterinary College. He taught Comparative Pathology and Bacteriology as well as meat inspection. In 1908 he became the second dean of the college, succeeding James Law. He served in that post until 1929, and died only two years later on February 11, 1931.</p>

<p>Chinese export watercolors were painted in the port cities of China for sale to
western customers in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Works were done in watercolor
or gouache, initially on European papers, particularly paper produced by the English
firm of J. Whatman, but later on pith"paper," produced from the pith of the Chinese
plant tongcao (generally identified as Tetrapanax papyrifera). Many of the
watercolors were done in sets such as trades, domestic interiors and gardens, boats,
birds, mandarins, punishments, etc. Particularly popular were sets illustrating tea
culture, the silk industry, and the making of porcelain since they explained the
products that were being sent to the west. The watercolors were painted in
workshops, using mass production techniques, so that there may be more than one
version of the same "original." The colors used were those common in Chinese
painting, but there is a clear tendency for primary colors to predominate later in
the 19th century, particularly on the pith paper paintings. They may have originally
been sold in loose paper bindings, but were frequently rebound in Europe in more
elaborate leather bindings.</p>

<p>Professor Millier received his Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell's College of Agriculture in October 1945. He then served as District Agricultural Engineer in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Recognizing the need for a graduate degree and the challenges of ventilating dairy barns, he became a Research Assistant, working with Professor Clesson Turner, and earned his Ph.D. degree in 1950. Their innovative work created a ventilation system that remains a seminal development in ventilation of structures for dairy and other animals. In 1998 his work was honored by a plaque presented by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. The plaque was installed at the entrance of Riley-Robb Hall on the Cornell campus. During his career at the Department of Agricultural Engineering, he was appointed as Associate professor with tenure in July 1956, and Professor in July 1964.

<p>William Reuben George, a social welfare leader, founded the George Junior Republic in 1895
in Freeville, New York as a means of moving boys and girls from the slums into a rural
environment. The Junior Republic, a community reflecting the principles of youthful
self-government, was founded upon the maxim "Nothing Without Labor." With assistance from
his wife Esther Ide Brewster, George developed a community consisting of a farm, blacksmith
and carpentry shops, laundry, bakery, general store, jail, and other elements of the larger
society which were intended to complement citizens' academic endeavors. By 1898, the first
of several institutions based on the Republic's principles was founded in Redington, Pa.,
and by 1908, the National Association of Junior Republics was formed with George as
Executive National Director.</p>

<head id="a2">HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION</head>
<p>When, in the autumn of 1878, George Lincoln Burr -- still a sophomore
at Cornell -- was entrusted by Cornell President White with the care of his
historical library, the collection was allready well under way. White saw the
witch-persecution as a particularly interesting form of fanaticism preceding
the Enlightenment. He was a firm secularist, and, since his 1869 speech on “The
Battle-Fields of Science,” the promoter of the so-called "conflict thesis"
which postulated an intrinsic conflict between science and superstition,
"scientific conclusions" and "theological control." In this never ending war of
ideas, university libraries were viewed as arsenals. White used historical
books and manuscripts in his history classes as early as 1872, and offered them
to the curiosity of researchers. The period 1881-1895 proved the most fruitful
for the expansion of the collection, with an increasing number of original and
complete witch trial records (see for example, box 5, folders 1 and 8). When
White was appointed as the first U.S. ambassador to a unified Germany
(1897-1902), he found himself in a good position to buy from German
booksellers. While witch hunts were seen all across early modern Europe, the
epicenter of the phenomenon was Southwestern Germany and Thuringia. The peak
years of witch hunts were from the 1560s to the 1670s, with more than 10,000
trials ending in executions. With family money and the proceeds from sales of
his book "The History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom"
(1896), A. D. White could afford outstanding documents, such as records of the
witch-trial of Sister Maria Renata Sänger (or Singerin) von Mossau, charged
with bewitching her fellow-nuns, whose execution was the last notorious witch
burning in 1749 (box 5, folder 3). Her tragic case undermined the witch-hunt in
Europe, and White commented upon it in chapter XVI of his book, "From Diabolism
to Hysteria." He paid particular attention to the role played by jurists in
fueling or denouncing the repression, for example in Rinteln, where Friedrich
von Langenfeld wrote his "Cautio Criminalis" in 1631 (cf. box 4, folder 24), or
in Ingolstadt, where the law faculty was particularly active (cf. 4620 Bd.
Manuscript 35 ++).</p>
<p>In his effort to build a unique collection for Cornell Library, White
could count on Burr, who once described himself jokingly as "a witch-hunter in
the book shops." Burr had been captivated by the subject since he read an essay
on the history of torture by Henry Charles Lea (1825-1909) at age fifteen. In
1885, while in Trier, he made a paleographic transcription of the trial of
Dietrich Flade, ex-rector of the University and chief judge of the electoral
court , who opposed the trials and especially the use of torture, and was
arrested, tortured, strangled and burned for that reason in 1589 (Box 2, folder
8, and for the trial record, Bd. Manuscripts 4620 21++). Dietrich Flade, "the
most eminent of the German victims of the persecution," became an icon to both
White and Burr: he was a scholar who earned his fate through his attempt to
check rationally and challenge the beliefs of his time. Having improved his
paleographic skills in University of Leipzig and at the Ecole des chartes in
Paris, Burr even started a doctoral dissertation on Dietrich Flade, and later
published an article titled "The Fate of Dietrich Flade" (1891), conceived as a
chapter of his never-written "History of Intolerance." In 1900, Burr initiated
a correspondence with Joseph Hansen, the director of the Köln Stadtarchiv and a
witchcraft historian who stood squarely within the positivist tradition. A
Unitarian and a progressive thinker, Burr was convinced that witch hunting was
not “the people’s fault,” and that clericalism -- more than "religion" -- bore
the main responsibility for persecutions. Until his own death in 1938, he
purchased original documents – though at a slower pace – and commissioned
transcriptions of German manuscripts for the Cornell Library. </p>

<head>ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY</head>
<p>A Short Line Railroad Association was first organized in 1910, and 22
railroads formed the Short Line Railroad Association of the Southeast in 1913.
The group became a national association, serving 177 members by 1918. In 1920,
the Western Association of Short Line Railroads affiliated with this
Association. This is a non-profit, unincorporated association, whose actions
are advisory only and nonbinding upon its members. Members are Class I and II
line-haul, switching and terminal companies in 43 states.</p>
<p>The American Short Line Railroad Association, with stated objectives
to "...provide cooperative action in the consideration and solutions of
problems of management and policy affecting...short line railroads..." and
"...to promote Federal legislation of benefit and resist the enactment of
legislation that would be detrimental to the railroad industry," has deposited
in the Cornell University Department of Manuscripts and University Archives
records documenting the history of the association and its member roads,
1912-1967.</p>
<p>Formally organized in 1913, although a predecessor was formed in 1910,
the first section of this listing is a record of the association itself, its
internal operation and general reference and technical records. With the
membership fluctuating as roads felt the need for cooperative action in the
face of Federal legislation and for a statutory agent to represent them in
Washington, as required by the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act,
service was provided to the varied interests of short line haul roads, switching
and terminal companies and these records are divided into two sections, active
and inactive and non-member roads.</p>
