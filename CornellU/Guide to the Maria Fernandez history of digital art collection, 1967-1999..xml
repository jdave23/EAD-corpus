      <abstract label="Abstract:">This collection was assembled by Fernandez over the course of her
        teaching career and provides an informed snapshot of the history of digital art, from
        robotics and installation to video art and interactive screen arts. Students, researchers,
        and artists will have access to primary tapes and documentary videos (some of which have
        already been digitized) that will provide them with an overview of the history of digital
        art. Documentaries provide a snapshot of the history of digital art since the mid-1960s.
        Materials also provide access to the artists' creative and thought processes as well as to
        their finished products. The items in this collection are intended for use in the research
        and teaching of Digital Media Art at Cornell University. Selected titles are available for
        viewing online by the Cornell community.</abstract>

      <p>Mari&#x301;a Ferna&#x301;ndez's research and teaching concern three areas and their
        intersections: the history and theory of digital and new media art, postcolonial and gender
        studies and Latin American art and architecture. She is the author of Cosmopolitanism in
        Mexican Visual Culture (Texas University Press 2014), for which she won the Arvey Book Award
        by the Association for Latin American Art in 2015. With Faith Wilding and Michelle Wright
        she edited Domain Errors: Cyberfeminist Practices (Autonomedia, 2002). Recently she
        completed an edited volume titled, "Latin American Modernisms and Technology" which explores
        diverse engagements of Latin American intellectuals and artists with modern technologies,
        mechanical, electronic, digital and imaginary (forthcoming, Cornell Institute for
        Comparative Modernities and Africa World Press). Her essays have appeared in multiple
        journals including Leonardo, Art Journal and Third Text as well as in edited
        collections.</p>
