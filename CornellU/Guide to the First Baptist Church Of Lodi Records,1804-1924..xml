         <p>In 1804 a council met at the home of Jacob Smith, in Ovid New York to constitute a new church in the boundaries of the Romulus Baptist Church. At that time circuit rider Elder Caton served the Romulus district and often preached at the church. In 1809 the church was officially organized and in 1826 it was incorporated as the First Baptist Church of Lodi. Reverend Thomas was the first preacher, only preaching a quarter of the time. In 1817 Rev. Thomas Brown became the first paid pastor, preaching at the church three quarters of the time. The first church was built in 1829 on the hill next to Stephan Smith's home and "a great many old time revivals were held there."</p>

         <p>The records of the First Baptist Church are divided among those of a church within the bounds of Romulus (1804-1821), those of the church when it was called the First Baptist Church of Lodi (1821-1900), and later when the church called itself the First Baptist Church of Valois (1900-1924). The records for the church when it was in the bounds of the Romulus district included lists of baptisms, of women members, of prior members (1812-1816), and of neighboring towns and their representatives to the ecclesiastical council. From 1821 to 1830 there are no records. While under the name the First Baptist Church of Lodi (1821-1900) the meeting changed from bimonthly to annually.</p>
