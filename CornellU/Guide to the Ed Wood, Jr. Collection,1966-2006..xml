			<p>Edward Davis Wood, Jr. (October 10, 1924 to December 10, 1978), better known as Ed
				Wood, was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author, and editor,
				who made a number of low-budget genre films and published pulp novels under various
				names. Ed Wood's fiction is as strange, idiosyncratic and out of step with his times
				and mores as his infamous movies. His novels inter-splice erotic segments with
				lengthy philosophical, sociological and psychological discourse. Rudolph Grey's
				biography "Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr." (1992) and
				Tim Burton's biopic "Ed Wood," which earned two Academy Awards, brought attention to
				his life and work. He died in 1978 of an alcohol-induced heart attack and has since
				achieved cult status.</p>

			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Pulp novels written anonymously and under various pseudonyms of the
				legendary psycho-sexual author and film-maker, Ed Wood, Jr., collected by pulp
				scholar Robert Legault (1950 to 2008). In addition, magazines, reference materials,
				posters and other ephemera.</p>
			<p>Also, an original one sheet poster for the 1953 film, "Glen or Glenda?" directed by
				Ed Wood, Jr. in his feature film debut. Originally titled "I Changed My Sex," the
				film has maintained a solid cult following over the decades despite its poor reviews
				due to Wood's decidedly distinctive style and z-budget production values. The aim of
				the film's producer, George Weiss, was to capitalize on the story Christina
				Jorgensen, who in 1952 became the first man widely known to undergo sex reassignment
				surgery. The film's first half guides the viewer down a crooked path that includes
				multiple narration techniques, BDSM (bondage/discipline/sadomasochist) pornography,
				and a buffalo stampede in order to convey a story about a man named Glen who wishes
				to become a transvestite, struggling to gain acceptance from his girlfriend. The
				second half, added largely at the demand of the distributor to include sex change in
				the content, is about a pseudohermaphrodite named Alan who fights his way through
				World War II in women's underwear, finally returning from the conflict to have the
				surgery he/she has always desired.</p>
			<p> Also, a DVD of an episode of "The Incredibly Strange Film Show," volume 3, on Ed Wood, featuring interviews with Wood's colleagues and clips from his films "Glen or Glenda?", "Bride of the Monster," "Plan 9 From Outer Space," "Revenge of the Dead," and "The Bride and the Beast." Also included in the DVD is his film "The Sinister Urge."</p>

							for new publications, and ties to more savage legal infractions, companies were constantly starting, collapsing and renaming themselves in a fly-by-night 
							fashion.  Therefore we find ourselves with situations like Strange Sisters which has a Pad Library ID# on the cover, yet on the verso of the title page 
							we find the publication credit attributed to Europa Books Limited.  Obscured by a fog of criminality it is quite difficult to know where one company ended 
							and another began.  It is highly likely that the amalgam of imprints were owned by only a few people.  For instance, Michael Thevis of Pendulum was said 
							to have owned 90% of all adult bookstores during the 1970s.  Viceroy Books and Private Editions Books shared the same Canoga Park address.

							<lb/>["A detailed analysis of the sexual and sociological misinformation surrounding black sexuality."  
							It was suggested by reported ex-Pendulum/Calga writer Leo Eaton, that Dr. T. K. Peters was in fact actually a real card-carrying doctor, 
							his website relays: "Pendulum had bought a serious, boring and excruciatingly long scientific study of sexuality from Dr. T. K. Peters. 
							It was an unpublished manuscript that the doctor had probably labored on for years without finding a buyer (he was a Kinsey-style researcher). 
							I hate to think what he was paid – probably peanuts – but he was very old (semi-senile was the word around the office) 
							and he’d let it go without realizing what use would be made of it. The manuscript gave Bernie [Bloom] a sort of ‘semi-legitimacy’ 
							for the books and magazine articles and we were all encouraged to make use of it whenever and wherever possible. Adding Dr. Peter’s name as co-writer 
							added a spurious legitimacy." (http://www.eatoncreative.com/memories/working-with-ed-wood-jr.php)   </p>

							Page 24: "The room began to smell like a whorehouse on dollar day.  Frantic, hot bodies give off a real musky smell when they’re in a close space.  
							And that apartment was like a closet.  Hell, I could have reached out and patted Benny on the butt."  Page 89: "While the majority of housewives 
							enter the forbidden world of animalism out of a profound despair, this is not an iron rule."  While much of Wood’s approaches to African-American 
							life are out and out racist, his views of Near Eastern sex practices seem to tend more towards a comical and prurient Orientalism, offensive and ignorant, 
							but tethered to an archetypal Rohmer-esque mythological world of sexist warriors, most certainly inspired by his fascination with the exotic and supernatural.  
							Yet, as opposed to Sax Rohmer, there is little awe and literary eloquence to counteract the reductions of the Other.  Rather the notion of a misogynist Arab, 
							painted as a savage and conquering force, is the primary abstraction of the Arab race with Wood.  This point of view is apparent during a discussion of Arab 
							sodomy on pages 136-7: "The Arab now straddled the American girl, and then his powerful maleness was at the entranceway.  ‘It is the way of the East, 
							my little love-slave.’  WIth [sic] that, he invaded.  There was some sphincter tightening.  Suddenly a gurgled shriek was heard as the American girl tried 
							to push him off [...] The sex-perverted Arab was now bearing down on her as if she were some animal, some beast.  She had always heard that these savage Arabs 
							were like that, but she never knew they were so brutal.  Now, a shock wave of pain tore through her narrow receptacle.  Suddenly, Ahman erupted in some erotic 
							sounding gibberish.  Then, he immersed himself "to the hilt" and there was a stiffening [...] Ahman’s stiffening was rigid.  Then the gushing proof of his peak 
							flooded Valerie’s soul until she was transformed into little more than a sexual slave [...] Wordlessly, he went to the bathroom and washed himself.  
							When he came out, bronzed and naked with his flaccid power a symbol of his superiority, he flashed a grin at her.  ‘This is how we use our women in the East.’"]

			<p>The following materials have been separated from the collection. Some have been cataloged individually:</p>
			<p><emph render="underline">A Study of Fetishes &amp; Fantasies</emph><lb/>By: <persname>Edward D. Wood, Jr.</persname><lb/>Pseudonym: <persname>Norman Bates &amp; Dick Trent</persname>
				<lb/>Location: Human Sexuality HQ57.3 .W77 1973
				<lb/>Pages: 191 Published: 1971
				<lb/>[indicative of the fast and loose publishing culture: though the outer boards attribute the book to Wood &amp; Bates, 
				inside title page attributes "by Norman Bates &amp; Dick Trent".  Bibliography of this "educational" book cites a myriad of sources including Freud, 
				Krafft-Ebing, Stekel, and Theodore Sturgeon.]

			<p><emph render="underline">A Study in the Motivation of Censorship, Sex &amp; The Movies: Book I</emph><lb/>By: <persname>	Edward D. Wood, Jr.</persname>
				<lb/>Location: Human Sexuality PN1995.9.S45 S89 1973 bk.1
				<lb/>Pages: 190 Published: 1973
				<lb/>[the EDUSEX Press imprint under Gallery was similar to SECS in that in provided an educational guise for pornography that made it exempt from 
				obscenity prosecution, this "study" in particular allowed Wood to flex his knowledge of the film world.  Preface reads: "The President’s Commission 
				on Obscenity and Pornography has found that the law ‘is not the only or necessarily the most effective way’ to deal with pornography.  The report 
				recommends a massive and extensive sex education program to blunt the American’s taste for smut and to forge an informed public consensus on the 
				problem."]
