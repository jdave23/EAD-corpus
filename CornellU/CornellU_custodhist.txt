<p>Consisting of an enormous quantity of manuscripts as well as printed works,
graphics, and other remembrances of the General, the collection had originally
belonged to the Lafayette family and had been preserved at the family estate at
Chavaniac. Early in this century it was sold to the Parisian antiquarian dealer,
Dieudonné-Elie Fabius, who himself made substantial additions to the collection
in the following decades. </p>

<p>The history of this collection is uncertain. Much of it was created by the college Alumni Association, but it was added to by the College Library staff as well. Other material may have been added from other sources.</p>

<p>Collection was formed around a core of materials probably originally collected by Judge W.E. Ambler of Cleveland, who solicited letters or documents from prominent individuals, some of whom were African Americans. Apparently, at a later date, the black writer Charles Chesnutt became involved in the project and also solicited such letters from African-Americans. Eventually, the collection came into the possession of James Lowell Gibbs, whose children donated it to Cornell University in his memory. Copied items were returned to donors.</p>

<p>The bulk of the collection came down through the Chazelles family and was subsequently acquired by Lavoisier bibliographer Denis Duveen. Duveen sold the collection after finishing the bibliography. The Cornell Library purchased the collection from dealer H.P. Kraus in 1963. Additional material was collected by Pierre Dejours, and subsequently the Library purchased the Dejours material from Librairie Hatchuel in 2006.</p>

<p>Cornell's Maurepas Collection is based upon a large and important segment of the ministerial papers of Jean Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas et de Pontchartain (1701-1781). Until 1962 these papers had been maintained largely intact but in private hands. In that year they were dispersed, with the bulk of the Secretary's general correspondence and the materials related to the King's Household going to the Archives Nationales in Paris. The extremely important naval papers were, however, held back and auctioned at Parke-Bernet Galleries of New York on March 6 of the same year. </p>
