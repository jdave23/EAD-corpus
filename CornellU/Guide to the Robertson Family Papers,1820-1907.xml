Starke is angered by a movement in Albany seeking to abolish County Superintendents. He attacks Silas Wright, U.S. Senator 1833; reelected 1837 and 1843; governor 1845-47, as being the American Cato and states that Wright has not the information needed to make the statements he has been making. Starke comes out against "bigotry and ignorance coupled with rank injustice in high stations."</p>

                  <p>From S. Young, Ballston, to SR, Ithaca. The letter is an answer to an invitation of SR to Young. Young talks about the prejudices of certain segments of the community against the school system. Young says that education is not for the rich alone, as the mass of people think, but for the poor as well. No one should be denied the opportunity of receiving an education. '"No philanthropist should remit his exertions until our Schools are raised to such a grade of utility as to embrace all the children of the State, the sons and daughters of the rich as well as of the poor. All should here mingle on one common level; all should be blended into one mass during the susceptible period of youth. This is the only means of promoting the harmony of society, of suppressing jealousies and perpetuating in letter and in spirit our republican institutions."</p>
