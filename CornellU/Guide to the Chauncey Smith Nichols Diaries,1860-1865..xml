               <p> Biography: Chauncey Smith Nichols was born February 13, 1847, the son of Robert T. and Harriet Smith Nichols, and grandson of pioneer settler Chauncey W. Smith of Hector, N.Y. C.S. Nichols' parents were married in New Jersey on February 29, 1844 and moved to North Barton, N.Y. to live. They had one other child, Helen Adell Nichols, born on December 19, 1849.</p>
               <p> Contents: The 1860 diary is commercially made, and entries in the diary refer almost exclusively to Nichols' school attendance and domestic chores. Some entries refer to local events. All entries stop after May 27, 1860, the re-mainder of the diary being filled with recipes, various lists of domestic items and unidentified figures.</p>

            <scopecontent>
               <p> Contents: The 1865 diary is commercially made, and entries in this volume are more detailed than in Item #2. Nichols was apparently not attending school at this time, but noted in the diary are domestic chores, local events, activities, and work with friends and discussions in the Post Office.</p>

            <scopecontent>
               <p> Contents: The 1864 diary is also commercially made. The entries in this volume are similar to those in Item #3, with the addition of notes on school attendance. In the back of this volume, Nichols used the printed charts for cash accounts (the chart for December is missing) and bills payable/receivable for the months February to July and December.</p>
