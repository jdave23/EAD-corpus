         <p>The Presbyterian Church in Dundee was an offshoot of the Eddytown Society, from which it drew most of its members. At a meeting of male members at Harpending's Corners at the school house April 11, 1832, the church voted to incorporate under the name of the Second Presbyterian Church in Starkey. Usually the church shared the services of the Eddytown minister. In 1846 the church changed its name to the present one. The Society first worshipped in the school house, and afterwards in a building which was the first store of John Starkey converted into a meeting house. A church was built in 1844 at the cost of $1,400, and was remodeled in 1857. See the 
		<title>History of Yates County, New York</title>, pages 1087-1089 for a list of original members, pastors and officers. </p>

         <p>This collection consists of a complete series of minutes of annual meetings to elect trustees from the church's incorporation in 1832 to 1887 and a volume (apparently the second) of session minutes (1853-1883) which also contains 2 membership lists. The volumes are illegible in places.</p>

				. The volume opens with a list of pastors and their dates of service (1832-1947). Minutes commencing June 3, 1853 record the attendance of members of the session, the reception and dismissal of members, the appointment of representatives to the Presbytery and occasional cases of discipline. One unusual resolution is to record the services of members of "this church in the volunteer forces of the United States during the present rebellion." (February 27, 1863). After the last entry (1883) are yearly reports to the Presbytery with list of statistics (1866-1883) showing: added on examination; added on certificate; total enrolled; no. non-? for 5 years; adults baptised, infants baptised; Sunday school membership; contributions to the General Assembly, Home Missions, A.B.C.J. (?), Education, Mis. Relief, Congregation, Misc. and a list (1859-1866) with figures for additions by letter, additions by profession, total; adult baptism, infant baptism; dismissals; excommunications, contributions; deaths; and miscellaneous. At the end of the vol. is a list of 4 infant baptisms (1864, 1876) with name, parents and date; a Communicants list copied from Book A in January 1863 listing 8 pages of names and when died, dismissed, excluded or otherwise disposed of, and a 5 page list for 1872 with the same information.</p>
