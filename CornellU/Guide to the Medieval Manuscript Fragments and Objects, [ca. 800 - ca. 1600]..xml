			<head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
			<p>Various items, including documents (such as Nuremberg rules for execution from 16th
				century, papal texts, legal statements) and fragments from books (such as parchment
				strips recovered from bindings, historiated initials, illuminations, and leaves
				drawn from various texts including the Vulgate Bible, commentaries on the Bible,
				breviaries, Psalters, books of hours, homilies, liturgical books with musical
				notation, books of law, works of Church Fathers such as Augustine and Jerome, works
				of classical authors such as Cicero and Livy, and works of various other
				authoritative authors such as Avicenna). Included is a document written on a
				bifolium from Thann (Alsace), dated 1499, listing saints' relics transferred from
				monstrances to a reliquary (here called a Tafel) in 1458 at the collegiate church of
				St. Thiébaut. Also, a fragment of an unidentified Lauda from the Passion of Christ,
				in ottava rima, probably of mid-Italian origin. It describes St. Peter's denial, the
				trial of Christ before Caiaphas, the crowd's verdict, the flagellation, and the
				humiliation.</p>
			<p>Also included is a leaf from an antiphonal, on vellum, with a miniature of a female
				saint preaching. The leaf (480 x 355 mm.) is from north-central Italy, probably
				around Bologna, ca. 1350. It includes 7 four-line staves in red, and a large initial
				"A" illustrating the verse Adaperiat dominus cor vestrum (2 Macc. 4). Music and text
				of a later date are added in the bottom margin.</p>
			<p> Included in addition is a framed 1288 document on vellum from Abbess Jutta von
				Arnsberg of Freckenhorst, Germany, concerning an annuity for goods bought in
				connection with the annual feast of St. Martin's. The abbess's seal is attached to
				the document by its original tab.</p>
			<p>Also included is a Spanish manuscript on vellum, conveying a piece of olive grove
				near Cordoba, dated 10 February 1503; and a small bronze seal matrix, used to seal
				documents, bearing an image of an Agnus Dei with a large flag on a long crucifix,
				with inscription "Ecce Agnvs Dei."</p>
			<p>Also, a remnant of a 15th-century book of hours annotated and augmented in the
				following centuries, with an inscription on the front pastedown dated 1768 naming
				one of its owners: Jean Hersmulle Duport, doctor of theology (Sorbonne), who taught
				physics at the Sulpician Grand Seminary of St Irenee, and then became curate of
				Loire, a village between Lyon and Vienne (until 1791). With eight original vellum
				leaves from the manuscript, most with added texts. The contents are: 1. one folio
				numbered 17, with the end of the Gospel lesson of St. Matthew, an inscription in a
				later hand, and on the verso the capital letters DE LH (the rest blank); 2. one
				folio with four lines of Latin religious verse in French humanist minuscule script,
				below which is an erased inscription that can be read in ultraviolet light (naming
				"Jehan Frenier," with various place-names: probably Je[h]an Frenier, cure de
				Saint-Martin de Maulay, near Loudun), the verso blank; 3. six folios from the end of
				the book, the first being the conclusion of the Suffrages but with the following
				added: a complete prayer in 90 rhyming couplets of French, beginning "O Iesu roy de
				tout le monde / En qui toute bonte abonde / Je suis ta pauvre creature / Contemplant
				ta saincte figure / Se tenant a grands cloux de fer... Helas quel fers, helas quelz
				cloux / Ils furent forges longs et groux / Pour te faire plus de martyre" (a variant
				was printed in 1556 in Fr. Pierre Olivier, Le Mirouer du Chrestien), followed by
				"Les Sept Oraisons de St. Gregoire" complete in seven Latin stanzas; this followed
				by an inscription, "AU NOM DIEU / AMEN CES HEURES." Many medieval manuscripts were
				transmitted from generation to generation and abundantly annotated. This remnant
				reveals the kinds of texts deemed essential in such books of private devotion but
				omitted, for whatever reason, from the original commissi on.</p>
			<p>Fragment from Saint Augustine's Expositio in evangelium Johannis, from Italy, circa
				1100; leaf on vellum from a breviary, Flanders, circa 1350; and leaf on vellum from
				a large antiphonal, from Spain, circa 1525, with elaborate Moorish strapwork design
				on the borders and surrounding a large initial letter O. Also, a leaf from a
				16th-century antiphonal from Italy, on vellum, with decorated initials; and a leaf
				from another antiphonal from Italy, circa 1500, with decorated initials made with a
				compass.</p>
			<p>Also, a leaf from a Book of hours (Paris, circa 1500), with a color illustration
				showing the coronation of the Virgin; and a fragment of a manuscript bifolium from
				Thomas of Breslau's Practica medicinalis, subsequently used as a binding cover in a
				volume, with pieces of leather straps laced through the text (Italy, late 14th
				century).</p>
			<p>Fragment from a codex of Justinian, with historiated initials including the head of a
				woman in a blue cloak (southern France, circa 1280).</p>
			<p> Also, the last will of Margarita de Ballis, the wife of the Count de Ballis, in
				Alcamo, Sicily (1408), on paper with a watermark showing a hand with a flower,
				commonly found on paper in Europe. Also, a historiated border on vellum from the
				Great Choir Book of Ferdinand and Isabella, Castile, circa 1479-1492.</p>
			<p>Two fragments of a commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, with a remark on
				werewolves, by Richard of Middleton (Ricardus de Mediavilla), circa 1400.</p>
			<p>Also, a papal bull signed by Pope Innocent VIII, 1488; and a patristic manuscript in
				Greek, evidently a homily about St. John Chrysostom, 11th century. Also, a leaf of
				the Stimulus amoris by Pseudo-Bonaventure, in Old French translation, circa 1420.
				Two fragments in Greek, one from Gregory of Nicomedia's Sermo in S. Mariam
				assistentem cruci, circa 13th or 14th century, and the other the description of
				Jesus's entrance into Jerusalem, Matthew 21:1-19, 12th or 13th century.</p>

						<emph render="underline">Description</emph>: Written in Latin on parchment.
						The script is Carolingian and of the Alcuin School of Tours. Fragment

						Burr’s notes read: ‘Manuscript fragments of about 800 AD taken from an old
						book ( CUL’s copy of the Bibliae Moraliztus of Berchorius of Poitiers – 7546
						G75) and to be restored to that volume after photographing them for the
						Pope’s Biblical Commission’; and another reads, ‘[…] Even more interesting
						than the book itself is the old MS with which the monks of St. Maximim to
						whom this copy belonged, have lined the binding. It is a fragment of a Bible
						of the ninth century, which was perhaps brought to St. Maximim by Ada,
						sister of Charlemagne. The script is clearly (so Dr. Loew convinced me) the
						work of Alcuin’s School of Tours […]’. Note that this manuscript fragment
						was never returned to the binding of Bibliae Moraliztus. <lb/><emph

						the history of France from its Trojan origins up to, in its final form with
						its continuations, the death of King Charles VII in 1461. Originally drafted
						and updated by the monks of the royal abbey of Saint-Denis, the vernacular
						text provided the "official" history of the French kings, but the present
						miniature is also related to Spain, crusades, and pilgrimages. Charlemagne
						stands crowned, accompanied by two of his courtiers/preux compagnons, as San
						Iago/Iacobus [di Compostella] appears to him in a vision. The saint is
						identified by his pilgrim staff, pack, book, and his hat (subsequent
						pilgrims to Compostela would dress like him for centuries). According to the
						Chronicle of Turpin and subsequent imitations, Sant Iago instructed
						Charlemagne (in a [day?] dream) to come to Galicia following the Milky Way
						(Campus Stellae) and wrest Spain from the Saracens. The text in French in
						this manuscript is approximately the same, although St. James also urges
						Charlemagne to go to Galilee and deliver the Holy Sites. <lb/><emph

						in Latin and French on parchment. Includes an inscription on the front
						pastedown dated 1768 naming one of its owners: Jean Hersmulle Duport, doctor
						of theology (Sorbonne), who taught physics at the Sulpician Grand Seminary
						of St Irénée, and then became curate of Loire, a village between Lyon and
						Vienne (until 1791). "Hic libris joannis hersmulle Duport... facultatis
						parisiensis doctoris theologi.. in ecclesia ligeriensis in diocesi
						viennensis [Vienne] anno 1768", with eight original leaves from the
						manuscript, most with added texts. The contents are: 1. one folio numbered
						17, with the end of the Gospel lesson of St. Matthew, an inscription in a
						later hand, and on the verso the capital letters DE LH (the rest blank); 2.
						one folio with four lines of Latin religious verse in French Humanistic
						Minuscule script, below which is an erased inscription that can be read in
						ultraviolet light (naming “Jehan Frenier,” with various place-names:
						probably Je[h]an Frenier, curé de Saint-Martin de Maulay, near Loudun), the
						verso blank; 3. six folios from the end of the book, the first being the
						conclusion of the Suffrages but with the following added: a complete prayer
						in 90 rhyming couplets of French, beginning “O Iesu roy de tout le monde/En
						qui toute bonte abonde [Je suis ta pauvre creature/Contemplant ta saincte
						figure/Se tenant a grands cloux de fer... Helas quel fers, helas quelz
						cloux/Ils furent forges longs et groux/Pour te faire plus de martyre]” (a
						variant was printed in 1556 in Fr. Pierre Olivier, Le Mirouer du Chrestien
						-- Olivier was the spiritual advisor of Marguerite de Navarre -- he revised
						the Heptaméron), followed by “Les Sept Oraisons de St. Gregoire” complete in
						seven Latin stanzas; this followed by an inscription, “AU NOM DIEU / AMEN
						CES HEURES”. This remnant reveals the kinds of texts deemed essential in
						such books of private devotion but omitted, for whatever reason, from the
						original commission.<lb/><emph render="underline">Provenance</emph>:

						yugo and for Ysabel and F stood for flechas and for Fernando, but there

						climbing through the foliage. This fragment comes from what was once a
						magnificent manuscript commissioned by Ferdinand of Aragon (1452-1516) and
						Isabella of Castile (1451-1504), and probably illuminated by Juan de
						Carrion, who was working in Avila in the 1470s and is mostly remembered for
						his illumination of the choir books of the cathedral of Avila. Other leaves
						or fragments of the manuscript were acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum,
						Cambridge University, and the Princes of Liechtenstein. In his Spanish

						the important medieval collegiate church of St. Thiébaut in Thann (founded
						1332). Written in the East Oberdeutsch dialect of German and dated 1499,
						this complete text describes a transfer of saints’ relics in 1458, as
						overseen by the lay brothers Johannes Schürer, Michael Feyrlin, and Conrad
						Weyssman. The relics were removed from monstrances and organized in a
						reliquary, here called a Tafel, and therefore probably a box with cells
						carved from porphyry. When relocated, the relics were situated in individual
						cells given coordinates identified in our manuscript. Among a list of
						fourteen bones, two teeth, three pieces of fabric, and three splinters from
						the True Cross, is the tooth of the exceptionally rare Saint Aurelia. She
						accompanied Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins down the Rhine, but staying behind
						at Strasbourg due to illness, she missed the chance for martyrdom. The
						relics listed in this text include cloth from the Virgin’s robe and a tooth
						of Thann’s patron saint, Thiébaut. Faded mid seventeenth-century notes at
						the end of the text have not yet been deciphered.<lb/><emph
