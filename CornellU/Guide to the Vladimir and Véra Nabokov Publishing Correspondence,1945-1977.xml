                  <p>With no address (probably written from Goldwin Smith), in English, concerning the publicity campaign for 

				<title>Lolita</title>. VN insists that this is not a novel that "should appeal to the kind of people {G.] euphemistically call 'amateurs'," and refers to a campaign to establish the novel as a "literary achievement of artistic value and lasting importance, and to counteract the unfortunate publicity it received at the start." Reference also to the good reviews that are now appearing in <title>The Partisan Review</title> and <title>The Hudson Review</title>.

                  <p>(1) Written from Goldwin Smith Hall, Ithaca NY, in French, explaining that he has refused Girodias' offer to litigate on behalf of 

				<title>Lolita</title>, and then moving on to treat the publication of all his works in French, which he thinks should take place now, at this most favorable time. Complains that his most successful novels, aesthetically speaking, <title>Lolita</title>, <title>Bend Sinister</title> and <title>Invitation</title>, have not been translated yet. (2) Written from Goldwin Smith Hall, Ithaca NY, in English, detailing contract negotiations with American publishing houses, especially their reluctance to take on <title>Lolita</title> because of Girodias' claims as well as fear of "unavoidable court proceedings." In anticipation of an offer from a new publishing house to bring out an American edition, VN proposes that he and G. rewrite their original (and severely flawed) contract.

Refers to Girodias' request that he reconsider his decision to avoid litigation over

Explains that two American publishers are interested in <title>Lolita</title>, but insist on dealing with VN directly rather than with Olympia.

(2) Writing from The Olympia Press, Girodias mentions that he has heard from Putnam, but feels that any negotiation with them will be fruitless, as all such negotiations have been and will continue to be until VN modifies his demands.

Wonders at G.'s claimed incomprehension of the reasons for VN's attempt to terminate their contract. Agrees to conditional advances from Gallimard for <title>Conclusive Evidence</title> and <title>Pnin</title>. Pencil annotation. </p>

                  <p>Not addressed, in French, regarding Girard's translation of the first part of 

				<title>Pale Fire</title>, including several explanations of terms that have confused the translator. Particularly interesting is VN's discussion of "homer" and the joke that eludes Kinbote as it probably will most French readers. Explains impossibility of including translator's notes in the French edition, as these may be confused with Kinbote's notes. Possibly a copy that was enclosed with 2-34. </p>

                  <p>Written from Paris, in French, outlining Coindreau's objections to VN's suggested mode of work. Accepts those corrections that right concrete mistakes and inevitable interpretive errors, but refuses to consider "inadmissible modifications" that either do not translate what VN has written, are "barbarisms" (i.e. are not French words) or will make readers laugh. Provides some instances of suggested corrections by VN that do not (in Coindreau's opinion) translate the original text but interpret or embellish. Writes that at the age of 71, C. is not about to allow "obscenities". Discusses duties of author to translator, and vice versa. Touches briefly on difficulty of undertaking a 'team' translation (Girard and Coindreau are translating the text together). 4 pages, photocopy, with pen and pencil annotations by VN. </p>

                  <p>Writing from Palace Hôtel, Montreux, in French, VN delivers a lengthy (and sarcastic) response to Coindreau's queries. Explains that if Coindreau (now translating 

				<title>Pale Fire</title>) has methods of translating, so too has VN for working with translators. Objecting to the tone of C.'s letter as "unfriendly and quite uncalled for", VN asserts that the modifications he suggests are not meant to replace an incorrect phrase with one that is correct, but are intended to make phrases more exact or clear, and 'reminds' C. that the only method he has for expressing his thoughts is in language, and not by sign or"a little dance like that a bee performs to notify its fellows of the results of its honey-gathering." Responds to C.'s queries one by one, and argues in conclusion for his own right as author to suggest corrections. 5 pages, including 3 page typescript of corrections to Kinbote's "Commentary", translated by Coindreau.</p>

				<title>Lolita</title> of Olympia's foreword, which VN takes as an unauthorized addition to his text, and therefore prohibited by his contract with Olympia (4.15.59). G claims that the foreword (concerning legal matters) is his prerogative, especially given a recent interview by VN misrepresenting (according to G.) Olympia's role in the publication of <title>Lolita</title>. (4.29.59 &amp; 5.11.59).</p>

Ergaz believes it important to publish <title>Lolita</title>. with a firm like Gallimard, as Pauvert (associated with Olympia) has a certain reputation based on its publication of works such as <title>The Story of O</title> (which Ergaz feels has no literary value). To Manceaux, who has just completed an article on <title>Lolita</title>. she writes that <title>Lolita</title>. is not a work of pornography, and is not about the love of an "old man" for a little girl, but rather a man's love for a woman (3.2.56). Ergaz is beginning to find G. slippery and untrustworthy. </p>

                  <p>10 TL, to VN (5) and VéN (5), in French. Mostly regarding the publication of all of VN's works in French if not with Table Rond, which is in difficulties, then with Gallimard (VN is somewhat exasperated that his books are not appearing at a time when everybody is talking about him). Encourages VN to take up Girodias' offer and launch legal proceedings on behalf of 

				<title>Lolita</title>. (cites Graham Greene's support of such a plan). Also discusses Girodias' position(s) with regard to the publication of <title>Lolita</title> in the US (G. apparently does not believe that Doubleday will ever get up the courage to publish <title>Lolita</title>.). Discusses possible translators for <title>Lolita</title>. and foreign contracts with Rowohlt and Mondadori. Asks whether, as has been rumored, VN has decided to allow Doubleday (rather than Clairouin) to represent future works. Autograph postscript to 4.16.57. </p>

                  <p>10 TL, to VN (5) and VéN (5), in French. Expresses first confusion over discrepancies between VN and G.'s accounts of their dispute, and then anger over G.'s behaviour. Ergaz consoles herself with the thought that there was no other publisher willing to launch 

				<title>Lolita</title>, and advises against attempting to announce the contract with Olympia ruptured, as Olympia has gained a great deal of sympathy with the literary community. Discusses foreign contracts for <title>Lolita</title> as well as the contracts with Gallimard for <title>Conclusive Evidence</title> and <title>Pnin</title> (which will be translated by Chrestien). </p>

				<title>Lolita</title>, <title>Despair</title>, and 3 others (<title>Pnin</title> and <title>The Defense</title>, though not <title>Sebastian Knight</title>, as the "absurd" impasse with New Directions continues), as well as the <title>Ada</title> translation (despite the slow pace, VN will not, as Schébéko suggests, allow <title>Mary</title> to appear before <title>Ada</title>). Includes typed copy of the blurb that will appear on the back of <title>Lolita</title> (the opening of <title>Lolita</title> and a short biographical note).

Dealing with the contract with Gallimard (VN is somewhat displeased with the terms and their ambiguous wording, but Schébéko urges him to sign) and publication details (asking VN to approve book jackets, for example). Notes slow pace of 

				<title>Ada</title> translation, and Fayard's concern that VN will sell <title>Transparent Things</title> to another publisher (he will not show it to Fayard until the <title>Ada</title> translation is completed). Includes a personal note from Schébéko commiserating with Véra over her back (an especially unfortunate circumstance, writes Schébéko, given the perfection of Véra's posture), and offering some advice. </p>
