      </p>

      <p>Executive Director Vic Basile (1983-1989)</p>
      <p>Executive Director Tim McFeeley (1989-1995)</p>

      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Foundation</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The Human Rights Campaign Fund (HRCF) was founded by Stephen Endean in 1980 as the United
        States' first gay and lesbian political action committee (PAC). Like other PACs, it started
        raising and contributing money to the campaigns of candidates likely to advance the group's
        interests. In its case, the mission was to advocate for gay and lesbian civil rights "by
        supporting and educating candidates for federal elective office." <emph render="super">1</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The organization was created partly in response to the successes of anti-gay groups,
        including the Moral Majority and the National Conservative Political Action Committee. In
        July 1980, HRCF registered with the Federal Election Commission and in November 1980, HRCF
        made its first campaign contribution to Jim Weaver, D-Ore., who defeated his Moral
        Majority-supported opponent. HRCF aggressively pursued "the goal of basic human rights
        through modern political methods" and wanted to help "bring the gay movement into the
        mainstream of the American political process." <emph render="super">2</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Distinctly bipartisan from its beginning, an early brochure explained, "The Campaign Fund's
        mission is simple: to provide financial support on behalf of the gay and lesbian community
        to candidates of both parties, Republicans and Democrats, who pledge their support of gay
        civil rights legislation."<emph render="super">3</emph> In its early years, HRCF got the
        support of famous activists and cultural celebrities, including Tennessee Williams, Joan
        Baez, Cesar Chavez, and Gloria Steinem.</p>
      <p>The organization was officially incorporated in the District of Columbia as a non-profit
        political committee on April 14, 1982. The incorporators of the organization were Steve
        Endean, Gilberto Gerald, and Farley Peterson. The initial Board of Directors at the time of
        incorporation were Virginia Apuzzo, Jerry Berg, John Campbell, Dallas Coors, Steve Endean,
        Gilberto Gerals, Ethan Geto, Rev. Elder Jerri Ann Harvey, Jim Hormel, Paul Kuntzler, Bettie
        Naylor, Lois Galgay Reckitt, Jerry Weeler, and Kerry Woodward.<emph render="super">4</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In September 1982, HRCF held its first large fund raising dinner at the Waldorf Astoria,
        featuring former Vice President Walter Mondale. Throughout its history, HRC annual dinners
        have been a staple of the organization's fundraising apparatus.</p>
      <p>As a result of effective fundraising techniques, during the November 1982 election cycle
        HRCF managed to raise nearly $600,000 and contributed $140,000 to 119 congressional
        candidates, 81% of whom won their races.<emph render="super">5</emph> Following the 1982
        election, HRCF became the 17th largest independent political action committee in the United
          States.<emph render="super">6</emph> In 1987, they raised more than $1,360,000.<emph render="super">7</emph> In 2005, donors contributed a record $35.9 million.<emph render="super">8</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Gay Rights National Lobby</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In November 1985, HRCF merged with the Gay Rights National Lobby. The Gay Rights National
        Lobby (GRNL) had been incorporated in the District of Columbia on August 15th, 1976.
        According to the articles of incorporation, GRNL was created for "the purpose of lobbying,
        at the Federal government level, for civil rights and other Federal legislation pertinent to
        gay people."<emph render="super">9</emph> The original incorporators of the organization
        were Roy Birchard, R. Adam DeBaugh, Franklin E. Kameny, Paul J. Kuntzler, and Richard G.
        Maulsby.</p>
      <p>At its inception, GRNL's founders expressed their intention to focus on areas of concern
        for the gay and lesbian community "including, but not limited to, public and private
        employment, housing, the use of public accommodations, licensure, immigration and
        naturalization, taxation, the Armed Services, and the criminal code."<emph render="super">10</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1978, after moving to Washington, D.C. from Minnesota, Steve Endean became the executive
        director of GRNL. During its nine year history, GRNL focused on several legislative issues
        on the federal level, lobbying for the passage of a lesbian/gay civil rights bill, increased
        AIDS funding, and the revision of immigration laws to remove provisions discriminating
        against gay and lesbian immigrants. </p>
      <p>In 1982, GRNL became one of the first gay and lesbian organizations to be admitted to the
        Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a "broad coalition of religious, labor, women's, and
        minority groups working on civil rights at the federal level."<emph render="super">11</emph>
        In 1982, after extensive negotiations between GRNL and officials from the American
        Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), delegates at the AFSCME
        convention approved an endorsement of gay civil rights legislation at all levels of
          government.<emph render="super">12</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1983, conflicts with other activists, including the Advocate publisher David B.
        Goodstein, led to Endean's resignation from both HRC and the Gay Rights National Lobby.</p>
      <p>In 1985, after accumulating a large financial debt, GRNL merged with the Human Rights
        Campaign Fund to ensure the survival of GRNL's mission and maximize the effectiveness of
        both organizations.<emph render="super">13</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Think Tank: Right to Privacy Foundation</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The Right to Privacy Foundation (RPF) was incorporated on July 14th, 1981, and its first
        President was Steve Endean, who had also served as first president of GRNL. The organization
        was incorporated by Steve Endean, Franklin Kameny, and Rev. Lawrence Uhrig. Endean, Uhrig,
        and Kameny also served as the organization's first Board of Directors. In April 1983, RPF's
        Board of Directors included Rev. Don Eastman, Doug Elwood, Stephen Endean, Meryl Friedman,
        Nath Rockhill and Tony Silvestre.</p>
      <p> According to the articles of incorporation, the purpose of RPF was to "engage in research,
        sponsor research and publish educational materials concerning the public policy implications
        of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation." <emph render="super">14</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In a press release from GRNL announcing the creation of the organization, the author
        describes the importance of RPF's mission, asserting that "there is no single organization
        devoted solely to providing the unique educational research service required to effectively
        address the public policy questions surrounding national legislation of concern to lesbians
        and gay men."<emph render="super">15</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Though RPF's history was brief, the organization conducted extensive research on
        anti-discrimination in employment, the federal Gay Civil Rights Bill, and HIV/AIDS
        discrimination. The organization essentially functioned as a think-tank, analogous to large
        conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, and the Free
        Congress Foundation, the bipartisan Brookings Institution, and the progressive People for
        the American Way. </p>
      <p>Records of the Right to Privacy Foundation from 1981 to 1989 are part of the Human Rights
        Campaign Records. In some ways, the RPF was a predecessor to the Human Rights Campaign's
        educational endeavors.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Educational Units of the HRC: Human Rights and Health Fund/The Triangle
          Institute (TTI)/Human Rights Campaign Foundation</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In October 1986, HRCF expanded its organizational activities with the creation of the Human
        Rights and Health Fund, a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization that supports the
        work of HRC through research, educational efforts and outreach. This branch of HRCF was
        "formed for the charitable and educational purposes of conducting research and educating the
        public on the social, economic, and health issues gay men and lesbians."<emph render="super">16</emph> In March 1988, HRHF officially changed its name to The Triangle Institute
        (TTI). </p>
      <p>During its early years, HRHF/TTI was engaged in several major projects. The electoral
        research project (ERP), was one of the organization's first projects. According to one
        information packet distributed by the organization, the ERP's objective was to "explore the
        impact of gay rights and AIDS related issues on voting behavior and candidates for elective
        office." </p>
      <p>Another major project of HRHF/TTI was the MEDPAC project, focused on reliable information
        dissemination related to the AIDS crisis. According to a Board of Director's report from May
        1988, "MEDPAC is a press packet which provides up-to-the-minute, authoritative, and
        comprehensive coverage of medical aspects of the AIDS crisis. Its distribution is to
        medical, legislative, service provider, funding, and other personnel who need such
        information but may not have ready access to it."<emph render="super">17</emph>
      </p>
      <p>HRHF/TTI also advocated for and facilitated the creation of academic and professional gay
        and lesbian caucus networks. In 1993, when the National Coming Out Day Project (NCOD) merged
        with the HRCF, NCOD became part of TTI. </p>
      <p>In 1995, TTI became the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In 2006, the Human Rights
        Campaign Foundation was engaged in several projects related to research, public education
        and programming. These projects included the Historically Black Colleges and Universities
        Outreach Program, the Family Project, the Workplace Project, the National Coming Out
        Project, the Religion and Faith Program, and the HRC Research Institute.<emph render="super">18</emph>
      </p>
      <p>While some analysts have observed that "there is a frustrating division in the progressive
        world between organizations that do grassroots or community organizing and those that do
        analysis and policy development,"<emph render="super">19</emph> HRC has focused substantial
        attention in both directions. In 1995, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force also took
        this step and formalized its research activities by forming the NGLTF Policy Institute, a
        separate, non-profit organization to serve as a national information clearinghouse and
        resource center dedicated to educating and organizing around lesbian and gay men's issues.
        People for the American Way, formed in 1980, is another example of a large progressive
        organization tackling both political and research functions.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Fairness Fund/Speak Out</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In January 1988, HRCF further increased the scope of its organizational activities with the
        acquisition of Steve Endean's Fairness Fund (FF). Endean had created the Fairness Fund (FF)
        in December 1986 to provide letters and mailgrams on behalf of concerned individuals to
        political leaders with the intention of influencing federal legislation relevant to the gay
        and lesbian community. When the Fairness Fund merged with HRCF, its name changed to Speak
        Out. When Steve Endean returned in 1988, the HRCF created a Field Division for grassroots
        organizing.</p>
      <p>Speak Out, like the Fairness Fund before it, generated mailgrams and letters to members of
        congress in high volume at pivotal moments in the legislative process. According to the
        agreement reached between HRCF and FF in 1988, HRCF asserted that their legislative agenda
        would be "substantially enhanced by the ability to generate, in a rapid and effective way, a
        'public outcry' when necessary."<emph render="super">20</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The method of grassroots political lobbying through sponsored mailgrams and letters was
        first developed by the women's movement during the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) campaign and
        became an effective means of political lobbying throughout the Fairness Fund's and Speak
        Out's history.<emph render="super">21</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">1989 Organizational Change</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1989, HRCF was reorganized into two distinct entities, a political membership
        organization known as the Human Rights Campaign Fund and a political action committee known
        as HRCF-PAC. In the same year, the Board of Directors approved the lesbian program of HRCF
        in an attempt to further develop HRCF's representation of lesbian issues and lesbian
          constituency.<emph render="super">22</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">1990 Legislative Successes</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1990, several significant pieces of legislation from HRCF's political agenda were
        approved by the federal government. The Americans with Disabilities Act, which included a
        provision preventing discrimination based on HIV/AIDS status, CARE-Ryan White Comprehensive
        AIDS Resource Emergency Act, and the Federal Hate Crime Statistics Act were all important
        pieces of legislation that were made possible, in part, by the efforts of HRCF. At the
        invitation of President George H.W. Bush, HRCF representatives attended the signing ceremony
        of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act.<emph render="super">23</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Presidential Politics</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1992, HRCF supported its first presidential candidate, governor of Arkansas Bill
        Clinton. During the election, HRCF contributed $3 million dollars to Clinton's campaign. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">1995 Organizational Change</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 1995, under the guidance of Executive Director Elizabeth Birch, HRCF underwent several
        significant changes. The name of the organization was officially changed from the Human
        Rights Campaign Fund to the Human Rights Campaign and the Triangle Institute became the
        Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In addition, HRC adopted its current logo, a new
        positioning statement, and a new vision statement.<emph render="super">24</emph>
      </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">New Building in 2003</emph>
      </p>
      <p>HRC purchased and renovated the building at 1640 Rhode Island Ave., N.W., in Washington, DC
        for its national headquarters. It dedicated the new space on National Coming Out Day,
        October 11, 2003. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">2005 Organizational Change</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In 2005, the Executive Director's position was redefined as a President. The Communications
        Department became the Communications and Marketing Division, the Education Department became
        the Public Education and Outreach Division, and both Divisions came under the Vice President
        for Programs. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">HRC in 2007</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In January 2007, HRC described its mission as:</p>
      <p> "...by inspiring and engaging all Americans, ... to end discrimination against GLBT
        citizens and realize a nation that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all."<emph render="super">25</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Contributing to the campaigns of candidates who will support GLBT civil rights is still a
        focal point of HRC's work. In addition, "HRC works to secure equal rights for GLBT
        individuals and families at the federal and state levels by lobbying elected officials,
        mobilizing grassroots supporters, educating Americans, ...and partnering with other GLBT
          organizations."<emph render="super">26</emph> HRC concentrates on creating effective
        education and outreach programs. Major issues include equal rights and benefits in the
        workplace and ensuring families are treated equally under the law. </p>
      <p>In 2007, "the Human Rights Campaign, the largest national gay, lesbian, bisexual and
        transgender advocacy organization, envisions an America where GLBT people are ensured of
        their basic equal rights, and can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the
        community. HRC has close to 600,000 members - all committed to making this vision of
        equality a reality."<emph render="super">27</emph>

      <p>Project files, correspondence, financial and administrative records, subject files, press
        clippings, photographs, and miscellany that, taken together, provide a broad overview of the
        American movement for lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual rights starting in 1980.
        HRC(F)'s lobbying, voter mobilization efforts, and grassroots organizing throughout the
        United States are well documented, as are its education and outreach efforts and the work of
        its various units that have served as think tanks: the Human Rights and Health Fund, The
        Triangle Institute (TTI), and the HRC Foundation. Also included in the collection are some
        records of the Gay Rights National Lobby, the Right To Privacy Foundation, and the Fairness
        Fund.</p>

          <p>Files from the top-level of Human Rights Campaign (Fund) administration, including
            files of executive directors, presidents, and Boards, and files relating to membership,
            fundraising, and planning, including plans for HRC's office building. Currently, there
            is no separate subseries for founding documents. Articles of incorporation, bylaws and
            their revisions, and other key records relating to the founding and development of
            HRC(F) as an organization can be found in the Education Department's 20th Year History
            Project files (Series VII). Files regarding various mergers with other organizations are
            also found primarily in the 20th Year History Project files.</p>
          <p>Note that most of the official records of the HRC(F) Board of Directors, Board of
            Governors, and Human Rights Campaign Foundation Board have not yet been transferred to
            the archives, and the use of Board and Executive Director files is currently
            restricted.</p>

            <p>Included here are the correspondence, subject files, and other files maintained by
              each head of HRC(F).  Currently it consists primarily of the records of Elizabeth
              Birch, with scattered files from others. The early files contain a lot of
              correspondence from long-time Administrative Assistant Farley Peterson. These boxes
              are not yet open for research use. HRC has yet to determine the length of their
              restriction.</p>
            <p>Early files of Stephen Endean, 1970-1985, came with Gay Rights National Lobby files
              HRC inherited and are in Series II. Additional Endean files may be found in the
              Fairness Fund and Field Division files in Series V and in the Right to Privacy
              Foundation files in Series VIII. Some files from Steve Endean's tenure as HRC
              Treasurer and a few additional files from executive directors Vic Basile and Tim
              McFeeley are in the 20th Year History Project files (Series VII).</p>

            <p>Included here are files from HRC(F)'s efforts to encourage membership, including
              files from the Insider Program, later the Federal Club, and the Sustainer Program. 
              Much of the work to encourage new members happened at the local level at events
              planned by the Constituent Mobilization Division and Field office, so researchers
              should look in those series too.  Also here is documentation of HRC's communication
              with its members, including member feedback on issues, both protest and support. The
              direct marketing files show HRC's efforts at communicating with members and appealing
              for funds through the years. Also included are correspondence and files from the
              Development Department. Records containing financial information are restricted for 25
              years from date of creation.</p>

        </did>
        <scopecontent>
          <p>GRNL was founded in 1976 and merged with HRCF in 1985.  This series contains files of
            Steve Endean, 1970-1985, and records of the Gay Rights National Lobby 1976-1985,
            including founding documents; GRNL board meeting packets, 1976-1985; other
            administrative files; files from GRNL's lobbying work in the US Congress, mostly on
            immigration reform; and files from the Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forums, 1984-85, and
            other projects. Endean kept files about lesbian and gay civil rights issues in various
            localities around the country, 1978-88. His files also contain correspondence from
            1981-85, including his resignation letter from GRNL.</p>
          <p>GRNL's subject files on related organizations and on HIV and AIDS appear to have been
            transferred to HRC and then maintained by HRC staff for some time. These files are found
            in Series III: Legislative and Public Policy.</p>

        </did><scopecontent>
          <p>These administrative, subject, and candidate files and the files of two staff members,
            E. Rosenthal and S. Smith, document the legislative and public policy work of HRC(F)
            from 1980 to 2005. The records indicate that at least from 1989 to 1995, this work was
            undertaken by the Public Policy Department. The Public Policy Department held subject
            files with material dating back to 1975. HRCF's Legislative Reports and Weekly Updates
            (1989-1991) provide insight into the issues HRCF was tracking and the information
            subscribers were receiving. There are three separate subject files: one on
            organizations, started by GRNL; one on HIV/AIDS, including youth and school issues; and
            one on the military, including the Don't Ask/Don't Tell policy. S. Smith's files
            document HIV and AIDS related work of HRCF in the mid-late 1980s.</p>

          <p>Included here are HRC(F)'s efforts to mobilize citizens to send messages to Congress at
            key times.  HRCF adopted this approach when it merged with Steve Endean's Fairness Fund
            in 1988 and created SpeakOut and a Field Division for grassroots organizing.  The
            records of the Fairness Fund are also included here.</p>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Steve Endean created the Fairness Fund (FF) in December 1986 to fight right-wing
              amendments in Congress and encourage positive federal legislation relevant to the gay
              and lesbian community by providing overnight constituent mail to national political
              leaders. FF fund staff wrote the text for letters and mailgrams and arranged to have
              them delivered on behalf of concerned individuals. FF tried to capitalize on the large
              crowd at the 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. These records
              include organizational vital records (including article of incorporation, bylaws, and
              the 1988 merger documents), FF board meeting documents, and correspondence.</p>

          </did>
          <scopecontent>
            <p>When the Fairness Fund merged with HRCF in 1988, HRCF created a Field Division for
              grassroots organizing, and Steve Endean returned to lead this unit. Some of this kind
              of work had been formerly conducted by the Constituent Mobilization Division, and some
              of the files here may have originated with the Constituent Mobilization unit. Endean
              created Speak Out to carry on the constituent mail functions of the Fairness Fund.</p>
            <p>The records in this series document the work of the Field Division, including event
              materials, grassroots lobbying, education, the Marches on Washington in 1987, 1988,
              and 1989, state based activities, and Speak Out. They include the records of Seth
              Kilbourn, National Field Director, 2000-2004.</p>

          <p>This series documents the media statements, publications, and other communications,
            both print and on-line, of the Human Rights Campaign Fund and HRC. It contains press
            releases and publications from the Communications Department, 1980-2004. Kim Mills
            worked here in 1996-1998 and gathered together these historical files. David Smith was
            the Director of the Communications Department in 2004. In a 2005 restructuring, he
            became the Vice President of Programs, a unit that includes both the Communications and
            Marketing Division and the Public Education and Outreach Division (formerly the
            Education Department.) Some HRC publications were cataloged separately and are listed at
            the bottom of this guide.</p>

        </did> <scopecontent>
          <p>Documenting the education and outreach activities of HRC(F), this series contains the
            records of the Education Department, which became the Public Education and Outreach
            Division in 2005. Most of the files come from Kim Mills, who was the Education Director
            from 1998 to 2004. The department files include the director's correspondence,
            1998-2004, her speeches, and two disks of her computer files, as well as some
            photographs and various organization-wide administrative materials. The Education
            Department was in charge of HRC's web site until the creation of an Information
            Technology unit in 2004, and the files here show web trend statistics and work on web
            redesign, 1997-2004.</p>
          <p>Various important administrative documents, including bylaws and merger documents, can
            be found in the Education Department's 20th Year History Project files.</p>
          <p>Other subseries contain subject files used in the creation of educational materials by
            and for HRCF staff on issues including the military, family, health, religion, and
            National Coming Out Day. Workplace files document WorkNet (HRC's Internet portal for
            workplace information), HRC's Business Council, and issues such as Exxon Mobile's
            corporate polices.</p>

              outreach.</p>

              files on gay politics, key races, polling data, minority AIDS outreach, and MEDPAC

          </did><scopecontent>
            <p>In March 1988, HRHF changed its name to The Triangle Institute (TTI) and was active
              under this name until 1995. Its programs included the Electoral Research Project
              (ERP), the MEDPAC project focused on disseminating reliable information related to the
              AIDS crisis, and after 1993, the National Coming Out Day Project (NCOD). Documented
              here are TTI's fund raising through grant applications and direct marketing and
              HRHF/TTI Board meeting packets and some of its project files. The files on the
              Electoral Research Project and on AIDS projects include earlier work done by HRHF. The
