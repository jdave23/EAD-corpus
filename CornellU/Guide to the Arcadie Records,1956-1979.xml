         <p>Arcadie was not only the most important French homosexual publication, but also a homophile social and cultural organization that maintained a private club in Paris from the mid-50s until the late 1970s. It sponsored social gatherings, talks and cultural outings. At various points in its history, Arcadie also sponsored activities in the French provinces and in Belgium. The Arcadie club was known as the Club littâeraire et scientifique des Pays Latins (CLESPALA) and the Paris-Club.</p>
