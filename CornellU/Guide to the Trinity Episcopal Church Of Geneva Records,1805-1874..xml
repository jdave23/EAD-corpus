         <p>The records of Trinity Episcopal Church of Geneva document the activities of the church administration and give membership information, including two volumes (1805-1836 and 1836-1855) listing marriages, baptisms, confirmations, burials, communicants, individual parishioners and some
		  financial records. Two volumes of vestry minutes (1806-1836 and 1836-1874) contain detailed entries concerning official church functions and brief notes on elections for various officers, pew allocation, construction of the church building, acquisition or sale of various accoutrements, and various functionary resolutions.</p>
         <p>Because
		  of the nature of these records there is no direct narrative of community or congregational dynamics.</p>

				considerations of building a new church, including financial planning and considerable architectural description and explanation on July 24, l84l; a May 10, 1844 entry noting the report of a committee organized to "ascertain what rules of business and proceedings of the Vestry have fallen into disuse;" and an entry of January 12, 1845
				concerning pews in the church, including a four page list (covering 129 pews) with the following headings: Pew No., Names of Holders, Purchase Price, Minimum Valuation, Annual Tax, Annual Rent , and Remarks.</p>

				including in the records, for example, an extensive four page report on church finances dated March 22, 1845.</p>
