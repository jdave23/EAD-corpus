         <p>The United Methodist Church of Waterloo was first organized on February 27, 1833 as the Fletcher Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Waterloo, the name later being changed to the Methodist Episcopal Society of Waterloo. A church edifice was constructed in 1835 which burned in 1843. A new church was built and dedicated in March 1844 which seated 450 and had a basement for meetings and four classrooms for the church's sabbath school A house was purchased for a parsonage in 1841. The church was subject to frequent revivals and by 1876 had a membership of 230.</p>

         <head id="a3">COLLECTION DESCRIPTION</head>
         <p>The records of the United Methodist Church of Waterloo consist of a book of trustees' records and a membership register.</p>
         <p> The trustees' records include both meeting minutes (September 11, 1843 to November 11, 1872) and financial accounts (1844 to 1847, 1855 to 1856 and 1873). The minutes cover official activities including financial matters, election of trustees (who in this congregation served as class leaders) and church maintenance. The accounts list both collections and expenditures for the years specified above.</p>
         <p> The membership register includes an undated alphabetical list of members with two revisions for each respective letter, one of which is dated 1868. Additionally, lists of Probationers (1864-1866) and a list of marriages (1865-1866).  Also includes a church booklet published in 1976.</p>

               <p> This volume includes both meeting minutes and accounts of church collections and expenditures.</p>
               <p> Meeting minutes (September 11, 1843 to November 11, 1872) note trustee action on election of board members (who were also class leaders in this congregation) and church officers, insurance for the church, church maintenance, purchasing and selling property, and raising funds for the church. Specifics of the various resolutions were apparently kept on separate file as the bulk of the entries refer to a motion by a particular individual and pursuant action without noting the particular subject or sense of the motion.</p>
               <p> The church resolved to erect an edifice on September 18, 1843 and to alter and enlarge their structure on December 13$ 1859. Church trustees were elected by "Male members of full age" as in the entry of October 20, 1845 and included in the process a pro forma discussion of voting qualifications, the specifics of which are not included. Financial concerns of the church are addressed throughout the minutes, examples being the citation of three members on May 7, 1855 to show why they failed to pay a church assessment, and a resolution of November 16, 1857 to negotiate a $250.00 loan to pay off the church's debts.</p>
               <p> The trustees' accounting of church collections and expenditures were organized with collections on a left hand page and expenditures on the right. Two pages preceding the meeting minutes cover the years 1873. After the minutes is a single page list entitled "Inventory of Parsonage Furniture belonging to the Methodist E Church of Waterloo taken 22 Feb 1871." Following this page, in imperfect chronology are financial accounts of the years 1844 to 1866, as follows: 1859-1866 (26 pp.), 1844-1847 (12 pp.), and 1855-1858 (12 pp.).</p>
