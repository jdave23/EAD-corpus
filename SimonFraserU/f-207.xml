      <note>
        <p>In January 1970 the Board of Governors created SFU's third Vice-President position: Vice-President, University and Community Services. By the time Stanley Roberts started in 1971, the position had been renamed Vice-President, Development. Shortly after, the name was changed again to Vice-President, University Services. <lb/><lb/>In 1971 the Vice-President had five primary responsibilities that included improving public relations through community services; improving internal non-academic activities (university student services); increasing student enrollment; ensuring adequate funding of university functions; and maximizing personnel and budget efficiency. <lb/><lb/>In 1972 S.T. (Stephen) Stratton resigned as the Director of the Division of University Services. The position of Director was discontinued and Roberts, as Vice-President, assumed full administrative responsibility for University Services. From 1971 to 1977 he reported directly to the university President. By 1972 University Services had expanded to include Alumni Affairs, the Campus Information Centre, the Centre for Communication and the Arts, Chaplain's Service, Counselling Services, Health Services, Residence and Housing, the International Office, the Reading and Study Centre, the Resources Office, School Liaison, the Student Placement Office, University News Service, and the University Theatre. In 1973 Financial Aid and the Daycare Centre were added to his sphere of responsibility, followed by Athletics and Recreation Services in 1974. <lb/><lb/>From 1972 to 1973 Ian B. Kelsey served as Assistant to the Vice-President, University Services and was followed by William (Bill) Stewart from 1974 to 1977. When Roberts resigned in 1977, the position of Vice-President, University Services was discontinued. Bill Stewart, his former assistant, became the new Director of Student Services (a position Stewart would hold until 1996). In 1981 the title Vice-President, University Development and Extension was resurrected with the appointment of Jack Blaney, but the focus was on expansion of the university, not provision of student services.</p>

      <p>The fonds consists of records relating to the development and administration of non-academic services for students, staff and faculty at Simon Fraser University. Activities, topics and events documented include the Vice-President's correspondence with university services departments, Student Society, the university community, and provincial and national organizations; participation on university committees; development of projects, programs, and workshops; and publications. Also included are records of the Assistant to Vice-President, University Services.<lb/><lb/>The types of documents include meeting agendas, minutes, and supporting papers; correspondence and reports; annual reports; statistical studies; budgets and financial working papers; contracts; and publications including student handbooks, brochures, posters, newsletters, and newspaper clippings.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="1.8B13">
      <p>Records in this fonds were originally processed as part of F-54 Campus Community Services where the records had been divided into series based on the tenure of each Dean/Director. During the arrangement and description of F-107 Student Services, the decision was made to integrate the records of F-54 as the records reflected the history and continuous administration of Student Services offices and programs. In keeping with past practices with university fonds, the records of the Vice-President, University Services were removed from F-54 and redescribed as a separate fonds. A concordance has been created that links old F-54 file numbers with their new F-207 file numbers. A paper copy is available in the collection file for F-207 and electronically via the Archives Information System (AIS) database. Please see an archivist for more information.<lb/><lb/>While the records consist mainly of those created/received by Stanley Roberts, there has been some integration with the records of Steve Stratton who acted as Director of University Services from 1971 to 1972. Stratton's resignation resulted in the transfer and amagamation of his records into Roberts' filing system. The original order of these records is unknown, making it impossible to separate the records so they have been processed as found. Within each series, the records have been arranged chronologically.</p>
