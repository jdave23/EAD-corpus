<p>The information for the administrative history was provided by the Women's Monument Project Committee. <lb/><lb/>The Women's Monument Project was founded in 1990 by Christine McDowell, a Capilano College student, in response to the massacre of fourteen women at Montreal's l'Ecole Polytechnique on December 6, 1989. Genevieve Bergeron, Nathalie Croteau, Anne-Marie Edward, Barbara Klucznik, Maryse Leclair, Sonia Pelletier, Annie St-Arneault, Helene Colgan, Barbara Daigneault, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganiere, Anne-Marie Lemay, Michele Richard and Annie Turcotte all died at the hands of a man who said he killed them because they were women. A few months after the unveiling of the monument, Marker of Change, by artist Beth Alber in Thornton Park in Vancouver on December 6, 1997, the Project became inactive. The Project's objectives were to focus national attention on the widespread problem of male violence against women; to build a permanent public art memorial to the fourteen women and to all women who have been victims of violence; to create a lasting testament to the value of women, the sanctity of human life and the refusal to be defeated by violence; and, to offer employment opportunities to women in all aspects of the Project from fundraising to design to construction. Through its fundraising and consciousness-raising efforts, the Project made contact with thousands of individual donors from across Canada and around the world, with community groups, unions and associations, schools, corporations, government, private foundations and the media.<lb/><lb/>A Committee coordinated the Project. The floor of the Orientation Stand at the Monument site states, "A feminist project realized by a small group of women in collaboration with Capilano College, with love for all people." During the Project's eight-year duration, from 3 to 10 women actively served on the Committee at any given time. Committee members included Lisa Brisebois, Kim Bruce, Janine Carscadden, Dawn Dalley, Christine McDowell, Vanessa Pasqualetto, Krista Marshall, Lianne Payne, Lindsay Setzer, and Elinor Warkentin. Other members were Susan Anderson, Gail Attara, Rita Beiks, Jennifer Bradley, Lorna Brown, Margot Butler, Karen Egger, Alexandra Ewashen, Maura Gatensby, Cate Jones, Deborah MacFarlane, Kelly Phillips, Wonda Seaboyer, Elena Shragge and Maria Walther. Many volunteers who did not sit on the Committee also participated in the Project. Carol McCandless and Olga Kempo represented Capilano College.<lb/><lb/>Usually meeting every two weeks, the Committee was a forum for collective decision-making. In 1992 a paid, part-time staff position was created, and in late 1993 a Coordinator for the national design competition was hired for ten months. There was no core funding; these positions were supported through government grants or fundraising. <lb/><lb/>Capilano College sponsored the Project by providing its endorsement, infrastructure (such as office space and telephones), charitable tax status, and administrative support.</p>

<p>The Department of Psychology was one of the original departments of the Faculty of Arts when the University opened in 1965. It offered courses in general experimental and applied psychology to undergraduate students based upon recommendations of the Canadian and American Psychological Associations. The Department also offered graduate work leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. <lb/><lb/>The department functioned through a number of committees which varied over the years. In 1978, for example they included the Undergraduate Studies Committee, Graduate Studies Committee, Space and Equipment Committee, Appointments Committee, Graduate Admissions Committee, Colloquium Committee, Applied/Clinical Committee, Departmental Tenure Committee, and the University Human Experimental Committee.<lb/><lb/>The department expanded steadily from its inception. By 1979 there were 25 faculty members offering 60 undergraduate courses and 48 graduate courses. Enrollment comprised 550 undergraduate students and 57 graduate students.</p>

<p>The Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies was created in 1988 as a merger between the Spanish Language Program of the Department of Literature, Languages and Linguistics and the Latin American Studies Program of the Faculty of Arts. The department was abolished in 1996. <lb/><lb/>In February 1971 a Latin American Studies Program was proposed to Senate. This program was first under the jurisdiction of the Division of General Studies in 1972, and then placed in the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies upon the inception of that faculty at the end of 1972. It was the first area studies minor at SFU and served as a model for the creation of similar programs in Canadian and Africa-Middle East Studies, also administered the Dean of FIDS. By 1984, Latin American Studies had evolved from granting an area studies minor to granting joint major degrees in conjunction with six other arts disciplines (Archaeology, Geography, History, Political Science, Spanish, and Sociology and Anthropology). The field school, first held in Guatemala in 1976, generated additional interest in the program. The LAS Student Union organized film series and other events. With the dissolution of FIDS in 1985. the program became part of the Faculty of Arts until the creation of the Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies in 1988.<lb/><lb/>Spanish language instruction at SFU took place first in the Department of Modern Languages, established in 1965, and later renamed the Department of Languages, Literature, and Linguistics in 1978 to reflect its broader scholarly focus. In 1988, the department was disbanded and instruction in Spanish language and literature was transferred to the Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies.<lb/><lb/>Upon the dissolution of the Department of Spanish and Latin American Studies, Spanish language instruction was transferred to the Language Training Institute in the Faculty of Arts. The Latin American Studies program was placed in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the Faculty of Arts. For further information on the dissolution of the department, see the appendix (Simon Fraser News, June 20, 1996).</p>

<p>The Universities Act , 1963, c. 52, s. 25 provided for a Faculty Council from each of British Columbia's three universities. Membership included the President as Chairman, the Registrar as secretary, the Librarian, the Deans and at least five faculty members. The Faculty Council was granted several powers (Universities Act, s. 61) including making rules and regulations with respect to student discipline, and approving the establishment of a representative student government.<lb/><lb/>SFU's Faculty Council, established in 1965, consisted of the officials listed above and 6 faculty members (2 elected from each of the original faculties of Arts, Science, and Education). One of its earliest actions was to examine the proposed constitution of the Simon Fraser Student Society in order to facilitate the formal recognition of the SFSS. In addition, it studied the issue of a separate graduate student society. The Council established policies in such areas as library fines, traffic violations, and conduct in student residences. It also heard individual disciplinary cases involving students accused of misconduct such as cheating and plagiarism. The last minutes of the Faculty Council are from 1973. The revised Universities Act in 1974 did not provide for the continuation of the Council.</p>

<p>The Universities Act, 1963, c. 52, s. 25 provided for the "Faculties in joint meeting" to determine the number and manner of election of faculty to the Faculty Council. Joint Faculty determined that there should be 6 faculty representatives (2 elected from each of the original faculties of Arts, Science, and Education). In its initial meetings, Joint Faculty discussed such issues as admission requirements, teaching loads and the establishment of a faculty lounge. University President, Patrick McTaggart-Cowan, was elected Chairman of the Joint Faculty; the Registrar acted as secretary. Following the censure of SFU by the Canadian Association of University Teachers, the Joint Faculty expressed a lack of confidence in President McTaggart-Cowan, who resigned his position in May 1968.<lb/><lb/>Also in that year, an interim council of Joint Faculty was established consisting of five members from Joint Faculty. The Interim Council was empowered to examine a set of declarations including the democratic selection of academic administrators, the establishment of an exclusively academic Senate, and the elimination of the Board of Governors "interference in academic affairs." Under the terms of reference of the Interim Council, the Student Society was invited to choose a committee to work with the Council on the implementation of these principles and the principle of student participation in university government. The Council made recommendations to Joint Faculty, which, in turn, made recommendations to Senate. The basic provisions for electing chairs, and the ability to recall chairs and deans originated with the work of the Interim Council.</p>

<p>The Pacific Women's Graphic Arts Cooperative, in co-operation with Press Gang Publishers (a feminist press in Vancouver), produced Makara magazine from 1975 to 1978. The magazine was billed as "The Canadian magazine by women for people," and sought to explore alternatives to traditional journal structures and work toward positive social change. Makara is a general interest magazine that reflects a wide range of interests and philosophies, and contains fiction, articles, interviews and dialogue, features, and children's section. The Co-operative, consisting of ten women, controlled the majority of production, with printing and four-colour layout done by Press Gang. Makara stopped publishing after 13 issues because it was not self-supporting; sales and advertising revenues did not cover printing costs or salaries.</p>

<p>The Women's Cultural Exchange incorporated under the Societies Act in October 1976. Its objectives were to promote an appreciation of women involved in cultural endeavors in the community; to establish a common space for women who wish to share and exchange their skills, arts and resources in a congenial setting; to facilitate self-help through skill-building workshops, meetings and other educational activities; and, to further communication in order to develop a more cohesive women's community. A space was found at 217 East 16th Avenue and opened April 15, 1977. The Exchange hosted film nights, art exhibits, workshops, readings, performances and other like activities. After five months the Exchange shut down due to lack of revenue and an insufficient number of women in the Exchange collective to run the establishment effectively. </p>

<p>The Simon Fraser Teachers' Union held its organizational meeting and first general meeting on July 27, 1967. Its membership consisted of faculty members who felt that the Simon Fraser University Faculty Association (SFUFA) was not representing their interests. The SFTU remained active until 1968, when it integrated into the SFUFA after that body called for the resignation of SFU's president, Patrick Duncan McTaggart-Cowan.<lb/><lb/>The SFTU was formed, in part, as a reaction to perceived inadequacies with the SFUFA due to its close association with university administration. The SFTU was distinct from the SFUFA because it excluded from its membership the President, administrators, heads, librarians and teaching assistants. The SFTU was designed to deal solely with the problems of faculty members, and to advocate on their behalf<lb/><lb/>The Teachers' Union's stated aims were as follows:<lb/><lb/>to promote, establish, and maintain the highest academic standards among the members of the full-time teaching faculty at Simon Fraser University; to concern itself with the welfare of its membership specifically in the areas of academic freedom, tenure, promotions, dismissal and renewal procedures, and in general to adopt the methods of collective bargaining in furthering the vital interests of its membership; to ensure that the university adheres to democratic principles and procedures in the relations that are established between students, teaching assistants, faculty, administration, and all other members of the academic community; to provide ways and means of furthering the interests of faculty not available through other teacher associations (e.g. Faculty Association, CAUT), due to the limited effectiveness imposed upon such associations by their structure, and, by the exclusion of heads of departments and other administrative personnel, to minimize conflicts of interest that militate against the best interests of the faculty.<lb/><lb/>The Simon Fraser Teachers' Union executive, consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, corresponding secretary, and four directors managed the business of the union. The STU was the first union of university professors in Canada, although it did not receive certification under the existing labour code.</p>

<p>The Simon Fraser University Staff Association was established in 1966 by staff on campus who felt that conditions and salaries at the university were in need of improvement. An association, rather than a union, was formed as staff felt that freedom of action within the university was preferable at the time. By 1968 the Staff Association was an officially recognized body of the university, and was registered under the Societies Act. The aims of the Staff Association, as given in its 1968 constitution, were to unite staff under a single organization capable of acting on its behalf, to communicate with administration on matters affecting staff, to obtain and improve the best possible conditions of employment, to have representation on university committees, and to encourage the continued education of its members. In 1971, the constitution was changed to read:<lb/><lb/>The primary object of the Association is to serve the common interests of the non-academic employees of Simon Fraser University who are not members of trade unions in all matters concerning wages, salaries, benefits, and conditions of employment in such manner as to promote the fair treatment of all such employees individually and as compared in general to other persons and groups of persons similarly employed at Simon Fraser University and in other parts of the Greater Vancouver area.<lb/><lb/>Membership in the Association was voluntary, although all eligible staff were encouraged to join in order to give it stronger support for voicing the opinions and needs of its members.<lb/><lb/>By 1974, some members of the university staff expressed interest in union representation. A Committee to Investigate Alternatives was formed to explore the possibilities of union representation, although the Staff Association executive did not support this group. Concurrently, a number of unions attempted to organize staff on campus: the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Office and Technical Employees Union, and the Association of University and College Employees all campaigned to represent staff at SFU. In response the Staff Association decided to seek certification through the Labour Relations Board. On November 19, 1974 an election was held to determine if staff at SFU wanted a union, and if so, which union they wanted to represent them (the Staff Association or the Association of University and College Employees). Staff voted to have AUCE as their representative, and, as a result, the Staff Association began winding up its affairs. By December 1974 it had moved out of its offices, gave their surplus equipment and stationary to AUCE, and turned their records over to the university archives.</p>

<p>The origin of Facilities Management can be traced back to the appointment of the University's first staff member, Arthur Gordon Orr, as Superintendent of Engineering Services on 1 September 1963. By September 1964, the position was renamed Manager of General Services. In 1968, the Department of Physical Plant and Planning was created to manage one of the functions of General Services. In 1988, Physical Plant and Planning was replaced by Facilities Management.<lb/><lb/>General Services was originally responsible for building construction and plant maintenance, as well as for many other services such as traffic, security, fire prevention, purchasing, bookstore operations, central stores, mail, and food services. Some services, such as food, security, and building cleaning, were contracted to outside firms. In these cases, the Department acted in an overall supervisory role. Other functions, such as purchasing, were carried out by departmental employees. The scheduling of space was an important concern of the new university, and the Manager chaired a Space Usage Committee, charged with room allocation.<lb/><lb/>In August 1967, General Services was reorganized into three sections: Physical Plant and Planning, Purchasing, and Ancillary Services. The following year, these sections became departments, the heads of which reported to the Vice-President, Administration. Physical Plant and Planning, headed by a Director, was responsible for the maintenance and operations of physical plant, the planning of all future facilities, and the construction of all facilities. These duties included liaison with the faculty on space problems. Ancillary Services was responsible for such functions as food services, security, and mail. Purchasing was charged with purchasing supplies and equipment.<lb/><lb/>In 1972, Physical Plant and Planning was formally divided into three separate divisions: Planning and Design, Construction, and Maintenance and Operations. The functions of these divisions were outlined in a l973 report, "Organizations, Responsibilities, and Objectives: Physical Plant and Planning." The Planning and Design Division was authorized "to co-ordinate planning and design for the physical development of the university." Construction Division was made responsible "for managing, on behalf of the University, the programme involving the expenditure of capital funds for the construction of new buildings and facilities, as well as designated minor projects." This function included liaison with departmental user groups.<lb/><lb/>Maintenance and Operations, the largest division, was comprised of various sections: Building and Grounds, Mechanical and Plumbing, Electrical Section, Projects (responsible for estimating and scheduling Work Orders), Maintenance and Operations Office, and Janitorial and Safety. In addition to regular maintenance work carried out by all sections, Projects section estimated and scheduled work orders, which were then carried out by tradespeople from the various sections. At the start of the 1974-1975 fiscal year, the three sections were reduced to two due to the amalgamation of the Planning and Design and Construction sections.<lb/><lb/>Ancillary Services supervised a number of functions. From 1974-1983, it was responsible for purchasing, duplicating, telephone, mail, traffic and security, central stores, and food services. From 1974-1979, it was also responsible for athletics and recreation, and from 1976-1979 for safety. In December 1983, Ancillary Services was dissolved as a separate unit, and Physical Plant and Planning assumed responsibility for several of Ancillary Services' functions: traffic and security, central stores, campus mail, telephones, and office equipment.<lb/><lb/>On 1 February 1986, Physical Plant and Planning began to report to the newly created position of Executive Director, Administrative Services, the successor to the Vice-President, Administration. During that year the Department was divided into three different units: Physical Plant, Facilities Planning and Construction, and Support Services. The responsibility for traffic and security was moved to Student Services. In 1988, Facilities Management was created to assume the functions formerly carried out by Physical Plant, and Facilities Planning and Construction.</p>

<p>The University Archives acquires, preserves and makes available three categories of materials: (1) the official records of the University, including those created by the Board of Governors, Senate, University committees, faculties, departments and administrative offices; (2) materials documenting the wider University community; and (3) historical research collections that promote the teaching and research activities of the University.<lb/><lb/>The Archives was established within the University Library in 1968 when librarian Liisa Fagerlund was appointed University Archivist on a half-time basis. She continued in this post until 1975 when she left the University. From 1975 to 1978, the Archives functioned within the Special Collections division of the Library. Archival duties were carried out by various library staff members. In 1978, the University Archives was established as a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. Donald Baird, recently retired as University Librarian, became University Archivist and held this position until his retirement in 1990. Jim Ross served as University Archivist from 1991 to 1993, and was succeeded by Ian Forsyth in 1994.<lb/><lb/>When the Archives was a function of the University Library, the University Archivist reported to the University Librarian. When the Archives was established as a separate administrative unit, the University Archivist reported directly to the University President. The reporting structure changed in 1986 when the University Archivist reported to the Vice-President, Research/Information Systems; in 1990, when the University Archivist reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic; and in 1996, when the University Archivist reported to the Registrar/Dean of Students.</p>

<p>The British Columbia and Yukon Association of Women's Centres (BCYAWC) was founded in 1985 as an umbrella organization of over 30 women's centres. It ceased operations in 1998.<lb/><lb/>Women's centres developed in the 1970s as a project of the women's movement. They served as women-only space to practice an egalitarian model of organization. They were devoted to improving the status of women through education and political action and to helping women through the provision of safe space, support, and services. Over the years, the number of women using women's centres increased as the centres struggled to find ongoing funding.<lb/><lb/>By 1984, women's centres were looking for a more structured way to work towards common goals, including secure funding and improved cooperation and communication among centres. In 1985 they established the BCYAWC and incorporated under the BC Society Act on November 12, 1987. By 1990, the BCYAWC consisted of 31 women's resource centres – 30 in BC, one in the Yukon. The Association was managed by a volunteer coordinating collective that included a secretary, treasurer, 11 regional representatives, and six members-at-large. Meetings were scheduled for four times a year.<lb/><lb/>Around 1993 the group began to lose its cohesiveness because of funding and other issues. In 1995, the province cut the Association's funding. The following year, the Association was struck from the Registry of Societies for failure to file required documentation such as audited financial statements. While the Association made an attempt to file the papers necessary to regain status, the remaining members in 1998 agreed to dissolve the organization and distribute its assets.</p>

<p>In 1991 the British Columbia and Yukon Association of Women's Centres (BCYAWC) initiated a training strategy called Planning for Change. It was preceded by a needs assessment questionnaire sent to member centres to identify the organizational and resource problems to be addressed by such a strategy and uncover solutions to common problems. The results were used to develop training workshops and a resource manual, "From Burnout to Breakthrough." The manual was completed in 1993. It begins with an historical overview of the development of women's centres and includes guidelines for operating a centre including fundraising, marketing, recruitment, and outreach.</p>

<p>F. Margaret Hayward was the founder and first director of the Reading and Study Centre at SFU.<lb/><lb/>She was born in Vancouver in 1919, received her BA and Social Work Diplomas from UBC in 1941 and 1943 respectively, and later earned an MA in psychology from Case Western Reserve University in 1951. Hayward worked as a social worker, counselor, and specialist in reading improvement<lb/><lb/>In 1963 Hayward wrote to Chancellor Gordon Shrum to suggest that the new university develop a Reading Service to improve the study skills of its students. Shrum and President Patrick McTaggart-Cowan agreed with her proposal and hired Hayward to be the Director of the Reading and Study Centre at SFU at the rank of Assistant Professor. The Centre was administratively placed in the Department of Psychology because Hayward believed that it was important to emphasize the academic nature of the program. Under Hayward's leadership, the Centre operated successfully for several years. When the Centre was moved to University Services in 1971, Hayward resigned her position and left the University.</p>

<p>The Department of Geography was established by the Board of Governors in 1965 as one of the original Departments in the Faculty of Arts. The Department was responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the broad fields of Human and Physical Geography. In 1965, the Department consisted of five faculty members and offered six undergraduate courses in the areas of economic, social and physical geography. Subsequent additions to its degree program offerings were a M.A. and Ph.D. in 1966, a B.Sc. in Physical Geography in 1978 and M.Sc. in 1981. The latter two degrees were both through the Faculty of Science. In 1979, the Department had 21 faculty. Members of the Department have also been involved in interdisciplinary programs with other departments and faculties, including the Master of Natural Resource Management Program in Applied Science; the Canadian Studies Program in the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies; the Institute for Quaternary Research; and the Latin American Studies Program in the Faculty of Arts.<lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by a Chair and a number of standing committees. The Chair was the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities included the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments; and representation of the Department to external bodies. The number and composition of departmental committees varied little over time. In a draft Constitution of 1969, there were nine standing committees: Undergraduate Studies, Graduate Studies, Library, Accommodation and Equipment, Budget, Appointments and Guest Lecturers, Salaries and Promotions, Cartographic Services, and Tenure. By 1990, the Resources Committee had replaced the former Accommodation and Equipment and Cartographic Services Committees; and the Departmental Tenure Committee had replaced the Salaries and Promotions Committee. Ad hoc committees, such as the Chairman's Search Committee, were also formed.</p>

<p>Press Gang Printers was a feminist printing collective operating in Vancouver from 1970 to 1993. It incorporated under British Columbia's Companies Act as Press Gang Publishers Ltd. in April 1970. The organization included both women and men until 1974, when it was established as a women-only feminist collective.<lb/><lb/>Press Gang published its first book under its own imprint in 1976, a collection of essays entitled "I'm Not Mad, I'm Angry: Women Look at Psychiatry." Over the years, printing and publishing activities increasingly diverged, and in 1982 Press Gang established a separate collective to manage the publishing operations. In 1989 the separation was completed when the two collectives formally became distinct legal and corporate entities, Press Gang Printers Ltd. and Press Gang Publishers Feminist Cooperative. The two organizations, however, remained closely associated and continued to operate out of the same premises -- 603 Powell Street, where the shop was established in 1978, after four years in its previous location at 821 East Hastings Street.<lb/><lb/>Politics were central to Press Gang Printers' mandate. It was an active participant in North American feminist networks, including the British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW). It provided training and opportunities for women in a trade traditionally dominated by men, and it participated in the labour movement, particularly after 1989 when the collective unionized, joining the Communications Workers of America, Local 226. Press Gang maintained a policy of rejecting material deemed sexist or racist. Its clients were primarily local feminist, radical, activist and community groups, and, especially in the early years, it often printed material that mainstream shops would not accept.<lb/><lb/>Throughout its existence Press Gang Printers remained a collective, though its organizational structure evolved as it shifted from volunteer to paid labour, with increasing specialization and professionalism, and unionization. During the late 1980s changes in printing technology, free trade, the restructuring of the print industry, and growing competition from larger print shops created an increasingly difficult business environment. The collective survived a fiscal crisis in 1992, but in 1993, under a debt load greater than the total value of the company, Press Gang Printers was forced to cease operations.<lb/><lb/>Articles and other materials relating to Press Gang Printers' history are included in the appendix to this finding aid (hard copy version only, available in the Archives Reading Room).</p>

<p>The British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW) was founded in 1974 as an umbrella group of women's organizations. Its objective was to bring about women's liberation through fundamental social change, providing a provincial network of support, information- and resource-sharing, and coordinated action. Groups joined as affiliate members and were organized into regional units; federation-wide matters were overseen by the Coordinating Collective, several standing committees (Finance, Communications and Convention), and various ad hoc committees established to address specific issues and projects. At the Annual General Convention delegates from each of the regions elected committee members and voted on policy resolutions. The BCFW disbanded in 1989.</p>

<p>The Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics was established by the Board of Governors in 1965 under the name of the Department of Modern Languages. The Department was responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the discipline of languages and linguistics. Initially, the Department offered a B.A. program in four language divisions— French, German, Russian, and Spanish— or in linguistics. In 1966, a M.A. in Linguistics was introduced, followed in 1967 by a Ph.D. program. The curricula developed and expanded steadily and by 1970, language courses consisted of three sections: the language itself, linguistics, and literature. While the French and Spanish programs expanded, the German and Russian divisions had smaller enrollments and faculty allocations were reduced. In 1974, an M.A. (Teaching French) program was added and in 1980 the French Language Training Centre was opened. In 1978, the Department was renamed Languages, Literatures and Linguistics, and in 1989 it was disbanded. Upon its dissolution, the Department was replaced by the Departments of French, Linguistics, and Spanish and Latin American Studies. All other language instruction, including Chinese, Hindi, Italian, Latin, and Swahili, was moved to the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies in the Faculty of Arts. <lb/><lb/>The Department was initially organized administratively into a Chair, four sub-departments or divisions (French, German, Russian, and Spanish), and a number of standing committees. The Chair was the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities included the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments; and representation of the Department to external bodies. While the Chair had overall responsibility to the Department and the Dean of Arts for the efficient operation of the Department, most decisions were made at the committee level with major issues referred to departmental meetings. The Departmental Assistant was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Department, which included the management of the departmental budget, the scheduling of courses, the provision of liaison with administrative offices, and advising students.<lb/><lb/>The number and composition of departmental committees varied over time. In 1966, there were eleven committees, including the Departmental Advisory, Scholarship, Library, Graduate Studies, Curriculum, Journal, Promotions, Projects, Amerindian, Teaching Experiments and Textbook, and Laboratory committees. There were also departmental meetings under the name of the Plenary committee. By 1969, the number of committees had been reduced to four, including the Committee of Chairmen, Graduate Studies, Tenure, and Salaries. The number of divisions within the Department had also expanded to five to include Linguistics, and each of these bodies conducted its own meetings under the leadership of a director who reported to the departmental chair. At the time of an external review in 1975, the significant change to the committees structure was the addition of a Committee of Chairmen -- consisting of the Department Chair, the Departmental Assistant, the five divisional directors, and the chair of the Graduate Studies committee -- and Tenure, Promotion, and Salaries committees. Throughout its history, the Department formed ad hoc committees when required. </p>

<p>John Ellis came to SFU as a charter faculty member in the Faculty of Education. He received his Ed.D degree from the University of California at Berkeley and had a twenty-year career in public education before joining the University to direct the Professional Foundations Program. He served as temporary acting president of SFU for four days following the resignation of Patrick McTaggart-Cowan in May 1968.<lb/><lb/>In November of that year, a series of protests against Simon Fraser University's admissions policies and inconsistent accreditation for courses taken at other institutions culminated in a 65 hour "sit-in" in the University Administration Offices. The University Senate responded by charging Professor Ellis with the responsibility of "the development of a definitive and comprehensive admissions and standings policy in consultation with an advisory committee..." (Simon Fraser University Senate. Minutes of Meeting held November 20, 1968. Although there was an "advisory committee" named by Senate, the final report is the product of Dr. Ellis' research, reflection and writing. Admissions and Standards: A Suggested Policy was released late March 1969. In June 1969, Senate adopted the recommendations of the report with only minor revisions. The admissions controversy was effectively defused.<lb/><lb/>The Ellis Report as it was re-titled by the university community, was widely applauded in post-secondary education circles in British Columbia, and played an important role in the development of Simon Fraser University.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Honey Producers' Association (BCHPA) was founded in 1920 and continues as an active organization. Its functions are to promote beekeeping as a profitable activity, promote and assist in the marketing of produce and purchase of supplies, support apicultural research and education, and disseminate information about beekeeping and best practices to both Association members and the general public. BCHPA membership includes both commercial honey producers and hobbyists.<lb/><lb/>The BCHPA was formed as a result of a split within the Beekeepers Association of British Columbia, founded four years earlier in 1916. The disagreements related to the outbreak of a bee disease in 1916 and the requirement of registration for all beekeepers under the provincial government's revised Foul Brood Act. When the BCHPA broke away in 1920 it established two Divisions – Fraser Valley and Kootenay; in 1925 the Vancouver Island Beekeepers' Association joined as a third Division. The two provincial associations merged in 1931, with the older organization entering the BCHPA as the Greater Vancouver Division. Membership in the BCHPA peaked in 1978 with 1,290 members and 32 Divisions.<lb/><lb/>The BCHPA is organized into geographically based Divisions. A Central Executive acts as a coordinating body for Association-wide business, and is assisted by various standing and ad hoc committees. Divisions are headed by their own Executives and are responsible for holding divisional meetings, publishing newsletters, collecting membership fees, operating educational programs, acting as a purchasing cooperative for supplies and medications, advising the Central Executive and preparing resolutions for the BCHPA annual general meeting. The Central Executive is headed by an elected President and consists of officers elected at the annual meeting and appointed regional representatives. It functions primarily as a liaison body between the various Divisions and between the Association as a whole and the provincial Ministry, the BC Federation of Agriculture and the Canadian Honey Council. It is also responsible for producing the Association's newsletter.</p>

<p>The SFU Childcare Society presently operates eleven programs that are collectively known as the Children's Centre. The Children's Centre is an independent, legally incorporated non-profit society with registered charitable organization status. The Children's Centre provides full and part time care to approximately 240 children, ranging in age from 3 months to 12 years. Each program has its own physical space and is often referred to as a centre. A Board of Directors is composed of parent representatives, university representatives, childcare staff representatives and community representatives. The Executive Director is an ex-officio, non-voting member of the Board, hired through the University (with direction from the Society Board) to be the Coordinator for the Society and to act as a liaison between the Society and the University.<lb/><lb/>Daycare began at SFU in 1968 when a group of parents established the Simon Fraser Co-operative Family in a student lounge. By 1973, the Family Co-op had grown into the SFU Day Care Society with three units in different locations. By 1976, there were five licensed daycare centres all incorporated under the Burnaby Mountain Day Care Society.<lb/><lb/>In 1976 the University provided 1.2 million dollars to fund construction of a childcare complex, the first of its kind in Canada. The University also supported the appointment of a full-time director, Emily Campbell. For funding purposes, the Burnaby Mountain Day Care Society separated into five non-profit societies, which could each apply for grants. The five societies and their nine centres formed a loose federation, The Burnaby Association of University Child Care Societies, to set overall policy, coordinate activities, and exchange information. Centres remained autonomous in financing, staffing, and style of care.<lb/><lb/>In 1981 it became evident that current levels of University funding were in jeopardy. A Task Force was struck by the University to investigate the current organization of childcare on campus. Following recommendations of that Task Force, the five individual daycare societies were reorganized in 1982 into a single non-profit society, The SFU Childcare Society, which continues today.<lb/><lb/>The SFU Childcare Society is funded primarily through parent user fees and Board fund raising efforts. These monies are used for staff salaries and benefits, program related expenses, equipment purchase and upkeep, playgrounds, administrative costs and utilities.<lb/><lb/>A Licensing Agreement with the University provides for repairs and maintenance service for all the major building structures, comprehensive insurance, and the salary and benefits for the Executive Director and secretarial positions.</p>

<p>One of the original departments of Simon Fraser University, the Department of Mathematics was opened to students in September 1965 as part of the Faculty of Science. The Department has been responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in mathematics and statistics. In 1984 the name of the Department was changed to its present form. In 1965, there were five full and assistant professors, two instructors and one visiting lecturer. In 1986, the faculty comprised twenty professors, eleven associate professors and three assistant professors.<lb/><lb/>Initial programs offered led to the B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Mathematics. In 1977, a B.Sc. (honours) program was introduced. By 1986, honours programs in conjunction with other departments included Mathematical Physics, Mathematics and Computing Science, and Management and Systems Science. The original goal of the Department, which it has continued to emphasize, was to work towards excellence in pure mathematics, and in certain branches of mathematics, statistics and computing – a regimen frequently encountered in British and European universities, but at that time a rarity in North America.<lb/><lb/>Like other SFU departments, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics was organized administratively into a Head (renamed Chair in 1972), and departmental committees. While the Chair had overall responsibility to the Department and the Dean of Science for the efficient operation of the Department, most decisions were made at the committee level with major issues referred to Departmental meetings for decision. The long-standing committees of the Department were the Appointments Committee, renamed the Appointment and long-range Planning Committee; the Graduate Studies Committee; the Undergraduate Studies Committee; and the Salaries, Tenure and Promotion Committee (known also as the Departmental Tenure Committee (DTC) and the Tenure and Promotions Committee).</p>

<p>The British Columbia Assembly of Students (BCAS), formally established in 1966, grew out of a 1965 meeting of delegates from universities, colleges, technical schools, and secondary schools. The students wanted a province-wide forum for the discussion of issues relevant to them.<lb/><lb/>The BCAS was succeeded in 1969 by the British Columbia Union of Students, which included only university and regional college representatives. This group concentrated on issues such as unemployment, housing, and civil liberties. For example, it established a student employment task force, and produced a lengthy report on the subject.<lb/><lb/>The BC Union of Students, in turn, was succeeded in 1972 by the British Columbia Association of Student Unions, formed by representatives of 16 student councils across the province. The Association's formal structure was limited; it had no financing, no staff and no central coordination of information. To overcome these limitations, BCASU delegates resolved to restructure the organization. The result was the British Columbia Federation of Students.<lb/><lb/>In order to join the BCSF, a student organization had to conduct a referendum among its members to join the BCSF on the basis of a per student levy. The BCSF provided a means of communication between different student organizations in order to build support for common interests. An executive met regularly and was advised by a number of committees. As well, the BCSF held semi-annual conferences. The BCSF employed staff members from time to time as well as researchers to collect information on topics such as a dental plan, student housing, daycare, student employment, financial aid, transferability of courses, and the financing of post-secondary institutions.<lb/><lb/>In 1982, the Simon Fraser Student Society voted to join the Canadian Federation of Students. The BCSF reformed itself as the Canadian Federation of Students---Pacific Region.</p>

<p>Frances Wasserlein is a feminist, historian and social activist. Her research and social activism has focused on issues surrounding women's liberation. She completed a Master of Arts degree in history at Simon Fraser University in 1990. Her thesis, "An Arrow Aimed at the Heart": the Vancouver Women's Caucus and the Abortion Campaign, 1969-1971, investigated the history of the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC) and their organizing work for the Abortion Caravan from Vancouver to Ottawa in 1970.<lb/><lb/>Wasserlein was raised in Vancouver. She graduated from the University Program at Little Flower Academy in 1964. Wasserlein acknowledges becoming a feminist in 1976. At the time she was working as a secretary at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Her involvement with the union, and a summer job working at Vancouver Rape Relief contributed to an interest in social justice and social change. In April 1977 she left her job at UBC and began full time undergraduate studies at that university. She completed a BA (honors) in history in 1980.<lb/><lb/>During the summer of 1979 Wasserlein worked as a researcher for the Women's Office at UBC on a project related to the early contributions of women to the establishment of UBC and the role women played in student activism at the university. In 1979 and 1980 she worked with a small group of women to begin Battered Women's Support Services, providing self-help groups for women who were seeking an end to the violence that had driven them and their children from their homes.<lb/><lb/>After receiving her BA from UBC, Wasserlein worked for the YMCA as a co-manager of Munro House for eighteen months. Following that, she worked as a researcher and writer with the Women's Research Centre, working on studies related to the institutionalization of women's services. She supplemented her income by doing bookkeeping for various arts and non-profit organizations. Wasserlein worked on founding Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW) in 1982. She was also involved in the work of Women Against the Budget in 1983, a political group opposed to the legislation tabled by the Social Credit government following their victory in the 1983 provincial election.<lb/><lb/>Her interest in the source of conflict between and among individual women activists, and between and among women's organizations, motivated her to seek out the source of these conflicts by examining the history of women's movements in Canada. In 1982, she applied for a Canada Council grant for a women's history project she wished to undertake. The grant application was turned down. In 1985 she enrolled in a Master of Arts degree program in history at Simon Fraser University. After completing her MA, Wasserlein taught women's studies at Langara College in Vancouver, BC until 1997. She has also worked as a sessional instructor at SFU. As of 2002, she was employed as the executive producer of the Vancouver Folk Music Festival.</p>

<p>Gerry Scott received a Master's degree from SFU in 1991 for his thesis entitled Beyond Equality: British Columbia New Democrats and Native Peoples, 1961-1979. In the preface to his thesis, Scott writes, "My interest in the evolution of the political relationships between British Columbia New Democrats and the aboriginal peoples of the province was first aroused in 1974. At that time I was working as a researcher for the government caucus and I undertook preparation of background papers on aboriginal land claims for the consideration of caucus members. In the 1970s and 1980s I continued to be involved in many of the issues under examination in this thesis through my work as Executive Assistant to Skeena MP Jim Fulton and as Provincial Secretary of the NDP during the years of Bob Skelly's leadership."</p>

<p>Susan Walsh received a Master's degree from SFU in 1984 for her thesis entitled "Equality, Emancipation and a More Just World: Leading Women in the British Columbia Cooperative Commonwealth Federation." In the abstract to her thesis, Walsh writes, "In the wake of suffrage victories, many early twentieth century Canadian women worked hard to make that equality meaningful and to extend it to all areas of women's lives. For those who predicted great changes, however, too few took their hard-earned rights further than the polling station. Most expressed their concerns and goals within the more familiar world of women's organizations. Helena Gutteridge, Laura Jamieson, Dorothy Steeves and Grace MacInnis were among the notable exceptions. While maintaining important ties with women's groups, they sought and won public office, pioneering important paths for generations of Canadian women to follow. These political trail blazers stand out for another important reason. They chose to establish their careers and test their political rights in a socialist party -- the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation -- pledged to sexual emancipation and equal opportunities for women. They were, in short, dual rebels -- as feminists and socialists -- in a sex and class-ordered world."</p>

<p>Dallas Walker Smythe (1907-1992) was an economist and civil servant for the United States government, and a university professor in the field of communications in the United States and Canada.<lb/><lb/>He was born in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1907 and moved to California with his family in 1918. Smythe attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received an A.B. (Economics) in 1928 and a Ph.D. (Economics) in 1937. His career as an economist began in 1934, when, at the College of Agriculture at the University of California, Berkeley, he worked as an Extension Specialist in Agriculture preparing studies of economic outlooks for various California farm products.<lb/><lb/>He left Berkeley in 1937 for Washington, D.C. to become a civil servant with the federal government. He worked as an economist with the Central Statistical Board, specializing in the coordination and review of agricultural information from various government agencies. In 1938, he joined the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor as their senior economist. While at this Division, Smythe was responsible for preparing and presenting interpretive studies on the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act to a variety of industries, including textile mills, newspapers, railways, and lumber companies. Smythe left the Division in 1942 to become the principal economist, Division of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget. He left that position in 1943 to join the Federal Communications Commission. As their chief economist, Smythe testified at FCC hearings and produced a number of statistical studies and reports on subjects such as radio frequency allocation and the public responsibilities of broadcasters. Throughout his career as a civil servant, Smythe belonged to pacifist or left-wing organizations, which later led to accusations of subversive conduct and disloyalty to the American government.<lb/><lb/>Smythe left the civil service in 1948 to join the faculty of the newly-formed Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois. In addition to lecturing on general economics, he taught the first course in the United States on the political economy of communications. The primary focus of his research was television, including its content, effects on family life, and portrayal of reality. He also studied the mass media and its influence on public opinion. With the development of satellite communication, he studied the effects of this new technology on international communications.<lb/><lb/>Partly because of his pacifist political beliefs, Smythe left the United States in 1963 to become the first Chairman of the Social Sciences Division at the Regina Campus of the University of Saskatchewan. When he reached the mandatory retirement age in 1973, he left Regina to serve as visiting professor of communications at the University of California, San Diego. He joined the faculty of Simon Fraser University in 1974, serving as the first chairman of the Department of Communications Studies. While Smythe continued to write on mass media, regulating the radio spectrum, and communications theory, he also produced Dependency Road: Communications, Capitalism, Consciousness and Canada, his study of the domination of Canadian communications by American influences and its effects on consciousness.<lb/><lb/>Smythe became professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University in 1980. Following a brief period at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he returned to teach at SFU until 1986. He accepted short-term appointments at Ohio State University and the University of Hawaii before retiring in 1988. He was working on his autobiography and a book about the theory of communications when he died in 1992.<lb/><lb/>Smythe married twice and had five children. He and his first wife Beatrice had three children: Sandra (born 1937), Susan (born 1938), and Roger (born 1943). Smythe later married Jennie Newsome Pitts, and the couple had two children: Patrick (born 1954), and Carol (born 1961).</p>

<p>The Fraser Valley University Society was established on February 5, 1991. Founding members of the Society included members of several Canadian Federation of University Women's clubs, particularly Karen Yong and Sharon Shilliday of the Delta University Women's Club; members of the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board; as well as individuals and representatives of organizations from communities throughout the Fraser Valley. Many of these individuals had been involved in a predecessor group, the Fraser South University Society, which had been established by Yong and Shilliday in November 1990.<lb/><lb/>The Society's mandate was to "ensure the development of appropriate legislation creating a new university in the Fraser Valley." The main purposes of the Society were: to further the development of university education in the Fraser Valley by encouraging the Provincial Government to legislate the establishment of an independent, degree-granting institution; to foster public education initiatives promoting the social, economic and cultural value of a university; to actively pursue excellence in university education for all communities in the Fraser Valley; and to improve access to university education.<lb/><lb/>The Society was headed by an elected Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appointed the following officer positions: President, Vice-President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Committees, headed by a Chair, were created to carry out the objectives of the Society. The original five committees of the society were the Public Relations Committee, Community Relations Committee, Fundraising Committee, Membership Committee, and the Government Committee. The first President of the Society was Karen Yong. She was succeeded in 1993 by Robert (Bob) Lowe, who remained President until the Society's dissolution. At its height, membership in the Society was over 1,100 members.<lb/><lb/>The Society enlisted the assistance of local government and community organizations in its efforts. From its inception, the Society received financial and other support, including office space in Surrey, from the Fraser Valley Real Estate Board. Other funds were obtained through government grant applications, membership fees, donations, and fundraising events. The Society also concentrated on promotional and community relations activities. Members collected over 7,000 petition signatures, set up information kiosks in malls and at public events, made presentations to local groups, solicited media coverage of Society events and activities, and distributed promotional material. The Society created and collaborated on several reports concerning the need for post-secondary education in the Fraser Valley, and established relationships with members of local and provincial governments.<lb/><lb/>In 1994 the Society began to place increased pressure on the Provincial Government and, after many meetings and much correspondence, Premier Mike Harcourt announced in February 1995 his government's support for the creation of a Technical University in the Fraser Valley (the Technical University of British Columbia). In May 1995 Society Board member Sharon Shilliday was appointed to the Interim Planning Council for the University; the Council became part of the Technical University Society of British Columbia when it was registered on August 10, 1995.<lb/><lb/>As a result of the Government's commitment to the creation of a new university, the Society evolved into a public foundation responsible for raising funds for the Technical University of British Columbia and its students. The Society's constitution was amended in August 1996 to reflect this change in mandate. In February 1998, a unanimous decision was made to dissolve the Society and transfer its fundraising responsibilities, as well as accumulated funds, assets, and records to the Technical University of British Columbia. Fundraising responsibilities were assumed by the University's new Vice-President External Affairs and Research. At an extraordinary meeting of the Society on April 28, 1998, the Society was dissolved.</p>

<p>The TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence (TL-NCE) was established in 1995 when the federal government's Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) program awarded a grant to create a network of researchers from Canadian universities, focusing on the development and application of networked technologies in education and training. TeleLearning established a management office to administer its affairs, and on April 7 1997 the office incorporated under the Corporations Act as TeleLearning Network Inc. (TN Inc.), a not-for-profit corporation. Ostensibly two separate bodies, each with its own Board of Directors, in practice TL-NCE and TN Inc. were not distinct: Board members were identical for both and the same Board session dealt with the affairs of both. TL-NCE was the "research face" and TN Inc. the "legal-administrative face" of the same organization. TeleLearning's renewal application in 2001 for a second round of NCE funding was unsuccessful. The decision was made to close out the Network, and on September 30, 2002 the corporation was officially dissolved.<lb/><lb/>TeleLearning's mandate was to research, develop and demonstrate effective knowledge-building pedagogies, implemented through telelearning; to support the development of a knowledge economy and learning society in Canada; and to transfer the resulting knowledge into Canadian organizations, institutions of learning and Canadian companies for worldwide exploitation. Its main functions were to organize further research and distribute funding to individual projects through seven distinct research themes; publicize research results through publications, reports, and conferences; promote cooperation among private, public and university sectors; and encourage the development of commercial applications and technologies through the formation of spin-off companies.<lb/><lb/>TeleLearning was primarily funded by the federal government through the NCE programs of the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and Industry Canada. Additional funding was obtained through TeleLearning membership fees from participating public and private-sector organizations, including international affiliates. The chief officers of the Network were the Network Leader, Network Co-Leader, and the Executive Director. The Board of Directors was responsible for the overall management and direction of the Network, with certain powers delegated to an appointed Executive Committee. Other committees advised the Board, including the Program Committee and the Knowledge and Technology Transfer Committee. Relations between the Network and member organizations was regulated by the Network Internal Agreement.<lb/><lb/>TeleLearning's management office operated out of Simon Fraser University, which served as the Network's host institution. The main functions of the management office were disbursement of funds, NCE reporting, communications, member liaison, assistance with funding proposals, and conference organization. As host institution, SFU provided TeleLearning with office space, facilities, and some administrative services (e.g. payroll and finances).<lb/><lb/>The TeleLearning Network was originally built around four "beacon technologies": Collaboration Architecture and Design Resources for Telelearning (CadreTel), Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE), Teleform, and Virtual-University (Virtual-U). Over 240 public- and private-sector organizations participated in its projects, including over 130 faculty from 30 Canadian universities. The Network supported the growth of the online learning industry with the development of more than 45 software prototypes. Its spin-off companies included TELEStraining Inc., ClearMed Medical Knowledge Inc., Math Resources Inc., Nomino Inc., InVentures Incubator Inc., Cogigraph, the Portal for Online Objects in Learning (POOL), and TeleLearning Solutions Inc.</p>

<p>Mark L. Winston is a professor of Biological Sciences at Simon Fraser University, known for his research in apiculture - the management and study of honey bees - and his writing about science, nature, and environmental issues. He is also a professor and senior fellow with the Undergraduate Semester in Dialogue program at the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue at SFU Harbour Centre.<lb/><lb/>Born Mark Leslie Winston on April 7, 1950 in Brooklyn, New York to Ruth and Larry Winston, he grew up with one younger brother, Scott. They moved to South Euclid, Ohio in 1958, and Winston went to Charles F. Brush high school, one of the premier science-intensive public schools in the United States, where he earned awards for academic excellence and athletics (in track). As a young adult he was active in the Jewish Community Centre of Cleveland, serving as president of the Teen Age Board in 1967, and also became politically active in the anti-Vietnam war movement.<lb/><lb/>In 1968 Winston began undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, transferring to Boston University in 1970. He graduated with a B.Sc. in Biology in 1971, and moved to Woods Hole, Massachusetts to work in marine biology at the Oceanographic Institute and the Marine Biological Laboratory. He returned to the Boston University Marine Program and earned an M.A. in 1975, studying hermit crab behaviour. In 1978, he earned a Ph.D. in Entomology from the University of Kansas. The start of his career-defining path with bees began while working on his Ph.D. and studying Africanized Bees in French Guiana.<lb/><lb/>On June 1, 1980, Mark Winston married Susan Katz in Beverly Hills, California. They have one daughter, Devora Winston, who was born in 1984.<lb/><lb/>Prior to moving to Canada to work at Simon Fraser University, Winston worked at the University of Kansas from 1978 to 1979 as a post-doctoral fellow. He was then employed as a visiting assistant professor at Idaho State University from 1979 to 1980. In September 1980 he began teaching at SFU in the Biological Sciences Department as an assistant professor. In 1984 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1988 became a full professor. In 2002 Winston stepped back from teaching biology to focus on the Semester in Dialogue program and pursue his interests in science communication, dialogue, and facilitation, inspired in part by his study of bees and their interactions and collaborative nature. That year he founded and became the director of the Undergraduate Semester in Dialogue program, a position he held until 2014. From 2002, he was also a fellow with the Centre for Dialogue at SFU’s Vancouver campus and its academic director from 2006 through 2014. In 2006 he also taught in the inaugural Science Communication program at the Banff Centre in Alberta. Winston continues to be a professor and now senior fellow with the Undergraduate Semester in Dialogue. The program combines experiential and interdisciplinary learning, community engagement, collaboration, mentoring, leadership, and dialogue-based interactions among students and community leaders on a variety of themes and public issues.<lb/><lb/>Winston's research areas in the biological sciences include insect behavioral ecology, apiculture, and pollinator biodiversity. At SFU he has taught courses on insect biology, social insects, introduction to beekeeping, and entomology. From 1983 to 1993 Winston presented a 9-part television series titled "Apiculture: An Introduction to Bees &amp; Beekeeping" that was aired annually on the Knowledge Network. As an extension of this series, he developed the Bee Masters program, a week-long public beekeeping course at SFU offered bi-annually in collaboration with the BC Ministry of Agriculture. Winston's research has also led him to patent a pheromone composition that is used for managing honey bee colonies.<lb/><lb/>Mark Winston has been a prolific writer during his academic career. He has authored or co-authored over 150 scientific papers. In 1987 he published his first book, "The Biology of the Honey Bee" that was followed by a French version in 1993 and a Portuguese version in 2003. In 1992 "Killer Bees: The Africanized Honey Bee in the Americas" was published, followed by "Nature Wars: People vs. Pests" in 1997. In 2003 a Chinese version of Nature Wars was released. Winston's fourth book was published in 1998, titled "From Where I Sit: Essays on Bees, Beekeeping, and Science". In 1998 he also co-authored "Chemical Communication in Social Insects" with R.K. Vandermeer, M.D. Breed, and K. Espelie. In 2002, Winston published "Travels in the Genetically Modified Zone," which was followed by Australian, Southeast Asian and Japanese editions between 2003 and 2004. His most recent book, "Bee Time: Lessons from the Hive," was published by Harvard University Press in 2014. It won the 2014 Science in Society General Book Award from the Canadian Science Writers Association, and the prestigious 2015 Governor General's Literary Award for non-fiction .<lb/><lb/>Winston has written articles that have appeared in the Encyclopedia Britannica, The Sciences, Orion magazine, The Vancouver Sun (since 1999), The New York Times, and published a monthly column in Bee Culture Magazine (1994-2005). He has appeared in numerous radio and television programs including CBC's "Quirks &amp; Quarks", CBC "Newsworld", and on National Public Radio in the United States.<lb/><lb/>Winston has been an active participant in local, national and international apiculture-related and other organizations. From 1994 to 1998 he served as President of the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists; founding Director and Chair of the Canadian Bee Research Fund from 1997-2001; Program Chair for Apimondia '99, the 1999 meeting of the International Federation of Beekeepers Associations held in Vancouver; and Chair of the External Advisory Committee, NSERC Biocontrol Research Network from 2002-2006. More recently, he served as a member of the Vancouver Foundation Education Advisory Committee, and as a science and technology jury member for the Jack Webster Awards for Journalism.<lb/><lb/>As an outcome of his research, teaching, and extension activities with beekeepers and the public, Winston is regarded as the world's leading expert on bees and pollination. As such, he has served as a legal consultant for firms in BC, Ontario, and California; as a film and television consultant since 1984 for locally shot programs including the "Beachcombers", "X-files", and "Smallville", production companies such as First Wave Productions, Creative Animal Talent, Great Northern Productions, television movies, and documentaries; as a business consultant; as a publishing consultant for book proposals, and a manuscript reviewer for Harvard University Press. He has also done consulting work for the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee, as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Enforcement &amp; Investigations. In 2006 the CBC television program "The Nature of Things" broadcast "Beetalker," an hour-long exploration of Winston's career and interactions with students, beekeepers, artists, and the public. With his additional interest in science communication and outgrowth into dialogue, facilitation, and leadership resulting from his work with the Semester in Dialogue, Winston has also consulted for various businesses, governments, and NGOs. Of particular note is his extensive work with Action Canada from 2003 through 2008.<lb/><lb/>Winston's research has been recognized by a number of awards. A sample of these include the C.G. Hewitt Award from the Entomological Society of Canada (1985); Fulbright Award from the Council of International Exchange of Scholars (1986-1987); a Gold Medal in the Natural Sciences from the Science Research Council of BC (1992); NSERC Senior Industrial Fellow (1995); Manning Award for Innovation (1997); the Sterling Prize in Controversy (1998); a Killam Research Fellowship (2000-2002); Academic of the Year from the Confederation of University Faculty Associations (2001); an Environmental Award for Communication from the City of Burnaby (2001); the Eve Savory Award for Science Communication from the Science Council of BC (2001); election to the Royal Society of Canada as a Fellow, (2003); the Fred Rathje Memorial Award from the Canadian Honey Council (2004); the NSERC Michael Smith Award (2004) for outstanding promotion of science in Canada; the Outstanding Service Award from the Canadian Association of Professional Apiculturists (2006); the President's 40th Anniversary Award from Simon Fraser University (2006); and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for excellence in higher education (2012).</p>

<p>The University Archives acquires, preserves and makes available three categories of materials: (1) the official records of the University, including those created by the Board of Governors, Senate, University committees, faculties, departments and administrative offices; (2) materials documenting the wider University community; and (3) historical research collections that promote the teaching and research activities of the University.<lb/><lb/>The Archives was established within the University Library in 1968 when librarian Liisa Fagerlund was appointed University Archivist on a half-time basis. She continued in this post until 1975 when she left the University. From 1975 to 1978, the Archives functioned within the Special Collections division of the Library. Archival duties were carried out by various library staff members. In 1978, the University Archives was established as a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. Donald Baird, recently retired as University Librarian, became University Archivist and held this position until his retirement in 1990. Jim Ross served as University Archivist from 1991 to 1993, and was succeeded by Ian Forsyth in 1994.<lb/><lb/>When the Archives was a function of the University Library, the University Archivist reported to the University Librarian. When the Archives was established as a separate administrative unit, the University Archivist reported directly to the University President. The reporting structure changed in 1986 when the University Archivist reported to the Vice-President, Research/Information Systems; in 1990, when the University Archivist reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic; and in 1996, when the University Archivist reported to the Registrar/Dean of Students.</p>

<p>Ann Carey Messenger was a Professor in the Department of English at Simon Fraser University. She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on May 31, 1933 to Raymond and Lillian Parshall. Between 1951 and 1955, Messenger attended Oberlin College in Ohio. Awarded a Snell Scholarship for 1952 to 1955, she completed a B.A. in English Literature in 1955. In September of 1955, Messenger began studies at Oxford University in England; she attended Oxford under a Fulbright Scholarship in 1955/56 and a Snell Scholarship in 1956/57. After completing a second B.A. at Oxford, Messenger returned to the United States in 1957, where she procured a job as a secretary at the Princeton University Library Rare Books Department. The following year, in 1958, she began studies at Cornell University. She remained at Cornell for two years, teaching freshman composition and earning credits for an Hon. M.A. at Oxford, which she completed in 1961. <lb/><lb/>During her first year at Cornell she met William (Bill) Messenger, a fellow graduate English student, and the two were married in Pittsburgh in 1960. After their marriage, they stayed in Pennsylvania, teaching at Bucknell University in Lewisburg for a year, before moving to California. In California, Ann taught, and Bill took post-graduate courses and taught, at the University of California, Berkeley. In September 1963, she began teaching at San Francisco State College. While teaching, she continued working towards her Ph.D., which she was awarded through Cornell University in 1964; Bill completed his PhD. from Berkeley in 1968. <lb/><lb/>In August 1966 the Messengers moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to teach at the University of British Columbia (UBC). They immediately fell in love with the city and purchased a home in Point Grey. In September 1968, Messenger secured a job as an Assistant Professor in the English Department at the recently established Simon Fraser University, attaining the rank of Professor in 1973. Her area of expertise as a professor was Restoration and 18th Century literature. In the early 1970s she began to cultivate an interest in the forgotten female writers of the period, and her research developed in this direction. Bill became an Assistant Professor at UBC in 1969, and an Associate Professor in 1982. <lb/><lb/>In 1988, Messenger was diagnosed with the first of multiple cancers. As a result of her illness, she was unable to teach, and in 1990 she went on long-term disability. <lb/><lb/>In spite of her illness, her passion for bringing to light female writers of the Restoration and 18th Century encouraged Messenger to continue to write and edit books, papers, and journal articles on the subject, often hiring people to do some of the research that she was unable to carry out herself. These works included the books "His and Hers: Essays in Restoration and Eighteenth Century Literature" (author, published 1986); "Gender at Work: Four Women Writers of the Eighteenth Century" (contributor and editor, published 1990); a new edition of Ellis Cornelia Knight's "Dinarbas"(editor, published 1993); "Woman and Poet in the Eighteenth Century: The Life of Mary Whateley Darwall (1738-1825)" (author, published 1999); "Pastoral Tradition and the Female Talent: Studies in Augustan Poetry" (author, published 1999); and "The Works of Mary Leapor" (co-editor, published 2004). <lb/><lb/>In 1993, Messenger set up the Aphra Behn Endowment Fund, named after the female poet. This fund was renamed the Ann Messenger Graduate Endowment Fund in 1996. <lb/><lb/>Despite Messenger's determination to fight her illness, the cancer continued to reoccur, and she passed away on February 1, 1996. Bill Messenger, who had taken early retirement in 1988 to care for Ann, passed away on June 15, 2003 due to complications from pneumonia and Alzheimer's Disease. </p>

<p>The Technical University of British Columbia had its roots in the Fraser Valley University Society, a group of concerned citizens founded in February 1991 to lobby government for the creation of a university in the Fraser Valley. On February 2, 1995, the Society's efforts were rewarded when Premier Mike Harcourt announced that $100 million would be provided for the establishment of a technical university in Cloverdale. According to the "Statement of Government Purpose" that was issued for the university, there was to be an emphasis on access, applied research, innovative programs, and the use of new learning technologies. Partnerships were to be developed with private industry to decrease operating costs, and there would be a unique governance structure. <lb/><lb/>On May 1st 1995, thirteen people were appointed by the Minister of Skills, Training and Labour to an Interim Planning Council (IPC), which was to provide advice to the government regarding the mandate and characteristics of the "Technical University of British Columbia" (TechBC); the first meeting of the IPC took place on June 10th. The original terms of reference for the University were delivered by the Ministry on May 8th, and on August 10th the original constitution and bylaws were registered, under the name "Technical University Society of British Columbia." The first President of TechBC, Dr. Bernard Sheehan, an original IPC member, was appointed on January 1, 1996. On September 27, 1996 the IPC presented its final report to the Provincial Government, and on October 19th the twenty member Council was replaced by a five member Interim Governing Board. <lb/><lb/>The establishing legislation for the Technical University of British Columbia, Bill 30, was introduced on June 9, 1997, and the Government announced a $2.8 million operating grant for the University. On July 28th, Bill 30 received its third reading; however, the lack of a union, tenure, and a senate in the proposed governance structure prompted the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) to protest the bill. When the "Technical University of British Columbia Act" was eventually proclaimed on December 5, 1997, CAUT boycotted the new University. The first meeting of the Board of Governors was one week later, on December 12th. An Academic Planning Board was created in place of a senate and on May 8, 1998, the CAUT boycott was lifted. <lb/><lb/>During this entire period, the University's location was a source of controversy and dispute. The Cloverdale site was deemed unsuitable and, eventually, on July 20, 1998 it was announced that the University campus would be constructed at Surrey City Centre. On October 14th, TechBC's Education and Information Centre at Surrey Place Mall was officially opened, although some students had been attending classes offered through other universities at that location since September 10th. The first ninety students for TechOne, the required first year program for TechBC students, did not begin classes until the following September, and the official opening ceremony for the University was held at Surrey Place Mall on October 14, 1999. A few weeks earlier, on September 23rd, a second announcement had been made confirming plans to construct a 450,000 square foot campus at Surrey City Centre; the development project, scheduled for completion in 2003, would be a joint venture with ICBC, the City of Surrey, and the Provincial Government. In July 2000, the amount of space allocated to TechBC at Surrey Place Mall was increased to 110,000 square feet. <lb/><lb/>When it opened, TechBC offered Bachelor of Science and Master of Applied Science degrees in three program areas: Information Technology, Interactive Arts, and Management and Technology. In May 2000 the University received government approval for a PhD. program in Applied Science to begin in February 2001.<lb/><lb/>TechBC Corporation, a wholly-owned, for revenue subsidiary of TechBC, was created in October 1999 in order to establish partnerships with private industry, conduct applied research, and develop and support new businesses. <lb/><lb/>In September 2000 Sheehan resigned, and the search for a new President began; Dr. Jean Watters was selected, and he began his term in August 2001. His term, however, would be a short one. In May 2001 a Liberal government had been elected in British Columbia. After months of investigation into the TechBC situation, the Government withdrew its support of the University. On February 7, 2002 it was announced that TechBC would be closed at the end of the academic year, and its students and modified programs transferred to Simon Fraser University, although the Surrey campus would remain in use. Watters' last day as President was March 20, 2002. </p>

<p>Established by the "Technical University of British Columbia Act" on December 5, 1997, the Board of Governors was the principal decison-making body at the University. It was composed of the Chancellor, the President, two teaching staff members, eight people appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, two students, and one university employee who was not a teaching staff member. According to the Act, the Board was mandated to "approve strategic program and research directions and policies"; make decisions concerning TechBC programs and program areas; and provide reports to the appropriate Ministry as necessary. The Board was also responsible for appointing a President for the University. Its first meeting was on December 12, 1997. The Board had a number of standing committees; these were the Academic Planning Board, Audit Committtee, Business and Finance Committee, Executive Committee, Human Resources Committee, and Senior Compensation Committee. Other committees established by the Board were the University Review Committee and the Presidential Search Committee. In light of the Provincial Government's February 2002 decision to close TechBC, the Board began the process of dissolving its committees at its March 11, 2002 meeting. The final meeting of the Board took place on July 31, 2002.</p>

<p>Press Gang Publishers was a feminist printing press publishing quality trade paperback books—fiction, non-fiction, poetry and art—primarily by Canadian women authors and artists. Their non-fiction books addressed such social issues as the treatment of women by the mental health system, recovery from childhood sexual abuse, lesbian identity, homophobia and censorship, and women in conflict with the criminal justice system. Press Gang authors won numerous awards for their work.<lb/><lb/>Press Gang Publishers evolved from a feminist printing and publishing collective of the same name. The original Press Gang was a small collective of men and women who incorporated under British Columbia's Companies Act as Press Gang Publishers Ltd. in April 1970. By 1974, the collective had become a women-only, feminist and anti-capitalist printshop, with paid and volunteer workers.<lb/><lb/>Press Gang published its first book under its own imprint in 1976, a collection of essays entitled "Women Look at Psychiatry." Over the years, printing and publishing activities increasingly diverged, and in 1982 Press Gang established a separate collective to manage the publishing operations. In 1989 the separation was completed when the two collectives formally became distinct legal and corporate entities, Press Gang Printers Ltd. and Press Gang Publishers Feminist Cooperative. The two organizations, however, remained closely associated. In 1993 Press Gang Printers ceased to exist due to economic pressues in the printing trade and on their clientele (grassroots, community organizations).<lb/><lb/>Full-time staff members of Press Gang Publishers included managing editor Barbara Kuhne; financial manager Della McCreary; and art director/production manager Val Speidel. Paula Clancy and Nancy Pollak also served on the Press Gang Board.<lb/><lb/>Because of changes in the book publishing industry and the book selling marketplace, smaller publishers such as Press Gang faced difficult times. In 2000, Press Gang formed an alliance with Polestar Publishers of Victoria and issued a joint catalogue. Shortly thereafter, Polestar was purchased by Raincoast Books. In 2002, Press Gang Publishers declared bankruptcy after thirty years as a major independent feminist publisher. Some of their titles are still distributed by Raincoast Books and by Lazara Press.</p>

<p>Organized in Toronto on June 27, 1876, the Sons of Scotland Benevolent Association is a fraternal association of Scottish people, their spouses, and their descendants in Canada. Its functions are to "preserve and promote Scottish heritage and culture in Canada" by maintaining Scottish historical, literary, and musical traditions, and to promote among its members a feeling of community and comradery. Additionally, the Sons of Scotland is a fraternal benefit association; membership dues entitle members to a certain amount of insurance coverage, which can be increased according to their needs. <lb/><lb/>The Sons of Scotland was incorporated by the Province of Ontario in 1880, and by the Dominion of Canada in 1937. It is governed by a central Executive Board in Toronto called the Grand Camp, which was established in 1878 and is headed by a Grand Chief and a Grand Chieftain. Grand Camp Executive officers are elected for three year terms. The Association is then divided into districts. There are currently four districts: Toronto District No. 7, Montreal District No. 14, Winnipeg District No. 15, and British Columbia District No. 16. The districts, in turn, consist of several camps, called subordinate camps. Each district and camp is governed by an Executive Board, which is headed by a chief and a chieftain. Executive officers of district and subordinate camps are elected on an annual basis.<lb/><lb/>In addition to regular meetings, the Association organizes and hosts social events, such as dances, dinners, picnics, and games.</p>

<p>The Glamis Camp was established in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver on June 2, 1937. Thirty-seven members were initiated into the Camp at this first meeting. John Brown was chosen as Worthy Chief, and William Fraser as Chieftain. Annual dues for honorary members were three dollars; annual dues for active members were dependent upon the type of insurance they had. The Camp first met at Killarney Hall, at 2nd Avenue and Bayswater Street, but due to increased membership, began meeting in the larger Elks Hall at 901 Dunsmuir Street in April 1938. After January 1943, the Camp met in various downtown and Kitsilano locations. The Camp is still active, meeting monthly at the Scottish Cultural Centre at 8886 Hudson Street in South Vancouver.</p>

The camp was named the Murray Camp, in honor of Camp Organizer Alex Murray, who had been an active member of the Sons of Scotland for thirty-two years. There were eighty-seven members accepted into the Camp at the meeting. The first Chief was Alex McKelvie, and the first Chieftain was W. Kane. The camp later met at the South Arm Community Center (March 1969 to February 1975), and then the Richmond United Church hall on Cambie Road.

<p>On August 19, 1895, members of the St. Andrews and Caledonian Society met in the Society's rooms on the Dunn Miller Block in Vancouver. Their guest for the evening was Captain D.M. Robertson, the Grand Secretary of the Sons of Scotland Benevolent Association. Robertson had come from Toronto with the intention of establishing a camp in Vancouver. By the end of the evening, thirty men had signed a petition to the Grand Chief, officers, and members of the Grand Camp for the creation of a subordinate camp in Vancouver. Robert Clark was elected as the first Chief, and John Johnstone as the first Chieftain. Five dollars was agreed upon as the initiation fee for members. At the next meeting, on August 29, the name Royal Scot was selected, and the name was formally adopted at the September 16 meeting. By December 21, 1899, the Camp had sixty-two members. Among the occupations listed for members between 1895 and 1899 were merchant, contractor, lumberman, physician, sailor, engineer, and policeman. The Camp is no longer active, but was in existence until 1969, at least.</p>

<p>The Department of Physics at S.F.U. was founded in 1964 as a charter department in the Faculty of Science. The Department was responsible, through its Chair, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the field of Physics. From the outset, the Department has offered programs leading to B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees. In keeping with the interdisciplinary nature of studies at S.F.U., the Department was involved in co-operative programs within the Faculty of Science, including joint degree programs with Mathematics and Statistics and Chemistry. Since the early 1970s, the Department has been involved in the TRIUMF (Tri-University Meson Facility) project at U.B.C, and it has also been involved in two faculty research bodies: the Theoretical Science Institute and the Energy Research Institute.<lb/><lb/>The Department was organized administratively into a Chair, Departmental Assistant, Lab Co-ordinator, and a number of standing committees. The Chair was the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities included the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments; and representation of the Department to external bodies, including the Faculty, Senate and Board of Governors. The Chair reported directly to the Dean of Science. The Departmental Assistant was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration and the management of the departmental budget, the scheduling of courses, the provision of liaison with administrative offices, and advising students. The Lab Co-ordinator acted as liaison between faculty and graduate students and departmental technicians.<lb/><lb/>The number and composition of departmental committees varied greatly over time. Long-standing committees included Departmental Tenure, Graduate Admissions, Graduate Studies, High School Liaison, Student Qualifying, and Undergraduate Curriculum. There was also departmental representation on faculty and university committees, including the faculty curriculum committees and the University Radiological Safety and University Review committees. The Department also struck ad hoc committees when required.</p>

<p>The John Howard Society of the Lower Mainland of British Columbia (JHSLM) takes its name and its spirit from the 18th century English prison reformer who observed unjust social conditions in prisons, both as a prisoner of war during the Seven Years War, and as High Sheriff of Bedfordshire, a post which included the task of inspecting local prisons. The suffering that John Howard endured and witnessed led him to become a lifelong advocate for criminal and social justice reform. Throughout his life he demonstrated a firm belief that every citizen must ultimately accept his or her individual responsibility for the criminal justice system.<lb/><lb/>The society began as the John Howard Society of British Columbia, established in Vancouver in 1931. It was the first John Howard Society in Canada. The objects of the Society as outlined in its Constitution (1932) were to seek to remove conditions which lead persons into crime; to befriend the first offender; to work for the wise and just treatment of those confirmed to penal institutions; to guide and help the mothers, wives and children of men in prison; to help discharged and paroled men and women to re-establish themselves; and to work for wise and just legislation with reference to court procedures and penal administration.<lb/><lb/>The Society has grown so that in 2020 there are over 60 John Howard Societies across Canada with a national office in Ottawa.<lb/><lb/>Throughout its history, the professional staff of the Society have been responsible for visiting regularly or being on-call to various correctional facilities throughout British Columbia. These include prisons, forest camps, community correctional centres and half-way houses. Staff offer counseling, advocacy, pre-release planning, educational guidance and develop self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and the Seventh Step Society. Staff also assist clients in the courts offering pre-sentence intervention, alternatives to incarceration, and counseling. In addition, family members are supported by the Society in acquiring life skills and attending community development programs.<lb/><lb/>Today, the JHSLM has expanded its services to assist people with complex needs achieve greater independence and value their positive contributions to society. While the JHSLM continues to advocate for and support people impacted by the criminal justice system, the organization has developed an expertise in assisting people facing multiple barriers, including those who may be experiencing homelessness, unemployment, problematic substance abuse, mental health challenges, developmental disabilities, or spectrum disorders. This is done through a range of programs that provide assistance with housing, life-skills, education, employment, and community-based services, with the goal of creating a safe, healthy and inclusive community for all.<lb/><lb/>The Society is also involved in parole, probation, bail supervision and community assessments, lessening the demands on existing facilities. In the area of education, the Society provides speakers for service clubs, churches and community groups desiring information about the criminal justice system and for furthering the cause of penal reform. In the area of advocacy, the Society's staff has been involved in preparing briefs and papers and corresponding with Government officials and others in an attempt to monitor the criminal justice system and encourage alternatives.<lb/><lb/>Organizationally, the John Howard Society of BC and the Vancouver Office of the JHS operated under the same roof and had the same executive director until 1983 when the provincial office was removed to Victoria, physically separated from any local branch office. At that time the JHS of BC and the JHS of Vancouver Island were amalgamated. The Vancouver office became the John Howard Society of the Lower Mainland of BC. There are currently seven regional John Howard Society’s in BC, and one provincial organization which now operates in the same office as the JHSLM.</p>

<p>The Office of the Associate Vice-President, Academic (AVPA) has its origins in the appointment of Ian Mugridge as Assistant Vice-President, Academic in 1972. At that time, the Office of the Vice-President, Academic (VPA) was itself a relatively new unit, having been established only two years before in 1970 (see fonds F-200 for the administrative history of the VPA's Office). The appointment of an Assistant enabled the VPA to delegate a number of responsibilities to the new position: administrative supervision of certain academic support departments (Library, Registrar, Academic Advice Centre), space allocation planning, and some involvement in academic planning. Mugridge left the university in 1975; his successors took the title of Associate Vice-President, Academic. By 1986 the AVPA's Office had established its own record-keeping system and maintained its own files separate from those of the VPA.<lb/><lb/>Over the years, the division of responsibilities between the VPA and the AVPA has evolved considerably. Academic planning and budget planning generally remained with the VPA until 2001, when a reorganization of the portfolio delegated the primary responsibility for these activities to the AVPA. Space planning and allocation were early delegated to the AVPA in 1972 and have remained with this position since that time<lb/><lb/>From 1975 to 2001, the primary focus of the AVPA's mandate was the management of employment relations with the university's academic staff. This began with the appointment of Dan Birch as AVPA in 1975. The AVPA took the lead role in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU) in 1979; throughout the 1980s and 1990s the AVPA was the university's chief negotiator with the SFU Faculty Association (SFUFA); and in 1996 the AVPA assumed direct responsibility for the Academic Relations Office (for a history of this office, see fonds F-203). The focus on academic employment relations continued until 2001, when the incumbent AVPA (Judith Osborne) became Associate Vice-President, Policy, Equity and Legal. This new position moved out of the VPA's portfolio, reported directly to the President, and took with it most policy-related and negotiating responsibilities. With this reorganization, the focus of the AVPA's mandate shifted to academic planning and budgeting processes, institutional analysis, space allocation, and coordination of major and minor capital projects and IT projects.<lb/><lb/>The AVPA's involvement in university IT systems planning has varied over the years. Support for academic and research computing requirements was originally a function of the VPA's Office, but was transferred to the newly established Vice-President, Research / Information Systems in 1985. It returned to the VPA's portfolio in 1990, with the AVPA (Ross Saunders) having lead responsibility, though this shifted back to the VPA in 1994; in 2001 all IT responsibilities were consolidated under the Chief Information Officer (CIO), reporting directly to the VPA.<lb/><lb/>Since its establishment in 1972, the position of AVP Academic has always reported directly to the VPA. The AVPA has had administrative responsibility for a number of different reporting units within the university at various times, include the Academic Advice Centre, the Audio Visual Centre and its successors (Instructional Media Centre, Learning and Instructional Development Centre), the Registrar's Office, the University Library, and the University Archives. See the table attached to this fonds description for a complete list of the units that have belonged to the VPA's portfolio, their distribution between the VPA and the AVPA, and the years of the reporting relationship.</p>

<p>The Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies (SCUS) is a standing committee of Senate. It was established by Senate in 1971 and has been reorganized on several occasions. Through tne 1970s, Senate delegated to SCUS certain responsibilities and authority for approving curriculum and academic program revisions. In 1987, these responsibilities were in turn delegated to the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP), of which SCUS became a sub-committee. In 2001 Senate restructured its committees, with SCAP becoming the Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP) and SCUS restored to a full standing committee reporting directly to Senate. Its main function are to review, make recommendations, and approve academic program and curriculum changes; and recommend to Senate policies relating to grading, examination, standing and continuance, undergraduate admissions, readmissions, and credit transfer, undergraduate course registration and course withdrawal procedures, and the administration of undergraduate student records.</p>

<p>The Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP) was originally instituted in 1971 as the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP). It replaced the Academic Planning Committee (ACP) previously established under the President's Office and was responsible for coordinating and implementing a system of academic planning at the university. Its functions included identifying priorities in the development of new and emerging programs; coordinating academic planning with allocation of resources; operating the system of external reviews; and reviewing and making recommendations for the establishment and disestablishment of academic departments and research units, centres and institutes. In 2001 Senate restructured its committee organization, and SCAP was renamed the Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP). It retained its academic planning functions, but took on additional responsibilities for advising the President on university budget matters.</p>

<p>Academic Planning Services was established in September 1990 with the appointment of Alison Watt as the unit's first Director, reporting to the Vice-President, Academic (VPA). Academic Planning Services' main functions were to coordinate academic planning at the senior staff level, provide secretariat services to the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP), coordinate the process for external reviews of academic departments, oversee use of endowment funds to support academic programs, and maintain the university's policies and procedures manual.<lb/><lb/>In March 1996, Watt became Director, Secretariat Services, moving from the VPA's to the Registrar's portfolio and transferring a number of responsibilities with her. In subsequent years, academic planning support services have been variously organized through the VPA's Office. Kathy Heinrich was appointed Special Assistant to the VPA, Academic Planning in 1996 to assist academic restructuring processes; Heinrich left the university in the summer of 1999. A directorship for Academic Planning Services was re-established from 2000 to 2004 with the appointment of Sue Roppel (2000-2001), then Laurie Summers (2002-2004). In 2004, academic planning was reorganized with the creation of the Academic Planning and Budgeting Office, headed by Glynn Nichols as Director. This unit has a dual reporting relationship to both the VP Academic and the VP Finance and Administration through their respective Associate VPs.</p>

<p>TRIUMF is Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics, operated as a joint venture by a consortium of universities. Its facilities support both pure and applied research and include the particle accelerator (cyclotron) and the Isotope Separation and ACceleration (ISAC) facility.<lb/><lb/>The idea of building a cyclotron in western Canada was first conceived by Dr. J.R. Richardson on Galiano Island in 1962. Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria collaborated on a proposal in 1966 for the Tri-University Meson Facility (TRIUMF). The University of Alberta joined the group and TRIUMF was formally established by the four universities in 1968 with funding from the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB).<lb/><lb/>The early years of TRIUMF were primarily concerned with the planning, design and construction of the facility on the campus of UBC, and on February 9, 1976 it was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Canda, Pierre Trudeau. In the same year the four founding universities signed a Letter of Agreement with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), to provide on-going core operational funding. The organization was formally constituted as a Joint Venture between the four universities in November 1981. A number of other Canadian universities are affiliated with TRIUMF as Associate Members, while Carleton University and the University of Toronto became Joint Venture members around 2003-2004. Although owned by the consortium, TRIUMF has always made its facilities available to other Canadian and foreign researchers.<lb/><lb/>TRIUMF is governed by a Board of Management which comprises individuals drawn from its Joint Venture and Associate Member universities and which is responsible for policy, budget, and fund-raising. TRIUMF is administered by a Director, assisted by a number of Advisory Committees, whose number and composition has varied over the years. The organization is internally structured into a number of divisions which have also changed over time through periodic reorganizations.</p>

<p>The Academic Relations Office is the planning, policy advising and administration office for faculty, professional librarians and archivists, and academic administrators at SFU. The Office was established in 1988 with the appointment of Sharon Cochran as Director. Its main functions are to coordinate human-resources services for faculty personnel; advise faculty and provide administrative support to the appointment, renewal, tenure, promotion, and salary review processes; and liaise with the SFU Faculty Association. Prior to 1988, a number of these responsibilities had been carried out within the Office of the Vice-President, Academic (VPA) by Alison Watt in her position as the Assistant to the Vice-President (1978-1990).<lb/><lb/>Throughout its history, Academic Relations has always belonged the VPA's reporting portfolio. From its establishment in 1988 until the departure of its first Director in 1996, Academic Relations reported directly to the VPA. Subsequently, the Associate VPA, Judith Osborne, assumed direct responsibility for the unit from 1996 to 2001. A new Director, Sue Roppel, was appointed in 2001 following a reorganization of senior administrative portfolios at the university. This saw the incumbent Associate VPA (Osborne) move to the new post of Associate Vice-President, Policy, Equity and Legal, and the mandate of the Associate VPA redefined, shifting from academic employment relations to academic planning and budgeting.</p>

<p>The Salary Equity Study Committee was established by the Vice-President, Academic in 1988 in response to concern on the part of Academic Women, the SFU Faculty Association, and the university administration about the the possible existence of gender-based salary differentials at SFU. The Committee's mandate was to determine whether gender-associated salary differentials exist among SFU's tenured and tenure-track faculty members, and if differentials exist, to recommend to the Vice-President, Academic a remedy based on the study findings. The Committee reported to the VP Academic in February 1991 with recommendations relating to methodology to determine the appropriate salary of each SFU tenure-track female faculty member relative to her peers, given academic performance; and measures to prevent future salary inequities.</p>

<p>The SFU Childcare Society presently operates eleven programs that are collectively known as the Children's Centre. The Children's Centre is an independent, legally incorporated non-profit society with registered charitable organization status. The Children's Centre provides full and part time care to approximately 240 children, ranging in age from 3 months to 12 years. Each program has its own physical space and is often referred to as a centre. A Board of Directors is composed of parent representatives, university representatives, childcare staff representatives and community representatives. The Executive Director is an ex-officio, non-voting member of the Board, hired through the University (with direction from the Society Board) to be the Coordinator for the Society and to act as a liaison between the Society and the University.<lb/><lb/>Daycare began at SFU in 1968 when a group of parents established the Simon Fraser Co-operative Family in a student lounge. By 1973, the Family Co-op had grown into the SFU Day Care Society with three units in different locations. By 1976, there were five licensed daycare centres all incorporated under the Burnaby Mountain Day Care Society.<lb/><lb/>In 1976 the University provided 1.2 million dollars to fund construction of a childcare complex, the first of its kind in Canada. The University also supported the appointment of a full-time director, Emily Campbell. For funding purposes, the Burnaby Mountain Day Care Society separated into five non-profit societies, which could each apply for grants. The five societies and their nine centres formed a loose federation, The Burnaby Association of University Child Care Societies, to set overall policy, coordinate activities, and exchange information. Centres remained autonomous in financing, staffing, and style of care.<lb/><lb/>In 1981 it became evident that current levels of University funding were in jeopardy. A Task Force was struck by the University to investigate the current organization of childcare on campus. Following recommendations of that Task Force, the five individual daycare societies were reorganized in 1982 into a single non-profit society, The SFU Childcare Society, which continues today.<lb/><lb/>The SFU Childcare Society is funded primarily through parent user fees and Board fund raising efforts. These monies are used for staff salaries and benefits, program related expenses, equipment purchase and upkeep, playgrounds, administrative costs and utilities.<lb/><lb/>A Licensing Agreement with the University provides for repairs and maintenance service for all the major building structures, comprehensive insurance, and the salary and benefits for the Executive Director and secretarial positions.</p>

<p>The Institute of Public Policy Analysis (IPPA) was a proposed institute that Simon Fraser University intended to establish as a forum bringing together individuals from the university, community and government sectors for the examination of Canadian public policy at both federal and provincial levels. The project was never realized.<lb/><lb/>Planning began in 1972 with the goal of commencing operations in September 1974. By early 1973 both Senate and the Board of Governors had approved the establishment of the Institute, and around March of that year the university appointed John Hogarth from the Faculty of Law at York University as the first Director. The Institute was to house both continuing staff funded by SFU as well as visiting fellows and researchers funded by external grants. Each academic year the Institute would focus on a specific problem or theme in public policy, offering symposia, research workshops, seminars and public lectures.<lb/><lb/>By early 1974 it had become apparent that the Institute would be unable to obtain sufficient external funding to begin its operations in the fall. Director Hogarth resigned effective March 31, 1974 and the university dissolved the Institute shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The Kelowna School of Resource Management (KSRM) was a proposed school that Simon Fraser University intended to establish in British Columbia's Interior, offering an undergraduate degree program based on core courses in natural and social sciences and in techniques of resource management and planning. The project was never realized.<lb/><lb/>Planning began in 1977 as part of SFU's response to the provincial government's Commission on University Programs in Non-Metropolitan Areas (Winegard Commission). The province's degree-program approval authority at that time – the Universities Council of British Columbia (UCBC) – gave approval in principle to SFU's proposal in early 1978. By August the university had appointed John M. Munro (then SFU's Dean of Arts) as the School's first Director, and KSRM began recruiting faculty. The curriculum was designed to provide undergraduate instruction for third- and fourth-year students who had already completed their first two years at community colleges in the province or at other universities. KSRM was to begin operations in September 1979, using facilities on the campus of Okanagan College.<lb/><lb/>In February 1979 UCBC reversed its earlier decision and rejected the proposal, citing several factors: lack of professional infrastructure at SFU; the employability of graduates; the professional qualifications of graduates; the need for a permanent building; and the financial requirement of $1 million annually. SFU contested each point of the rationale but was unable to overturn the decision. All planning activities were discontinued and the School dissolved. Its Director, Professor Munro, returned to SFU's Department of Economics and Commerce; in June 1979 he became SFU's Vice-President, Academic.</p>

<p>In January 1970 the Board of Governors created SFU's third Vice-President position: Vice-President, University and Community Services. By the time Stanley Roberts started in 1971, the position had been renamed Vice-President, Development. Shortly after, the name was changed again to Vice-President, University Services. <lb/><lb/>In 1971 the Vice-President had five primary responsibilities that included improving public relations through community services; improving internal non-academic activities (university student services); increasing student enrollment; ensuring adequate funding of university functions; and maximizing personnel and budget efficiency. <lb/><lb/>In 1972 S.T. (Stephen) Stratton resigned as the Director of the Division of University Services. The position of Director was discontinued and Roberts, as Vice-President, assumed full administrative responsibility for University Services. From 1971 to 1977 he reported directly to the university President. By 1972 University Services had expanded to include Alumni Affairs, the Campus Information Centre, the Centre for Communication and the Arts, Chaplain's Service, Counselling Services, Health Services, Residence and Housing, the International Office, the Reading and Study Centre, the Resources Office, School Liaison, the Student Placement Office, University News Service, and the University Theatre. In 1973 Financial Aid and the Daycare Centre were added to his sphere of responsibility, followed by Athletics and Recreation Services in 1974. <lb/><lb/>From 1972 to 1973 Ian B. Kelsey served as Assistant to the Vice-President, University Services and was followed by William (Bill) Stewart from 1974 to 1977. When Roberts resigned in 1977, the position of Vice-President, University Services was discontinued. Bill Stewart, his former assistant, became the new Director of Student Services (a position Stewart would hold until 1996). In 1981 the title Vice-President, University Development and Extension was resurrected with the appointment of Jack Blaney, but the focus was on expansion of the university, not provision of student services.</p>

<p>The Department of Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology (P.S.A.) was established by the Board of Governors in 1965 as one of the original Departments in the Faculty of Arts. It was dissolved on 19 February 1974. The Department was originally conceived as an experiment in interdisciplinary, and it was responsible, through its Chair, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs which combined the fields of Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology. In 1965, P.S.A. consisted of seven faculty members and offered courses leading to a B.A. degree. In 1966, the number of courses and programs greatly expanded, to include both M.A. and Ph.D. programs. In 1969, the Archaeology program was removed and placed as a distinct unit under the administration of the Faculty of Arts. It later became a full department. The history of P.S.A. was marked by a prolonged period of dissension between faculty members, the Department, and the University which included a period of trusteeship and a strike by students and faculty in 1969, the suspension of faculty, and the subsequent censure of the University by the Canadian Association of University Teachers in May 1971. In 1974, P.S.A. was split into two successor departments: Political Science, and Sociology and Anthropology.<lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by a Chair and a number of standing committees. The Chair was the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities included the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments; and representation of the Department to external bodies. The Departmental Assistant was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration and the management of the departmental budget, the scheduling of courses, the provision of liaison with administrative offices, and advising students.<lb/><lb/>The number and composition of departmental committees varied greatly over time. In 1969, there were eleven committees, including Budget; Curriculum; Executive; Faculty/Staff Relations; Graduate Admissions; Graduate Programme; Grievance; Library; Salary; Tenure and Promotions; Teaching Methods and Grades; and Visiting Lecturers. By the next year, there remained only the Executive, Budget, Curriculum, Graduate Studies, and Appointments committees. This structure remained until the dissolution of the Department. Other short-lived committees, such as Majors and Honours, were also formed. P.S.A. also struck ad hoc committees, such as the Chairman's Search Committee, when required.<lb/></p>

<p>Klaus Ekkehard Rieckhoff is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Physics at Simon Fraser University (SFU). He helped shape the department and the university through his active involvement in the governance of SFU, through his contributions to science and his devotion to teaching, as well as his involvement in the larger community.<lb/><lb/>Born in Weimar, Germany, Rieckhoff experienced life under both the Nazi and Communist regimes before escaping from the Soviet-occupied zone in 1947. Shortly after, he left for the western zones where he worked in various factories in Munich until he was accepted at the University of Karlsruhe where he studied mathematics and physics (1947-1949). He was accepted for one of 40 places in physics and mathematics from a pool of 400 applicants after an entrance examination administered to 160 of the applicants. In 1949, he left the university while continuing to work as a clerk in the actuarial department of a life insurance company (1948-1951). In December 1949, he married Marianne Neder with whom he has three children, Bernhard Andreas, Claudia Angela, and Cornelia Andrea.<lb/><lb/>Rieckhoff immigrated to Canada in 1952. Upon his arrival to Vancouver, B.C., he held various jobs as a dock worker (1952), sawmill worker (1953), and television technician (1953-1957) before earning his B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D at the University of British Columbia.<lb/><lb/>In 1965, Rieckhoff joined SFU as a charter faculty member and immersed himself in its life. He is regarded as a vital force in the Department of Physics, a department he helped to create and nurture. From 1966-1967, he was Acting Dean of Science, and from 1972-1976, he was Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. He has authored and co-authored more than 60 papers in the areas of spectroscopy and chemical physics, earning international recognition for his work. From 1976-1977, he worked at the IBM Research Lab in San Jose, California as Visiting Scientist. In 1987, he was a Visiting Professor at the universities of Puerto Rico (Mayaguez, U.S.A.), Queensland (Brisbane, Australia), and Bayreuth (Germany).<lb/><lb/>Rieckhoff's passion for critical inquiry is reflected in his multiple appointments, participation, and election to a number of faculty, departmental, and university committees. As a founding member of Senate, he supported the inclusion of undergraduate representation. He served on the Senate for 17 years and on the Board of Governors for 11 years, earning him the distinction of being one of the longest-serving members on both bodies. In recognition of his contributions to the governance and administration of SFU, the university named the Senate Chamber in his honour in 1982. Although the space has been renovated, a plaque remains in place. In 1998, SFU awarded him a Doctor of Laws, honoris causa.</p>

<p>When SFU opened in 1965 the Board of Governors and senior academic staff agreed that there were not enough students to form a separate faculty of Graduate Studies. For the first couple of years, each academic department was responsible for the administration of their own graduate students and the development of graduate programs. In 1968 the Senate Committee on Graduate Studies approved the formation of departmental graduate studies committees and the recommendation of a Dean of Graduate Studies. In 1971, the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies was officially created. Reporting to the Vice-President, Academic, the Dean was given responsibility for graduate studies policy development and graduate student services, including the administration of research and grants for faculty and scholarships for students. In 1994 the Dean's role was combined with that of Vice-President, Research with the graduate studies portfolio reporting to the Vice-President, Academic. In 2000 the Dean of Graduate Studies was made a separate position once again, with the Vice-President, Research taking responsibility for research administration and the Dean of Graduate Studies reporting back again to the Vice-President, Academic and Provost.<lb/><lb/>The Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies ensures that graduate students throughout the university conform to standards approved by the university Senate. The Dean is assisted by an Associate Dean of Graduate Studies who is responsible for matters that involve individual students and individual graduate programs. The Dean retains primary responsibility for policy matters and external relations. The Dean approves supervisory committees, recommends the awarding of degrees, advises on program development and approves new graduate programs. The Dean also administers and provides information about all graduate awards and liaises with national and provincial granting agencies. The Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies maintains all formal graduate student records from the time of application to the awarding of degrees. The Dean's office also administers Special Arrangement students and Post-doctoral Fellows. The Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies organizes a number of events throughout the year including Graduate Scholarships Day, the TA/TM Day, library workshops for graduate students, SFU Graduate Student Certificate Program in University Teaching and Learning, and the SFU Teaching, Learning, and Research Showcase.<lb/><lb/>The Dean of Graduate Studies participates in university administration through membership on senate and various senate committees. The Dean serves as Chair of the Senate Graduate Studies Committee, the Executive Committee of the Senate Graduate Studies Committee, the Assessment Committee for New Graduate Programs, the University Ethics Review Committee, the Senate Graduate Awards Adjudication Committee, and the President's Research Grant Committee. The Dean serves as an ex officio member of Senate, the Senate Committee on Academic Planning, and the Senate Policy Committee for Scholarships, Awards and Bursaries. Over the years, the Dean of Graduate Studies has also served on a series of external boards, including the TRIUMF (Tri-University Meson Facility) Board of Management, the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies, and the Western Canadian Deans of Graduate Studies Committee.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Education was one of the three founding faculties of Simon Fraser University and began operations in September 1965 with the opening of the university. As of this writing (May 2008), it continues as an active faculty with a mandate to engage in research and scholarly inquiry, advance knowledge, and improve the practice of teaching and the learning experience.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Education was founded with a broad mandate. In addition to courses relating to education and the teacher-certification Professional Development Program (PDP), the faculty was also responsible for instruction in the fine and performing arts, campus arts programming, campus recreational services, and intercollegiate athletics. This broad scope was reflected in the original structure of the faculty, which was organized into three distinct Centres, each with their own departments. (i) The Physical Development Centre included the departments of Physical Development Studies, Athletics, and Recreational Services. (ii) The Centre for Communications and the Arts was responsible for courses in fine and performing arts and communication studies, and provided a range of non-credit courses and public-events programming. (iii) The Educational Foundations Centre offered courses through the departments of Behavioural Sciences Foundations, Social and Philosophical Foundations, and Professional Foundations. <lb/><lb/>Re-organization occurred in 1970. The Centre for Communications and the Arts moved out of the faculty to become a separate unit for arts programming and non-credit instruction. Communication Studies remained within the faculty, moving to the Educational Foundations Centre. Athletics and Recreational Services merged, separated from the Physical Development Centre and left the faculty. Professional Foundations moved out of the Educational Foundations Centre to become its own Centre.<lb/><lb/>This new arrangement did not last long, and in 1972 the faculty abolished the entire structure based on centres and departments. Physical Development Studies (renamed Kinesiology) and Communication Studies moved out of Education to become academic departments in the newly established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. The Faculty of Education became a unitary body with functional divisions for Undergraduate Programs, Graduate Programs and Professional Programs. Professors were now affiliated to the faculty as a whole, able to cross over different program areas. Two further divisions were later added. Field Relations and Teacher In-Service was established in 1994 for professional development programs for BC school teachers and administrators (renamed Field Programs in 1998). International Programs was created in 2000 for coordinating the faculty's many internationalization activities. In both cases, the new divisions did not represent the accrual of a new function as such, but rather provided a more coherent organizational structure for activities and programs that were already underway in the faculty.<lb/><lb/>Administratively, the faculty is headed by the Dean of Education, assisted since 1983 by an Associate Dean. The Dean originally reported directly to the President, but since 1970 has reported to the Vice-President, Academic whose office was established in that year. The number and composition of the faculty's committees has varied over time. The Faculty Meeting has always been the principal governing forum, while the Executive Committee prepares matters for the Faculty Meeting, makes recommendations, and reviews and coordinates the activities of the different program areas. Each program area is headed by a Director, with program committees that review and make recommendations relating to the program as a whole.<lb/><lb/>Since the 1972 re-organization, teaching in the Faculty of Education focuses on provision of Education courses to undergraduate and graduate students; teacher certification through the Professional Development Program (PDP); and professional development activities for in-service teachers. From 1965, the faculty has offered degrees for the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.), the Master of Arts (Education) (M.A.) and Master of Science (Education) (M.Sc.). The Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) were offered from 1983, and the Doctor of Education (D.Ed.) was added in 1998. Teaching is carried out by faculty members, assisted in the PDP program by faculty associates and program coordinators (teachers in the BC school system seconded to assist in teaching and classroom supervision activities). Since the early 1970s, decentralization has allowed PDP students to complete part of their requirements in communities across the provinces, as well providing in-service professional development activities beyond the Lower Mainland region.<lb/><lb/>See fonds Appendix B for a visual representation of the Faculty of Education's organizational structure and how this has changed over time.</p>

<p>The Joint Board of Teacher Education (JBTE) was established by the Province of British Columbia in 1963, in the revision of the University Act, whereby Simon Fraser University and the University of Victoria came into existence alongside the University of British Columbia. The JBTE comprised representatives from each of the universities, their Faculties of Education, the Ministry of Education, the Department of Education, the BC School Trustees Association, and the BC Teachers Federation. Its mandate was to ensure the high quality of teacher instruction in the province by reviewing the curriculum, staffing, budget, and facilities of the Faculties of Education; to make recommendations to the universities and the Ministry; and to initiate changes to teacher training. The JBTE was the successor to the Joint Board of College of Education (1955-1963). It was abolished in the 1983 amendment of the University Act.</p>

<p>A central committee charged with coordinating the activities and programs of the faculty has existed since the Faculty of Education began operations in 1965. It was originally called the Executive Council (1965-1967), then the Coordinating Council (1967-1972), before becoming the Executive Committee in 1972, under which name it continues to operate as of this writing (July 2008). In addition to its coordinating function, the committee reviews programs and activities and makes recommendations to the appropriate faculty bodies, and it prepares the agenda and documentation for the monthly Faculty Meeting. The composition of the committee has varied over time. Prior to 1972, members included the Dean, the Chairs of the Centres, and the Heads of Departments. After 1972 it comprised the Dean (and Associate Dean from 1983) and the Directors of the program areas. </p>

In 1967, the centre added the Department of Physical Development Studies to deliver courses on human growth and movement (kinesiology). Athletics and Recreatonal Services left the centre (and the Faculty of Education) in 1970 to become an independent administrative unit reporting to the Vice-President, Administration. The Faculty of Education as a whole re-organized in 1972, abolishing the PDC along with the other remaining centres, with Physical Development Studies moving to the newly established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies as the Department of Kinesiology.</p>

<p>Professional Programs was established in 1972 as one of the three functional program areas that replaced the faculty's previously independent centres and departments during the re-organization of that year. It was the successor to the Professional Foundations Centre, taking over responsibility for the teacher-certification component of the Faculty of Education at SFU, and it continues as an active division of the faculty as of this writing (July 2008).<lb/><lb/>From the opening of the university in 1965, the Faculty of Education has offered the Professional Development Program (PDP). Students could apply for PDP admission after completing a certain number of undergraduate credits at SFU or another university and, upon completion of the program, were recommended for the provincial Teachers' Certificate (granted originally by government's Department of Education, after 1974 by the British Columbia College of Teachers). The PDP program at SFU was initially administered by the Department of Professional Foundations in the Educational Foundations Centre, later (1970) becoming its own centre (Professional Foundations Centre). In 1972 responsibility for the program was carried over to faculty's new Professional Programs division. While PDP requirements and curricula have evolved over the years, it's basic structure has consistently been a three-semester program involving two core courses (EDUC 401/402), a semester of supervised classroom experience, and a semester of supplementary course programming. The faculty uses a "differentiated" or "complementary" staffing model which teams tenure-track faculty members with seconded teachers selected from school districts throughout the province. In the early 1970s the faculty initiated a decentralization of the program, enabling students to complete some of their requirements in communities outside of the Lower Mainland. In 2006, the Professional Qualifications Program (PQP) was established, a three-semester program for those wishing to re-certify their teaching credentials.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies (FIDS) was established by the Board of Governors 12 December 1972 to succeed the Division of General Studies. The primary function of the faculty was to encourage the development of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary programs and provide a stable administrative environment within which these could mature. Upon the dissolution of FIDS 1 September 1985, the responsibility for promoting interdisciplinary studies was inherited by the Faculty of Arts, and the FIDS departments and programs were assumed by the Faculties of Arts, Science, and Applied Sciences.<lb/><lb/>Upon inception of the Faculty, the functions of the previous Dean of General Studies were transferred to the new Dean of Interdisciplinary Studies. As the executive officer of the Faculty and an administrative officer of the University, the Dean of Interdisciplinary Studies was responsible to the Senate for ensuring that the functions of the Faculty were carried out. Specifically, the position was given six major duties: 1) to act as the central budget authority for all departments and programs in the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies; 2) to administer all non-departmental programs of the Faculty; 3) to coordinate curriculum development through the faculty undergraduate and graduate curriculum committees and maintain scholastic uniformity; 4) to be responsible for faculty hiring, discipline, tenure and promotion in conjunction with appropriate departments; 5) to facilitate the research undertaken by Faculty members by ensuring facilities, equipment and support, and; 6) to engage in the ongoing assessment of Faculty performance through performance review, contract renewal, tenure and promotion evaluations. The Dean also acted as chair of Faculty meetings and represented the Faculty to external bodies such as Senate and the Board of Governors.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty consisted administratively of a number of departments and programs. Departmental chairs and program directors reported to the Dean, who in turn reported directly to the Vice-President, Academic. The Dean was solely responsible for overall academic and administrative matters until 1980, when the position of Associate Dean was established. The Associate Dean was made responsible for space allotment, the appointment of sesssional staff, the coordination of curriculum development in graduate and undergraduate programs, advice to the Dean on specific matters, and to take the role of Acting Dean when required.<lb/><lb/>The original Faculty departments were Fine and Performing Arts, Kinesiology, and Communication Studies, all of which were formerly units within the Faculty of Education. Fine and Performing Arts had been part of the Centre for Communications and the Arts; Kinesiology was an expansion of Physical Development Studies; and Communication Studies was created by the amalgamation of two former units: Behavioral Science Foundations and the Centre for Communications and the Arts. The original Faculty programs were African/Middle Eastern Studies, Canadian Studies, Computing Science, and Latin American Studies.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty expanded steadily in the number of its departments and programs offered. A program in Criminology was created in 1974, and became a department in the Faculty in 1975. Further program additions included Women's Studies (1976), Natural Resource Management (1979), Management and Systems Science (1980), and Gerontology (1982). When the Faculty was dissolved, it consisted of the Centre for the Arts; Centre for Canadian Studies; the Departments of Communication, Computing Science, Criminology, and Kinesiology; and the following programs: African/Middle Eastern Studies, Gerontology, Latin American Studies, Management and Systems Science, and Women's Studies. Upon dissolution, most of the units became part of the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies in the Faculty of Arts. The exceptions were the Departments of Communication, Computing Science and Kinesiology, which became part of the Faculty of Applied Sciences, and the Management and Systems Science Program, which became part of the Faculty of Science.<lb/></p>

<p>The Institute of Fisheries Analysis (IFA) was founded in 1980 by Dr. Parzival Copes, an economist and charter faculty member at Simon Fraser University (SFU), with the support of faculty members who held a common interest in fisheries research. The IFA was established to promote interdisciplinary study and research on fisheries questions among SFU faculty, staff, and students. Topical areas of interest included, but were not limited to, the basic biology, ecology, and population dynamics of exploitable fish stocks; the bio-economic and socio-political framework of fisheries regulation and management; the socio-economic well-being of fishing communities; industrial and commercial developments related to fisheries; and the political economy of the fishing industry. In 2001, the IFA was dissolved and succeeded by the Centre for Coastal Studies.<lb/><lb/>In conjunction with its objective to promote interdisciplinary fisheries studies and research, the IFA sponsored interdisciplinary research seminars in fisheries and encouraged research cooperation among persons from relevant disciplines. The Institute also assisted in securing and administering resources for fisheries research conducted at the University. Although the IFA did not have a formal teaching role, it did encourage and support teaching programs in fisheries analysis by providing background research as well as guidance and academic supervision to students admitted to master’s or doctoral programs in fisheries management under Special Arrangements (i.e., graduate studies programs outside or between existing graduate programs, administered by the Dean of Graduate Studies). <lb/><lb/>The Institute, through using the services and expertise of its members, undertook research contracts external to the University. In order to disseminate research carried out by its members, the IFA published a Discussion Paper Series, which later evolved into the series titled Fisheries Research Papers. <lb/><lb/>When the IFA was first founded, the directorship and administration were combined with that of the Centre for Canadian Studies (CNS) as Copes was the director of CNS at the time. CNS received resources from the Office of the Vice-President, Research and Information Systems to support all of the IFA’s administrative needs. Around 1988, CNS and the IFA were separated, and the IFA was allocated its own physical space where a library and fisheries-related bibliography were developed and maintained for the use of researchers. This separation resulted in a lack of support staff and regular budget for the IFA.<lb/><lb/>In 1989, the IFA entered into a Collaborative Research and Training Agreement with Simon Fraser University and the Asian Fisheries and Social Science Research Network (AFSSRN), which was sponsored by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The purpose of this agreement was to provide opportunities at SFU for members of the AFSSRN to obtain master’s and doctoral qualifications in fisheries economics under the supervision of SFU faculty members from the IFA. This was a major source of IFA funding, along with a small amount of funding provided through the Faculty of Arts, and various research grants obtained by individual members of the Institute for various projects.<lb/><lb/>The administration of the IFA consisted of a Governing Committee—initially comprised of the Deans of Arts, Graduate Studies, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Science—a Director, and an Associate Director. The Director and Associate Director were appointed by the Governing Committee in consultation with the regular members of the Institute (i.e., persons holding faculty or research appointments at SFU) and the associate members of the Institute (i.e., students of the University who were directly involved in the work of the Institute). Nominations made to the Governing Committee for the Director and Associate Director were made by majority vote of the members. Applications for membership to the Institution were made to the Director and approved by majority vote of the Institute’s regular members. The Director reported directly to the Dean of Arts.<lb/><lb/>The Institute was dissolved in 2001, and its successor, the Centre for Coastal Studies, expanded the IFA’s original mandate, taking a broader ecosystem approach to coastal resource research and management.</p>

<p>The Canadian Studies program developed from a series of informal meetings among a group of interested faculty members in late 1969 and early 1970. Subsequently representatives from eight departments and the library drafted a proposal for a Canadian Studies program within the Division of General Studies (later the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies). Course offerings began in the fall of 1971. The program was intended to provide a corrective for the lack of Canadian content being offered in the University and to provide a focus for interdisciplinary study. <lb/><lb/>By 1978, the University had appointed a full-time director for the program. The director was advised by a Steering Committee with one member from each department in the University which offered courses acceptable for credit towards the minor in Canadian Studies. The Steering Committee also included representatives from the Faculty of Education, the library, and the Student Society. <lb/><lb/>In 1980, the program was redesignated as the Centre for Canadian Studies, and offered students a major and honours in Canadian Studies. In addition, the Centre developed a French Canadian Studies Certificate Program.<lb/><lb/>Upon the dissolution of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies in 1985, the Centre for Canadian Studies became part of the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies within the Faculty of Arts.</p>

<p>The Department of Economics and Commerce was established by the Board of Governors in February 1964, and began to offer courses within the Faculty of Arts leading to B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees when the University opened in 1965. The Department was responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the fields of economics and commerce.<lb/><lb/>The Department expanded rapidly in size, growing from an initial 5 faculty members in 1965 to 52 in 1979. During this period it had greatly expanded its program offerings, including the important addition of a Master of Business Administration program in 1968. In September 1979 the Department underwent a re-organization, when it was subsumed by the new School of Business Administration and Economics in the Faculty of Arts. The School consisted of two departments: Business Administration and Economics. The School existed only until November 1981, when a separate Faculty of Business Administration was established. The Department of Economics has continued to exist in the Faculty of Arts.<lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by a Chair and departmental committees, whose number and composition changed over time. The Chair was responsible for the overall administration of the Department, and reported to the Dean of Arts. In addition to its departmental committees, the Department adopted in 1969 a Constitution and By-laws for its Graduate Program in Economics. It stated that the Program would have three committees: the Graduate Studies Committee, the Curriculum Committee, and the Admissions Committee. </p>

<p>Peter Martinus Buitenhuis (1925-2004), English professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University (SFU), was a prolific scholarly writer and literary critic. His academic career—which included teaching positions at Yale University, University of Toronto, McGill University, and University of California at Berkeley—saw the production of numerous books, articles, and reviews, including works on Henry James, E.J. Pratt, and Hugh MacLennan. Buitenhuis also conducted research and wrote on various topics pertaining to propaganda and World Wars I and II.<lb/><lb/>Of Dutch ancestry, Buitenhuis was born in Ilford Essex, England on December 8, 1925. He married three times and had seven children. With his first wife, Patricia (nee White), he had three children, Paul, Penelope, and Pym; with his second wife, Elspeth Fisher (nee Cameron), he had two children, Beatrix and Hugo; and with his third wife, Ann Cowan (nee Stephenson), he had two children, Juliana and Adrian.<lb/><lb/>In December 1943, Buitenhuis left his job as a bank clerk and enlisted in the Royal Navy. From 1943-1946, he was commissioned to several different ships, including the H.M.S. Beehive, where he served as a Navigating Officer in Coastal Forces, conducting anti-submarine and minesweeping duties in the English Channel and North Sea (1944-1945). After his time on the Beehive, Buitenhuis spent a short period in the Admiralty. In 1946, he was appointed as a navigational officer on H.M.S. Starling, where he served until his release from the Navy later that year. Buitenhuis received the 1939-45 Star, the France and Germany Star, and the Victory Medal.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis left the Navy to attend Jesus College at Oxford University on a veteran’s grant (1946). There he earned a BA and an MA in English language and literature. In Buitenhuis’s last year of studies, a professor from the University of Oklahoma (U of O) recruited him to teach English, thus enticing Buitenhuis to immigrate to the United States.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis taught at the U of O until 1951, at which time he left his position in response to an investigation by an Oklahoma legislature committee. The committee was putting pressure on the university’s employees to sign a loyalty oath to the constitution of the United States and to the constitution of Oklahoma State. Buitenhuis, neither interested in staying in Oklahoma nor signing the oath, went on to Yale University to pursue a PhD in American Studies, where he wrote his thesis on Henry James. After completing his degree, Buitenhuis stayed on at Yale’s American Studies Department to teach (1955-1959).<lb/><lb/>In 1959, Buitenhuis left Yale and immigrated to Canada, after receiving an invitation from Northrop Frye—then the chairman of the English Department at Victoria College in the University of Toronto—to teach at the College. He became a Canadian citizen c.1960, while still retaining his British citizenship.<lb/><lb/>While at Victoria College, in 1963, Buitenhuis joined with fellow Americanists from other Canadian universities to form the first American Studies association in Canada, the Canadian Association of American Studies.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis worked at the College as an associate professor until 1966, when he took a year to teach at the University of California (Berkley) as a visiting professor. In 1967, Buitenhuis returned to Canada to take a position at McGill University in Montreal. After several years at McGill, in 1975, Buitenhuis accepted the position of Chairman of the Department of English at Simon Fraser University (1975-1981) and moved to Vancouver.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis remained at SFU until his retirement in 1992. In that time, he not only taught in the Department of English, but was also the Associate Director in SFU’s Centre for Canadian Studies (1987-1988). He continued to teach literature well after his retirement through SFU’s Continuing Studies Department, and was still teaching until shortly before his death. Buitenhuis passed away on November 28, 2004.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis remained an active scholar, book reviewer, and writer throughout his life. Included in his many literature reviews and scholarly articles are several books, including E.J. Pratt and His Works; Five American Moderns: Mary McCarthy, Stephen Crane, J.D. Salinger, Eugene O’Neill, and H.L. Mencken; The Grasping Imagination: The American Writings of Henry James; The Great War of Words: British, American, and Canadian Propaganda and Fiction, 1914-1933; and The House of Seven Gables: Severing Family and Colonial Ties. Buitenhuis also completed a manuscript just weeks before his death titled, Empires of the Mind: British Authors' Roles in World War II.<lb/><lb/>Buitenhuis’s literary and academic career brought him into contact with many well-known authors, including Margaret Atwood, Northrop Frye, Timothy Findley, Thomas Wolfe, and Scott Symons.</p>

<p>The University Archives acquires, preserves and makes available three categories of materials: (1) the official records of the University, including those created by the Board of Governors, Senate, University committees, faculties, departments and administrative offices; (2) materials documenting the wider University community; and (3) historical research collections that promote the teaching and research activities of the University.<lb/><lb/>The Archives was established within the University Library in 1968 when librarian Liisa Fagerlund was appointed University Archivist on a half-time basis. She continued in this post until 1975 when she left the University. From 1975 to 1978, the Archives functioned within the Special Collections division of the Library. Archival duties were carried out by various library staff members. In 1978, the University Archives was established as a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. Donald Baird, recently retired as University Librarian, became University Archivist and held this position until his retirement in 1990. Jim Ross served as University Archivist from 1991 to 1993, and was succeeded by Ian Forsyth in 1994.<lb/><lb/>When the Archives was a function of the University Library, the University Archivist reported to the University Librarian. When the Archives was established as a separate administrative unit, the University Archivist reported directly to the University President. The reporting structure changed in 1986 when the University Archivist reported to the Vice-President, Research/Information Systems; in 1990, when the University Archivist reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic; and in 1996, when the University Archivist reported to the Registrar/Dean of Students.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Science is one of the three founding faculties of Simon Fraser University. The Faculty was established in September 1965, as mandated by the Universities Act, 1963. c.52 (RS 1979, c. 419). The four charter departments of the Faculty consisted of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, and Physics. As of 2006, the Faculty has grown to eight departments and also includes Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Statistics and Actuarial Science (the only program of its kind in western North America.)<lb/><lb/>The Dean of Science reports to the Vice-President Academic and Provost. Each department in the Faculty is headed by a Chair and the Dean is assisted by an Associate Dean. The Dean is both the chief officer and chair of faculty meetings and is responsible for ensuring that the various duties and responsibilities of the Faculty are carried out.<lb/><lb/>Each of the departments offers BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees and participates in the university's co-operative education program that allows students to combine relevant work experience with academic studies. The Faculty of Science also offers several courses that can be used by non-science students to fulfill degree requirements. In 2005 the Faculty began offering science programs at SFU's Surrey campus.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Science is a research-intensive faculty, traditionally accounting for half the external research support (and funding) brought to SFU. The Faculty has actively supported a high school recruitment policy through high school liaison programs established in the late 1960's and more recently, hiring a Director of Student recruitment. The Faculty of Science also plays a role in university outreach by promoting a general understanding of scientific discoveries and explaining the implications of science for setting social policy. Through the School for Continuing Studies, the faculty sponsors science seminar series that are held in the evenings at Harbour Centre. Graduate and undergraduate students from the faculty annually run summer science camps and maintain the “Science Alive!” and “Let's talk Science” programs.<lb/><lb/>SFU is one of five universities involved in research at TRIUMF, Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics located at the University of British Columbia. In addition, SFU is one of five universities that form the Western Canadian Universities Marine Biological Society (WCUMBS), a non-profit group that owns and operates the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre, in Bamfield, BC.</p>

<p>Hari Prakash Sharma (1934-2010) was a sociologist and Marxist scholar who came from the United States, politicized by the anti-war movement and inspired by the politically charged atmosphere at Simon Fraser University in 1968. He joined the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in that year and taught until his retirement in 1999 when he was honoured by the university as Professor Emeritus.<lb/><lb/>He was born on November 9, 1934 (although some records indicate January 10, 1934 as his date of birth) at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh, India, the second of eight children born to Kundun Lal Sharma and Moharli Devi Sharma. His father was a railway stationmaster, and the family moved frequently.<lb/><lb/>Sharma earned his BA from Agra University in 1954. After a five-year stint as Lower Division Clerk and Typist for the Government of India in the Central Excise and Customs Department, he earned an MA in Social Work from Delhi University in 1960. He then accepted a post as Lecturer at the Delhi School of Social Work, where he remained for three years. In 1963, Sharma moved to the US to further his education. He received an MS in Social Work from Case Western Reserve University in 1964 and a PhD in Rural Sociology from Cornell University in 1968. He taught briefly at the University of California, Los Angeles before accepting a position at SFU.<lb/><lb/>As a faculty member of SFU, Sharma became a champion of the academic rights of colleagues who faced the threat of dismissal for their support of student-led movements to democratize the university. Notably, he supported fellow colleague and friend Kathleen Gough, a British anthropologist with Marxist leanings who was suspended for her political activities. Gough and Sharma co-edited "Imperialism and Revolution in South Asia," which was published in the Monthly Review, an independent socialist journal, in 1974.<lb/><lb/>His research areas of special interest included political economy and agrarian social structures, particularly in India; social movements, political mobilization, ethnic and cultural identities; race and class; and nation-building among the aboriginal people of British Columbia. He wrote extensively on those topics and provided guest lectures at over 50 universities and scholarly institutions in Asia, Europe, and North America.<lb/><lb/>In the spring of 1967, the Naxalbari peasant uprising inspired him to travel to India and several other Asian countries. Upon his return, he became committed to political activism from an anti-imperialist perspective. During 1971-72, Sharma was a founding member of and contributor to the Georgia Straight Collective, which produced a publication for radical and alternative views. In 1973, he went to Amnesty International in London and the Commission of Jurists in Geneva and made a written representation to the UN Human Rights Commission in an effort to publicize the condition of more than 30,000 political prisoners in Indian jails. In 1974, Sharma and his comrade Gautam Appa of the London School of Economics organized a petition of international scholars to protest the treatment of political prisoners in India, which he handed to the Indian Consulate in Vancouver, BC on August 15 of the same year.<lb/><lb/>On a return trip from India in early 1975, Hari Sharma began to travel across North American campuses giving talks and mobilizing people toward the formation of a patriotic organization of Indians living in North America. This effort contributed to the founding of the Indian People's Association in North America (IPANA) on June 25, 1975, the same day on which Indira Gandhi declared a State of Emergency in India. The opposition to what was identified as a "fascist dictatorship" became the urgent task of IPANA along with the defense of the thousands of political prisoners.<lb/><lb/>IPANA established chapters in several North American cities, with its most active chapters in Montréal, Vancouver, New York, Toronto, and Boston. It had links with patriotic organizations in San Francisco, Chicago, Winnipeg, and Edmonton. In their effort to oppose imperialism and to promote democratic rights and social justice in India, IPANA produced three publications: the quarterly New India Bulletin, which came out of Montréal from 1975; India Now, a monthly that was produced in New York from 1976; and Wangar, a Punjabi paper that was produced from Vancouver every two months from 1977. In addition to its publications, IPANA held numerous public meetings, demonstrations, lectures, films, and cultural programs to highlight the systemic oppression of dalits, peasants, and workers that mocked any concept of democracy and freedom put forth by the existing Government of India. One of IPANA’s first public interventions in North America was to sponsor a speaking tour by Mary Tyler, a British writer who had been held in an Indian prison for several years without any formal charge for alleged revolutionary activities in Bihar.<lb/><lb/>Under Sharma's leadership, IPANA also supported the struggles of minorities and workers in BC. He was a primary force in the founding of the British Columbia Organization to Fight Racism (BCOFR). Through the 1980s, IPANA and BCOFR engaged thousands of people from several communities. Both Sharma and IPANA also helped form the Canadian Farmworkers Union in 1980.<lb/><lb/>In the 1980s, Sharma focused much of his research and writing on the condition of minorities in India, which came to a crisis with the attack on the Golden Temple and the massacre of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. He defended the human rights of Sikhs and of Muslims who became the primary targets of the Hindutva movements advocating Hindu nationalism. In 1987, Sharma organized a parallel conference on the centralization of state power and the threat to minorities in India to coincide with the Commonwealth Conference in Vancouver.<lb/><lb/>In 1989, Sharma united groups of the South Asian community to form the Komagata Maru Historical Society. The event commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Komagata Maru incident in which Indian immigrants traveling to Canada on a chartered ship were turned away from the shores of Vancouver by racist policies of the government. The society united the community, and as a result of its activities, the government installed a commemorative plaque in Vancouver in 1989. In 2004, during a screening of the film Continuous Journey (a documentary on the episode by the Toronto filmmaker Ali Kazimi), Mayor of Vancouver Larry Campbell sent a scroll to Sharma on behalf of the Komagata Historical Society declaring the week to be dedicated to the memory of Komagata Maru.<lb/><lb/>Following the attack on the Babri Masjid mosque in December 1992, Hari Sharma became the prime mover in the formation of a North American organization dedicated to the defence of minority rights in India, also known as Non-Resident Indians for Secularism and Democracy (NRISAD). This organization united people of Indian origin collectively through educational and cultural activities. One of its significant events in Vancouver included the celebration of the 50th anniversary of India's independence from colonial rule. The event united people across the South Asian community to focus on issues that included the urgency for peace between Pakistan and India. In September 1999, Sharma travelled to Montréal to join the founding of the International South Asia Forum (INSAF), a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to the promotion of peace and social justice in South Asia. He became its first President and organized the Second Conference in Vancouver in August 2001.<lb/><lb/>Over time, NRISAD recognized a need to widen the focus of the organization to include the whole of South Asia because its membership in Vancouver comprised people from the entire subcontinent of India and the diaspora in East Africa and other countries. Under Sharma's leadership, NRISAD evolved into the South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy (SANSAD) in 2000. It pursued the same quest as its predecessors for peace and democracy based secularism, human rights, and social justice. Some activities included condemning the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 (for which Sharma was denied a visa to visit India), championing the human rights of Kashmiris, condemning violence against journalists and academics in Bangladesh, supporting the movement for democracy and social justice in Nepal, and defending the human rights of Tamils under the attack of the Sri Lankan state.<lb/><lb/>Throughout the years, Hari Sharma developed close ties and contacts with various political groups and communities. He worked with the First Nations in the Interior of BC, and as co-chair (along with Dr. Ronald Ignace, the elected Chief of the Skeetchestn Band from 1982 to 2003 and between 2007 and 2009), he helped to promote and to defend the merit of the SFU Kamloops First Nations program (then the SCES/SFU Program). In addition to his regular workload at SFU, Sharma taught courses such as Violence and War, Marxist Theory, and Third World issues on different occasions in Kamloops. Although the 16-year partnership between SFU and the Secwepemc Cultural Education Society of the Shuswap Nation (SCES) was dissolved by mutual agreement in 2004, over 400 students graduated from the program.<lb/><lb/>In addition to his academic work and political activism, Hari Sharma was an accomplished literary writer and self-taught photographer. He wrote and published short stories in Hindi. Many of his works also were also translated into Bengali, Punjabi, and English. Vapsi, one of his stories, was made into a Doordarshan (Indian public service broadcaster) film. Sharma attributed his interest in photography to a Japanese camera that had been "gifted" to him as a bribe by an importer while pushing files as a government worker. The camera became something that Sharma frequently took with him on trips to India to capture snippets of everyday life. Over the years, his photographs were published in academic journals and art magazines. His works were also publicly displayed in galleries in North America, Europe, and India.<lb/><lb/>After more than 50 years of political activity, Hari Sharma developed contacts and friendships with many who supported revolutionary movements. He married twice.<lb/><lb/>After a prolonged battle with cancer, Hari Sharma died in his Burnaby home surrounded by his closest comrades on March 16, 2010.</p>

One of its significant events in Vancouver included the celebration of the 50th anniversary of India's independence from colonial rule. The event united people across the South Asian community to focus on issues that included the urgency for peace between Pakistan and India. In September 1999, Sharma travelled to Montréal to join the founding of the International South Asia Forum (INSAF), a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to the promotion of peace and social justice in South Asia. He became its first President and organized the Second Conference in Vancouver in August 2001.<lb/><lb/>Over time, NRISAD recognized a need to widen the focus of the organization to include the whole of South Asia because its membership in Vancouver comprised people from the entire subcontinent of India and the diaspora in East Africa and other countries. Under Sharma's leadership, NRISAD evolved into the South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy (SANSAD) in 2000. It pursued the same quest as its predecessors for peace and democracy based secularism, human rights, and social justice. Some activities included condemning the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 (for which Sharma was denied a visa to visit India), championing the human rights of Kashmiris, condemning violence against journalists and academics in Bangladesh, supporting the movement for democracy and social justice in Nepal, and defending the human rights of Tamils under the attack of the Sri Lankan state.<lb/><lb/>Throughout the years, Hari Sharma developed close ties and contacts with various political groups and communities. He worked with the First Nations in the Interior of BC, and as co-chair (along with Dr. Ronald Ignace, the elected Chief of the Skeetchestn Band from 1982 to 2003 and between 2007 and 2009), he helped to promote and to defend the merit of the SFU Kamloops First Nations program (then the SCES/SFU Program). In addition to his regular workload at SFU, Sharma taught courses such as Violence and War, Marxist Theory, and Third World issues on different occasions in Kamloops. Although the 16-year partnership between SFU and the Secwepemc Cultural Education Society of the Shuswap Nation (SCES) was dissolved by mutual agreement in 2004, over 400 students graduated from the program.<lb/><lb/>In addition to his academic work and political activism, Hari Sharma was an accomplished literary writer and self-taught photographer. He wrote and published short stories in Hindi. Many of his works also were also translated into Bengali, Punjabi, and English. Vapsi, one of his stories, was made into a Doordarshan (Indian public service broadcaster) film. Sharma attributed his interest in photography to a Japanese camera that had been "gifted" to him as a bribe by an importer while pushing files as a government worker. The camera became something that Sharma frequently took with him on trips to India to capture snippets of everyday life. Over the years, his photographs were published in academic journals and art magazines. His works were also publicly displayed in galleries in North America, Europe, and India.<lb/><lb/>After more than 50 years of political activity, Hari Sharma developed contacts and friendships with many who supported revolutionary movements. He married twice.<lb/><lb/>After a prolonged battle with cancer, Hari Sharma died in his Burnaby home surrounded by his closest comrades on March 16, 2010.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Organization to Fight Racism (BCOFR) was founded in November 1980, with the core leadership and the majority of its membership from the Indi-Canadian community in Vancouver. Many of the founders were also members of the Indian People's Assocation in North America (IPANA). The organization drew members from different communities and traversed ethnic and class lines. At its peak, BCOFR had close to 1,500 members, and its leadership consisted of a president, executive committee, and task-oriented committees. Some of BCOFR's activities included producing a newsletter and organizing social and educational activities to promote community awareness of racism. In addition, BCOFR petitoned, rallied, and campaigned against discriminatory immigration practices. </p>

<p>On February 26, 1979, after a series of casual meetings, Raj Chouhan, Harinder Mahil, and Charan Gill formed the Farm Workers’ Organizing Committee (FWOC) in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia. They were joined at this first official meeting by Sarwan Sidhu, Pritam Singh, Amarit Pal Mann, and Gurnam Sahota. Sarwan Boal and Judy Cavanagh soon joined the FWOC as organizers. A series of public meetings followed to spread awareness of the new group, address farmworkers’ concerns, and advocate for their rights. In the spring of 1980, at a founding convention, members of the FWOC formally established the Canadian Farmworkers Union (CFU). Chouhan was president, Jawala Singh Grewal was vice-president, Gill was secretary, and Boal was treasurer. Cavanagh was a chief organizer. The motto of the CFU was “Zindabad!” (“Long live!” in Urdu). Areas of concern and action for this new union included farmworkers’ pay, housing, working conditions, and work-related legislation. The CFU advocated for childcare for farmworkers and raised awareness of the racism the predominantly Indo-Canadian workers often faced, and also participated in numerous rights-related events and causes in solidarity with other organizations. The CFU was assisted financially by the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) from founding until 1991.<lb/><lb/>In 1979 the FWOC began publishing The Farmworker, a Punjabi/English newspaper with the purpose of educating workers about their rights on the job and their right to organize. The CFU continued publishing this paper through the mid-1990s.<lb/><lb/>In the early 1980s the CFU focused on recruiting members and gaining certification at some farms, and also picketed and fought in court to defend farmworkers’ right to unionize and to protect workers from mistreatment by farm owners. In November of 1980, the collective agreement signed by the CFU and Bell Farms was the first ever signed by a union representing farmworkers in Canada. The union was also particularly vocal about the exclusion of farmworkers from various legislation protecting other workers’ rights and safety. In 1983, farmworkers became eligible for Workers’ Compensation Board benefits, but were still mainly exempt from health and safety regulations.<lb/><lb/>In its early years, the CFU tried to organize farmworkers outside the Fraser Valley and Lower Mainland, reaching out to workers in the BC Okanagan and Ontario. It did not succeed in the Okanagan, due to conflict between CFU executives and local organizers, and in Ontario its success lasted only a few years.<lb/><lb/>In addition to its unionization and advocacy work, the CFU responded to its membership’s needs with relevant educational programming. In 1982 the union began running “ESL Crusade” classes, developed specifically for Punjabi-speaking farmworkers and including both everyday and farmwork-specific English lessons. The “preventable homicide” of worker Jarnail Singh Deol by pesticide exposure led to the establishment of the Deol Agricultural Education and Research Society (the Deol Society) in 1983, as an internal branch of CFU created for the purpose of applying separately from the union for funding grants. The Deol Society’s main concern was education of farmworkers on the health risks and safe handling of pesticides, and it also ran ESL programs. In many projects, jurisdiction was shared by the Deol Society and the CFU.<lb/><lb/>The CFU researched a wide variety of subjects related to farmworkers and workers in general, in order to educate its members and spread awareness of many issues, from global struggles for workers’ and women’s rights to immigration and multiculturalism in Canada. CFU executives and members participated in union, labour, and activist groups and committees, and were vocal in numerous letter-writing, fundraising, and awareness campaigns. The union also participated in rallies and protests on many subjects.<lb/><lb/>By the mid-1980s the CFU was nearly bankrupt due to the ongoing difficulty of collecting dues from underpaid seasonal workers. The union briefly considered merging with other similar unions but, convinced of the unique needs of its membership, it was determined to retain its own name.<lb/><lb/>In 1986, Chouhan stepped down, principal organizer Judy Cavanagh and founding member Charan Gill left, and Sarwan Boal became president. Boal was replaced in 1991 by Jawala Singh Grewal.<lb/><lb/>In the 1990s, the provincial New Democratic Party government extended health and safety legislation to farmworkers, solving one of the CFU’s main areas of concern. The Progressive Intercultural Community Services Society (PICS, formerly Progressive Indo-Canadian Community Services Society) and its founder, Charan Gill, took over management of the union and its work. The CFU still exists in name, but is essentially inactive.</p>

<p>The Department of English was established by the Board of Governors in April 1964, and began to offer courses within the Faculty of Arts at the Bachelor level when the University opened in 1965. The Department's offerings were expanded with the addition in 1966 of a Master's program and in 1974 with the approval of a Ph.D. program. The Department was responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the field of composition and English-language literature. An adjunct to this function was its responsibility to help in the development and instruction in non-departmental programs such as Women's Studies, Fine and Performing Arts, Canadian Studies, and the Humanities minor program. <lb/><lb/>The Department's activities included participation in University and external associations and committees, and the organization of and participation in conferences. Several faculty members were involved in the publication of literary journals. These include West Coast Review, which began in 1965 and later became independent of the Department; Line, edited by Roy Miki and devoted to the University's Contemporary Literature Collection; and Tessera, a feminist journal edited by Kathy Mezei. In 1990, West Coast Review and Line were joined to form West Coast Line.<lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by a chair and a number of standing committees, as laid down in a Department constitution in 1968. In the formalized Department Constitution approved 1 August 1975, the Chair was responsible for the overall administration of the Department, which included "The devising and apportioning of the budget; The assignment of teaching duties, with the advice of the Graduate and Undergraduate Curriculum Committees; Calling and conducting Departmental meetings; Mediating all disputes within the Department; [and] Initiating course grade appeal procedures."<lb/><lb/>The number of Department committees changed greatly over time. In 1965 the Department consisted of five standing committees which had an advisory role: Curriculum (ad hoc), Appointments, Promotions and Salary Increases, Library, and Invited Speakers. There were also loosely organized committees of those teaching each first- and second-year course, usually chaired by the lecturer. By 1968 the number of committees had expanded to ten to include: the Policy Committee; Steering Committee, which was the chief advisory body to the Chair; Honours Committee; Teaching Evaluation Committee; Student Load Committee; Search and Selection Committee; Graduate Admissions Committee; Undergraduate Studies Committee; and West Coast Review, responsible for the publication of the journal.<lb/><lb/>In the Constitution of 1975, it stated that the Department would consist of four elected and two non-elected standing committees. Those elected committees included the Graduate Curriculum Committee, the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee, the Departmental Tenure Committee, and the Appointments Committee. Those appointed committees included the Library and Invited Speakers committees. After 1975, a Composition Committee was also struck.</p>

<p>The Office of Vice-President, Finance and Administration was originally established by the Board of Governors on 21 June 1968, under the title Vice-President, Administration. The general administration of the University was originally a function of the President, who by 1966 had delegated this responsibility to a senior administrator. This administrator oversaw a number of administrative units, including the Bursar, Registrar, General Services, Facility Planning, and the Library. In 1968, the Office of Vice-President, Administration was created, and was responsible for finance, physical plant and planning, purchasing, personnel, ancillary services, and athletics and recreation. Each of these units was headed by a director. <lb/><lb/>By 1981, responsibility for finance, including the office of Bursar, was moved to a newly created Executive Director of Finance, which by 1985 was renamed Vice-President, Finance and in 1988, Vice-President, Financial Services. Both the Vice-Presidents Administration and Financial Services reported directly to the President. In 1993, the two separate offices were rejoined to form the Office of Vice-President, Finance and Administration.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Arts was one of the three founding faculties of the University established in September 1965, as required by the Universities Act, 1963. c.52 (RS 1979, c. 419). According to the Act, a faculty has a number of powers and duties, including the responsibility to make rules for its self-governance; provide for student representation in faculty bodies and meetings; determine the courses of instruction offered and who is eligible to provide such instruction; appoint examiners to conduct examinations and determine results; and decide on all applications and memorials by students and others in connection with the Faculty. In addition to these powers, a faculty is the central intermediary body through which funding is disbursed to departments and non-departmental programs, including the provision of facilities, equipment and support. In keeping with the overall approach of the University, the Faculty of Arts has sought from its inception to foster interdisciplinary research and teaching.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty is organized administratively into a Dean of Arts, Associate Dean, and a number of faculty committees, including the committee of the whole. The Dean, as the chief officer and chair of the faculty committee, is responsible for ensuring that the varied duties and responsibilities of the Faculty are carried out. The position of Associate Dean, established in 1966, has been responsible for space allotment, the appointment of sessional staff, the coordination of curriculum development in graduate and undergraduate programs, advice to the Dean on specific matters, and to take the role of Acting Dean when required.<lb/><lb/>The number and composition of faculty standing committees has changed little over time. Those committees which have existed since the inception of the University include Academic Planning, Curriculum, Dean's Advisory, Graduate Studies, and Tenure. The Faculty has also had a number of ad hoc committees, which were numerous during the first developmental years of the Faculty. These included the Departmental Review and Grading committees.</p>

<p>Gordon Merritt Shrum (1896-1985) was a scientist, teacher, administrator, and the first Chancellor of Simon Fraser University.<lb/><lb/>He was born in Smithville, Ontario in 1896. He entered the University of Toronto in 1913 with the intention of becoming a teacher. He joined the Canadian Officers' Training Corps in 1915 and joined the army the following year. After serving in France and receiving the Military Medal, he returned to finish his university studies. He received his BA in 1919, MA in 1921 and PhD in 1923 in physics. His notable achievements included liquefying helium in 1923 and discovering the origin of the auroral green line in the Northern Lights in 1925.<lb/><lb/>Later that year he left Toronto to become professor of physics at the University of British Columbia. Over the next 36 years, he served that institution as an academic and administrator.<lb/><lb/>During his time at UBC, Shrum became a colonel in the COTC, and received the Order of the British Empire during World War II. He was also appointed a director of the BC Research Council in 1944. In 1958, he served as chairman of a royal commission investigating the BC Power Commission. This led to his appointment as Chair of the BC Energy Board in 1959.<lb/><lb/>In 1961, Shrum had to leave UBC because he had reached the compulsory retirement age of 65. He was immediately appointed head of BC Electric (later BC Hydro) by Premier W. A. C. Bennett. In that capacity he was responsible for the Peace River hydro project.<lb/><lb/>Bennett also selected Shrum to create the new university recommended by the Macdonald Report of 1963. Shrum built Simon Fraser University, as it would be named, in 18 months earning it the title of "the Instant University." Shrum served as SFU's first chancellor until June 1969 and continued to head BC Hydro until 1972. In May 1975 he became director of the Vancouver Museum and Planetarium Association and reorganized the museum-planetarium complex at Vanier Park.<lb/><lb/>Now in his eighties, Shrum was approached by Premier Bill Bennett to take charge of the financially-troubled Robson Square Courthouse project. He successfully completed the project and was next asked to develop a trade and convention centre for Vancouver. He stepped down from this project when the federal government took over construction. Gordon Shrum died at the age of 89 in 1985.</p>

<p>The Teaching Support Staff Union is the representative bargaining agent for Teaching Assistants, Tutor Markers, Language Instructors and Sessional Instructors at Simon Fraser University. The union negotiates terms and conditions of work, rates of pay, benefits and grievance procedures in a Collective Agreement with the University.<lb/><lb/>In 1971 graduate students organized the Graduate Student Union, an association that worked to improve teaching and research conditions. The GSU was inactive after 1974 but the discussion it had initiated regarding unionization continued until 1976 when twelve graduate students held a union organizational meeting in September of that year. They proposed affiliation with the Association of University and College Employees (AUCE) rather than the Canadian Union of Public Employees or the University of Toronto based Graduate Assistants' Association. The Teaching Support Staff Union, as it would be named, favored AUCE because of its relative smallness, democratic structure, local autonomy, strong representation of women's employment rights, and the established presence at SFU, since 1974, of AUCE Local 2 for office, clerical and technical staff. Accordingly, the TSSU received its charter as AUCE Local 6 on September 10, 1976.<lb/><lb/>The TSSU took additional steps to establish themselves as a legal entity under the British Columbia Labour Code. By April 1978 the TSSU had signed over 50% of the bargaining unit into the union. It then applied to the Labour Relations Board for a certification vote to make the TSSU the representative body for the bargaining unit. Before the vote could be held, however, the LRB conducted a hearing to define the membership of the bargaining unit, which had been disputed by the University. Following an LRB ruling in TSSU's favor, the certification vote was finally held in November 1978. The vote was positive despite an effort by some Language Assistants to have the LRB exclude them from the bargaining unit and the vote. The LRB certified the union on December 13, 1978.<lb/><lb/>In January 1979 the union began bargaining with the University for a first collective agreement. The TSSU and the University administration negotiated each article individually and resolved impasses through mediation. During negotiations, the TSSU successfully complained to the LRB that the University had violated Section 51 of the Labour Code by withholding an annual pay increase. The first Collective Agreement was signed by both sides on July 1, 1980, and has been renegotiated from time to time.<lb/><lb/>TSSU supported its sister local, AUCE 2, during the latter's strike in 1979. In 1983 and 1984, TSSU joined other campus unions in Operation Solidarity, a province-wide organization opposed to Premier Bennett's Social Credit restraint legislation.<lb/><lb/>TSSU remained as the last independent local of AUCE until the latter's dissolution in the early 1990s. Still functioning as an independent union, TSSU operates under a constitution and bylaws as a membership-driven organization. Union policy, bargaining positions, and the election of union officers and salaried officers are decided by the membership through meetings, mail-in ballots, and referenda. Departmental stewards serve as immediate contacts for TSSU members. In addition, a number of standing committees conduct on-going business and help direct the executive and general membership. Ad hoc committees have functioned from time to time.</p>

<p>The Graduate Student Union (GSU) was active from 1971 to 1974, campaigning on behalf of all SFU graduate students for reasonable fees, income support, office facilities, better representation, and a Graduate Appeals Board; for teaching assistants in particular, it also sought a more advantageous payment system and a training program. It was successful with fees and training as well as some individual grievances, but by early 1974 its limited achievements persuaded the executive to canvas support for a formal, legal unionization of teaching assistants. These efforts came to fruition in 1976 with the establishment of the Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU).</p>

<p>The Society of Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST) was founded in Vancouver BC in 1981 by six women: Mary Vickers, Hilda Ching, Abby Schwarz, Mary Jo Duncan, Diana Herbst, and Maggie Benston. SCWIST is a volunteer non-profit organization incorporated under the BC Societies Act; in 1984 it was registered as a charity under the federal Income Tax Act. It continues as an active organization.<lb/><lb/>SCWIST's mandate is to promote, support and empower women in the fields of science and technology. To this end, the Society works (i) to promote equal opportunities for women in scientific, technological and engineering careers; (ii) to improve social attitudes on the stereotyping of careers in science and educate the public about careers in science and technology; and (iii) to assist educators by providing current information on careers and career training, science and scientific policies. It realizes these goals through the organization of conferences and networking events, delivery of public educational outreach programs, production of resource material (videos, publications and handbooks), liaison with other organizations, and participation in granting, advocacy and advisory bodies.<lb/><lb/>From the six founders in 1981, membership in SCWIST grew rapidly to approximately 160 by 1984; subsequently, membership increased more slowly, reaching approximately 200 by 1993. The Annual General Meeting – held each spring and open to all members of the Society – votes on major decisions and elects the Executive Board of Directors. The Board is headed by the Society's president and meets regularly in Vancouver, while much of the on-going work of SCWIST is carried out by a number of standing and ad hoc committees appointed by the Board. Since 1992 SCWIST has maintained a permanent Resource Centre in Vancouver.<lb/><lb/>Major milestones in SCWIST history include the production of the Registry of Skilled Women, BC and Yukon (1983); the organization of the first National Conference on Women in Science and Technology (1983); the development of the following educational programs: Girls in Science (1984), Ms. Infinity (1990), and Project Tomorrow (1993); the establishment of the SCWIST scholarship (1986)--renamed the Maggie Benston Scholarship in 1991; the opening of a Resource Centre (1992); and the launching of the SCWIST web site (1997).</p>

<p>The Office of Chancellor of S.F.U. was formally established with the appointment of the first officer of the University and first Chancellor, Dr. Gordon M. Shrum, on 9 May 1963. The functions of the Chancellor were laid out in the Universities Act (SBC 1963 c. 52, ss. 11-14; RSBC 1979, c. 419, ss. 11-17), which stated that the chief role of the Chancellor was to confer degrees. The Chancellor was elected by the members of Convocation, and presided as chair of this body. The Chancellor also sat as a member of other bodies, including the Board of Governors and the Senate. The incumbent to this position also represented the University at various events and took on speaking engagements in keeping with the largely ceremonial nature of the office.</p>

<p>The SFU Women's Centre was established in 1974 and continues as of this writing (2009) as an active organization. Funded by the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) as a constituency group, the Women's Centre provides programming, space and volunteer opportunities to self-identified women on campus, and resource information and peer support to women and men.<lb/><lb/>The Women's Centre began in 1974 when a group of women students revived the SFU Women's Caucus (originally established in 1968) and obtained SFSS club status. It opened the Women's Centre that year in a small room in the Rotunda. In 1980 the Centre moved to the Academic Quadrangle, then in 1996 back to the Rotunda (TC3013), doubling its physical space to approximately 1400 square feet.<lb/><lb/>The Centre's organizational structure has evolved over time. The Women's Centre Steering Committee developed out of the Women's Caucus, but by 1977 it had merged with the Women's Centre Collective. The Collective consists of women students who volunteer a set number of hours per week to staff the Centre and remains the decision-making body of the Centre. In 1979-80, the Women's Centre Board was created to formulate policy, promote the Centre, liaise with the university community, locate funding sources, and work closely with the Collective, which continued to be responsible for day-to-day operations and activities. The Board included representatives from SFSS, the Women's Centre Collective, the Women's Studies Department, the Women's Studies Student Union, and female administrative and clerical university staff. By the mid-1980s the Board was meeting irregularly; it was discontinued in 1990, its functions transferred to a newly created part-time paid position of Coordinator, funded by and reporting to the SFSS.<lb/><lb/>The Women's Centre provides a number of services, including a women-only lounge open 24 hours a day, a resource office, peer support, library, kitchen facilities, study carrels, couches and a quiet play area for children in the lounge. Men can access the Centre's library materials, peer support, and referral information.<lb/><lb/>Since its establishment, the Centre has undertaken numerous activities and projects. In cooperation with other campus groups, the Centre promoted the creation of a Women's Studies Department, the institution of a university harassment policy and office, the improvement of campus childcare facilities, and the organization of International Women's Day events, December 6 vigils, and women's self-defense classes.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW) was founded in 1974 as an umbrella group of women's organizations. Its objective was to bring about women's liberation through fundamental social change, providing a provincial network of support, information- and resource-sharing, and coordinated action. Groups joined as affiliate members and were organized into regional units; federation-wide matters were overseen by the Coordinating Collective, several standing committees (Finance, Communications and Convention), and various ad hoc committees established to address specific issues and projects. At the Annual General Convention delegates from each of the regions elected committee members and voted on policy resolutions. The BCFW disbanded in 1989.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Business Administration has its origin in the Department of Economics and Commerce that was established in February 1964 by the Board of Governors. The Department was responsible for promoting research and the development and delivery of economics and commerce programs.<lb/><lb/>In 1968 the Department of Economics and Commerce began offering a Master of Business Administration program (one of the oldest in Canada). In September 1979 the Department underwent a reorganization and was subsumed by the new School of Business Administration and Economics in the Faculty of Arts. The School consisted of the Department of Business Administration and the Department of Economics. Each school had their own chair, faculty and support staff. In November 1981 the School was dissolved into two separate entities. The Department of Economics remained as part of the Faculty of Arts while the Department of Business Administration was restructured as the Faculty of Business Administration, reporting to the Vice-President, Academic. Later, the Faculty established a Dean's External Advisory Board comprised of industry professionals who provide expertise, guidance, and direction in supporting relevant education and research focused on the changing needs of business and the economy. <lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Business Administration offers undergraduate, graduate (MBA), and Ph.D. programs in cooperation with various faculties. Curriculum concentrations include accounting, finance, international business, marketing, management information systems, management and organizational studies, policy analysis, and technology and operations management. The structure of undergraduate program allows students to combine academic studies with cooperative and intern work opportunities, and student exchange agreements are in place with business schools throughout Europe, Asia, and South America. The Faculty also offers non-credit programs at the director, executive and management levels. The undergraduate business program is offered at both the Burnaby and Surrey campuses, while the Segal Graduate School of Business - located in downtown Vancouver - officially opened in May 2006 as the site of the Faculty's MBA and graduate programs. <lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Business Administration is also home to a number of different research institutes and centres that enable faculty to be involved in a range of research activities. In 1990 the W.J. VanDusen B.C. Business Studies Institute was established and funds research on issues relevant to B.C. industry and government and supports an executive-in-residence program and special public lectures. In 2000 the Time Business Centre opened to support research, teaching, and innovation in technology and management partnerships between Simon Fraser university and technology based businesses. In 2005 the CMA Centre for Strategic Change and Performance Management and the CIBC Centre for Corporate Governance and Risk Management opened. As of 2006 corporate support is also being sought for additional research centres including the Centre for Technology and Innovation, the Centre for Building Sustainable Enterprises, and the Centre for Global Asset and Wealth Management.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Business Administration has achieved international accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and, as of 2006, is in the process of acquiring European Quality Improvement System (EFMD Equis) accreditation.</p>

<p>Working Women Unite was formed to create links between working women and the women's movement. The group focused on issues of women and work, and sought to create a relationship with trade unions that would further the position of women in the work force. Specifically, Working Women Unite sought to encourage the formation of women's committees within local unions, discuss strategies on how to organize in a non-union job, articulate feminist demands for working women to take to their unions when negotiating new contracts, and to recognize the value of all women's work regardless of whether it was paid or unpaid. The group also held conferences, workshops, and seminars on issues such as unpaid work, immigrant female workers, women in unions, women working in the home, equal pay for equal work, and the effects of video display terminals in the workplace.<lb/><lb/>Working Women Unite emerged from the British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW) during its convention in 1977. During this convention the lack of representation for working women within the BCFW was addressed by a group of women, primarily members of the Service, Office, and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC), who met and formulated resolutions that were passed at the convention. It was not until 1978 that the group gained momentum with a broader base of support. Women from unions such as the British Columbia Government Employees Union (BCGEU), Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), SORWUC, Letter Carriers Union of Canada (LCUC), and Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), along with non-unionized women, and women in the home, became involved with the group. Structurally, Working Women Unite remained within the BCFW, a federation of women's groups in British Columbia working toward liberation of women through fundamental social change.</p>

<p>Robert F. Harrison is one of the key contributors to the architecture of Simon Fraser University. His firm was responsible for designing and building the WAC Bennett library according to design specifications outlined by Erickson and Massey (the architects responsible for the overall design of the university). Harrison's firm also designed and built the Academic Services building, and made later alterations to it and to other buildings on campus.<lb/><lb/>Robert Harrison was born in Vancouver in 1925. He became a registered architect in 1954, and became the Registrar of the Architectural Institute of British Columbia in 1961. Later, Harrison was made Chair of the Institute's Examining Board (circa 1964). In 1963 Harrison submitted an entry to the contest to design the new university that would be built on top of Burnaby Mountain. His design finished 4th place. According to the contest parameters, the top five winners would each be given a contract to build a section of the campus according to the winner's overall design. Harrison took Erickson and Massey's basic outline for the library, and expanded it to reflect his own ideas. After the first phase of building, Harrison designed a new administration building in keeping with the architectural character of the university. He also made alterations to the Academic Quadrangle, designed later additions to the library, and made alterations to other buildings at Simon Fraser University.</p>

<p>W. Randle Iredale is one of the contributors to the architecture of Simon Fraser University. He and his partner, William R. Rhone, were responsible for designing and building the Science Complex according to design specifications outlined by Erickson and Massey (the architects responsible for the overall design of the university). Rhone and Iredale built the Science Complex in three phases based on preliminary drawings by Erickson and Massey, but added their own ideas and innovations to the building.<lb/><lb/>Iredale was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1929. In 1955 he received a degree in architecture from the University of British Columbia, and went to work for McCarter and Nairne until Iredale was registered in 1957. He had his own practice from 1957 to 1959, and then formed a partnership with William R. Rhone. In 1963 Rhone and Iredale submitted an entry to the contest to design the new university that would be built on top of Burnaby Mountain. Their design finished in second place. According to the contest parameters, the top five winners would each be given a contract to build a section of the campus according to the winner's overall design. Originally, Rhone and Iredale chose the Academic Quadrangle, but changed their minds and picked the Science Complex, which Chancellor Gordon Shrum had assured them would be expanded on a regular basis. The Science Complex was built in three phases between 1964 and 1971: Phase I was substantially completed by August 1, 1965, Phase II was completed September 7, 1966 and Phase III was completed in 1971. Rhone and Iredale also designed and built the student pub, circa 1970.</p>

<p>The position of Director of Academic Planning (also referred to as the Academic Planner) was created by President McTaggart-Cowan in 1963 in order to help plan, organize, and formulate policies on the academic activities of the University. Duties of the director included providing assistance to the President, the Senate, and the Board of Governors in making decisions as to the format of the academic year to be adopted by SFU (e.g., a semester system versus a term year system); the organization of University faculties (including making decisions as to which faculties were to be included in the University); the planning of University academic priorities in relation to programs offered by other universities in the community; the setting of admissions policies; the establishment of student study formats (such as sizes of lectures and tutorials, and grading standards); the formulation of policies regarding academic staff; and the formulation of expansion plans for the University. The Academic Planner reported to the Vice-President, Academic, until the position of Academic Planner was eliminated in 1974.<lb/><lb/>On November 14, 1963, the University hired its first Director of Academic Planning, Ronald James Baker, who assumed his duties on January 1, 1964. On December 10 of that year he also became the head of SFU's English department. He served in these positions until 1969, when he left SFU to become President of the University of Prince Edward Island. At that time, John Chase took over duties as Academic Planner. Chase left the position in 1974 to become Director of Institutional Studies (now Analytical Studies) for SFU.</p>

<p>The Department of Archaeology was originally established in 1965 as a program area within the Department of Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology (P.S.A.). In 1969, the Department was removed from P.S.A. to become an independent unit within the Faculty of Arts. In 1971, it became a full Department. The Department is responsible, through its Chair, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the field of Archaeology. The Department is involved in interdisciplinary programs both within the University and with external bodies, including the Institute for Quaternary Research (IQR) and Continuing Studies and Distance Education programs.<lb/><lb/>The Department is organized administratively into a Chair, Departmental Assistant, and a number of standing committees. The Chair is the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities include the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments, and representation of the Department to external bodies, including the Faculty, Senate and Board of Governors. The Chair reports directly to the Dean of Arts. The Departmental Assistant is responsible for much of the day-to-day administration and the management of the departmental budget, the scheduling of courses, the provision of liaison with administrative offices, and advising students. The Department also comprises the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and the Radiocarbon Laboratory. The Museum Curator and Laboratory Manager reports directly to the Chair of the Department, who is the Director of each of these units and is therefore responsible for fiscal, administrative, and academic matters pertaining to them. <lb/><lb/>The number and composition of departmental committees varied greatly over time. Long-standing committees include Appointments, Graduate Studies, Undergraduate Curriculum, and Tenure. There is also departmental representation on faculty and university committees, including the Faculty of Arts Curriculum committee and the University's Articulation committee. The Department also struck ad hoc committees, such as the Chairman's Search Committee, when required.</p>

<p>Preparations for a University Library began in 1964 with the hiring of Donald Baird as University Librarian. The Burnaby campus was still under construction so the Library was set up in Vancouver at the BC Tel Building on Wylie Street under the Cambie Street Bridge. Baird began by obtaining copies of library book lists developed by new state universities in California and they served as the basis for SFU's collection. By the fall of 1965, the Library had 42 employees (12 of whom were librarians) who had catalogued and prepared 13,000 volumes for the new Library.<lb/> <lb/>When the Library opened in September 1965 it served as a multi-purpose building with tenants that included administrative departments along with the Registrar's Office and the Office of the President. The first phase of the Library had 5 floors - the subject divisions were decentralized by floors and each floor had its own specialized subject information staff.<lb/><lb/>The earliest organization of the Library included a Processing Division and three Collections Divisions - Humanities, Social Sciences, and Sciences. By 1966 the Processing Division grew to five sections: Searching, Acquisitions, Cataloguing, Serials, and Government Publications and the Collections Division increased to four sections: Bibliographic Services, the Social Science Collection, the Humanities Collection, and the Science Collection. Two Assistant University Librarians were hired to oversee the Processing Division and the Collections Division and they reported to the University Librarian, who in turn, reported directly to the President until 1970. The Library also promoted an emphasis on automation that resulted in the formation of the (Information) Systems Division. In 1966, the University's Audio-Visual Services began in the Library.<lb/><lb/>The 1970s were a time of administrative and operational growth for the Library. During this time (1970-1979), the University Librarian reported to the Vice-President, Academic. By 1970 there were four Assistant Librarians, each heading a division – Processing, Collections, Information Systems, and the Audio Visual Centre. In late 1970 an ad hoc committee met to examine the concept of Special Collections and Archives that had been steadily growing as part of the Library's holdings. The Archives, established in 1968, functioned within the Special Collections Division of the Library. Various members of the library staff carried out archival duties. By the end of 1971 the university's administrative offices had moved out of the Library and the Library took on the operating responsibility for the University Bookstore. In 1973 the Audio Visual Centre moved out of the Library and in 1974, the Information Systems Division was replaced by the Planning and Budgeting Division. By 1978, the University Archives had become a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. That same year Baird retired as University Librarian and became University Archivist, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1990. Theodore (Ted) Dobb, previously serving as Deputy Librarian, was appointed the new University Librarian.<lb/><lb/>From 1979 until 1985, the University Librarian reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic. In 1982 the Library was renamed the W.A.C. Bennett Library in recognition of the strong role that Bennett, former Premier of B.C., had in the creation of SFU. In 1985, the Library added a Reference Division and the Collections Division was renamed the Collections Management Office. From 1985 to 1990, Dobb reported to the Vice-President, Research and Information Systems. In 1990, the Librarian was again reporting directly to the Vice-President, Academic until 1994. That year, Paul Baldwin was appointed Associate Librarian, a position he held until 2002.<lb/><lb/>By 1991, the Library had grown to ten Divisions: Reference, Monographs, Collections Management, Serials, Loans, Systems, Support Services, Building, Belzberg Library, and the Bookstore. The heads of these divisions, as well as an Associate Librarian and Library Secretary reported to the University Librarian. In 1994, the Librarian began reporting directly to the renamed Vice-President, Research. <lb/><lb/>In 1998 Lynn Copeland replaced Ted Dobb as the new University Librarian. In 2005, Copeland was reappointed as University Librarian and Dean of Library Services.</p>

<p>Donald Baird, SFU's University Librarian, was one of the driving forces behind the formation of the Tri Universities Library (TRIUL) consortium between SFU, the University of British Columbia and the University of Victoria. It informally grew to include all publicly funded libraries in the province. Under the auspices of TRIUL, libraries in B.C. came together to cooperate in the establishment of the British Columbia Union Catalogue (BCUC) and promote other cost saving initiatives for library processing and cataloguing divisions.</p>

<p>The University Archives acquires, preserves and makes available three categories of materials: (1) the official records of the University, including those created by the Board of Governors, Senate, University committees, faculties, departments and administrative offices; (2) materials documenting the wider University community; and (3) historical research collections that promote the teaching and research activities of the University.<lb/><lb/>The Archives was established within the University Library in 1968 when librarian Liisa Fagerlund was appointed University Archivist on a half-time basis. She continued in this post until 1975 when she left the University. From 1975 to 1978, the Archives functioned within the Special Collections division of the Library. Archival duties were carried out by various library staff members. In 1978, the University Archives was established as a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. Donald Baird, recently retired as University Librarian, became University Archivist and held this position until his retirement in 1990. Jim Ross served as University Archivist from 1991 to 1993, and was succeeded by Ian Forsyth in 1994.<lb/><lb/>When the Archives was a function of the University Library, the University Archivist reported to the University Librarian. When the Archives was established as a separate administrative unit, the University Archivist reported directly to the University President. The reporting structure changed in 1986 when the University Archivist reported to the Vice-President, Research/Information Systems; in 1990, when the University Archivist reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic; and in 1996, when the University Archivist reported to the Registrar/Dean of Students.</p>

<p>Institutional Research and Planning compiles, analyzes, and reports on information regarding Simon Fraser University, such as enrollment and attrition, faculty salaries, course grades, instructional activities, facilities, and other matters. The office also analyzes phenomena of interest to university administration, faculty, and students, such as employment demand and various economic circumstances. The office also produces a yearly Fact Book, containing information on various aspects of SFU activities. <lb/><lb/>Until 1974, statistics and other data were collected by the Academic Planner, the Bursar, and the Registrar. In that year the position of Academic Planner was eliminated and the incumbent, John Chase, was named the first Director of Institutional Studies. In 1975, the name of the office was changed from Institutional Studies to Analytical Studies. In 1981, the Director's position was renamed Executive Assistant to the President/Director (Analytical Studies). By 1984, the name of the position was changed back to Director of Analytical Studies, and the position was then filled by Dr. Walter Wattamaniuk. In 2007 the name of the office was changed to Institutional Research and Planning.<lb/><lb/>From 1974 to 1984, the office reported directly to the President. By 1986, the office began reporting to the Vice-President, Academic.</p>

<p>The Office of University Advancement is responsible for fund raising initiatives to support the university's teaching, research, and service objectives.<lb/><lb/>Organized fund raising activities began at SFU in 1966, when the Resources Office was established. This office was responsible for following up pledges to the Three Universities Capital Fund, which had been established in 1963. The Resources Office was also responsible for establishing and developing new, permanent fund raising programs. Originally, the Resources Office reported directly to the University President. In 1971, the office of Vice-President, Development (later renamed Vice-President, University Services) was created, which then took on responsibility for the Resources Office. In 1977, the position of Vice-President, University Services was eliminated, and the Resources Office again reported directly to the President. <lb/><lb/>In 1982 the Resources Office was renamed Development Office and reported to the newly-created Vice-President, University Development and Extension. In 1988, the Director of Development began reporting to the Vice-President, Harbour Centre. In 2000 the office was renamed University Advancement.<lb/><lb/>The Office of University Advancement has close ties with the SFU Alumni Association, which was founded by SFU graduates in 1969, and which provides programs and services to assist SFU and its graduates. The Association is a registered nonprofit society governed by an elected board of volunteers. The Alumni Relations Office provides administrative support for all Association activities. It also publishes the Alumni Journal, maintains alumni records, and serves as the main point of contact for alumni on the SFU campus. From 1971 to 1972, this office reported to the Director of Resources. From 1973 to 1975, the office reported directly to the Vice-President, University Services, but still maintained close ties to the Resources Office. From 1977 to 1984, the office was again made a responsibility of the Director of Resources (also referred to as the Director of Development). By 1986, the Alumni Relations Office reported directly to the Vice-President, University Development and Extension, but was still linked to the Development Office. In 1988, the Director of Alumni Relations began reporting to the Vice-President, Harbour Centre.<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>W.A.C. (William Andrew Cecil) Bennett (1900-1979), also known as Cecil or Cece, was a businessman and politician. He was the Premier of British Columbia from 1952-1972.<lb/><lb/>The youngest of five children, Bennett was born on September 6, 1900 in Hastings, Albert County, New Brunswick to parents Andrew Havelock Bennett and Emma Burns Bennett. He was raised Presbyterian, and maintained a strong affiliation with the church throughout his life.<lb/><lb/>In 1901, the family moved to Hampton, New Brunswick, where Bennett received his early education. In 1915, the family moved to Saint John, where Bennett attended high school. While in school, Bennett worked part time for Robertson, Foster, and Smith’s, a local hardware firm. In grade 9, Bennett left school to work full time at the hardware store, working in most of the store’s departments.<lb/><lb/>At the age of 18, Bennett moved to Edmonton, Alberta, where he worked for Marshall Wells, a large wholesale hardware firm (1919). He was quickly promoted up the ranks, eventually becoming assistant sales manager.<lb/><lb/>While in Edmonton, Bennett took correspondence courses in such subjects as accounting, business management, business law, economics, and commerce.<lb/><lb/>On February 19, 1927, Bennett, in partnership with Joe Renaud, purchased a hardware and furniture store in Westlock, Alberta. In 1928, they opened a second store in nearby Clyde, Alberta.<lb/><lb/>On July 11, 1927, Bennett married Annie “May” Elizabeth May Richards. Bennett and May had three children, Mary “Anita” (1928), Russell “R.J.” James (1929), and William “Bill” Richards (1932).<lb/><lb/>Bennett sold his share of the Westlock and Clyde stores to Renaud in 1930 and moved his family to Kelowna, British Columbia, where he bought Leckie Hardware. On January 15, 1932, he opened McEwan &amp; Bennett Hardware in Vernon, BC. That same year, he also helped established Domestic Wine By-Products Ltd., now known as Calona Vineyards, with partners Pasquale Capozzi and Giuseppe Ghezzi.<lb/><lb/>Bennett was elected President of the Kelowna Board of Trade in 1937, and served until 1939. In 1937, he also ran, unsuccessfully, for nomination as South Okanagan candidate for the provincial Conservative Party. In 1941 he ran again, and was elected Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for South Okanagan on October 21. Bennett was also a member of the Post-War Rehabilitation Council (1942-1946).<lb/><lb/>Bennett was active in local charities, including fundraising efforts for the Salvation Army’s Red Shield Home Front Appeal and as President of the Kelowna branch of the Red Cross Society.<lb/><lb/>In 1946, Bennett ran for leadership of the provincial Conservative Party, but was defeated by Herbert Anscomb. Bennett maintained his seat in South Okanagan until May 13, 1948, when he resigned to run as a federal Conservative candidate in the riding of Yale. He was defeated in the May 31 federal election, but was re-elected MLA for South Okanagan the following month. In 1950 he ran again for leadership of the provincial Conservative Party, but was defeated again by Anscomb.<lb/><lb/>During this time, Bennett was involved in two additional political endeavours: trying to create a Coalition Party in BC, and also attempting to reform the election system with the Transferable Voting system, in which voters could rank candidates into their first, second, third, and fourth choices.<lb/><lb/>On March 14, 1951, Bennett crossed the floor of the House to become an Independent Member. Later that year, he joined BC’s Social Credit League. He was re-elected in his riding as a Social Credit MLA on June 12, 1952, an election in which the Social Credit League of BC won a minority government. Bennett was then elected leader of the Social Credit League on July 15, and sworn in as Premier of British Columbia on August 1. This provincial election featured the Transferable Voting system which Bennett had championed. Later that year, Bennett was also made Freeman of the City of Kelowna (December 9, 1952).<lb/><lb/>On June 9, 1953, the Social Credit government was re-elected with a majority. The following year, Bennett was made Minister of Finance in conjunction with his position as Premier. In 1956, the Social Credit government was re-elected, and in 1959, Bennett and the government announced that British Columbia was free of debt.<lb/><lb/>The Social Credit government stayed in power, with Bennett at its helm, until 1972. Bennett’s government oversaw numerous infrastructure projects including road and bridge development and the expansion of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway (now British Columbia Railway Company), 1956-1958; establishment of what would become Canada’s largest ferry fleet, the British Columbia Toll Authority Ferry System (now BC Ferries), 1958; formation of B.C. Hydro and Power Authority, 1962; creation of the Bank of British Columbia, 1966 (later acquired by the Hong Kong Bank of Canada); and construction of two large-scale hydroelectric dams on the Peace and Columbia Rivers (W.A.C. Bennett and Duncan dams), 1967.<lb/><lb/>Bennett also oversaw the development of post-secondary education institutions in BC, including the establishment of British Columbia Institute of Technology (1962), University of Victoria (1963), and Simon Fraser University (1965). He was awarded an honourary Doctorate of Laws at the opening ceremonies of Simon Fraser University on September 9, 1965. SFU also named its library after Bennett in 1982.<lb/><lb/>On September 15, 1972, the Social Credit government was defeated by Dave Barrett’s provincial New Democratic Party. Bennett, who had been the longest-serving premier in BC history, was re-elected in his riding, and became the leader of the Opposition. On June 5, 1973, he resigned as South Okanagan’s MLA; his son, William “Bill” R. Bennett, won the riding in a by-election on September 7. Bennett retired as leader of the Social Credit party on November 15, and Bill was elected leader of the party on November 24. In 1975, the Social Credit party was re-elected with a majority, making Bill Bennett premier.<lb/><lb/>In 1976, W.A.C. Bennett was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He died in Kelowna on February 23, 1979.</p>

<p>The Association of Canadian Publishers (ACP) has its origins in the 'Emergency Committee of Canadian Publishers', formed in Toronto in November 1970 to protest against the sale of Ryerson Press to an American-owned company. In the following months the group worked under the name of the 'interim Council of Canadian Publishers' while the permanent association was being organized. During this time a brief was presented to the federal government discussing the problems facing the Canadian book publishing industry. A founding meeting on February 19th and 20th, 1971 brought together the charter members of the new association (Appendix A).<lb/><lb/>At the first general meeting, held in late April 1971, the name 'Independent Publishers Association' (IPA) was adopted and an executive was elected (Appendix B). The constitution outlined that the first objective of the IPA was "to work for the maintenance of strong competitive book publishing houses owned and controlled in Canada" and Active membership was limited to Canadian firms which had published a minimum of 5 original Canadian titles. Associate membership was available to those that supported the IPA's objectives but did not meet the titles' criteria. The Executive in accordance with policies laid down by the general membership governed the Association on a day-to-day basis. Three committees were created at the first general meeting: Government Relations, Educational Publishing and Co-operative Promotion (Appendix C).<lb/><lb/>The IPA obtained funding from the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council. It operated through the offices of the Book Society and House of Anansi until acquiring its own office in Toronto in 1972. The Association hired its first Executive Director, Paul Audley, in January 1974, to work with 3 staff members. By 1974 the IPA had 40 Active members and 32 Associate members.<lb/><lb/>In addition to the issue of foreign ownership, some of the particular concerns of IPA members during this period were a lack of awareness of Canadian titles amongst the general public; the shortage of government funding; American dominance of the mass-market paperback and educational publishing fields; the disadvantages faced by small publishers in matching the sales force, warehousing and fulfillment operations of the large foreign subsidiaries; and an alarming increase in the price of paper. Researching these problems and designing co-operative strategies to overcome them was the focus of much of the IPA staff and executive's time and effort.<lb/><lb/>A federal government policy on book publishing was announced in early 1972 and the IPA participated in instituting two of the new programs. The Association for the Export of Canadian Books (AECB), funded by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, sent Canadian representatives and books to foreign book fairs and established promotional agencies, known as Books Canada, in New York, London and Paris. The Book Purchase Program involved the purchase of Canadian titles by the Canada Council for distribution to Canadian consulates and libraries around the world. In later years the book kits were sent to small Canadian libraries. The IPA administered the warehousing and shipping of the selected titles.<lb/><lb/>Canadabooks, established by the IPA in 1974, grew out of the Canadian Educational Resources Project. It was a co-operative marketing organization providing promotional services to members who paid a commission on their reported sales to educational markets. The same year Canadian Basic Books evolved out of a trial project called Backlist. The program aimed to increase the stock of proven Canadian past sellers in bookstores. The Canadian Book Information Centre, earlier known as the Promotion and Information Centre, assumed responsibility for the ambitious display and book promotion activities of the IPA. Each of these programs was open to all Canadian-owned publishers, regardless of their membership in the IPA. The Canadian Publishers Project Co-ordinating Committee, which included non-IPA publishers, oversaw their development and funding while a project manager was responsible for the operation of each.<lb/><lb/>Beginning in 1974 with the formation of the BC Publishers Group, regional and special interest publishers began to organize to pursue common goals. The Literary Press Group was established in February 1975 with affiliate status and administrative assistance of the IPA. The Music Publishers Group formed in 1974. The Alberta Publishers and Atlantic Publishers Associations were created in 1975 and 1976.<lb/><lb/>Dissatisfied with government response to their concerns, IPA members had pursued for some time the formation of an umbrella organization to accommodate all the associations concerned with the book trade in Canada. The Book and Periodical Development Council, founded in January 1975, joined together the IPA, Canadian Periodical Publishers Association, Canadian Booksellers Association, Canadian Library Association, Periodical Distributors of Canada and the Writers Union in order to present a united front in lobbying the federal government, and to provide a structure for developing common policies in the industry. Paul Audley served as the BPDC Acting Director while Arden Ford became Assistant Director of the IPA.<lb/><lb/>In early 1976 a number of major firms which had maintained membership in both the IPA and the Canadian Book Publishers Council (CBPC) withdrew from the CBPC. Wishing to assert a new identity as the major trade organization of Canadian-owned firms, the IPA changed its name to the Association of Canadian Publishers, incorporated as a no-share capital corporation and altered the Association's objectives to encourage firstly the "writing, publishing, distribution and promotion of books written by Canadian authors." The ACP placed increased emphasis on promoting Canadian books abroad and began a series of professional development seminars for members.<lb/><lb/>It was perceived that the rapid growth of the IPA had resulted in an unwieldy structure and at the 1976 annual meeting, a new structure was adopted with three additional vice-presidents to oversee the various committees and projects. Another restructuring occurred in 1978 and the ACP Council returned to the format of an executive supplemented by committee chairs.<lb/><lb/>Paul Audley left the ACP in 1977 and was replaced by Arden Ford as Administrative Director while Patsy Aldana filled the role of Executive Director. In 1980 Phyllis Yaffe became Executive Director and Jane Springer replaced Libby Oughton as Associate Director. By the spring of 1980 the ACP had 70 Active members and 48 Associate members.</p>

<p>The Halpern Family fonds consists of the personal archives of five members of the Halpern family: Simon (1865-1939) and Rosalie (1875-1951) Halpern; their daughter Fanny Halpern (1899-1952), a psychiatrist; their son George Halpern (1902-1989), a businessman and philanthropist; and his wife Ida Halpern (1910-1987), a noted ethnomusicologist.<lb/><lb/>Simon Halpern was born on June 6, 1865. He was a Surgeon-General in the Austrian Army. He died in 1939. Simon’s wife Rosalie Halpern (nee Salkind) was born on November 19, 1875, in Kremenczuk, Russia. She died in Shanghai, China, on June 26, 1951.<lb/><lb/>Fanny Gisela Halpern was born August 1, 1899 in Krakow, Poland. After graduating in medicine from the University of Vienna in 1924, she worked in various clinics in that city. Her interest in neurology and psychiatry led her to study with Professor Wagner-Jauregg, who had received the Nobel Prize for developing the malarial treatment of syphilis.<lb/><lb/>Fanny was invited to China in November 1933 to teach at the Medical College of China in Shanghai. She later taught at Shanghai’s St. John's University and Women's Christian Medical College. In 1935 she organized China's first modern psychiatric hospital, Shanghai Mercy Hospital for Nervous Diseases. She became the hospital's medical director, while at the same time serving as a consultant to several other medical institutions.<lb/><lb/>Fanny founded the first Committee on Psychiatry in China. She also established a Committee on Mental Hygiene in Shanghai, which became the Mental Hygiene Association of that city. The group consisted mainly of volunteers who worked in mental hygiene and child guidance clinics. She wrote many articles on psychiatry and neurology and presented papers at scientific meetings in Europe and China.<lb/><lb/>For much of her time in Shanghai, Fanny shared her life and home with her mother, Rosalie, who joined her there after Simon's death in 1939. Shortly after her mother passed away in 1951, Fanny moved to Vancouver to be near her brother, George, and his wife, Ida. Fanny Halpern died on June 26, 1952.<lb/><lb/>George Robert Halpern was born in Krakow, Poland on May 11, 1902. In 1936 he married Ida (nee Ruhdörfer), who was born on July 17, 1910, in Vienna, Austria, to Heinrich and Sabine Ruhdörfer.<lb/><lb/>George Halpern had a Ph.D. in chemistry, and as a research chemist, developed a number of pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations that were manufactured in Vienna and later in Italy (1936-1937) after he established a factory there. Halpern's medicines, with such names as "gelamon" and "jonojod," were advertised for the treatment of various illnesses including asthma, rheumatism, atherosclerosis, and syphilis. Halpern's cosmetic products included skin creams and hair tonics.<lb/><lb/>Once Ida received her doctorate in music in July 1938, she and George decided to leave Vienna. That October they moved to Shanghai to be with George's sister Fanny. While there, Ida taught music history at the University of Shanghai. George considered opening a pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai as well, but instead in 1939 he and Ida left for Canada.<lb/><lb/>Arriving in Vancouver in August, the Halperns were initially placed under a deportation order. They succeeded in gaining landed immigrant status through the intervention of R.D. Murray, manager of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China located in Shanghai. Murray offered financial guarantees regarding Halpern's proposed business enterprises.<lb/><lb/>George hoped to manufacture cosmetics in Vancouver, but was discouraged by George Cunningham, the owner of the city's largest drugstore chain, who told George that his stores only dealt with nationally advertised products. Instead, after inventing chocolate-covered cod-liver oil pills for children, George established his own company, Dr. G. Halpern (Vienna) Laboratories, which manufactured the product for a short time (ca. 1939-1941).<lb/><lb/>In May 1941 George joined the Canadian Fishing Company as a research chemist. His role was to develop products, such as vitamin oils and poultry feed, that could be manufactured from fish. Halpern also joined a professional association, the Chemical Institute of Canada, and became chairman of its Vancouver section. In 1953, the Canadian Fishing Company’s management curtailed its research activities, and Halpern had to seek other employment. In 1954, he opened his own business, G.R. Chemicals, Ltd., which manufactured "Ply-O-Seal" plastic patching compounds for the plywood industry.<lb/><lb/>In 1969, George sold the assets of G.R. Chemicals to the H.B. Fuller Company (Canada) Ltd. He then formed a new company, G.R. Chemicals (1969), Ltd., an investment business which owned some property and whose principal income came from interest and rent. This business existed until 1986.<lb/><lb/>Ida taught music lessons in the Halperns’ home and also lectured in music appreciation and later in ethnomusicology at UBC. In 1947 she began recording the music of First Nations peoples of the Pacific Northwest, being one of the first to study the subject. In 1948 she helped found, and was first president of, the Friends of Chamber Music in Vancouver. Ida wrote numerous articles and a few books on First Nations music, and also published some sound recordings.<lb/><lb/>Both George and Ida Halpern were noted benefactors to two of British Columbia's universities, the University of Victoria, and Simon Fraser University (SFU). They were convocation founders of SFU in 1965, and their financial support enabled the construction of the George and Ida Halpern Centre at that institution. George was present at the Halpern Centre's official opening on May 24, 1989. As well, the Halperns donated several important paintings to SFU.<lb/><lb/>Ida was awarded an honourary doctorate from SFU in 1978, and was made a Member of the Order of Canada in the same year. She continued to lecture, and to consult on First Nations music for films and other productions. In 1986, the University of Victoria also awarded her an honourary doctorate. Ida died in Vancouver on February 7, 1987.<lb/><lb/>During his later years, George played a broad role in community activities. He served as President of Brock House, a community centre for senior citizens, which he helped to establish, in 1974, in a local heritage building. He and Ida both served on its board of directors for a number of years. He was also elected a member of the Dunbar-West Point Grey-Southlands Community Resources Board in 1973. The Board promoted the general well being of seniors in the area through such projects as the seniors' housing complex at Fourth Avenue and Wallace Street. George Halpern died in Vancouver on November 28, 1989.</p>

<p>The East Enders Society was a private social service group which worked to aid women in Vancouver's East Side neighbourhoods from 1965 to 1993.<lb/><lb/>The group was initiated by Mrs. May Gutteridge, a social worker at St. James Anglican Church in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. In 1964, at the request of Anglican Bishop Godfrey Gower, she extended her work to include assisting native women in the courts. Through this work she saw a need for a women's hostel in Vancouver's East End. The East Enders Society was then established to provide this hostel and other services. The Society was incorporated March 24, 1965, with early members including Mrs. M. Gutteridge, Mrs. M. White, Mrs. S. Ainsworth, Miss P. Dale, Mrs. K. Arens, Mrs. M. Beckett, Miss D. Oikawa. To raise funds for the Society, a "Dollar Club" was formed, in which members contributed one dollar each month towards the Society. The East Enders were also assisted by Mary Southin (a lawyer who provided free legal advice), the United Church Women, the Anglican Church Women's Auxiliary, the Soroptomists, the Fresco Club, and various Lions Clubs. A donation of $10,000 was also received from two anonymous women from the United Church, which went toward the purchase of a rooming house at 883 East Hastings. The rooming house was refurbished and opened as a hostel in May 1965, with Mrs. Margaret White hired as matron to live at the hostel full-time. The hostel provided temporary shelter for a number of women in the Downtown Eastside. Often, women charged with drunkenness and vagrancy would be given suspended sentences, on the condition that they go to the East Enders hostel. The Society also received a monthly grant from the provincial government to hire a social worker to assist women arriving at the hostel. This hostel (sometimes referred to as the Lodge) operated for five years, then moved to 1656 East 4th Avenue, when the Hastings Street building was demolished as part of an urban renewal program. This second lodge was later sold in the mid-1970s to the Mental Patients Association, who operated it as a halfway house.<lb/><lb/>To meet the social needs of women in the area, a Women's Centre was opened at 342 East Hastings Street in 1967. The Centre provided typewriters, sewing machines, steam irons, hair washing and drying facilities, a television, a radio, a turntable, and children's toys and games. Volunteers at the Centre served tea daily, held monthly birthday parties and sponsored demonstrations and talks. This Centre later moved to 217 Dunlevy Avenue, and eventually closed in the mid-1970s.<lb/><lb/>By 1970, several other hostels were operating in the Downtown Eastside area, and social services agencies from the City of Vancouver began to request that the hostel accept long-term guests. As a result, in 1971, the hostel began taking in women who had been discharged from hospitals, but were not yet ready to live on their own.<lb/><lb/>By 1971, the Society saw a need for low-income housing for women, and began to press for the provision of such housing. In 1972, it worked to have women included in Oppenheimer Lodge (a senior citizens' housing project built by the City of Vancouver). It also assisted in the planning of other housing projects for low income women (Bauer Villa and Adanac Place). In 1974, members of the East Enders Society joined with members of the Amherst Lions Society to form the “East-Enders Amherst Lions Housing Society” to work toward providing affordable housing for senior citizens. This Society then obtained property on 3433 Renfrew St. (between 18th and 19th Avenues), where they constructed Renfrew Park Manor, a 41-unit senior citizens housing development. In the late 1970s, the Society became involved in the Franklin House Society to purchase and refurbish a vacant apartment building on 1721 Franklin Street. Two members of the East Enders Society (Margaret Davies and Mary Kelly) were executive members of the Franklin House Society, and the East Enders provided many furnishings and appliances for the building.<lb/><lb/>During the 1970s, income generated by term deposits allowed the Society to support various agencies providing housing and other services to low income women. By 1978, the Society was donating money to agencies such as Powell Place, the Y.W.C.A., Charlsford House, the Makwalla Native Women's Association, T.R.A.C.Y. (Taking Responsible Action for Children and Youth), and others.<lb/><lb/>In the 1990s, the Society began to discuss its own dissolution, and plan for distributing its assets. After accepting proposals and discussing various distribution plans, the Society was presented with a request by the Owl House Society (later renamed the Vi Fineday House Society) for financial assistance to install a $22,000 sprinkler system in the house they had just purchased for use as a shelter. The East Enders Society eventually covered the entire cost of this system, which totaled $26,827.05. Early in 1993, the Society received a proposal from the Kettle Society for a service centre for women with mental health disabilities, and it was decided that the majority of the remaining assets would go to this group. Smaller donations from the group's assets were made to Charlsford House, Children's Foundation, First United Church, St. James Anglican Church, and the Sisters of the Atonement. On October 7, 1993, the Society applied for dissolution under the Societies Act, and was formally dissolved on March 4, 1994.</p>

<p>The Department of Biological Sciences was established in 1965 as a department in the Faculty of Science. From its inception, the department offered a broad curriculum leading to B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees. The overall mission of the Department was to provide instruction in Biology and, by research, to increase the knowledge base in Biological Sciences. This mission encapsulated four broad areas of responsibility: to provide broad-based undergraduate instruction in modern biology; to provide graduate training leading to Master of Pest Management (M.P.M.), M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees; to provide a work environment and facilities for faculty, researchers, and graduate students; and to provide for expansion and development of research and graduate training and to foster the development of intra- and interdepartmental Centres and Institutes designed to promote collaborative research and training. With the opening of the Pestology Centre in 1967, it began its specialization in pest management and the role of nurturing an international centre for excellence in research and teaching in the field. <lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by the Chair and two standing committees: Departmental Undergraduate Curriculum Committee (DUCC) and the Departmental Graduate Studies Committee (DGSC). The Chair was responsible for the overall administration of the Department, including the operational budget, faculty tenure and salary recommendations, teaching assignments and representation of the Department. The DUCC was responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the undergraduate program. The DGSC was responsible for graduate admission recommendations, monitoring the progress of graduate students, and developing criteria and methodology for student evaluation for purposes of scholarships. By 1990, two further committees had been added: the Departmental Tenure Committee and the Committee on Space. The Departmental Assistant and Lab Coordinator were responsible for much of day-to-day administration of the Department. The Departmental Assistant reported to the Chair, who in turn reported to the Dean of Science. The Pestology Centre, renamed the Centre for Pest Management in the 1980s, was headed by a Director, who was responsible for the planning and development of programs within the Centre and the promotion of external relations. The Director was also actively involved in a number of international organizations for biological control and entomological research. The Director reported to the Department Chair.<lb/><lb/>The Department was involved in or associated with university interdisciplinary research institutes which conducted both research and instruction. These included the Centre for Pest Management and the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (IMBB). The IMBB was established in 1987 as an interdisciplinary graduate research institute, and its members held appointments in Biological Sciences and/or Chemistry. The Department was also affiliated with several bodies responsible for research. These research groups included the Behavioural Ecology Research Group (BERG), the Chemical Ecology Research Group (CERG), the Institute of Aquaculture Research (IAR), the Institute of Quaternary Research (IQR), the R.H. Wright Institute for Sensory Science (WISS), and the Western Canadian Universities Marine Biological Society (WCUMBS).<lb/><lb/>From its inception the department expanded greatly in terms of the size of its faculty and the number of programs offered. In 1965, the department consisted of six faculty, and increased to thirty by 1969 and forty by 1994. A significant addition to its program offerings was the establishment in 1973 of the Master of Pest Management degree program.<lb/><lb/>The first Director of the Centre for Pest Management was Dr. Bryan P. Beirne, who served until 1980. In 1986, Dr. J.P. Manfred Mackauer became the new Director, and he was succeeded by Dr. Zamir Punja in 1993.</p>

<p>When Simon Fraser University opened in 1965, it established a Physical Development Centre in the Faculty of Education. This Centre included Physical Development Studies, which was first chaired by Dr. Glen Kirchner. This unit was physically located on the top of the gymnasium complex with laboratories in the gymnasium and across campus.<lb/><lb/>In September 1967, SFU instituted the degree of Bachelor of Science (Kinesiology) intended for students interested in becoming physical education specialists, or pursuing graduate studies and research. It was the first interdisciplinary program in this field to be offered in North America.<lb/><lb/>The Department of Physical Studies was split in 1970, when those faculty with an interest in physical education transferred to the Professional Development Centre within the Faculty of Education. The remaining faculty became the Department of Kinesiology with Dr. Eric Banister as its first chair. This was the first Department of Kinesiology in Canada. The specialist in dance moved to the Centre for the Arts, later re-named the School for the Contemporary Arts. The Department remained in the Faculty of Education administratively although the B.Sc. program was under the direction of the Interdisciplinary Committee on Kinesiology chaired by the Dean of Science. The mandate then was changed to the study of humans structure and function. <lb/><lb/>In 1972 the Department of Kinesiology was moved to the newly-established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. After Dr. Banister's term as Chair had ended, he was replaced by Dr. Tom Calvert, who remained as chair until he became Dean of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies in 1977. At this point, Dr. Eric Banister returned for a further term as Chair of the department.<lb/><lb/>In 1976 the physical location of the department was moved to the top floor of the Library Building with laboratories in various locations across campus. It wasn't until 1981 that the department moved to its current building, the Shrum Science Centre, with offices and laboratories in the same location. There has been modest expanison of laborartory and office space since that time. In 1982 Dr. John Dickinson became Chairman of the Department, and in 1985 the academic location of Kinesiology was changed when the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies was disbanded. Kinesiology became a School in the new Faculty of Applied Sciences. Dr. Andy Hoffer was appointed as the new Director of the School in 1991. Dr. John Dickinson returned as Director in 1997. Dr Jim Morrison took over as Director from 2000 to 2002 after which Dr. John Dickinson was re-appointed for a three-year term.<lb/><lb/>During the 33 years of its history, the School of Kinesiology has seen steady growth in terms of student numbers and in terms of faculty size. The first Masters student was graduated in 1970 and the first Ph.D. student in l980. As of 1998, approximately 500 undergraduate students and 50 graduate students study Kinesiology at SFU.</p>

<p>The University Archives acquires, preserves and makes available three categories of materials: (1) the official records of the University, including those created by the Board of Governors, Senate, University committees, faculties, departments and administrative offices; (2) materials documenting the wider University community; and (3) historical research collections that promote the teaching and research activities of the University.<lb/><lb/>The Archives was established within the University Library in 1968 when librarian Liisa Fagerlund was appointed University Archivist on a half-time basis. She continued in this post until 1975 when she left the University. From 1975 to 1978, the Archives functioned within the Special Collections division of the Library. Archival duties were carried out by various library staff members. In 1978, the University Archives was established as a separate administrative unit outside of the Library. Donald Baird, recently retired as University Librarian, became University Archivist and held this position until his retirement in 1990. Jim Ross served as University Archivist from 1991 to 1993, and was succeeded by Ian Forsyth in 1994.<lb/><lb/>When the Archives was a function of the University Library, the University Archivist reported to the University Librarian. When the Archives was established as a separate administrative unit, the University Archivist reported directly to the University President. The reporting structure changed in 1986 when the University Archivist reported to the Vice-President, Research/Information Systems; in 1990, when the University Archivist reported to the Associate Vice-President, Academic; and in 1996, when the University Archivist reported to the Registrar/Dean of Students.</p>

<p>The Department of Women's Studies at SFU has its roots in the political climate on campus during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some students and faculty expressed a desire to participate in research on women and the development of feminist theory. In the fall of 1971, the first course to focus on women—Geography 404: the Geography of Gender—was offered to 40 students. At the same time, SFU faculty members began to develop and participate in a series of non-credit courses relating to women's issues. As a result of the success of both Geography 404 and these non-credit courses, a proposal for a Women's Studies program was drafted. In 1975 this proposal was presented by Andrea Lebowitz and Margaret Benston to Senate and approved.<lb/><lb/>The Women's Studies program was established within the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies, and offered its first course in 1976. The program was administered by the Women's Studies Coordinating Committee, which was responsible for hiring, course development, and other administrative details. The Coordinating Committee was composed of Women's Studies faculty members, elected student representatives, and associated faculty teaching in the program.<lb/><lb/>In 1985, when the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies was eliminated, the Women's Studies program was placed in the Faculty of Arts within the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies. Also in the 1980s, the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Chair in Women's Studies was founded, a role that includes teaching, public speaking engagements, the organization of conferences, and the invitation of distinguished speakers. And, in 1985, the MA program was established and admitted its first students.<lb/><lb/>The 1990s brought further developments: the introduction of a certificate program in 1990; departmental status in 1991; the offering of joint majors, with English in 1991 and with Psychology in 1992; and the approval of Women's Studies as a major in 1994. Political Science and Sociology/Anthropology joint majors were added in 1997.<lb/><lb/>In 2000, the department introduced a course-based MA, followed by additional joint majors with Criminology, History, and Humanities in 2001. A PhD program was established in 2004, and a Gender Studies minor was added to the undergraduate program in the same year. By 2007-2008, there were 775 students enrolled in Women's Studies undergraduate programs and courses, with a further 23 students in the MA and PhD programs. As of 2008, there are six full-time faculty members, four faculty who are jointly appointed with another department, eight faculty from other departments who serve as associate members of the department, three professors emeritae, one adjunct faculty member, and one endowed professor. Three staff members are also employed by the department.<lb/></p>

<p>The Canadian Studies program developed from a series of informal meetings among a group of interested faculty members in late 1969 and early 1970. Subsequently representatives from eight departments and the library drafted a proposal for a Canadian Studies program within the Division of General Studies (later the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies). Course offerings began in the fall of 1971. The program was intended to provide a corrective for the lack of Canadian content being offered in the University and to provide a focus for interdisciplinary study. <lb/><lb/>By 1978, the University had appointed a full-time director for the program. The director was advised by a Steering Committee with one member from each department in the University which offered courses acceptable for credit towards the minor in Canadian Studies. The Steering Committee also included representatives from the Faculty of Education, the library, and the Student Society. <lb/><lb/>In 1980, the program was redesignated as the Centre for Canadian Studies, and offered students a major and honours in Canadian Studies. In addition, the Centre developed a French Canadian Studies Certificate Program.<lb/><lb/>Upon the dissolution of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies in 1985, the Centre for Canadian Studies became part of the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies within the Faculty of Arts.</p>

<p>Patrick McTaggart-Cowan was a distinguished meteorologist who served as the first president of SFU.<lb/><lb/>McTaggart-Cowan was born in Edinburgh on May 31, 1912 and immigrated with his family to Canada in 1913. The McTaggart-Cowan family settled in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Patrick McTaggart-Cowan attended the University of British Columbia, graduating with an honours degree in Mathematics and Physics in 1933. He proceeded to further studies at Oxford as a British Columbia Rhodes Scholar, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Natural Science in 1936. In 1939 McTaggart-Cowan married Margaret Palmer, with whom he had two children: a daughter, Gillian, born in 1942; and a son, James Duncan, born in 1944. Patrick McTaggart-Cowan passed away in 1997 at the age of 85.<lb/><lb/>Patrick McTaggart-Cowan was well known in Canada as a meteorologist, scientist and educator. After Oxford, he joined the Meteorological Service of Canada. As officer in charge of the meteorological service in Newfoundland from 1937 to 1942, he pioneered weather services for the first transatlantic passenger flights. During W.W.II, McTaggart-Cowan was chief meteorologist for the RAF Ferry Command, and was responsible for forecasting weather conditions for delivery of airplanes from North America to Europe. McTaggart-Cowan's skill in forecasting won him the gratitude of hundreds of pilots ferrying planes across the Atlantic, and earned him membership as an Officer of the British Empire in 1944. From 1945 to 1963, McTaggart-Cowan worked for the Meteorological Service of Canada in Ontario, where he became the Director in 1959. In 1963, McTaggart-Cowan accepted the position as first president of Simon Fraser University, and moved back to British Columbia. He helped to guide construction of the University, oversaw the hiring of professional staff, and helped to set up the academic structure of the university which opened in 1965. In 1968, McTaggart-Cowan was asked to resign his position as President by the Board of Governors. McTaggart-Cowan went on to head the Science Council of Canada from 1968 until his retirement in 1975. While with the Science Council, he was appointed by the federal Minister of Transport to head the Task Force Operation Oil in 1970 to clean up the oil spill in Chedabucto Bay, Nova Scotia. After retirement, McTaggart-Cowan moved to his farm in Bracebridge, Ontario where he continued to take an active part in environmental and science policy issues, such as acid rain, water pollution, and science education. He also became a beekeeper.<lb/><lb/>Patrick Duncan McTaggart-Cowan was the recipient of a number of international medals and honours. His national contributions earned him 7 honourary doctorates from across Canada, including those from the University of British Columbia and from Simon Fraser University.<lb/><lb/>He was created an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1979. In addition, he received a Coronation Medal in 1953 and the Canada Centennial Medal in 1967. For further information, see autobiographical notes, F 65-1-0-1.</p>

<p>The Department of Chemistry at Simon Fraser University was founded in 1965 as a charter department in the Faculty of Science. The Department has been responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in organic, inorganic, physical, theoretical, nuclear chemistry, as well as biochemistry. It became known for its breadth of programs and was unique in Canada for its involvement in the nuclear field, which is commonly found in physics departments.<lb/><lb/>The Department offered degrees at all levels from the beginning. Honours and majors degrees in Chemistry are awarded at the B.Sc. level and after a separate program in Biochemistry was instituted in 1968, similar honours and majors degrees in Biochemistry were added. In addition, minor programs are offered in all areas. A joint program with the Physics Department in Chemical Physics was initiated early in the history of the Department, and in the early 1980s, a joint Nuclear Science minor program with the Physics Department was started. An undergraduate cooperative education program began in 1982.<lb/><lb/>Administratively, the Department began with a Head of Chemistry who was appointed without term. In 1968 this was changed to an elected Head which, in turn, was changed to a Chair in 1972. In addition to the elected Departmental Tenure Committee, there were 3 main standing committees charged with the responsibility of ensuring the smooth and effective operation of the Department's business. They were the Undergraduate Studies Committee, the Graduate Studies Committee, and the Appointments Committee, which also acted as a long-range planning committee. These committees were appointed by the Chair and, in the case of the Undergraduate and Graduate Committees, had separate chairs. There were additional minor committees such as the Space Committee and the Safety Committee. Departmental operations were also assisted by Academic Advisors in Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the Graduate Admissions Officer. The Laboratory Coordinator (formerly the Departmental Assistant), helped with many administrative tasks.<lb/><lb/>The Department has been involved with TRIUMF (Tri-University Meson Facility) since its establishment in 1974, which marked the beginning of a major local research program in the nuclear sciences and associated areas. A long-standing research collaboration with members of the Department of Biological Sciences, called the Chemical Ecology Research Group, was formed in 1981.<lb/><lb/>During the Department's first year 12 faculty members were appointed. After an initial rapid increase in the next few years, the Department had a relatively stable number of 26 permanent faculty members by 1986.</p>

<p>The Simon Fraser University Society (SFUSS) was established on October 5, 1965. "University" was later dropped and it is now known as the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS). The SFSS still maintains its original constitutional objectives: "to promote, direct, administer, coordinate all student activities of, by and for the students of Simon Fraser University, and to promote cooperation amongst the students of Simon Fraser University and cooperation between the members of the Society and students within the Province and elsewhere." Its mandate has come to include advocating for students rights and providing services to graduate and undergraduate members. These include advocacy services, such as Legal Aid and Women's Centre, and retail services, such as Quad Books, the Print Shop and the Pub.<lb/><lb/>In its first year, the Society organized social events, co-sponsored Vietnam teach-ins, started a co-op bookstore, and protested against the poor quality food offered on campus. In the 1970s, the Society organized against tuition fee increases, lobbied for improved on-campus housing, started a women's centre, and opened a student-run pub. The 1980s saw the development of plans for a student union building and a continuation in the struggle for affordable education. In the 1990s the Society has constructed the Maggie Benston Centre, expanded its services and continues to advocate on behalf of students for accessible, affordable education.<lb/><lb/>The Executive Council originally consisted of 14 elected officers: President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Ombudsman, Clubs Director, Public Relations Officer, Arts, Science and Education Presidents, Athletics Coordinator, Social Convenor, Cultural Director, and Housing coordinator. This remained until 1977 when changes to constitutional by laws established five at large positions: President, Treasurer, External and Internal Relations Officers, Secretary, and Public Relations Officer and the Ombuds Office. Currently, six elected Executive officers and 36 Student Union representatives elected by students from each academic department sit on the Forum, the student representative body responsible for all major Student Society decisions. The Departmental Student Unions and Standing Committees supply information and recommendations to the Forum. Student Society Standing Committees deal with every aspect of the Society's operations.</p>

<p>The Women's Studies Association of British Columbia was a province-wide organization set up in 1974 to improve women's social status through the promotion, continuation and development of women'studies programmes at the post-secondary level of education and at adult community education centres. Soon afterwards, the association expanded to include high-school women's studies curricula. On December 11, 1978 the association incorporated as a society; it disbanded in 1980 due to declining support and lack of representation by members from colleges and universities. <lb/><lb/>The objectives of the Women's Studies Association were to promote women's studies in the province; to encourage research into previously unexamined aspects of Canadian women's lives, with particular emphasis on BC; to establish adequate support services for women at all post-secondary institutions throughout the province; and, to ensure that women's studies remained a part of the women's movement and that staff and students involved in women's studies were familiar with the aims and objectives of the women's movement.<lb/><lb/>A standing committee consisting of a coordinator, a secretary, a treasurer, a communications organizer, and a member-at-large directed the association. Membership included students and faculty from the province's community colleges and universities, persons from community service groups, and people with an individual interest in women's studies. </p>

<p>The Port Coquitlam Area Women's Centre Society was established as the result of efforts by a small group of women who met originally as a consciousness-raising group in 1974. They saw the need to establish a place for women to meet, give support, share their knowledge and experience, and to have a place that could provide a safe environment for women in crisis. With the support of the city councils of Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and Port Moody, the women were given an old concession stand to convert into the Port Coquitlam Area Women's Centre in 1975. The society itself incorporated under the British Columbia Societies Act in 1975, and ran the centre, which provides not only a meeting place, but also information, referrals and volunteer opportunities. The society also lobbies government, and is involved in community projects, such as the Coquitlam Women's Transition House. <lb/><lb/>The Port Coquitlam Area Women's Centre is run as a collective. Committees are formed as required. Each committee is responsible to the membership and gives a report at the general monthly meetings. A steering committee coordinates all activities. It consists of five women with a rotating membership; every three months one of its members is replaced in order to allow more women in the centre to be involved in the process of decision making. This structure ensures that there are experienced members on the steering committee at all times, but allows new (and inexperienced) members to participate and learn. The steering committee also ensures that decisions made at general meetings are carried out and brings issues forward to the general membership for action. <lb/><lb/>The Port Coquitlam Area Women's Centre continues to be active to this day, and operates under the guiding principles of feminism, including the idea that women have the right to be full and equal members of society. It is a member of the National Action Committee for the Status of Women; the BC/Yukon Association of Women's Centres; the Legal, Education, and Action Fund; and the BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics.</p>

<p>Hari Prakash Sharma (1934-2010) was a sociologist and Marxist scholar who came from the United States, politicized by the anti-war movement and inspired by the politically charged atmosphere at Simon Fraser University in 1968. He joined the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in that year and taught until his retirement in 1999 when he was honoured by the university as Professor Emeritus.<lb/><lb/>He was born on November 9, 1934 (although some records indicate January 10, 1934 as his date of birth) at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh, India, the second of eight children born to Kundun Lal Sharma and Moharli Devi Sharma. His father was a railway stationmaster, and the family moved frequently.<lb/><lb/>Sharma earned his BA from Agra University in 1954. After a five-year stint as Lower Division Clerk and Typist for the Government of India in the Central Excise and Customs Department, he earned an MA in Social Work from Delhi University in 1960. He then accepted a post as Lecturer at the Delhi School of Social Work, where he remained for three years. In 1963, Sharma moved to the US to further his education. He received an MS in Social Work from Case Western Reserve University in 1964 and a PhD in Rural Sociology from Cornell University in 1968. He taught briefly at the University of California, Los Angeles before accepting a position at SFU.<lb/><lb/>As a faculty member of SFU, Sharma became a champion of the academic rights of colleagues who faced the threat of dismissal for their support of student-led movements to democratize the university. Notably, he supported fellow colleague and friend Kathleen Gough, a British anthropologist with Marxist leanings who was suspended for her political activities. Gough and Sharma co-edited "Imperialism and Revolution in South Asia," which was published in the Monthly Review, an independent socialist journal, in 1974.<lb/><lb/>His research areas of special interest included political economy and agrarian social structures, particularly in India; social movements, political mobilization, ethnic and cultural identities; race and class; and nation-building among the aboriginal people of British Columbia. He wrote extensively on those topics and provided guest lectures at over 50 universities and scholarly institutions in Asia, Europe, and North America.<lb/><lb/>In the spring of 1967, the Naxalbari peasant uprising inspired him to travel to India and several other Asian countries. Upon his return, he became committed to political activism from an anti-imperialist perspective. During 1971-72, Sharma was a founding member of and contributor to the Georgia Straight Collective, which produced a publication for radical and alternative views. In 1973, he went to Amnesty International in London and the Commission of Jurists in Geneva and made a written representation to the UN Human Rights Commission in an effort to publicize the condition of more than 30,000 political prisoners in Indian jails. In 1974, Sharma and his comrade Gautam Appa of the London School of Economics organized a petition of international scholars to protest the treatment of political prisoners in India, which he handed to the Indian Consulate in Vancouver, BC on August 15 of the same year.<lb/><lb/>On a return trip from India in early 1975, Hari Sharma began to travel across North American campuses giving talks and mobilizing people toward the formation of a patriotic organization of Indians living in North America. This effort contributed to the founding of the Indian People's Association in North America (IPANA) on June 25, 1975, the same day on which Indira Gandhi declared a State of Emergency in India. The opposition to what was identified as a "fascist dictatorship" became the urgent task of IPANA along with the defense of the thousands of political prisoners.<lb/><lb/>IPANA established chapters in several North American cities, with its most active chapters in Montréal, Vancouver, New York, Toronto, and Boston. It had links with patriotic organizations in San Francisco, Chicago, Winnipeg, and Edmonton. In their effort to oppose imperialism and to promote democratic rights and social justice in India, IPANA produced three publications: the quarterly New India Bulletin, which came out of Montréal from 1975; India Now, a monthly that was produced in New York from 1976; and Wangar, a Punjabi paper that was produced from Vancouver every two months from 1977. In addition to its publications, IPANA held numerous public meetings, demonstrations, lectures, films, and cultural programs to highlight the systemic oppression of dalits, peasants, and workers that mocked any concept of democracy and freedom put forth by the existing Government of India. One of IPANA’s first public interventions in North America was to sponsor a speaking tour by Mary Tyler, a British writer who had been held in an Indian prison for several years without any formal charge for alleged revolutionary activities in Bihar.<lb/><lb/>Under Sharma's leadership, IPANA also supported the struggles of minorities and workers in BC. He was a primary force in the founding of the British Columbia Organization to Fight Racism (BCOFR). Through the 1980s, IPANA and BCOFR engaged thousands of people from several communities. Both Sharma and IPANA also helped form the Canadian Farmworkers Union in 1980.<lb/><lb/>In the 1980s, Sharma focused much of his research and writing on the condition of minorities in India, which came to a crisis with the attack on the Golden Temple and the massacre of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. He defended the human rights of Sikhs and of Muslims who became the primary targets of the Hindutva movements advocating Hindu nationalism. In 1987, Sharma organized a parallel conference on the centralization of state power and the threat to minorities in India to coincide with the Commonwealth Conference in Vancouver.<lb/><lb/>In 1989, Sharma united groups of the South Asian community to form the Komagata Maru Historical Society. The event commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Komagata Maru incident in which Indian immigrants traveling to Canada on a chartered ship were turned away from the shores of Vancouver by racist policies of the government. The society united the community, and as a result of its activities, the government installed a commemorative plaque in Vancouver in 1989. In 2004, during a screening of the film Continuous Journey (a documentary on the episode by the Toronto filmmaker Ali Kazimi), Mayor of Vancouver Larry Campbell sent a scroll to Sharma on behalf of the Komagata Historical Society declaring the week to be dedicated to the memory of Komagata Maru.<lb/><lb/>Following the attack on the Babri Masjid mosque in December 1992, Hari Sharma became the prime mover in the formation of a North American organization dedicated to the defence of minority rights in India, also known as Non-Resident Indians for Secularism and Democracy (NRISAD). This organization united people of Indian origin collectively through educational and cultural activities. One of its significant events in Vancouver included the celebration of the 50th anniversary of India's independence from colonial rule. The event united people across the South Asian community to focus on issues that included the urgency for peace between Pakistan and India. In September 1999, Sharma travelled to Montréal to join the founding of the International South Asia Forum (INSAF), a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to the promotion of peace and social justice in South Asia. He became its first President and organized the Second Conference in Vancouver in August 2001.<lb/><lb/>Over time, NRISAD recognized a need to widen the focus of the organization to include the whole of South Asia because its membership in Vancouver comprised people from the entire subcontinent of India and the diaspora in East Africa and other countries. Under Sharma's leadership, NRISAD evolved into the South Asian Network for Secularism and Democracy (SANSAD) in 2000. It pursued the same quest as its predecessors for peace and democracy based secularism, human rights, and social justice. Some activities included condemning the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 (for which Sharma was denied a visa to visit India), championing the human rights of Kashmiris, condemning violence against journalists and academics in Bangladesh, supporting the movement for democracy and social justice in Nepal, and defending the human rights of Tamils under the attack of the Sri Lankan state.<lb/><lb/>Throughout the years, Hari Sharma developed close ties and contacts with various political groups and communities. He worked with the First Nations in the Interior of BC, and as co-chair (along with Dr. Ronald Ignace, the elected Chief of the Skeetchestn Band from 1982 to 2003 and between 2007 and 2009), he helped to promote and to defend the merit of the SFU Kamloops First Nations program (then the SCES/SFU Program). In addition to his regular workload at SFU, Sharma taught courses such as Violence and War, Marxist Theory, and Third World issues on different occasions in Kamloops. Although the 16-year partnership between SFU and the Secwepemc Cultural Education Society of the Shuswap Nation (SCES) was dissolved by mutual agreement in 2004, over 400 students graduated from the program.<lb/><lb/>In addition to his academic work and political activism, Hari Sharma was an accomplished literary writer and self-taught photographer. He wrote and published short stories in Hindi. Many of his works also were also translated into Bengali, Punjabi, and English. Vapsi, one of his stories, was made into a Doordarshan (Indian public service broadcaster) film. Sharma attributed his interest in photography to a Japanese camera that had been "gifted" to him as a bribe by an importer while pushing files as a government worker. The camera became something that Sharma frequently took with him on trips to India to capture snippets of everyday life. Over the years, his photographs were published in academic journals and art magazines. His works were also publicly displayed in galleries in North America, Europe, and India.<lb/><lb/>After more than 50 years of political activity, Hari Sharma developed contacts and friendships with many who supported revolutionary movements. He married twice.<lb/><lb/>After a prolonged battle with cancer, Hari Sharma died in his Burnaby home surrounded by his closest comrades on March 16, 2010.</p>

<p>The Simon Fraser University Women's Association was founded in 1965, and dissolved in 1977. The association met for the first time on March 16, 1965 under the name Simon Fraser University Women's Club. Its first objectives were to provide hospitality to new arrivals at the university, and to help with housing. Shortly afterwards the association expanded its purpose to be the encouragement of the best interests of Simon Fraser University and the general community. The management and administration of the association rested with the executive, consisting of a President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, and the past President.<lb/><lb/>In 1966, the group changed its name to the Simon Fraser University Faculty Women's Association, and, in 1973, again changed its name to the Simon Fraser University Women's Association. Regular membership in the association was open to members and wives of the university's teaching or research staff, administrative staff officers, library staff, governing staff, and to other women connected to the university as approved by the association's executive.<lb/><lb/>Activities of the association included regular meetings, social activities such as outings and lectures, wine and cheese parties, and the organization of the annual Christmas party for the children of staff and faculty.<lb/><lb/>The Simon Fraser University Women's Association dissolved in 1977 due to declining membership and lack of interest in its activities.</p>

<p>The Simon Fraser University Faculty Association was incorporated under the British Columbia Societies Act on June 24, 1969, although it had been active on campus since the university opened in 1965. The Association is concerned with the economic benefits available to faculty including salary and fringe benefits; grievances; conditions of employment; procedural matters with respect to promotion, granting of tenure, dismissal and disciplinary actions; and other related areas. The Faculty Association also concerns itself with asserting the integrity of the academic profession, defending independence of thought, and encouraging the social and recreational association of its members.<lb/><lb/>On the Provincial level, the Association is a charter member of the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of British Columbia (CUFABC) and is a member of the governing council. Nationally, the Simon Fraser University Faculty Association is a member of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT).<lb/><lb/>An Executive Council elected by the membership administers the Faculty Association. The Executive consists of the President, Vice President, and Directors. In 1969, there were six Directors, which increased to eight by 1998. See Appendix A8 for a list of Executive Committee members from 1965 to 1988. Over the years various standing and ad hoc committees have assisted the Executive Council. The most recent constitution (1998) provides for an Economic Benefits Committee and a Pension Committee.<lb/><lb/>Currently, the Faculty Association continues to advocate on behalf of its members, and acts as their representative in the faculty's relationship with the university.</p>

<p>The School of Criminology was established under the name of the Department of Criminology by the Board of Governors in February 1975. In 1984, it was renamed the School of Criminology. The School is responsible, through its Director, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the field of Criminology. The first director, Dr. Ezzat Fattah, set out the goals of the Criminology program, which included the mission to contribute to public education and public enlightenment about crime and justice through the dissemination of scientific, unbiased information; accelerate the shaping of a fair, rational and responsive criminal justice system; promote understanding and co-operation between people in the social, legal and behavioral sciences, in and outside the University, through an interdisciplinary and integrative approach, through team teaching and team research, and; contribute in various ways to social development and social reform.<lb/><lb/>In December 1972, a faculty ad hoc committee recommended that graduate and undergraduate programs in Criminology be established and incorporated within the Division of General Studies. In August 1973, the Senate resolved to accept this recommendation. In 1974, Criminology was established as a program within the new Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies, before becoming a full department the next year. In 1985, the School left the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies to become a departmental unit within the Faculty of Arts. <lb/><lb/>In 1978 the School added an M.A. program to its offerings, followed in 1984 by the addition of a Ph.D. program. In meeting its research and instruction mandates, the School has sponsored the Criminology Research Centre, whose management committee consists of members of the department. The School has also taken part in the University's Directed Independent Study Course (DISC) Program, recruiting its first Distance Education Coordinator in 1979 and offering its first DIS course in 1980. In May 1981, The Universities Council of B.C. approved the establishment of Certificate Programs (General and Advanced) in Criminology, comprised of a variety of home study courses. The School also sponsors conferences on various topics, and members of the department have attended conferences elsewhere. <lb/><lb/>The School has been organized administratively into a Director, Associate Directors, and a number of standing committees. The Director is the chief administrative officer, whose responsibilities include the management of the operational budget; faculty tenure, promotion and salary recommendations; teaching assignments; and representation of the School to external bodies. The Director reported, until 1985, directly to the Dean of Interdisciplinary Studies. The Associate Directors have been responsible for space allotment, the appointment of sessional staff, the coordination of curriculum development in graduate and undergraduate programs, and advice to the Director on specific matters. The Departmental Assistant is responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the School, including the management of the departmental budget, the scheduling of courses, the provision of liaison with administrative offices, and advising students. <lb/><lb/>The number and composition of departmental committees has varied over time. Long-standing committees include the Undergraduate and Graduate Curriculum Committees. The School also struck various ad hoc committees when required, including those on Field Practices, Planning and Co-ordinating; Statistics; and Legal Studies. <lb/></p>

<p>The origins of Recreational Services and Athletics can be traced to two predecessor bodies established during the founding of the University in 1965. These bodies, the Athletics Program and the Recreation Program, were originally components of the Physical Development Centre, one of three centres that comprised the Faculty of Education. The organization of the Centre, approved by the Board of Governors on 14 January 1965, consisted of a Chairman acting as Head, responsible to the Dean of Education. Responsible to the Chairman were three Directors who oversaw the Centre's program areas of athletics, recreation, and research and professional development.<lb/><lb/>The Athletic Program was responsible for providing an opportunity to qualified students to increase their standards of athletic proficiency through competition in intercollegiate sports. Initially, the University competed on an intercollegiate level in three sports -- football, basketball and aquatic sports. Intercollegiate competition in other sports was added to the Program when interest and resources permitted. In contrast, the Recreation Program was responsible for providing a broad range of activities to students, faculty, staff, and the off-campus community through sport clubs, intramurals, community recreation programs and non-credit workshops and activity courses. <lb/><lb/>Reorganization within the Physical Development Centre, in 1967, resulted in the formation of the Physical Development Studies Department (later Kinesiology) and the merger of Athletics and Recreation as the Department of Athletics and Recreational Services. In 1970, responsibility for the Department of Athletics and Recreational Services was transferred from the Centre and the Faculty of Education to the Vice-President, Administration. In 1971, the VP, Administration divided the Department into three new departments: Athletics, Recreation, and Athletic and Recreational Services . Athletic and Recreational Services was headed by a Manager who reported to the Director of Ancillary Services and was responsible for the maintenance of athletic and recreational facilities and for the servicing of both the Athletics and Recreation Departments for such things as secretarial services, physiotherapy, audio-visual requirements, purchasing, equipment, ticket sales, transportation, accommodations, temporary help, scheduling, budget control, building and playfield maintenance and for all general administration. The Departments of Athletics and Recreation were headed by Directors who reported directly to the VP, Administration. Athletics remained responsible for intercollegiate sports, and Recreation for all other sports and leisure activities.<lb/><lb/>Slight changes to the above reporting structure occurred in 1979 when responsibility for the Department of Athletic and Recreational Services was transferred from the Director of Ancillary Services to the Directors of Athletics and Recreation. Reorganization occurred again in 1984 when the Departments of Athletics and Recreation were amalgamated to form the Department of Athletics and Recreation. This structure remained stable until 1996 when the Department of Athletics and Recreation merged with the Department of Athletic and Recreational Services to form the current Department of Recreational Services and Athletics.<lb/><lb/>Placement of the Department of Recreational Services and Athletics and its predecessors within the organizational hierarchy of the University have also undergone some changes over their history. As stated above, the Department(s) were originally located in the Physical Development Centre of the Faculty of Education and later transferred to the Vice-President, Administration. In 1986, the Department of Athletics and Recreation began reporting to the new office of the Executive Director of Administrative Services, a successor to the Vice-President, Administration. This office reverted to its former title of VP, Administration in 1990. In 1996, the Department was made a division of Campus Community Services which in turn was responsible to the Dean and Registrar of Student Services. The Dean and Registrar of Student Services reports to the Vice-President, Academic. This placement represents the current status of Recreational Services and Athletics.</p>

<p>Ellen Frank's interest in the women's movement began in 1972, while on a Kibbutz in Israel. At the time she was married, expecting her second child, and reading Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. In April, upon return to Vancouver, Ellen Frank contacted the 'Woman's Centre' and became involved in a consciousness-raising group. Ms. Frank's involvement with the women's movement expanded from these beginnings. She became, in her words, "unmarried," and went to work at the Woman's Place. In addition, Ms. Frank also became involved in organizing around day care issues, came out as a lesbian, and worked around issues of violence against women. She also spent time organizing demonstrations, being active in occupations, and involved in the fight for women's rights in general. Ms. Frank passed away on January 30, 2017.</p>

<p>The British Columbia Universities Act of March 1963, which created Simon Fraser University, required the establishment of a University Senate for the management of curriculum, instruction and education. The Act, and its subsequent amendments over the years, specified the membership, duties and powers of the Senate. As of May 2003 Senate is made up of 60 elected and appointed members chosen from faculty, students, staff, convocation, and the community. Senate is responsible for such academic matters as determining requirements for admission; providing for and granting degrees including honorary degrees; recommending to the Board of Governors the establishment or discontinuation of any faculty, department, or course of instruction; awarding fellowships and bursaries; making rules for the management of the library; and providing for the publication of the University calendar. <lb/><lb/>The President of the University is the chair of the Senate. Senate elects a Vice-Chair annually. The Registrar is the Secretary of Senate according to the University Act, and has delegated to the Director, University Secretariat, the responsibilities for the management of Senate and its committees.<lb/><lb/>Senate usually meets once a month in open and closed sessions except for August when no meeting is held. Matters for decision are normally brought to Senate through the Senate Committee on Agenda and Rules.<lb/><lb/>The first meeting of the SFU Senate was held November 29, 1965. In 1967, Senate voted to allow three student representatives--a move hailed as a first for a Canadian university. In 1968, in another precedent-setting decision, Senate admitted observers to its open sessions. <lb/><lb/>For further information on Senate membership, committees, duties, powers, and rules, see the appendix to this finding aid which contains a print out from the Senate web page, or consult the web page itself for the most current information at http://www.reg.sfu.ca/Senate/</p>

<p>The Department of Economics and Commerce was established by the Board of Governors in February 1964, and began to offer courses within the Faculty of Arts leading to B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees when the University opened in 1965. The Department was responsible, through its Head, for the promotion of research and the development and delivery of programs in the fields of economics and commerce.<lb/><lb/>The Department expanded rapidly in size, growing from an initial 5 faculty members in 1965 to 52 in 1979. During this period it had greatly expanded its program offerings, including the important addition of a Master of Business Administration program in 1968. In September 1979 the Department underwent a re-organization, when it was subsumed by the new School of Business Administration and Economics in the Faculty of Arts. The School consisted of two departments: Business Administration and Economics. The School existed only until November 1981, when a separate Faculty of Business Administration was established. The Department of Economics has continued to exist in the Faculty of Arts.<lb/><lb/>The Department was administered by a Chair and departmental committees, whose number and composition changed over time. The Chair was responsible for the overall administration of the Department, and reported to the Dean of Arts. In addition to its departmental committees, the Department adopted in 1969 a Constitution and By-laws for its Graduate Program in Economics. It stated that the Program would have three committees: the Graduate Studies Committee, the Curriculum Committee, and the Admissions Committee. </p>

<p>The Simon Fraser Gallery was established as a public art gallery in 1970 by SFU President Kenneth Strand upon the recommendation of the President's Works of Art Committee. At the same time, he appointed James Warren Felter as University Art Curator. He was charged with directing the Gallery's program and serving as curator of the University's art collection known as the Simon Fraser Collection. The Gallery was administratively located in the Centre for Communications and the Arts. The Gallery and the Simon Fraser Collection provided the visual arts component of the Centre. In 1974, the collection had more than five hundred works of art, primarily of Canadian artists.<lb/><lb/>When the Centre for Communications and the Arts became the Centre for the Arts within the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies, the position of Curator/Director of Exhibitions became the Director of the Simon Fraser Gallery.<lb/><lb/>During the first ten years of its operation, the Gallery presented 127 exhibitions in its campus facility. In addition to organizing exhibitions and hosting circulating programs on the SFU campus, the Gallery developed its own program of circulating exhibitions to other public art galleries, principally in western Canada.<lb/><lb/>The 1983 programs of the Gallery reflected the University's growing financial crisis and the once extensive program of circulating exhibits was cut back. The new University President, William Saywell, restructured the Works of Art Committee. In 1984, Felter, who had been the chair of the committee, became its secretary and Professor Ed Gibson became chair. In June 1985, after receiving a proposed statement of policy from the President's Works of Arts Committee, President Saywell separated the Gallery from the Centre for the Arts to become an independent unit reporting to the Vice-President, Development. The new policy stated that the primary purpose of the Gallery was to enhance the aesthetic sensibilities of the entire University community as well as the general public. The University Art Curator, who acted as Director of the Gallery, would be responsible for planning and day to day Gallery operation.<lb/><lb/>In January 1986, Ed Gibson succeeded Jim Felter as Director of the Gallery. The President's Works of Art Committee expanded to become the Simon Fraser Gallery Board, with representation from faculty, students, staff and the community. It functioned in an advisory capacity to the Vice-President, Development.<lb/></p>

<p>The Ceremonies and Events Office manages and produces Simon Fraser University's ceremonial, social, fundraising and special events and maintains SFU's traditions and protocol. It is the main office (along with the Registrar's Office) responsible for Spring and Fall Convocation ceremonies.<lb/><lb/>The Office coordinates many other events throughout the year, primarily for the President's Office, University Advancement and Alumni Relations.

<p>The School of Communication has built its curriculum and research around understanding the organization, operation and meaning of the communication messages on which personal, national and global associations are built and sustained.<lb/><lb/>The School had its origins in 1965 as the Centre for Communications and the Arts, a unit in the Faculty of Education which offered credit courses, non-credit workshops, and public events. In 1970, the Faculty of Education was reorganized. The Arts program separated from the Faculty of Education to become part of the Division of General Studies. It retained the organizational title of Centre for Communications and the Arts although it no longer offered academic courses in communication studies. These courses remained in the Faculty of Education and became part of that faculty's Educational Foundations Centre. In 1972 Communication Studies became a department of the newly created Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. In 1977-1978, its name changed to the Department of Communication.<lb/><lb/>The School concentrated on six areas in the undergraduate program: theory and systems, history of communication, communication processes, communication media, political economy, and communication policy. In 1980, the School played an active role in founding the Canadian Communication Association (CCA). In 1981 a proposal was submitted to the Universities Council of British Columbia to establish a Ph.D. program in Communication. Approval for this program was obtained in 1983, making it the only Communication Department in Canada (west of Ontario) to offer a full set of academic degree programs (Ph.D., M.A., and B.A.) in the communication field. In 1984 the School consolidated its teaching and research areas, focusing on three areas of specialized concentration: communication media, technology and policy.<lb/><lb/>In 1985 after the dissolution of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies, the School moved into the Faculty of Applied Sciences, in recognition of the fact that communication is a discipline of practical application. In 1994, the School adopted its current name, the School of Communication.<lb/><lb/>The School continues to be leader in local and international communication research and is involved in a number of projects including the Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing (founded in 1987), Centre for Policy Research on Science and Technology (established in 1988), The Digest (an on-line journal published by the Centre for Policy Research on Science and Technology), Emergency Preparedness Information Exchange (operated by the Telematics Research lab), and NewsWatch Canada. The School also has a number of lab facilities that supporting research and communication development. These include the Assessment of Technology in Context Design Lab (ATIC-DL) created in 1997, the Emergency Preparedness Information eXchange Lab, the Media Analysis Lab and the Sonic Research Studio (home of the World Soundscape Project established at Simon Fraser University during the late 1960s and early 1970s).</p>

<p>The School of Computing Science began in 1973 as a Program in the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. Courses were based on a single-track universal curriculum that focused on the interdisciplinary aspects of computing science, featuring a core of mainstream computing topics together with a techniques sector dealing with applications. Core courses were taught by regular Computing Science faculty while the techniques courses were taught by faculty from other disciplines. The Program offered undergraduate courses leading to a minor, major or honors degree in Computing Science.<lb/><lb/>In 1975 the Computing Science Program became a department, with nine tenure track faculty. That same year the School began a Co-operative Education Program that continues to place students in 4 and 8 month work-term positions with local, national, and international industries. In 1979 a graduate program was initiated with the approval of both M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs and the first Ph.D. students were admitted in 1983. In 1985, Computing Science joined the newly formed Faculty of Applied Science and became known as the School of Computing Science. The role of departmental Chairman was renamed Director and in 1989 the School was moved to its current space in the Applied Sciences Building.<lb/><lb/>Over the years, the School's curriculum has developed in response to changing computer technology and faculty research interests focussing on computer theory, hardware and software systems, multimedia applications, databases, and artificial intelligence. The School now offers a general program leading to a B.Sc. and B.A. degree with major or honors in Computing Science and specialist programs leading to a B.Sc degree with a major in Computing Science. It also contributes to a wide variety of programs that combine studies in other academic disciplines. Formal joint programs consist of Joint Major in Information Systems in Business Administration and Computing Science; Joint Major in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Computing Science; Mathematics and Computing Science Joint Honors Program; Cognitive Science Program (in cooperation with the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology); and the Management and Systems Science Program (in cooperation with the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Economics, and the Faculty of Business Administration). <lb/><lb/>The school also offers a minor program that can be taken in conjunction with other major or honors programs or a general degree program. Other programs include Digital Systems Design Honors (established in 1981), a Bachelor of General Studies Minor, the Second Degree Program, and the Certificate Program that provides part and full time students an opportunity to obtain an understanding of the fundamentals of computers and programming without specializing in Computing Science. The School continues to offer a non-credit summer Computer Institute for high school students and teachers.<lb/><lb/>Current research computing facilities at the School include over 300 networked workstations, file servers, CPU servers and other specialized systems. Undergraduate computing facilities include the Computing Science Instructional Lab (CSIL) that provides computers for students to do coursework assigned to particular software platforms. The School of Computing Science operates several interconnected Local Area Networks in cooperation with other schools in the Faculty of Applied Sciences and the Centre for Systems Science (CSS). The Laboratory for Computer and Communications Research (LCCR) is a separate lab operated in cooperation with the Department of Communications. Established in 1982, the LCCR promotes inquiry into the problems of computing and communication research; fosters cooperative efforts between the university, industry and government agencies; and sponsors distinguished visitors.</p>

<p>The Division of Continuing Education was formed in 1971 in order to develop new academic programs and to improve the accessibility of Simon Fraser University to the community. Milton McClaren, Director of the new division reported directly to the Vice-President, Academic. The original terms of reference for the Division of Continuing Education were very broad as the Senate had given it responsibility for courses of instruction offered at "times other than the usual times, in places other than the usual places, and in ways other than the normal ways." A few years later the Senate passed a series of motions which more precisely defined and described the role of the Division and established new procedures for offering and approving non-credit courses. By 1973 the Division of Continuing Education offered several types of programs including evening credit courses for undergraduates and graduates; summer session credit courses (primarily for teachers); off campus courses; and non-credit courses, lecture series and workshops. <lb/><lb/>In 1974 the Program for Senior Citizens was created with the assistance of a government grant. Using the "Age of Options" television program it was able to reach out to seniors in Burnaby and in the surrounding communities. Continuing Education further expanded its student base in 1974 by offering courses in interior and non-metropolitan locations such as the Fraser Valley and Kelowna. In 1975 Dr. Jack Blaney, previously the Associate Director of the Centre for Continuing Education at the University of British Columbia, replaced McClaren as the Dean of the newly renamed Division of Continuing Studies. With this appointment, Blaney became Canada's first Dean of Continuing Studies. The Center for Distance Education was established in the same year and introduced four university correspondence courses to fifty-five registered students. In 1976 the Division of Continuing Studies approved the Extended Studies Diploma that enabled students with an undergraduate degree to undertake further study outside of a traditional graduate program.<lb/><lb/>Backed by encouraging enrollment numbers, a proposal was circulated in late 1978 calling for a downtown program that would provide increased access to the university and support existing campus programs. In February 1980 SFU Downtown officially opened at a storefront location at 822 Howe Street and offered a selection of credit courses for degree completion, career upgrading, and personal interest and development. Organized under a Coordinator of Downtown Programs, courses were structured in six thematic areas: Business and Professional Studies; Urban and Regional Studies; Canadian Studies; Humanities; Health and Fitness Studies; and Social Sciences. The success of the programs soon led to the establishment of the Downtown Education Centre (DEC), a shared space with BCIT located at 549 Howe Street. In 1984 the Downtown Campus Planning Committee presented an interim report to the Senate Committee on Academic Priorities (SCAP) focusing on areas of program development. As a result, the School for Liberal and Professional Studies was established and used as a vehicle for organizing and marketing downtown-based, non-credit continuing studies courses on behalf of departments and faculties. By 1985 downtown programs included the Writing Program, the City Program, the Fine Arts Program and the Professional and Management Studies Program. <lb/><lb/>During this time Blaney was appointed as Vice-President, University Development and Extension while continuing to direct Continuing Studies. Blaney, considered the architect of Continuing Studies at SFU, spearheaded the concept of the university's new campus at Harbour Centre. Opened in 1989 in the historic Spencer Building at 515 West Hastings, the downtown campus was built entirely thorough private sector funding due in part to the strong fundraising efforts of the "Bridge to the Future Campaign." After almost ten years of planning and development, SFU's new downtown campus opened with a curriculum of unique, established programs and specialized spaces that included an arts studio, human performance centre, conference centre, and language and computer laboratories. <lb/><lb/>In the mid-1980's, Continuing Studies initiated two very distinct, off-campus programs. In 1984 the Prison Education Program (PEP) was launched under contract with the Federal Government. For ten years, Continuing Studies administered the program at four penitentiaries - Kent, Matsqui, Mountain, and William Head/Metchosin - and offered inmates courses in the Liberal Arts leading to certificate, degree and diploma completion in several academic disciplines. In 1988, the division created an academic partnership with the Secwepemc Cultural Education Society (SCES) to develop a university program for native students. The Kamloops-based integrated university program was structured with an emphasis on Native studies and social sciences and students were able to earn a BA degree with a major in Sociology or Anthropology. <lb/><lb/>Meanwhile at the Burnaby campus, Continuing Studies programs and courses continued to grow. After serving as Assistant Dean for three years, Jo Lynne Hoegg was appointed Dean of Continuing Studies in 1984 (a position she would hold until 1994.) The Applied Sciences Continuing Education Program began offering specialized non-credit courses for local and international audiences, including computer programming courses, a project management program, and in 1986, the Management Skills in Advanced Technology (MSAT) program. Utilizing a medium found in most households, Continuing Studies worked with KCTS/9 and the Knowledge Network to air television programs developed for distance education courses. Through funding from the BC Ministry of Skills, Labour and Training, the Centre for Distance Education Lab was established in 1995. It was later expanded and renamed the LohnLab in 1997 because of a financial donation from the Earl and Jennie Lohn Foundation. From 1998-1999 Lynn Elen Burton served as Dean and was succeeded by Colin Yerbury in 1999, the current Dean of Continuing Studies.<lb/><lb/>In 2000, the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue, a state of the art conference centre devoted to facilitating public and private dialogue, opened across the street from Harbour Centre. Continuing Studies is responsible for the program component of the Centre, which, since its opening, has won worldwide acclaim for its design. SFU's newest campus location in Surrey (opened in 2002), also offers continuing studies courses and professional development programs for students.<lb/><lb/>In 2004 the Seniors' Program celebrated its 29th anniversary. It remains an integral part of SFU's commitment to "help adults achieve their intellectual, professional and cultural goals through programs for lifelong learning that build on the strengths of the university and resources of the community." The program continues to offer intellectually challenging non-credit courses each week and it is open to anyone fifty-five years of age and older regardless of their educational background. Tuition is free for seniors sixty years of age or older and a Senior Citizens Certificate is available for those who complete thirty hours of courses. <lb/><lb/>Continuing Studies continues to expand its curriculum every year, developing courses, seminars and workshops in each of its current programming units. As of 2005, they included the Centre for Distance Education, the Centre for Integrated and Credit Studies and the Center for Community and Professional Programs.<lb/><lb/></p>

<p>The SFU/Secwepemc Cultural Education Society university program began in 1988 as a one-year pilot project with nineteen aboriginal students taking introductory courses in sociology and anthropology. In 1989 the University and the Shuswap Nation entered a formal three-year agreement, followed by another long-term agreement in 1992 to cooperatively run the program which focuses on making university education accessible to aboriginal students. Located on the Kamloops Indian Reserve, the curriculum offers an integrated university program with an emphasis on First Nations studies, research and social sciences. Students can earn credits towards diplomas, certificates, minors or majors in First Nations Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, or Archaeology. It is the first post-secondary institute in British Columbia that offers university level courses in aboriginal languages such as Secwepemc (Shuswap), Upper and Lower Statimc (Lillooet), and Nle7kepmx (Thompson). In 1991 an Archaeology Field School was established and is the only university program for First Nations of its kind in Canada that allows students to receive hands-on experience in archaeological site identification, survey techniques, site testing, excavation and cultural resource management. Campus facilities in Kamloops include administrative and faculty offices, class and seminar rooms, a computer lab, student lounge, resource library, reading room and a dedicated archaeology laboratory.</p>

<p>The Vancouver Women in Trades Association (VWITA) was formed in 1979 and incorporated under the British Columbia Societies Act in 1983. It became inactive in 1987. The organization functioned as an advocacy and support group for women working in, or seeking to work in trades and technology. It sought to facilitate contact among tradeswomen, improve their working conditions, promote greater representation of women in skilled, blue-collar occupations, and further women's access to trades education and training. In pursuing these goals, the Association frequently acted in liaison with other groups, government agencies, unions, businesses and educational institutions. The group also maintained links with other Women in Trades Associations across Canada, including the Women in Trades Kootenay Council. Membership in VWITA generally ranged between forty and fifty women. Annual general meetings and regular monthly meetings were forums for collective decision making, while a number of elected standing committees and coordinators initially carried out on-going business. In 1983 one paid staff position was created (Office Administrator) and in 1985 staff was expanded to three (Office Coordinator, Research Coordinator and Liaison Coordinator). These positions were primarily funded through government grants. Prior to the Association's incorporation in 1983, it was also known as the B.C. Women in Trades and the Women in Trades Association of B.C. Officers of the organizations included Joan Blair, Judy Doll, Alison Stewart, Carolyn Sawyer, Kate Braid, Suzanne Gerard, and Lynn Ryan.</p>
