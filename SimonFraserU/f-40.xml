        <p>The SFU Women's Centre was established in 1974 and continues as of this writing (2009) as an active organization. Funded by the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) as a constituency group, the Women's Centre provides programming, space and volunteer opportunities to self-identified women on campus, and resource information and peer support to women and men.<lb/><lb/>The Women's Centre began in 1974 when a group of women students revived the SFU Women's Caucus (originally established in 1968) and obtained SFSS club status. It opened the Women's Centre that year in a small room in the Rotunda. In 1980 the Centre moved to the Academic Quadrangle, then in 1996 back to the Rotunda (TC3013), doubling its physical space to approximately 1400 square feet.<lb/><lb/>The Centre's organizational structure has evolved over time. The Women's Centre Steering Committee developed out of the Women's Caucus, but by 1977 it had merged with the Women's Centre Collective. The Collective consists of women students who volunteer a set number of hours per week to staff the Centre and remains the decision-making body of the Centre. In 1979-80, the Women's Centre Board was created to formulate policy, promote the Centre, liaise with the university community, locate funding sources, and work closely with the Collective, which continued to be responsible for day-to-day operations and activities. The Board included representatives from SFSS, the Women's Centre Collective, the Women's Studies Department, the Women's Studies Student Union, and female administrative and clerical university staff. By the mid-1980s the Board was meeting irregularly; it was discontinued in 1990, its functions transferred to a newly created part-time paid position of Coordinator, funded by and reporting to the SFSS.<lb/><lb/>The Women's Centre provides a number of services, including a women-only lounge open 24 hours a day, a resource office, peer support, library, kitchen facilities, study carrels, couches and a quiet play area for children in the lounge. Men can access the Centre's library materials, peer support, and referral information.<lb/><lb/>Since its establishment, the Centre has undertaken numerous activities and projects. In cooperation with other campus groups, the Centre promoted the creation of a Women's Studies Department, the institution of a university harassment policy and office, the improvement of campus childcare facilities, and the organization of International Women's Day events, December 6 vigils, and women's self-defense classes.</p>

      <p>Title of the fonds is based on the name of the organization. Series titles were supplied by the archivist and are typically based on the contents of the series (exceptions will be noted in series descriptions). At the file and item level, titles reflect the records creator's original usage.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="1.7D">
      <p>Fonds consists of records made or received by the Women's Centre in the course of carrying out its functions and programs. The geographical focus of the activities documented is the Lower Mainland of British Columbia and especially the Simon Fraser University campus in Burnaby. Activities documented include provision of facilities, resources and referral services; meetings of the Women's Centre Collective and the Women's Centre Board; correspondence and liaison with other individuals and groups; Centre funding, budget planning and management of its financial resources; planning and organization of projects, programs and events; and maintenance of library and reference material. Records include logbooks, correspondence, reports, account books and summaries, minutes and meeting support papers, brochures, handbooks, photographs, reference files and audio cassettes.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="1.8B13">
      <p>Records were originally used and maintained by the Women's Centre as a single unit of office files. In 2001 the Archives arranged the material into seven series (with some additional sub-series) in order to facilitate intellectual access to the documents by grouping records that were generated by similar functions and activities. During the 2009 processing of subsequent accruals, the archivist added a new series (F-40-8, Liaison and cooperation files) and re-organized what had been a single series (series 5) into several sub-series (see F-40-5, Education, advocacy and outreach files). The latter re-organization affected a number of files that had previously been assigned reference codes; see appendix D for a concordance between the former file numbers and the new ones. Researchers should be aware that overlap among groupings occurs, and the entire file list for the fonds should be reviewed to determine the existence of all files on a particular subject.<lb/><lb/>Within series, files are typically arranged chronologically; exceptions only will be noted in series descriptions. Within files, documents are generally organized chronologically, though strict chronological order was not always originally maintained within files nor has it been supplied by the archivist.</p>

              <p>The Women's Centre Collective was established by 1977, having developed out of its predecessors, the Women's Caucus and the Women's Centre Steering Committee, which opened the SFU Women's Centre in 1974. The Collective has remained the core decision-making body of the organization and is responsible for the day-to-day operations and activities of the Centre. Since 1990, the Collective has been assisted by a paid part-time Coordinator, a position funded by and reporting to the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS). The Collective consists of women students who volunteer a set number of hours per week to staff the Centre. The Collective meets regularly, with the positions of chair and minute-recorder rotating weekly to different Collective members.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Women's Centre Board was established in the 1979-1980 re-organization of the SFU Women's Centre. The Board was created to formulate policy, liaise with the university community, locate funding sources, and work closely with the Women's Centre Collective which was responsible for the Centre's day-to-day operations and activities. The Board consists of representatives of the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS), the Women's Centre Collective, the Women's Studies Department, the Women's Studies Student Union, and female administrative and clerical university staff. By the mid-1980s, the Board was meeting irregularly. In 1990, it ceased operations and its functions were transferred to a newly created paid part-time position (Women's Centre Coordinator) funded by and reporting to the SFSS.</p>

In the 2009 processing of new accruals, the archivist re-organized the files into a number of sub-series due to the large volume of material.

          <note>
            <p>The British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW) was founded in 1974 as an umbrella group of women's organizations. Its objective was to bring about women's liberation through fundamental social change, providing a provincial network of support, information- and resource-sharing, and coordinated action. Groups joined as affiliate members and were organized into regional units; federation-wide matters were overseen by the Coordinating Collective, several standing committees (Finance, Communications and Convention), and various ad hoc committees established to address specific issues and projects. At the Annual General Convention delegates from each of the regions elected committee members and voted on policy resolutions. The BCFW disbanded in 1989.</p>

          <p>Series consists of records made or received by the Women's Centre in its capacity as a member of the British Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW). The SFU Women's Centre was an affiliate member of the BCFW in the Lower Mainland Region. As the BCFW disbanded in 1989, it made a donation to the SFU Women's Centre Development Fund of $1600. This money along with other private donations to the Women's Centre is intended to support work which is feminist and activist in nature but which falls outside the scope of the Centre's usual operations. The Women's Centre Development fund is not used for ongoing operating expenses of the Women's Centre.<lb/><lb/>Activities documented in this series include annual BCFW conventions; meetings of the Coordinating Collective, the Lower Mainland Region, and the finance committee; correspondence with various action committees (including the Structure Committee, Rights of Lesbians Committee, Women and Prisons Committee, Women's Heath Committee, Women Against Violence Against Women Committee, and Human Rights Committee); budget planning, grant applications, and accounts management; administration of membership applications, renewals and correspondence; and publications and public relations. Records consist of constitution and policy handbook; correspondence; agendas, minutes and meeting support papers; reports and proposals; financial statements, ledgers and daybooks; membership lists and records; and BCFW newsletters, publications and brochures.<lb/><lb/>Note that some of these records were information copies received by the Women's Centre as an affiliate member of the BCFW; others, however, appear to be the original records of the BCFW itself (e.g. some of the financial and membership records).</p>
