<p>The series consists primarily of material collected by Hugh Johnston; however it also contains material collected during an earlier attempt at writing the history of SFU. In 1990 President William Saywell commissioned history professor Robin Fisher to undertake a history of SFU. Fisher hired graduate student Steve Hicks as his research assistant to photocopy background material from the SFU Archives. When Fisher accepted a position at the University of Northern British Columbia, he took the photocopied material with him. Other commitments forced Fisher to abandon the SFU history project.<lb/><lb/>When a new SFU President, Michael Stevenson, asked Hugh Johnston, to write the history of SFU, Johnston contacted Robin Fisher who sent him his photocopied material in 2001. Johnston incorporated this material into his own records. The Fisher-Hicks material is recognizable because of the "RG" (record group) notation by Hicks at the top of each photocopied document. In 2004, Hicks sent Johnston additional photocopied material that had been forgotten in the basement of his parents' house. The archivist did not retain this material except for draft chapters and notes.</p>

Archives staff used this material to create displays and to answer reference questions. Over the years, they added additional files originating from other University departments.<lb/><lb/>Originally, the Media and Public Relations office kept these materials in their internal files so they could keep track of potential story leads. Additional files have been added to the collection since the Media and Public Relations fonds first had been processed.
