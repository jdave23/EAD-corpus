The need for honey judges grew out of the desire to promote honey and its uses at various exhibitions in BC, and in particular the Pacific National Exhibition at Vancouver and the Interior Provincial Exhibition at Armstrong. As early as the 1920s, a score card was developed to rank honey on a standardized scale and was used into the 1950s. The Canadian Beekeepers Council, established in the 1940s, also developed a score card allowing for the judging of honey at a national level. By the mid-1960s in BC, there was a demand for formally-trained honey judges, and a one day course was held in 1966 to teach, test, and certify the first group. Additional courses followed in 1975 and the 1980s. Certified honey judges continue to be an important part of exhibitions.

<p>The Women's Bookstore collection consists of materials relating to the operation of several Vancouver women's organizations and reflects the issues that dominated the women's movement throughout the 1970s. Consistent with the community based nature of women's movements during this period, the scope and content of the collection reflects the diversity common to a phenomenon rather than the administrative and subject coherence found in records generated by a single organization. As such, the collection as whole gains its coherence due primarily to the interdependence rather than independence of the individual items to one another. This also applies to the records generated by autonomous organizations in the collection. While the different organizations should be regarded as distinct, a good deal of the records concern the communication between various organizations and women's groups across the country or identify issues of concern to a broad range of organizations. Thus, the collection as whole should be regarded as a record of a dynamic process in which a common ideology served to unify the aims of distinctive organizations, persons, and subjects.<lb/><lb/>The collection is comprised of the records of the Women's Bookstore, Women's Caucus, A Woman's Place, Transition House, the British Columbia Federation of Women and the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery. Includes constitutions, minutes, reports, correspondence, position papers, and sound recordings. Also includes newsletters from women's centres across British Columbia and Canada, subject files, and an assortment of feminist publications.</p>

<p>The following text quoted from Alexandra Bischoff's digital records transfer form dated August 20, 2018:<lb/><lb/>This audio record was created on January 10, 2018 at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery - the day preceding the opening of the exhibition "Beginning with the Seventies: GLUT" (January 12 - April 8, 2018). For this exhibition, artist Alexandra Bischoff restaged the Vancouver Women's Bookstore as "Rereading Room," an interactive installation which includes a selection of the Bookstore's inaugural inventory. With the support of the Belkin Art Gallery, Bischoff held a reunion celebration with nine of the Bookstore's volunteers; this recording is from the reunion event.<lb/><lb/>Interviewed participants include volunteers that were involved in the organization throughout three decades of its existence, and represent a range of feminist concerns and perspectives. Many, in fact, met for the first time on this occasion. The opinions expressed within the interview are the participants own and do not necessarily reflect the policy of each individual involved, the Vancouver Women's Bookstore at large, or the Belkin Art Gallery.<lb/><lb/>Moderating the discussion with Bischoff is Vincent Tao, Librarian of Vancouver artist run centre 221A and Bischoff's collaborator and adviser for Rereading Room's first installation in 2016-17.</p>

Indeed, Vancouver was the only city in North America that supported two feminist bookstores simultaneously for such a long period of time. Ariel Books specialized in books for women in such areas as feminist theory, politics, lesbian issues, violence against women, assertiveness, psychology, parenting, birth and midwifery, fiction and the like. Ariel Books also hosted readings by popular feminist writers, and acted as an essential resource for Vancouver women.<lb/><lb/>Series consists of records that document the operation of Ariel Books from the period when Margo Dunn was owner of the store, although some records date to when the collective ran the store.

<p>Item is a recording of a meeting of the Shuswap Beekeepers Association held at Salmon Arm, BC on February 21, 1991. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss nine questions posed to all BCHPA Divisions, Associations, and other BC beekeepers by the BCHPA Bee Act Committee. The Committee was struck as an informal group to assist in the formulation and direction of revisions to be applied to the BC Bee Act by the Ministry. The recording begins mid-discussion at the start of side 1. In addition to input from Paul van Westendorp, the BC Provincial Apiarist, questions and comments arise from the members as the discussion around the nine questions ensues. Questions and concerns raised by the audience are not always fully clear, but van Westendorp's responses are. There is also the occasional sound of movement and disruption to the recording mic. The meeting adjourns halfway through side 1, and the recording cuts to a presentation by van Westendorp on tracheal mites and the BC Policy on Movement of Bees as they pertain to the question of quarantine areas, a question posed by the Bee Act Committee. Van Westendorp takes questions from the audience, and his talk continues onto side 2. The talk comes to a close approximately 2 minutes before the end of the second side. A summary of the Association's decisions on the nine questions are included on the file.</p>

<p>The Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA) Department was established in 1965 as one of the original departments at SFU. It marked a significant academic innovation in that it united three separate disciplines under one head—the distinguished Marxist scholar Tom Bottomore. By the late 1960s, Bottomore had returned to England, and the department entered a period of scholarly and administrative turmoil. The crisis culminated in the Department being placed under trusteeship by the University administration and eight faculty members going on strike.<lb/><lb/>The collection consists of various files collected over the years by the staff of the University Archives to assist history students and other researchers.

<p>The Archives established the Sterling Prize Collection in 2000 at the suggestion of Professor Ted Sterling, who, with his wife Nora, established the Sterling Prize for Controversy in 1993. According to the terms of reference for the prize, it may be given for work in any field including—but not limited to—fine arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and education. The primary aim of the prize is to encourage daring, creative, controversial, unconventional, and non-traditional work at SFU that also meets high standards and is morally and ethically sound. An ancillary aim is to encourage the study, at SFU, of the role of the controversial. The prize is normally awarded to a member of the SFU community—students, faculty, staff, or alumni. The winner is selected by the Sterling Prize Committee, composed of faculty. student and staff representatives.<lb/><lb/>Dr. Sterling, Professor Emeritus at SFU, was the founder of the University’s computing science program in 1973, and is an expert in computational epidemiology and the social implications of computing. He was awarded an honorary degree by SFU in 2001.<lb/><lb/>For further information on Ted and Nora Sterling and the Sterling Prize, see the file "Background Information."<lb/><lb/>In 2000, the archivist asked each previous Sterling Prize winner to give the Archives a copy of his or her Sterling Prize lecture. Some winners were able to supply a prepared text; other winners spoke from notes and supplied these. The archivist added more information to the files including announcements, press releases, articles from Simon Fraser News, print-outs from the Sterling Prize website, (http://www.sfu.ca/sterlingprize/) and other documents. SFU Media and Public Relations gave the Archives a cassette copy of Russel Ogden’s lecture for 1995. Please note that there was no prize winner for 1996.<lb/><lb/>For a list of speakers included in the collection, see Access Points.</p>

They encompass work done as a provincial society and also as a working office in the Lower Mainland.<lb/><lb/>The administrative records of the Society document all aspects of the Society's work.

A third group of administrative records reflects a new file classification plan which replaced the earlier file system (see Appendix B2 - hard-copy finding aid only). Administrative records that have accrued to the fonds have been added to this series.<lb/><lb/>Later records demonstrate the increased activity of the society in addressing the social problems of crime, including victim assistance programs and community assessments, as well as administration of halfway houses.<lb/><lb/>Individual case files and cards provide evidence of the Society's involvement with clients on probation including repeat or 'habitual' offenders, as well as prison visits, counseling sessions and other related actions undertaken by the Society on behalf of its clients.<lb/><lb/>Records comprising this fonds are records created at the Vancouver office of the Society, and do not include records created by the various regional offices.</p>

<p>Collection consists of records available in multiple formats relating to the 14-lecture series "Canadian-American Relations: Perspectives on the Columbia River Treaty" held at Simon Fraser University in 1974.<lb/><lb/>The Columbia River Treaty was an agreement between Canada and the United States for flood control and the construction of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity. Four dams were constructed - three in Canada (Mica, Arrow, and Duncan) and one in the United States (Libby). The treaty was signed in 1961 but was not ratified by the Canadian Parliament. The treaty was so controversial that a Protocol was drawn up, which eventually defined the monetary terms and operational procedures without changing any of the physical plan. The Protocol was agreed upon in 1964.<lb/><lb/>The lecture series was organized through the combined efforts of the Canadian Studies Program, the Department of Continuing Studies, and the Alumni Association and was chaired by Professor George Cook of the History Department. Each lecture was given by a person who had been closely connected to the Columbia River Treaty. Admission to attend the lectures was free. All lectures were held in the East Concourse Cafeteria, SFU (Burnaby campus).<lb/><lb/>Collection consists of audio recordings of the Columbia River Treaty lecture series advertised by Simon Fraser University as "a series of talks and panels designed to increase public understanding of this issue in Canadian-American relations on the international, national, regional and local levels and from the political, legal, economic, geographic and social aspects." The collection also consists of transcripts compiled by BC Hydro (Dania Robinson) in 2011 from the audio recordings of the Columbia River Treaty lecture series. Due to variable audio quality, the transcripts are not a full disclosure of the lectures. Researchers are advised to review access copies of the original audio recordings.<lb/><lb/>Document types include reel to reel, audio cassette tapes, digital (mp3 format) as well as transcripts (paper and PDF formats) of the audio recordings.</p>

<p>The collection was compiled by the University Archives staff to illustrate the construction of Simon Fraser University.<lb/><lb/>The history of Simon Fraser University is reflected in its world-renowned architecture. Located atop Burnaby Mountain, SFU's design was the result of a competition held in 1963 by Dr. Gordon Shrum, the newly-appointed Chancellor of the University. The goal of the competition was to produce five winners. One architect would be awarded first prize for the overall design of SFU, while four other architects would each be invited to build a section of the University under the supervision of the winner. All entries were limited to applicants from British Columbia.<lb/><lb/>The informal guidelines for SFU's design consisted of a directive from Dr. Shrum entitled, "Notes from the Chancellor," which was distributed to the applicants. In this directive, Dr. Shrum noted many of the features that he felt were essential to the new university based upon his previous experience at the University of British Columbia. Among his recommendations were that students should be able to move from one part of the university to another without going outside, and that the large lecture theaters should be grouped together rather than scattered over the whole campus. Perhaps the most important of his criteria was that SFU should appear in 1965 essentially as it would look in 1995. In other words, it should look like a finished university, but also be designed for expansion. The design chosen was that of a young UBC architecture professor, Arthur Erickson, and his colleague Geoffrey Massey. The four other winners were William R. Rhone and Randle Iredale; Zoltan Kiss; Duncan McNab, Harry Lee, and David Logan; and Robert F. Harrison. The Erickson and Massey design had been the unanimous choice of the judges, and had met all the requirements that Shrum had outlined in his memo.<lb/><lb/>The collection consists of photographic prints and contact sheets that illustrate the physical development of SFU including site clearance, excavation, the construction of individual buildings, and completed buildings and interiors. There are a number of aerial photographs. The collection also includes photographs of the University's opening ceremonies and the installation of Dr. Shrum as Chancellor and Patrick McTaggart-Cowan as President.</p>

<p>Subseries consists of materials used for the writing of Gordon Shrum: An Autobiography with Peter Stursberg, edited by Clive Cocking. This book was conceived by Darrel Zarn of the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies at SFU. He approached Peter Stursberg, an experienced journalist, who conducted a series of oral history interviews with Shrum in 1983. In order to fund the interviews, they were conducted under the oral history program of the Public Archives (now the National Archives) of Canada and the Parliamentary Library. Stursberg also made a 21/2 hour video interview of Shrum at the Instructional Media Centre at SFU. In addition, he interviewed nine of Shrum's friends and Shrum's son to provide material for the books's introduction. Because Stursberg was occupied with other projects, Clive Cocking a Vancouver writer and editor was hired to complete the project. Cocking conducted a series of supplementary interviews in 1985 to clarify statistics and other facts from the oral history interviews. Unfortunately, Shrum passed away suddenly before the manuscript was completed. The finished book appeared in 1986 through the support of SFU and the University of British Columbia.<lb/><lb/>The subseries contains transcripts, background materials, notes, drafts, U-matic videos, audio reels, and audio cassettes.</p>

<p>Series comprises records relating to McTaggart-Cowan's work as Head of the Task Force Operation Oil, established by the Minister of Transport in February 1970.<lb/><lb/>On February 4, 1970 the Liberian tanker the Arrow was wrecked on Cerberus Rock in Chedabucto Bay, off Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The tanker was bound from Venezuela carrying a cargo of 108,000 barrels of Bunker C fuel oil for Imperial Oil Limited. It is estimated that some two-thirds of the cargo was released into the Bay, polluting 190 miles of the Bay's 375-mile shoreline. The wreck in Chedabucto Bay was the first major spill of heavy Bunker C oil in frigid waters and presented problems for clean-up which were without precedent.<lb/><lb/>Initial clean-up efforts were directed by James Hornsby of Imperial Oil; he was replaced on February 13. On February 20, the Minster of Tranport appointed a three-man Task Force dubbed “Operation Oil,” with McTaggart-Cowan as the Head, assisted by Dr. H. Sheffer of the Defense Research Board of Canada (Deputy Head), and Capt. M. A. Martin of Maritime Command. The mandate of the Task Force was to minimize damage to the economy and ecology of the region, to gain a knowledge and understanding of oil spills in order to contend with similar incidents in the future, and to make recommendations for minimizing occurrences of oil spills and for providing immediate response and control. In overseeing the clean-up, the Task Force established various headquarters and field units, with much of the on-site capability being provided by the Canadian Armed Forces. Operation Oil reported to the Minister on September 1, 1970 (Final Report, volumes I - III). Clean-up efforts continued over the next two years, and the Task Force delivered the fourth and last volume of its Final Report on May 23, 1972.<lb/><lb/>Records include correspondence, memoranda, minutes, photographs, diaries, reports and publications (including the Final Report of the Task Force), press releases and press clippings, telegrams, proposals, contracts, plans and drawings, claims sheets and invoices.<lb/><lb/>Note that the records in this series were made or received by McTaggart-Cowan in his official capacity as Head of the Task Force, an agency of the federal government. Accordingly, in terms of provenance these are public records of Ministry of Transport. The records remained, however, in the physical custody of McTaggart-Cowan and were transferred to the Archives along with his private papers.<lb/><lb/>Note that associated records may also be held by the federal government department Environment Canada. According to a letter to McTaggart-Cowan dated July 6, 1971 (see file F-65-9-1-19), "much of the reconnaissance data obtained at Chedabucto Bay on ‘Operation Oil' has been placed on microfilm and is stored at the Canadian Oceanographic Data Centre."</p>

<p>SFU's Downtown Campus Program had a modest beginning on February 22, 1980 with a small storefront location and a couple of rented classrooms at 822 Howe Street. Developed as an extension of the Burnaby campus evening programs, the downtown program was established to help SFU strengthen its community identity and recruit new students. A selection of extension credit courses and non-credit community education programs were offered to adult students who sought to complete or upgrade their existing university education. By 1981 growing enrollment numbers forced the program to move to a larger site at 849 Howe Street. Known as the Downtown Education Centre (DEC), the space was shared with BCIT who managed and coordinated the Centre through their Division of Continuing Education and Industry Services. <lb/><lb/>Faculty from the Burnaby campus traveled downtown to teach at the Centre and brought in community professionals to assist them. In 1983 the Downtown Campus Planning Committee was struck by Senate to survey the downtown community and assist in the planning of proposed sites for a downtown campus. Downtown enrollment continued to grow and each year new programs were tested as administrators worked towards developing a curriculum that would be unique to a downtown campus. During this time a number of programs were created including the School for Liberal and Professional Studies, the City Program, the Fine Arts Program, the Writing Program and the Professional Management Studies Program. <lb/><lb/>In 1989 the new downtown campus was opened in the remodeled historic Spencer Building on West Hastings Street. Since then, SFU at Harbour Centre has continued to expand its curriculum to the needs of the downtown community, offering courses in sciences, liberal arts, and applied, professional and interdisciplinary fields of study leading to certificates, diplomas, and undergraduate and graduate degrees. In addition, SFU at Harbour Centre hosts professional development seminars, short courses, conferences and lectures. <lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the planning, development, and administration of the Downtown Campus Program and its successor, SFU at Harbour Centre.

<p>The Extension Credit Program began in 1973 as a result of a Senate motion delegating all responsibility for off-campus programs to Continuing Studies. The program provided educational opportunities for persons who could not attend day classes, but through evening, Intersession, or Summer Session courses could complete a degree, upgrade existing education or enhance personal academic interests. Professional programs were also offered to teachers through evening and summer classes. The opening of the downtown campus at Harbour Centre in 1989 enhanced the visibility of the Extension Credit Program as it offered courses aimed towards the advanced recurring educational needs of the business, professional and cultural communities in Vancouver's urban core. The Extension Credit Program remains active as of 2005 and allows students to obtain graduate degrees, post baccalaureate diplomas, and selected undergraduate certificates on a part time basis by day or evening study.<lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the administration and development of the Extension Credit Program.

<p>The Interior and Non-Metropolitan program began in 1975 as a response to government concern that residents in interior regions of BC were excluded from university education. After a year of offering credit courses at non-metropolitan colleges, SFU began to formally develop a distance education program and initiated a three-year experimental program in Kelowna offering degree completion programs in Psychology and Biological Sciences. SFU's goal was to design a distance education program that would provide an opportunity for all persons in BC to complete a degree without the usual attendance at UBC, UVic or SFU. By this time UBC and UVic were also offering interior programs and together with SFU ensured that the courses offered by each institution did not overlap each other. SFU interior courses were developed by university faculty and delivered with the assistance of the Office of Continuing Studies. Under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, the Interior University Programs Board approved courses and provided program funding from the provincial government. <lb/><lb/>In 1978 the the Interior Universities Programs Board was disbanded and replaced by the Open Learning Institute. The Open Learning Institute took responsibility for offering a bachelor of Arts and Science Program in cooperation with colleges, while universities remained responsible for offering professional programs. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s SFU initiated a number of programs that were delivered out of university centres in Kamloops, Kelowna, Prince George and Fort St. John. The Faculty of Education offered a variety of credit and non-credit programs and other departments developed courses in response to school district requests. Courses were taught through a combination of face-to-face instruction, directed independent study courses and via Knowledge Network telecourse programming. <lb/><lb/>In 1984, the provincial government established the University Consortium to increase access to post-secondary distance education courses. The Open Learning Agency (formerly the Open Learning Institute) was selected to be the central administrative headquarters for the University Consortium. SFU, UBC and UVic were integrated into the new program as consortium partners, delivering courses and programs in cooperation with various educational institutions, professional associations, workplaces, and community organizations. As of 2005 SFU's relationship with the Open Learning Agency remains in place. Through the British Columbia Open University (BCOU), a division of the Open Learning Agency, students can register and take distance education courses delivered by SFU without having to be admitted to the university. <lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the development and administration of the Interior and Non-Metropolitan Programs offered by SFU. Activities, events and topics documented include program development, the Interior University Program Board, SFU's Planning Committee on Interior Programming, administration of the Kelowna and Fraser Valley programs and budget planning.

<p>SFU launched the Prison Education Program (PEP) on April 1, 1984 after negotiating a three-year contract with the Federal Government to deliver a university program for male inmates at four penitentiaries - Kent, Mountain Head, Matsqui, and William Head/Metchosin. Assuming responsibility from the University of Victoria who had run the program for twelve years, PEP staff worked quickly to ensure a smooth administrative transition of the program and re-registration of the inmates as SFU students. The new program was assigned a dual home at SFU where all academic affairs of the program were administered through the Office of the Dean of Arts and a Steering Committee, and all administrative affairs of the program - including appointment of its Director, Stephen Duguid and its Program Coordinator, Henry Hoekema - were run under the guise of the Office of Continuing Studies. <lb/><lb/>Teaching staff for Kent, Mountain Head and Matsqui institutions were recruited from SFU while faculty at William Head were drawn extensively from UVic. In the course of its duration, the Prison Education Program established a library program at each institution, administered GED (grade 12 equivalency) courses, and offered courses in the Liberal Arts leading to certificate, diploma and degree completion. The program also sponsored courses and workshops in Writing and the Fine and Performing Arts and had a transition program for paroled inmates who chose to complete their education at SFU's Burnaby campus. After a few short years, the program grew to be very successful, garnering support from other SFU departments, developing a network of contacts in the field of prison education, initiating a series of seminars and Occasional Papers, and regularly publishing the Prison Journal. Despite the program being cancelled in the early 1990's due to government cutbacks, SFU continues today to be recognized as a leader in the field of prison education.<lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the administration and development of the Prison Education Program. Activities, events and topics documented include liaison with the federal government and SFU departments, library proposals, course scheduling, Library Technician meetings, recognition and awards ceremonies, the SFU Prison Education Newsletter, and copies of the serial Prison Journal.

<p>The Certificate Program in Health and Fitness Studies was established in 1978 drawing largely upon the resources of the Department of Kinesiology. Developed for sport coaches, those supervising training and/or fitness programs, and the general public, the program provides an opportunity to complete a coordinated program of university study on a full or part time basis in the areas of health, fitness, and nutrition. In the program's early years, students could earn a certificate by completing a series of credit courses from Kinesiology, Chemistry, Psychology, and Fine and Performing Arts along with a series of scheduled non-credit activities organized to allow students to meet with faculty and professionals in the field. Credit from these courses could also be used towards a Bachelor's degree. The program has evolved with an emphasis on Kinesiology courses and as of 2005, continues to be offered as an undergraduate certificate by the School of Kinesiology in the Faculty of Applied Sciences.<lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the administration of the Health and Fitness Studies Certificate program.

<p>The Applied Science Continuing Education program has offered a series of non-credit certificate programs in the areas of Communication, Computing Science, Engineering, Kinesiology and Resource and Environmental Management since 1989. Courses, seminars, workshops, and conferences are developed as a result of faculty support and industry demand with changing technological needs often dictating course content. In the 1990s an autonomous Faculty of Applied Sciences Continuing Education Unit was created that reported directly to the Dean of the Faculty of Applied Sciences. However, the unit proved to be financially unsustainable so in 2002 it was downsized and its administrative control was returned to the Dean of Continuing Studies. <lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the development and administration of the Applied Sciences Continuing Education program.

<p>In August 1988 the British Columbia Telephone Company entered into agreement with SFU for the delivery of a Certificate Program in Telecommunications Engineering. The specialized program, developed to upgrade the technical knowledge of BC Tel professional engineers in telecommunications technologies, was jointly run by SFU and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and managed by the Applied Sciences Program in Continuing Studies. Working in collaboration with the BC Tel Engineering Training Committee, Continuing Studies developed a series of eight, one-week extensive courses that covered topics such as communication systems, digital concepts, voice networks, communication standards and ISDN. Courses were made up of a combination of lectures, technical presentations, laboratories, and group activities. Each course had a coordinator rather than a single instructor and industry experts were brought in to give presentations. At the end of each session, courses were evaluated by participants and individuals outside of the BC Tel/SFU-UCLA group to ensure that participants acquired an in-depth understanding of changing technology and communication systems. <lb/><lb/>Sub-series consists of records relating to the development and administration of the BC Tel Convergence course program.

<p>The Management Skills in Advanced Technology Program (MSAT) was established in 1986 after a series of development seminars with employers, managers, and engineers in science and technology-based industries identified the need for a management skills training program. The President's Fund provided a loan to the Applied Sciences Continuing Studies program in order to get to the program started and soon after its inception, it was recognized as an innovative program in professional development education winning a Canadian Association for University Continuing Education Distinctive Program Award in 1989. The design of the program has changed little since the development of core courses in the late 1980's that include Managing Technology, Engineering Economics and Financial Planning, and Project Management. Students - comprised mainly of engineers, software developers, technologists and scientists seeking to develop their management skills - receive twenty-four days of instruction over a six month period in two three-day modules. Resource persons from the community are brought in as guest speakers.
