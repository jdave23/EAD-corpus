His book Radical Campus: Making Simon Fraser University was published to coincide with the university's 40th anniversary (2005). He joined SFU as a faculty member in 1968 and witnessed firsthand SFU's tumultuous beginnings. At various times in his career, Johnston led the History Department as chair.<lb/><lb/>Johnston grew up in south-western Ontario. He received a B.A. from the University of Toronto and attended the Ontario College of Education. Johnston went on to receive an M.A. from the University of Western Ontario and his PhD. from King's College at the University of London.<lb/><lb/>His teaching and research interests have centered on British and South Asian migration and settlement, eighteenth century exploration of the Pacific Northwest, the history of British Columbia, and higher education in Canada. Johnston is well known as an expert in Sikhism, Sikhs in Canada, and India-China relations. From 1992 to 2001 he also served on the board of the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute, a bi-national organization promoting scholarly exchange, and in 1995–1996 he was resident director of the institute's office in Delhi. In 2001 he was the institute's president.<lb/><lb/>During his career, Johnston wrote numerous scholarly articles and books. In 1995, with Tara Singh Bains he co-wrote The Four Quarters of the Night: The Life Journey of an Emmigrant Sikh. Other books include The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: The Sikh Challenge to Canada's Colour Bar; British Immigration Policy, 1815-1830:  "Shovelling out Paupers"; and the History of Perth County to 1967 (co-authored with W.

          <p>The series consists primarily of material collected by Hugh Johnston; however it also contains material collected during an earlier attempt at writing the history of SFU. In 1990 President William Saywell commissioned history professor Robin Fisher to undertake a history of SFU. Fisher hired graduate student Steve Hicks as his research assistant to photocopy background material from the SFU Archives. When Fisher accepted a position at the University of Northern British Columbia, he took the photocopied material with him. Other commitments forced Fisher to abandon the SFU history project.<lb/><lb/>When a new SFU President, Michael Stevenson, asked Hugh Johnston, to write the history of SFU, Johnston contacted Robin Fisher who sent him his photocopied material in 2001. Johnston incorporated this material into his own records. The Fisher-Hicks material is recognizable because of the "RG" (record group) notation by Hicks at the top of each photocopied document. In 2004, Hicks sent Johnston additional photocopied material that had been forgotten in the basement of his parents' house. The archivist did not retain this material except for draft chapters and notes.</p>
