      <note>
        <p>The School of Computing Science began in 1973 as a Program in the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. Courses were based on a single-track universal curriculum that focused on the interdisciplinary aspects of computing science, featuring a core of mainstream computing topics together with a techniques sector dealing with applications. Core courses were taught by regular Computing Science faculty while the techniques courses were taught by faculty from other disciplines. The Program offered undergraduate courses leading to a minor, major or honors degree in Computing Science.<lb/><lb/>In 1975 the Computing Science Program became a department, with nine tenure track faculty. That same year the School began a Co-operative Education Program that continues to place students in 4 and 8 month work-term positions with local, national, and international industries. In 1979 a graduate program was initiated with the approval of both M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs and the first Ph.D. students were admitted in 1983. In 1985, Computing Science joined the newly formed Faculty of Applied Science and became known as the School of Computing Science. The role of departmental Chairman was renamed Director and in 1989 the School was moved to its current space in the Applied Sciences Building.<lb/><lb/>Over the years, the School's curriculum has developed in response to changing computer technology and faculty research interests focussing on computer theory, hardware and software systems, multimedia applications, databases, and artificial intelligence. The School now offers a general program leading to a B.Sc. and B.A. degree with major or honors in Computing Science and specialist programs leading to a B.Sc degree with a major in Computing Science. It also contributes to a wide variety of programs that combine studies in other academic disciplines. Formal joint programs consist of Joint Major in Information Systems in Business Administration and Computing Science; Joint Major in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Computing Science; Mathematics and Computing Science Joint Honors Program; Cognitive Science Program (in cooperation with the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology); and the Management and Systems Science Program (in cooperation with the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Economics, and the Faculty of Business Administration). <lb/><lb/>The school also offers a minor program that can be taken in conjunction with other major or honors programs or a general degree program. Other programs include Digital Systems Design Honors (established in 1981), a Bachelor of General Studies Minor, the Second Degree Program, and the Certificate Program that provides part and full time students an opportunity to obtain an understanding of the fundamentals of computers and programming without specializing in Computing Science. The School continues to offer a non-credit summer Computer Institute for high school students and teachers.<lb/><lb/>Current research computing facilities at the School include over 300 networked workstations, file servers, CPU servers and other specialized systems.  Undergraduate computing facilities include the Computing Science Instructional Lab (CSIL) that provides computers for students to do coursework assigned to particular software platforms. The School of Computing Science operates several interconnected Local Area Networks in cooperation with other schools in the Faculty of Applied Sciences and the Centre for Systems Science (CSS). The Laboratory for Computer and Communications Research (LCCR) is a separate lab operated in cooperation with the Department of Communications. Established in 1982, the LCCR promotes inquiry into the problems of computing and communication research; fosters cooperative efforts between the university, industry and government agencies; and sponsors distinguished visitors.</p>

          <p>Series consists of records relating to meetings and deliberations of departmental, faculty, university, and external committees in which faculty or representatives from Computing Science participated. Departmental activities, events and topics documented include meetings; faculty search, hiring, and tenure deliberations; computing facilities; curriculum development; undergraduate and graduate programs; and hardware and software acquisition. Faculty records include minutes of the Faculty of Applied Science Executive Committee and the Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies Executive Committee. University-wide records consist of minutes and papers from committees such as academic planning, computer policy and planning, and research policy. External committee records include minutes and papers of the British Columbia Computers in Education Committee and the Canadian Computer Science Department Chairmen Committee. <lb/><lb/>Records include meeting agendas, minutes and supporting documents; correspondence; reports; policies and procedures; program revisions and course proposals; and working papers.<lb/><lb/>Note that in the case of departmental committees, the files constitute the original, authoritative records of those committees. In the case of non-departmental committees (faculty, university and external), however, the School did not typically function as the official record-keeper or custodian of the committee's original records. Accordingly, these files document the School's participation in the committees (correspondence and copies of committee records) rather than representing the authoritative record of those committees.<lb/></p>

          <p>Series consists of records relating to credit and non-credit instruction offered by the School and its predecessors. Activities, events and topics documented include the evaluation of courses, new course proposals, curriculum rationalization and scheduling, development of Continuing Education courses, cross-listed courses with other departments, Programs of Distinction, Programs of Excellence, seminar and colloquium series, high school computer course development, the Summer Computing Institute, workshops, and the graduate and undergraduate program. <lb/><lb/>Records include correspondence, reports, course files, working papers, policies, lecture schedules and outlines, reading lists, student self-study guides and handbooks, assignments and essay questions, final exams, directed studies proposals and teaching evaluation summaries.<lb/><lb/>Some teaching material has been retained (e.g. glossaries, lecture notes), but reprints of articles have not been preserved. The sub-series on "Course files" does not include course administrative records (e.g. enrollment lists, book requisition forms, grade change forms, registration status reports, waiting lists, add/drop forms, lab fee notices). Note that record types found in the files vary considerably from course to course.</p>
