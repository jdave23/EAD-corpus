      <note>
        <p>The Office of the Associate Vice-President, Academic (AVPA) has its origins in the appointment of Ian Mugridge as Assistant Vice-President, Academic in 1972. At that time, the Office of the Vice-President, Academic (VPA) was itself a relatively new unit, having been established only two years before in 1970 (see fonds F-200 for the administrative history of the VPA's Office). The appointment of an Assistant enabled the VPA to delegate a number of responsibilities to the new position: administrative supervision of certain academic support departments (Library, Registrar, Academic Advice Centre), space allocation planning, and some involvement in academic planning. Mugridge left the university in 1975; his successors took the title of Associate Vice-President, Academic. By 1986 the AVPA's Office had established its own record-keeping system and maintained its own files separate from those of the VPA.<lb/><lb/>Over the years, the division of responsibilities between the VPA and the AVPA has evolved considerably. Academic planning and budget planning generally remained with the VPA until 2001, when a reorganization of the portfolio delegated the primary responsibility for these activities to the AVPA. Space planning and allocation were early delegated to the AVPA in 1972 and have remained with this position since that time<lb/><lb/>From 1975 to 2001, the primary focus of the AVPA's mandate was the management of employment relations with the university's academic staff. This began with the appointment of Dan Birch as AVPA in 1975. The AVPA took the lead role in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU) in 1979; throughout the 1980s and 1990s the AVPA was the university's chief negotiator with the SFU Faculty Association (SFUFA); and in 1996 the AVPA assumed direct responsibility for the Academic Relations Office (for a history of this office, see fonds F-203). The focus on academic employment relations continued until 2001, when the incumbent AVPA (Judith Osborne) became Associate Vice-President, Policy, Equity and Legal. This new position moved out of the VPA's portfolio, reported directly to the President, and took with it most policy-related and negotiating responsibilities. With this reorganization, the focus of the AVPA's mandate shifted to academic planning and budgeting processes, institutional analysis, space allocation, and coordination of major and minor capital projects and IT projects.<lb/><lb/>The AVPA's involvement in university IT systems planning has varied over the years. Support for academic and research computing requirements was originally a function of the VPA's Office, but was transferred to the newly established Vice-President, Research / Information Systems in 1985. It returned to the VPA's portfolio in 1990, with the AVPA (Ross Saunders) having lead responsibility, though this shifted back to the VPA in 1994; in 2001 all IT responsibilities were consolidated under the Chief Information Officer (CIO), reporting directly to the VPA.<lb/><lb/>Since its establishment in 1972, the position of AVP Academic has always reported directly to the VPA. The AVPA has had administrative responsibility for a number of different reporting units within the university at various times, include the Academic Advice Centre, the Audio Visual Centre and its successors (Instructional Media Centre, Learning and Instructional Development Centre), the Registrar's Office, the University Library, and the University Archives. See the table attached to this fonds description for a complete list of the units that have belonged to the VPA's portfolio, their distribution between the VPA and the AVPA, and the years of the reporting relationship.</p>

      <p>The fonds consists of records made or received by the Office of the Associate Vice-President, Academic in the course of its activities. Activities and topics documented include the AVPA's reporting relationship with the VP Academic (meetings and consultations); liaison with other senior university administrators, including the President and other Vice-Presidents; administrative supervision of and correspondence with units reporting to the AVPA; and the AVPA's participation in a number of Senate committees, including the Senate Policy Committee on Scholarships, Awards and Bursaries (SPCSAB), the Senate Undergraduate Admissions Board (SUAB), the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies (SCUS), the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP), and the Senate Committee on Enrolment Management and Planning (SCEMP). Records include correspondence, reports, and meeting agendas, minutes, and supporting papers. For more detailed descriptions of record types, see individual series and sub-series descriptions.</p>
    </scopecontent>
    <arrangement encodinganalog="1.8B13">
      <p>The arrangement of the fonds into series, sub- and sub-sub-series is based on the original order of the material as found in the file classification system used by the AVPA's Office to organize the records.<lb/><lb/>Evidence of the original order is found in the annual file indices that survive from 1987 to 1994 (with some gaps) and in the staff practice from around 1984 to 1996 of coding files and annotating documents with the file classification code. From this, it appears that a file classification plan was adopted around 1984 to organize the AVPA's records independently of the VPA's files. This was based on the system already in use by VPA and shared the same numbering and naming conventions. Over the years, the VPA and AVPA systems began to diverge, however, especially after 1992 when the VPA (but not the AVPA) totally restructured its plan from an alphanumeric hierarchy to a block numeric system. Around 1996, the AVPA's Office appears to have discontinued its classification and numbering scheme altogether.<lb/><lb/>The arrangement of the fonds is therefore based on the classification system operative between 1984 and 1996. Files outside this date range have been assigned by the archivist to a series within that system. There is evidence of an even earlier file classification plan: a file index exists from 1977 showing different categories and a different numbering system, but no files survive from this period. All file indices are available in series F-201-3-2-9.</p>

For the whole of its existence (1971-1992), the Centre belonged to the VP Academic's reporting portfolio, though its direct reporting relationship shifted several times between the VP and the AVP. Activities documented in the correspondence include staffing, budget, policy development, and the reorganization and dissolution of the Centre in 1992. Records include correspondence, reports and statistics, student attrition and retention studies, advisors' manuals, and meeting agenda, minutes, and notes.</p>

            <p>Sub-series consists of the Associate Vice-President, Academic's correspondence with, related to, or copied from the Financial Aid and Awards Office during the period in which it reported to the AVP Academic (1984-1994). Note that until 1989, the Office was called simply the Financial Aid Office. From 1994 it reported to the Registrar, where it was eventually merged with other programs to form part of the Student Academic Resources Office. Activities documented in the correspondence include departmental budget planning, program and policy development, and the external review of the department in 1991. The sub-series also includes one file of correspondence with the Community Relations Office. This appears to have been a short-lived office, established around 1986 with the appointment of Vern Loewen (also Director of Financial Aid) as Community Relations Officer; it does not appear to have continued beyond 1987. Records in the sub-series include correspondence, meeting minutes, budgets, statistics and reports.</p>

              <p>The Senate Policy Committee on Scholarships, Awards and Bursaries (SPCSAB) is a standing committee of Senate, established in 1986 when its predecessor – the Senate Committee on Scholarships, Awards and Bursaries (SCSAB) – was reorganized into three distinct committees to deal separately with policy, undergraduate adjudication, and graduate adjudication. The main functions of SPCSAB are to set terms of reference for all university administered award programs and their adjudication; establish budget requests; integrate award programs with recruiting; and establish university policies relating to student funding from non-university sources.</p>

              <p>The Senate Undergraduate Admissions Board (SUAB) was established as a standing committee of Senate in 1970, replacing its predecessor, the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Standing. Its functions were to make recommendations relating to policy on undergraduate admissions, readmissions, standing and credit transfer; and to review applications involving special or extenuating circumstances. SUAB was dissolved by Senate effective January 1, 1996, and its functions transferred to the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies (SCUS).</p>

              <p>The Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies (SCUS) is a standing committee of Senate. It was established by Senate in 1971 and has been reorganized on several occasions. Through tne 1970s, Senate delegated to SCUS certain responsibilities and authority for approving curriculum and academic program revisions. In 1987, these responsibilities were in turn delegated to the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP), of which SCUS became a sub-committee. In 2001 Senate restructured its committees, with SCAP becoming the Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP) and SCUS restored to a full standing committee reporting directly to Senate. Its main function are to review, make recommendations, and approve academic program and curriculum changes; and recommend to Senate policies relating to grading, examination, standing and continuance, undergraduate admissions, readmissions, and credit transfer, undergraduate course registration and course withdrawal procedures, and the administration of undergraduate student records.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP) was originally instituted in 1971 as the Senate Committee on Academic Planning (SCAP). It replaced the Academic Planning Committee (ACP) previously established under the President's Office and was responsible for coordinating and implementing a system of academic planning at the university. Its functions included identifying priorities in the development of new and emerging programs; coordinating academic planning with allocation of resources; operating the system of external reviews; and reviewing and making recommendations for the establishment and disestablishment of academic departments and research units, centres and institutes. In 2001 Senate restructured its committee organization, and SCAP was renamed the Senate Committee on University Priorities (SCUP). It retained its academic planning functions, but took on additional responsibilities for advising the President on university budget matters.</p>

              <p>The Senate Undergraduate Awards Adjudication Committee (SUAAC) was established in 1986 when the former Senate Committee on Scholarships, Bursaries and Awards (SCSAB) was replaced by three separate committees with distinct responsibilities for policy, undergraduate adjudication, and graduate adjudication. The main functions of SUAAC are to adjudicate all undergraduate private and university awards; recommend changes or additions to the award programs; interview students in order to prepare recommendations where required for external agencies; confer with scholarship students; and present scholarships at secondary school convocations, as required.</p>

              <p>The Senate Committee to Review Academic Discipline and Student Conduct Policies (SCRAD) was an ad hoc committee established by Senate in  May 1993 to review university academic discipline and student conduct policies. SCRAD reported to Senate in 1994. As an outcome of its recommendations, the university adopted a package of policies and procedures relating to student discipline, dissolved the former Senate Committee on Academic Discipline (SCAD), and replaced it with two new bodies, the University Board of Student Discipline (UBSD) and the Senate Committee on Disciplinary Appeals (SCODA).</p>
