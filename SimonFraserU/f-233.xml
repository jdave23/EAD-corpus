      <note>
        <p>The Faculty of Education was one of the three founding faculties of Simon Fraser University and began operations in September 1965 with the opening of the university. As of this writing (May 2008), it continues as an active faculty with a mandate to engage in research and scholarly inquiry, advance knowledge, and improve the practice of teaching and the learning experience.<lb/><lb/>The Faculty of Education was founded with a broad mandate. In addition to courses relating to education and the teacher-certification Professional Development Program (PDP), the faculty was also responsible for instruction in the fine and performing arts, campus arts programming, campus recreational services, and intercollegiate athletics. This broad scope was reflected in the original structure of the faculty, which was organized into three distinct Centres, each with their own departments. (i) The Physical Development Centre included the departments of Physical Development Studies, Athletics, and Recreational Services. (ii) The Centre for Communications and the Arts was responsible for courses in fine and performing arts and communication studies, and provided a range of non-credit courses and public-events programming. (iii) The Educational Foundations Centre offered courses through the departments of Behavioural Sciences Foundations, Social and Philosophical Foundations, and Professional Foundations. <lb/><lb/>Re-organization occurred in 1970. The Centre for Communications and the Arts moved out of the faculty to become a separate unit for arts programming and non-credit instruction. Communication Studies remained within the faculty, moving to the Educational Foundations Centre. Athletics and Recreational Services merged, separated from the Physical Development Centre and left the faculty. Professional Foundations moved out of the Educational Foundations Centre to become its own Centre.<lb/><lb/>This new arrangement did not last long, and in 1972 the faculty abolished the entire structure based on centres and departments. Physical Development Studies (renamed Kinesiology) and Communication Studies moved out of Education to become academic departments in the newly established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. The Faculty of Education became a unitary body with functional divisions for Undergraduate Programs, Graduate Programs and Professional Programs. Professors were now affiliated to the faculty as a whole, able to cross over different program areas. Two further divisions were later added. Field Relations and Teacher In-Service was established in 1994 for professional development programs for BC school teachers and administrators (renamed Field Programs in 1998). International Programs was created in 2000 for coordinating the faculty's many internationalization activities. In both cases, the new divisions did not represent the accrual of a new function as such, but rather provided a more coherent organizational structure for activities and programs that were already underway in the faculty.<lb/><lb/>Administratively, the faculty is headed by the Dean of Education, assisted since 1983 by an Associate Dean. The Dean originally reported directly to the President, but since 1970 has reported to the Vice-President, Academic whose office was established in that year. The number and composition of the faculty's committees has varied over time. The Faculty Meeting has always been the principal governing forum, while the Executive Committee prepares matters for the Faculty Meeting, makes recommendations, and reviews and coordinates the activities of the different program areas. Each program area is headed by a Director, with program committees that review and make recommendations relating to the program as a whole.<lb/><lb/>Since the 1972 re-organization, teaching in the Faculty of Education focuses on provision of Education courses to undergraduate and graduate students; teacher certification through the Professional Development Program (PDP); and professional development activities for in-service teachers. From 1965, the faculty has offered degrees for the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.), the Master of Arts (Education) (M.A.) and Master of Science (Education) (M.Sc.). The Master of Education (M.Ed.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) were offered from 1983, and the Doctor of Education (D.Ed.) was added in 1998. Teaching is carried out by faculty members, assisted in the PDP program by faculty associates and program coordinators (teachers in the BC school system seconded to assist in teaching and classroom supervision activities). Since the early 1970s, decentralization has allowed PDP students to complete part of their requirements in communities across the provinces, as well providing in-service professional development activities beyond the Lower Mainland region.<lb/><lb/>See fonds Appendix B for a visual representation of the Faculty of Education's organizational structure and how this has changed over time.</p>

      <p>The fonds consists of records made and received by the Faculty of Education in the course of administering its programs and operations. Activities documented include  policy and procedures development, budget planning, and relations with staff, faculty members, and students; the self-governance of the faculty through the faculty meeting and faculty committees; the evolution of the faculty's administrative structure and its re-organizations;  the administration of faculty departments and centres (prior to 1972) and program area divisions (after 1972); the development of curriculum and delivery of courses; liaison with other SFU bodies and departments, other universities, government bodies and agencies, school boards, and professional associations relating to education; and special events held by the faculty, including conferences, colloquia, and public lecture series. Textual records include meeting agenda and minutes, reports, correspondence, publications, statistics, notes and working papers. Non-textual media include photographic material, architectural drawings, and audio and audio-visual recordings. For more detailed descriptions, see the series-level descriptions.<lb/><lb/>Note that there are a number of gaps in the coverage of the fonds. No records have been transferred from the Dean's office (series 1) for the period after 1984. The series of committee records (series 3) includes no or very few files from several of the faculty's standing committees (Field Programs, Appointments, Tenure and Promotion, and Research Opportunities). The holdings of the early centres and departments of the faculty (series 4) are slight, with the exception of those for the Department of Behavioural Science Foundations. Of the program area divisions established after the 1972 reorganization (five as of 2008), only one (Professional Programs) has transferred its records to the Archives (series 5).</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="1.8B13">
      <p>The fonds was arranged into the series by the SFU Archives in 2008, based on the original order established by the office(s) of creation. This does, however, represent the third arrangement under which the Archives has organized Faculty of Education records. Around 1985, the Archives established Record Group 9 (RG-9) for the archival material of the Faculty of Education. In 1997, the Archives re-described the records as fonds F-22, following the Canadian descriptive standard, the Rules for Archival Description (RAD). This created RAD-compliant descriptions down to the series level (but not sub-series); the overall arrangement, however, continued to follow the structure established by RG-9. In 2008, with another 11 m of accruals spanning 1965-2000 to process into the fonds, the Archives decided to modify the arrangement to better reflect the original order. It broadly follows the same outline as RG-9, but attempts to more clearly group material according to the unit of origin within the faculty. A new fonds number was assigned (F-233), and files previously processed under F-22 were renumbered according to the new arrangement.<lb/><lb/>See Appendix C for the previous series arrangements (RG-9 and F-22) and Appendix D for a concordance between the old F-22 and new F-233 file numbers.</p>

      <p>The records were transferred to Archives directly from the Faculty of Education, but the method of transfer has changed over time, and this has had an impact on the overall nature of the fonds.<lb/><lb/>(i) From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, university bodies, including the Faculty of Education, used the University Records Centre (URC) to store their semi-active and inactive records. Around 1985, ca. 7 m of the faculty's URC material was processed into the Archives' permanent holdings.<lb/><lb/>(ii) In 1994, the Archives undertook the first systematic appraisal and scheduling all unprocessed material then in the URC, and this resulted in the further transfer of an additional 5 m of Education records to Archives, though this accrual was not processed at that time.<lb/><lb/>(iii) From 1994 on, the faculty has from time to time transferred records to the URC in accordance with approved Records Retention Schedules and Disposal Authorities (RRSDAs). RRSDAs provide a timetable for how long departments retain records and specify the final diposition at the end of that period (destroy or transfer to the Archives). Through the application of schedules, the Archives received between 2000 and 2008 seven accessions of Faculty of Education records (6 m, 1965-2000) under the following RRSDAs:<lb/>- RRSDA 1999-002, Course files.<lb/>- RRSDA 1999-003, Committee files.<lb/>- RRSDA 1999-005, General administrative, program, and subject files.<lb/><lb/>Note that in the course of processing, the total extent was reduced, as not all of the files accessioned were selected for permenant retention.</p>

            <p>The Joint Board of Teacher Education (JBTE) was established by the Province of British Columbia in 1963, in the revision of the University Act, whereby Simon Fraser University and the University of Victoria came into existence alongside the University of British Columbia. The JBTE comprised representatives from each of the universities, their Faculties of Education, the Ministry of Education, the Department of Education, the BC School Trustees Association, and the BC Teachers Federation. Its mandate was to ensure the high quality of teacher instruction in the province by reviewing the curriculum, staffing, budget, and facilities of the Faculties of Education; to make recommendations to the universities and the Ministry; and to initiate changes to teacher training. The JBTE was the successor to the Joint Board of College of Education (1955-1963). It was abolished in the 1983 amendment of the University Act.</p>

              <p>A central committee charged with coordinating the activities and programs of the faculty has existed since the Faculty of Education began operations in 1965. It was originally called the Executive Council (1965-1967), then the Coordinating Council (1967-1972), before becoming the Executive Committee in 1972, under which name it continues to operate as of this writing (July 2008). In addition to its coordinating function, the committee reviews programs and activities and makes recommendations to the appropriate faculty bodies, and it prepares the agenda and documentation for the monthly Faculty Meeting. The composition of the committee has varied over time. Prior to 1972, members included the Dean, the Chairs of the Centres, and the Heads of Departments. After 1972 it comprised the Dean (and Associate Dean from 1983) and the Directors of the program areas. </p>

              <p>The Faculty Meeting was established in 1965 and continues as of this writing (July 2008) as the main governing forum of the Faculty of Education. It includes all tenure-track faculty and limited-term appointments of over one year as voting members. Faculty Associates, Program Coordinators, and student representatives from each program area are also included, though exact rules of membership have varied over the years. The meeting is chaired by the Dean and typically meets on a monthly basis.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The administrative history of the President's Athletic Awards Committee is not well-established. The committee was created by the President's Office in 1966 with a mandate to adjudicate university athletic awards, establish standards and methods of awards, review recruiting procedures and make recommendations, and liaise with the Senate Committee on Scholarships and Awards. Membership comprised a faculty member from each of the faculties, nominated by the Dean to the President. The committee appears to have ceased activities some time in the 1970s.</p>

              <p>The administrative history of the Coordinating Committee on General Education is not well-established. The committee was created by Senate in January 1967 to review the programs offered in the General Education program at the university and make recommendations relating to the extension or revision of the program. Membership consisted of seven faculty members and the (non-voting) Coordinating Secretary. It is not known when the committee was discontinued, but likely before or around 1970, when the Division of General Studies was established.</p>

              <p>The establishment of the Professional Development Committee was approved at the Faculty of Education Faculty Meeting in November 1968, and the committee was operational by early 1969. It was renamed the Professional Programs Committee with the reorganization of the faculty in 1972 and continues as an activity committee as of this writing (July 2008). Its mandate is to review and make recommendations on all matters relating to the professional courses and programs of the faculty, and with respect to these courses and programs it has the responsibilities of departmental and faculty undergraduate studies committees. <lb/><lb/>The committee's composition has varied over time. Originally membership comprised the Dean plus one faculty member and one student from each of the faculty's various departments. With the restructuring of the faculty in 1972, composition was changed to consist of the Director of Professional Programs, Dean (non-voting), and elected faculty members, coordinators, faculty associates, and students (with exact numbers changing over the years).</p>

            <note>
              <p>Mention of a Standing Committee on Graduate Studies appears in the minutes of the Faculty of Education's Faculty Meeting in December 1965, but its level of activity and continuity with later committees is not clear. At the faculty's April 1969 meeting, it approved the establishment of the Graduate Studies Committee. With the faculty's 1972 reorganization, it was renamed the Graduate Programs Committee, and it continues as an active body as of this writing (July 2008). Its mandate is to fulfill the responsibilities of departmental and faculty graduate studies committees as established by university policy and to review and make recommendations to the faculty on all matters relating to the graduate programs and course of the faculty.<lb/><lb/>Rules for composition of the committee have varied over time. From 1969 to 1972 memberships comprise the Dean, a representative from the Graduate Studies Committee of each department of the faculty, and a graduate student from each department. After 1972, the committee has been composed of the Director of Graduate Programs (Chair), the Dean (non-voting), and elected faculty members (four in total),  faculty associates (one), and graduate students (one plus alternate). </p>

              <p>The administrative history of the Faculty of Education's Ad Hoc Committee on Reorganization is not well-established. A "Re-organization Committee" appears in 1968 (see minutes of the Faculty Meeting, 30 September 1968). The Ad Hoc Committee, on the other hand, appears to have been active mainly in 1971, with a mandate to canvass and investigate proposals for re-structuring the faculty. Re-organization was finalized in 1972 with the abolition of the faculty's departmental structure based on centres and its replacement by a unitary faculty with functional program-area division.</p>

              <p>The establishment of the Undergraduate Studies Committee was approved by the Faculty of Education at its Faculty Meeting of November 1968. Although the records of the committee do not begin until 1972, reference to its activities can be found in the Faculty Meeting minutes before this date. With the re-organization of the faculty in 1972 it became known as the Undergraduate Programs Committee and under this name continues as an active committee as of this writing (July 2008). Its mandate is to consider and make recommendations to the faculty on all matters relating to the undergraduate courses and programs of the faculty; to recommend candidates for the Bachelor of Education degree; and to fulfill the responsibilities of departmental and faculty undergraduate studies committees.<lb/><lb/>The committee's composition has varied over time. Originally membership comprised the Dean plus one faculty member and one student from each of the faculty's various departments. With the restructuring of the faculty in 1972, composition was changed to consist of the Director of Undergraduate Programs, Dean (non-voting), four members elected by and from the faculty, and two student representatives (originally named by the Director on nomination by the Education Student Union, later elected directly by it).</p>

Its mandate is to make recommendations on contract renewal, tenure, and promotion in accord with university policies and procedures; and to consult with the Chair with respect to the merit component of annual salary increase recommendations. Six members and the Chair are elected from the faculty, with the Chair normally a tenured faculty member of the rank of Full or Associate Professor.</p>

              <p>The administrative history of the Savage Beagles Meeting is not well-established. It was not an official standing committee of the Faculty of Education, but appears to have begun some time after 1972 as a meeting called by the Director of Professional Programs and attended by faculty members involved in PDP. The records of the meeting begin in 1974. It was originally called the Director's Meeting, renamed Management Meeting in 1980, and the Dicord Meeting in 1986. In August 1986 the group went on retreat to Whistler BC, and henceforth the committee was known as the Savage Beagles after the name of a Whistler pub.</p>

Activities documented include programs for school associates, faculty associates and program coordinators (conferences, events, orientation); external programs planning and liaison with school districts; PDP staffing and budget; and PDP curriculum, intake, and student placement. Records prior to 1985 consist solely of meeting agenda and minutes; from 1985-1987 meeting support papers were also maintained, including correspondence, reports, orientation schedules, and lists of appointments of associates and coordinators.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Faculty of Education's Faculty Appointments Committee first appears in the record in 1976, but was likely already established by then, though not earlier than the 1972 faculty re-organization. It continues as of this writing (July 2008) as an active standing committee of the faculty. Its mandate is to review all candidates for appointment, arrange appropriate screening procedures, short-list candidates, and recommend candidates for appointment in accordance with university policies and procedures. Its composition has varied over time but includes the Dean or Associate Dean, Program Directors, and members elected by and from the faculty.</p>

Its mandate is to advise the Director of Professional Programs on scholarships and awards, and to review applications and forward nominations to the appropriate Senate body. It continues as of this writing (July 2008) as an active committee.</p>

              <p>The administrative history of the Faculty of Education's Admissions Committee is not well-established. It was originally a sub-committee of the faculty's Professional Programs Committee and was established sometime between 1972 and 1976 to advise the Director of Professional Programs on student admission. In 1978 it became a standing committee of the faculty in its own right with a broadened mandate to consider and make recommendations to the faculty on all matters relating to admission of candidates to the PDP and Bachelor of Education degree programs; execute and monitor faculty and university polices and procedures regarding admission matters; and act as the first review level for admission candidates' appeals in the event of disputes. Membership consisted of the Chair (elected faculty member), the Dean, the Directors of Professional Programs and Undergraduate Programs, and individuals elected from faculty (two), PDP students (one) and faculty associates (one). The committee was dissolved some time between 1989 and 1994 (it appears on the annual "Committees of the Faculty of Education" lising in 1988-89, but not on the next extant one from 1994/95).</p>

              <p>The Physcial Development Centre (PDC) was established in 1965 as one of the three original centres of the Faculty of Education. It was responsible for managing campus recreational faclities and intramural activities (Recreation Services); organizing SFU's competitive intercollegiate athletics program (Athletics); and offering courses relating to physical education through the university's General Education program. In 1967, the centre added the Department of Physical Development Studies to deliver courses on human growth and movement (kinesiology). Athletics and Recreatonal Services left the centre (and the Faculty of Education) in 1970 to become an independent administrative unit reporting to the Vice-President, Administration. The Faculty of Education as a whole re-organized in 1972, abolishing the PDC along with the other remaining centres, with Physical Development Studies moving to the newly established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies as the Department of Kinesiology.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Professional Development Centre has its origins in the Department of Professional Foundations, established in 1965 as one of the original units of the Educational Foundations Centre (EFC) within the Faculty of Education. As the faculty re-organized in 1970, Professional Foundations left the EFC to become a centre in its own right and was renamed the Professional Development Centre.  From the outset, the department / centre was responsible for developing and delivering the Professional Development Program (PDP), the teacher training and certification component of the Faculty of Education at SFU. The centre was abolished in the 1972 re-structuring of the faculty, with the Professional Programs division established as its successor.</p>

            <note>
              <p>The Educational Foundations Centre (EFC) was established in 1965 as one of the original centres of the Faculty of Education. The EFC originally contained separate departments for Behaviourial Science Foundations, Social and Philosophical Foundations, and Professional Foundations. In 1970, Communicaton Studies moved from the Centre for Communications and the Arts (which left the Faculty of Education) to the EFC, while Professional Foundations separated to become its own centre. The EFC was abolished along with the remaining centres when the faculty re-organized again in 1972. In that year, Behavioural Science Foundations and Communication Studies merged and moved to the newly established Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies, while the faculty members and curriculum of Social and Philosophical Foundations joined the new unified structure of the Faculty of Education as a whole.</p>

              <p>Professional Programs was established in 1972 as one of the three functional program areas that replaced the faculty's previously independent centres and departments during the re-organization of that year. It was the successor to the Professional Foundations Centre, taking over responsibility for the teacher-certification component of the Faculty of Education at SFU, and it continues as an active division of the faculty as of this writing (July 2008).<lb/><lb/>From the opening of the university in 1965, the Faculty of Education has offered the Professional Development Program (PDP). Students could apply for PDP admission after completing a certain number of undergraduate credits at SFU or another university and, upon completion of the program, were recommended for the provincial Teachers' Certificate (granted originally by government's Department of Education, after 1974 by the British Columbia College of Teachers). The PDP program at SFU was initially administered by the Department of Professional Foundations in the Educational Foundations Centre, later (1970) becoming its own centre (Professional Foundations Centre). In 1972 responsibility for the program was carried over to faculty's new Professional Programs division. While  PDP requirements and curricula have evolved over the years, it's basic structure has consistently been a three-semester program involving two core courses (EDUC 401/402), a semester of supervised classroom experience, and a semester of supplementary course programming. The faculty uses a "differentiated" or "complementary" staffing model which teams tenure-track faculty members with seconded teachers selected from school districts throughout the province. In the early 1970s the faculty initiated a decentralization of the program, enabling students to complete some of their requirements in communities outside of the Lower Mainland. In 2006, the Professional Qualifications Program (PQP) was established, a three-semester program for those wishing to re-certify their teaching credentials.</p>
