         <head>Historical Note:</head>
         <p>The Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation (GHWF) was established in 1990 by a group of Houston women who were concerned that only four to five percent of nationwide charitable donations were allocated to help women and girls. Consequently, the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation was created to focus specifically on the needs of women and girls in Houston, and the mission of the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation is to provide funding for projects and programs that benefit women and girls. Through grants, the Foundation gives back to the community seventy-five percent of the money donated.</p>
         <p>Each year, the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation awards grants to agencies and programs that are devoted to women and girls. The Grants Committee reviews proposals and makes its recommendations to the Board of Trustees, who then finalize the selection. The Foundation typically awards grants to seven to twelve agencies per year, at its annual Grants luncheon. The Foundation strives to award grants to a diversity of programs. Recent recipients include the Chinese Community Center, the Women&#039;s Home and the Women&#039;s Resource and Crisis Center in Galveston, Project Row Houses, Chinquapin School, ESCAPE Family Resource Center, the Houston READ Commission, and the San Jacinto Girl Scouts.</p>
         <p>Education is another important component of the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation The Foundation sponsors a number of educational seminars and conferences, many of which feature prominent Houston women who address issues such as career enhancement and the importance of self-confidence and self-esteem for women and girls. The main focus of the Foundation&#039;s educational efforts, is however, financial planning and money management.</p>
         <p>The Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation and several institutions of higher learning in the Houston area, including the University of Houston, Texas Southern University, and Houston Community College, have worked together on research projects which examine current issues relevant to women. These studies have focused on topics such as the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; in the workplace, childcare and benefits, and girls and gangs. Copies of the completed research projects can be found in the Houston Public Library and its branches, and they are also distributed to elected officials. Based upon the findings of the research project, each year the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation presents its Excellence awards to local businesses in recognition of their progressive policies. Recent recipients of the Excellence awards include Shell Oil Company, Mir Fox and Rodriquez, PanEnergy Corporation, and Browning-Ferris Industries.</p>
         <p>Although no items relating to it are included in the collection, in 1992 the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation, in conjunction with PBS station KUHT, developed and produced a television series entitled &quot;Focus on Success.&quot; The Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation also participates in programs such as the national &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day.&quot; Many prominent women have been involved in some manner with the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation, including Oprah Winfrey, Nellie Connally, Elizabeth Rockwell, former Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin, former United States Ambassador to Austria Swanee Hunt, and local celebrities Jan Carson and Shara Fryer.</p>

                  <p>This series contains thirteen folders, dating from 1990 to 2000. In general, the original order has been maintained, although some changes have been made to facilitate access. The folders contain minutes and memoranda of the Board of Trustees meetings and Executive Committee meetings. There were no minutes for 1992. The series also contains policies and procedures guidelines for the organization, as well as a sublease agreement. Unless they were attached to the minutes of meetings, some items, such as Treasurer&#039;s Reports have been moved to other series. The Foundation did not hold board meetings in December of any year. A number of miscellaneous financial documents were placed at the back of the original folder dated 1997, and these items have been moved and re-foldered.</p>

                  <p>This series contains six folders, dating from 1992 to 1997. The folders are arranged chronologically rather than alphabetically in order to show more clearly the issues of interest to the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation over the years. Included in this series are the research projects and studies compiled by the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation, in conjunction with such institutions as the University of Houston Graduate School of Social Work, the University of Houston College of Business Administration, Texas Southern University, and Houston Community College. Topics of the studies include the status of women and girls in Houston, corporate relationships with female-owned businesses, education and employability, and girls in gangs.</p>

                  <p>This series contains thirteen folders, dating from 1990 to 1998. It includes mostly thank-you notes, general correspondence to and from members of the organization, and internal memoranda. The creator had a separate folder, labeled &quot;thank-you notes,&quot; which was arranged in roughly chronological order by year. Some items had post-it notes saying &quot;correspo from member&quot; or just &quot;correspo,&quot; but all the items were in the &quot;thank-you notes&quot; folder. Several cards are from prominent Texas and Houston women, and the notes generally refer to luncheons, programs or fundraisers sponsored by the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation.</p>

                  <p>This series contains twenty folders, dating from 1990 to 1994. It contains records and documents pertaining to membership in the Greater Houston Women&#039;s Foundation. The materials in this series have been left in their original order. The creator organized the membership applications according to the monetary donation level. The items were then arranged alphabetically by member&#039;s name. The database membership record has been left in its original order, with some additions. Not all of the pages of the database membership record are numbered, and so page numbers and letters have been assigned to the unnumbered pages to ensure that they remain in their original order. For example, the page following 7 is 7a. In some cases, page numbers, such as 28, are missing, and there is only one page (27a) between 27 and 29. In other cases, there is a page between the numbered pages (32a is between 32 and 33), or multiple pages between numbered pages (33a and 33b are between 33 and 34). When a charter member&#039;s application was missing, the creator inserted a blank sheet with the charter member&#039;s name. The membership lists for 1992 and 1993 were arranged according to zip code, rather than alphabetically, and that arrangement has been retained. Some of the membership applications are dated and others are not. Some of these dates may pertain to a renewal of membership, rather than to an original membership. Membership records and lists cannot be photocopied.</p>
