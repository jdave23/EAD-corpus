         <head>Biographical Information:</head>
         <p>Dr. Bette Ann Stead, known as the Architect for C.T. Bauer's $40 million endowment, is professor emerita of the C. T. Bauer College of Business, University of Houston, where she taught for 34 years.  Dr. Stead's numerous articles have been published in the Academy of Management Journal, Business Horizons, Group and Organization Management, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Journal of Business Ethics, Information and Optimization Sciences, Journal of Library Administration, Journal of Nonprofit and Public Sector Marketing, Library Quarterly, Vital Speeches of the Day, etc.   In 1978, she co-authored Business English and Communication (McGraw-Hill).   Also in 1978, Stead published the first edition of Women in Management (Prentice Hall), which she used in her "Women in Administration" course. In 1985, the second edition was published.</p>
         <p>In 1975, when Dr. Stead began teaching her groundbreaking course, "Women in Administration," women were denied membership in business and service organizations. On March 31, 1981, Dr. Stead presented a suggested constitution and bylaws to representatives from 20 business and scientific women’s organizations, which was used to establish the Federation of Houston Professional Women (FHPW), in September of that year. FHPW now has some fifty member organizations.  http://www.fhpw.org/our_history.html</p>
         <p>In 1989, while serving as the Director of the Institute for Business, Ethics, and Public Issues, Dr. Stead presented a concept statement suggesting that the business school could bring together company representatives to discuss ethical concerns.  There was very little interest in establishing such an organization. On October 26 1995, she again forwarded her concept statement regarding the establishment of the Greater Houston Business Ethics Roundtable (GHBER).  This time, Dr. Stead did receive a positive response from local businesses. Shortly thereafter, GHBER was established to highlight the pivotal role of ethics in the workplace and to share "best practices." On November 16, 1999, GHBER presented Dr. Stead with the "1999 Dedicated Service Award," due to her efforts in creating this organization. In 2006 on GHBER's Tenth Anniversary, five $1000 scholarships were named in her honor. "The GHBER Bette Stead Scholarships" recognize her tireless dedication to education as well as the decisive role she played in establishing this organization. These 5 scholarships are awarded to Houston-area MBA students, and numerous major corporations belong to GHBER today.  http://www.ghber.org.</p>
         <p>In 1999, Dr. Stead became the architect of the capital campaign needs assessment that led to C.T. Bauer's $40 million endowment of the University of Houston's College of Business Administration.  She has endowed three memorial scholarships in the C. T. Bauer College of Business honoring her aunt, paternal grandparents, and parents.  These scholarships are managed by the Cougar Investment Fund, L.L.C., which allows graduate students to gain valuable experience in money-management.</p>
         <p>Dr. Stead has received the Distinguished Faculty Member Award, C. T. Bauer College of Business Alumni Association; Melcher Faculty Service Fellow for outstanding service productivity and contributions to  field, 1992-1993, 1993-1994, 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1999-2000; Melcher Award for Excellence in Service for accomplishments and contributions in all dimensions of professional service, 1995; Senior Service Award for outstanding service as mentor, scholar, and role model, Women in Management Division, Academy of Management, 1992; and was named Distinguished Alumna, Lamar University, 2004. She has endowed three memorial scholarships in the Lamar University College of Business honoring her aunt, paternal grandparents, and parents.  In 1970 she guided the work that won the MBA Magazine award, for best graduate research by a business student in the U. S. ($700 for student; $500 for UH Library).  She also was invited to the White House July 1, 1976, to attend the International Women's Year report ceremony presentation to President Gerald R. Ford.  In June 12-16, 1972, she was a participant in the "Global Strategy Discussions," Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island.</p>
         <p>She developed a course called "Marketing for Nonprofits."  Her students completed over 150 projects for Houston-area nonprofits.  Her community service also includes being president, River Oaks Business Women's Exchange Club, 1991; president, advisory board, The Women's Home (founded 1957), 501 (c)(3), only agency in Houston offering women long-term residential care, psychiatric and nurse practitioner services, psychotherapy, chemical dependency services and vocational and spiritual development programs, 2002-2004; president, board of directors, Houston Compass, Inc., (501 (c)(3) provides job leads, bus tokens, and legal aid for street people; president, board of directors, Christ Church Cathedral (Episcopal) Endowment, 2003.  She chaired the $2M renovation of Christ Church Cathedral, 1994.  She also chaired the $4M capital expansion (1999) as well as the $10M affordable housing project (2001-now) for The Women's Home. </p>
         <p>She has also published, The Adventures of December, The Women's Home Cat, about a real cat that has lived at The Women’s Home for some 20 years; and C. C. Billy Goat and the First Christ Church, based on an 1852 painting by Thomas Flintoff of the first Christ Church, which stands where Christ Church Cathedral stands today.  She has gifted the first printing and copyright for both stories to these organizations.</p>
