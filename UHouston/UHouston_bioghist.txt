<p>Maxime Faget was born on August 26, 1921, in Stannis Creek, British Honduras (now
Belize) and died on October 9, 2004, in Houston, Texas. Dr. Faget was married to the
former Nancy Carastro of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They lived in Dickinson, Texas,
with their four children, Ann Lee, Carol Lee, Nanette, and Guy. After graduating
from Louisiana State University, Faget served in the Submarine Service of the United
States Navy during World War II. During his lifetime, Faget worked as a United
States government employee, first at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
(NACA) and then later as one of the founding employees of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). Faget was on the design team for the Mercury,
Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle vehicles and held several key patents for both
Mercury and Shuttle.</p>
<p>After his retirement from government service, Faget went on to found the company
Space Industries. He began Space Industries, Inc. with the goal of placing a
commercially operated space station in orbit. This project, named the Industrial
Space Facility, was proceeding well until the disaster of Space Shuttle Challenger.
After the Challenger disaster, resistance from Congress caused several key financial
backers to pull out, effectively ending the viability of a commercial space venture
for the 1980s and 1990s. After the disaster, Space Industries first merged with the
Calspan Corporation and later with General Dynamics Corporation. It no longer exists
as an independent entity.</p>
<p>Faget received many awards during his lifetime, including being inducted into the
Space Hall of Fame and the National Inventors Hall of Fame and being elected to the
National Academy of Engineering. Faget received the Arthur S. Flemming Award in
1960. He was presented the Golden Plate Award in 1961 by the Academy of Achievement.
In 1963, he was awarded the NASA Medal for Outstanding Leadership, and in 1965, he
was given the Award of Loyola. Faget received an honorary Doctorate of Engineering
from the University of Pittsburgh in March 1966. He was an active member of the
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Faget died in 2004....</p>

<p>Irvin M. Borish was born on January 21, 1913 in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, the son a Lithuanian Jewish immigrants. His father later
contracted tuberculosis, forcing the family to move to Liberty, New York, where
Borish graduated from Liberty High School. He returned to Philadelphia in 1930
to pursue studies in English literature at Temple University. In 1932 he
enrolled in the Northern Illinois College of Optometry in Chicago.</p>
<p>Dr. Borish graduated from Northern Illinois College of Optometry in
1935 and achieved the best academic record in the institution's history. During
the same year, the Northern Illinois College of Optometry also appointed him to
the position of Instructor on the school's faculty as well as Chief of Staff
for the college's Eye Clinic. By 1942, Dr. Borish held the position of
Assistant Dean.</p>
<p>In 1944 Borish moved to Kokomo, Indiana where he started a successful
private optometric practice. A heart attack in 1973 forced him to retire from
private practice. After recovering, he assumed a full-time faculty position at
Indiana University's Optometry School. Between the 1944 and 1973 he actively
pursued many endeavors. In 1948 the first of numerous editions of
<title xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="simple" render="italic" xlink:href="">Clinical Refraction, </title>still a
standard for optometry students, was published. While in private practice,
Borish lobbied for the establishment of an optometry school in Bloomington,
Indiana, wrote nearly one hundred articles, delivered numerous lectures, served
as a visiting professor to at least nine optometry schools, and patented hard
toric and bifocal contact lenses. He also contributed to the by-laws
establishing the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry, coauthored
the original manual of Accreditation used by the Council on Education and
Accreditation in Optometry, as well as working on the by-laws of the Contact
Lens Manufacturers Association which sets standards for the safe manufacture of
contact lenses.</p>
<p>Dr. Borish retired from Indiana University in 1982, at which time he
assumed the Benedict Professorship of Optometric Practice at the University of
Houston. Since his arrival at the University of Houston, the University of
Houston College of Optometry has established the Irvin M. Borish Chair in
Optometric Practice (1987), an endowed chair with more than one million dollars
of support. In 1995, Indiana University honored him by establishing the Borish

<p>The Houston Ship Channel was established in 1914; however, Buffalo Bayou, which flows through Houston, had been used for boat navigation as early as 1839. In 1841, the mayor of Houston established the Port of Houston, which was supported by the city and later by the state of Texas. In 1880, Congressional legislation was introduced which began the involvement of the federal government in the Ship Channel.</p>
<p>The Houston Ship Channel was completed in 1914, although many additional improvements and changes have been made since that date. These include the dredging of the turning basin, allowing for larger ships to navigate the channel, and widening the entrance to the channel.</p>
<p>Several books have been written about the Port of Houston. For additional information, see:</p>

<p>The Petroleum Institute was an annual educational seminar, consisting
of three courses, held at the University of Houston from 1958 until 1994. It
was a joint effort between the Oil Information Committee of the Texas
Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association and the Department of Curriculum and
Instruction of the College of Education. University faculty and individuals
from the petroleum industry conducted the Institute. The Institute was designed
to inform participants about all aspects of the petroleum industry. By doing
so, it crossed the traditional course content fields normally taught at this
University. The areas where the content of the Institute could be used were as
follows:
<list><item>1. Sciences (emphasized earth science, geology, chemistry, and
physics)</item><item>2. Environmental Studies </item><item>3. Social Sciences (emphasized economics, geography, history,
and political science)</item></list></p>
<p>The content of the courses included presentations by lecturers from
the petroleum industry who were experts on a particular subject. The courses
also included the development of teaching materials that could be used to
infuse energy education into the curriculum. The three courses carried three
semester hours of graduate credit and were accepted by many graduate programs
within the Department of Curriculum and Instruction.</p>

<head>Organization History</head>
<p>The Houston Saengerbund (Singing Society) was founded on Oct. 6, 1883, as an organization through which German immigrants in Houston could join with their countrymen to sing songs in the German language. The Houston Saengerbund was one of a number of all-male singing organizations which formed in the German communities of Texas during the last half of the 19th century. These local groups were united under Der Deutsch-Texanische Saengerbund (the German-Texan Singers' League, or DTSB), a regional organization which held biennial meetings and Saengerfeste (Singing Festivals) in various Texas cities.</p>
<p>The Houston Saengerbund swelled to over one thousand members before World War One, and in 1913 Houston played host to a particularly elaborate DTSB Saengerfest which featured a full orchestra and world-class opera singers. But during the war years membership fell as Germans became reluctant to draw attention to their nationality.</p>
<p>After the war, membership increased and the group flourished. The Saengerbund bought their first in a series of clubhouses, and introduced new activities such as dancing, children's plays, and beach excursions. The club officially began admitting women as members in 1937 with the formation of the Ladies Auxiliary and the Damenchor (Women's Chorus).</p>
<p>With the onset of World War II, the Saengerbund members changed the name of the group to “The Houston Singing Society,” quit their primary activity of singing German songs, and began keeping minutes in English due to their concern about arousing anti-German sentiment. After the war, the club members restored both their singing and their name, but membership declined, partly owing to a drop in German immigration.</p>
<p>The Houston Saengerbund is still in existence more than one hundred years after its founding, and the Saengerbund and Damenchor continue to perform at the Saengerfeste of the DTSB, the International Festival, Lights in the Heights, and other public events.</p>

owned by the Ballentine family. When NASA announced the construction of the Manned
Spacecraft Center in this part of Harris County, astronauts and other NASA families
purchased lots and homes in the neighborhood, creating a housing boom. The community
developed into a close family-oriented neighborhood.</p>
<p>In 1962, the Timber Cove Civic Club formed an independent committee to investigate
the feasibility of constructing a swimming pool and recreation area. After an
initial survey of residents found over 70% favored the project, they held a charter
membership drive to raise funds. Charter members paid a $50 initiation fee,
$135 charter membership share and $65 annual dues. Membership
surpassed the required minimum quota of 80 initial members by March 1963.</p>
<p>The Timber Cove Recreation Association incorporated on April 10, 1963 as a non-profit
corporation to promote the public health and interests of the Timber Cove residents
by owning and operating a swimming pool and clubhouse for its members. Taylor Lake
Development Company deeded the land to the Timber Cove Recreation Association for
$10 on April 22, 1963. TCRA contracted Abernathy Company to construct the
swimming pool in May 1963. Traditional Homes built the clubhouse.</p>

Huxley's career as a writer began in the 1920s with a sequence of novels and short story collections which lampooned the pretensions of post-World War I society. Interested in a variety of literary forms, Huxley also published books of essays, travel observations, and poetry. In 1928, he published the novel <emph render="italic">Point Counter Point, </emph>an ambitious work with a vast cast of characters which explored multiple points of view and the multiple aspects of experience.</p>
<p>In 1932, Huxley released the book which would become his most famous, <emph render="italic">Brave New World. </emph>In this cautionary tale of the future, babies are bred in test tubes to become workers who, as adults, are kept docile through games, “sleep teaching,” and the calming drug “soma.” The book's success brought him celebrity and fortune, but the novels which followed suffered from Huxley's inclusion of his own instructive rhetoric. Still as prolific as ever, he continued to churn out additional stories, essays, plays, literary criticism and, following his 1937 move to Southern California, several Hollywood screenplays.</p>

<p>From its inception as a four-year institution in 1934 until the 1942-1943 academic year, the University of Houston consisted of the General College and the Junior College. All areas of academic study at the upper levels were pursued within the General College, while the Junior College provided more vocational and technical training. With the 1942-44 catalog, a new organizational plan was announced. This plan divided the General College into seven schools, based primarily on different academic disciplines.</p>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences, created in 1942, consisted of three divisions: the Division of Cultural Arts, the Division of Sciences, and the Division of Social Sciences. The departments within the College of Arts and Sciences were as varied as the divisions, with students able to pursue both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in areas ranging from drama and music to mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>The College of Arts and Sciences continued as the central instructional unit of the University of Houston through the mid-1970s. The curricula encouraged students to explore many fields of intellectual interest, while examining one field in depth. In late 1972, President Philip Hoffman appointed a committee to investigate a possible reorganization of the university's administration. One area of investigation was the possible division of the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The study found that the areas of responsibility of the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences were "too broad," making the "offering of dynamic leadership to the college almost impossible because of the numerous departments and special programs, which report to this office." With the recommendations of the study group and President Hoffman, the Board of Regents authorized the reorganization of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1975 the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three colleges: the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the College of Social Sciences.</p>

<p>Historical Note</p>
<p>The University of Houston was founded in 1927 as the Houston Junior College, operated by the Houston Independent School District. In 1934, the school was renamed the University of Houston and became a four-year college. In 1940, the first graduate degrees were awarded in the field of education. In 1945, the University became a separate, private entity with its own Board of Regents, chaired by Hugh Roy Cullen. Throughout this period E. E. Oberholtzer was the president of the University.</p>
<p>In 1950, W. W. Kemmerer became acting president of the University. Kemmerer served as president from 1952 to 1953, when C. F. McElhinney became acting president. General A. D. Bruce, who served as president until 1956 when he became chancellor of the University, followed him in 1954. Clanton W. Williams became president in 1956. In 1961, Philip G. Hoffman became president of the University of Houston. He held this position until 1977, when he became president of the UH System.</p>
<p>Biographical Notes</p>
<p>Edison E. Oberholtzer</p>
<p>From 1924-1927 Oberholtzer served as Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District. With the formation of the Houston Junior College in 1927 he was named president. He remained president through the change from a two-year to a four-year institution in 1934 and continued until shortly before his death in 1950.</p>
<p>Walter W. Kemmerer</p>
<p>In 1929 Oberholtzer offered Kemmerer the position of Director of Curriculum and Research with Houston Independent School District. He remained in this position until June 1934, when he was appointed vice-president of the University of Houston. In October 1943, the position of "vice-president" was eliminated and Kemmerer's title was changed to Comptroller and Director of Curriculum. In spring 1944 Oberholtzer created the office and title "Assistant to the President" for Kemmerer. With Oberholtzer's retirement in 1950 Kemmerer became first acting president on June 1, 1950 and president on April 15, 1952. He was asked to resign on April 27, 1953.</p>

McElhinney or "Mr. Mac") moved to Houston in 1934, taking the position of Assistant Director of Curriculum and Research for the Houston Independent School District from 1934-1939. He became Director of Research from 1939-1945, and business manager for the University of Houston which, until 1945, was operated by the Houston Independent School District. During this time he also served as a staff assistant to E. E. Oberholtzer. From 1945 until his retirement in 1973, McElhinney served as the business manager of the university.

<p>General Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was the third president and the first chancellor of the University of Houston. Bruce became president of the university on September 1, 1954 and chancellor in December 1956. He retired from the university after the 1960-61 academic year. In 1957 Bruce organized a Board of Governors, composed of the regents of the university and prominent Houstonians. In November 1959 the governing board sought state support for the University, which had grown rapidly in the preceding years. Bruce was one of the first to advocate tax support for the University of Houston.</p>
<p>Clanton W. Williams</p>
<p>Clanton Ware Williams served as the fourth president of the University of Houston from 1956-1960. Williams joined the University of Houston as Vice-President for Academic Affairs in January 1955. He was named president of the University at the December 10, 1956 meeting of the Board of Regents. At this same meeting, A.D. Bruce was named chancellor and chief executive officer of the university.

<p>The University of Houston played an important part in the United States' efforts during the Second World War. Among its many contributions, the institution housed the first Naval School established in a college, training more than five thousand Navy personnel and several hundred Army and Navy pilots. Following the war, many of the nation's servicemen and women returned to colleges and universities to take advantage of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 - better known as the GI Bill of Rights. Under the GI Bill, veterans received up to $500 a year from the government to cover tuition and fees as well as a monthly stipend.</p>
<p>Just as the University of Houston contributed to the war effort, following the war it contributed to the education of thousands of returning veterans. Dr. W.W. Kemmerer, assistant to the university president, strongly influenced the university's successful shift from a wartime to a peacetime stance. The postwar years were an era of significant growth for the fledgling institution. Many UH students used the GI Bill to further training obtained in the military, learn a vocational trade, or pursue college degrees. Enrollment for Fall semester 1944 reached 2,720, a significant increase from the 1,104 students just a year before. By the 1947-1948 school year enrollment reached 10,882.</p>
<p>To aid veterans in their transition from military to student life, UH established a guidance program with Richard O. Jonas as chief counselor and Roy A. Crouch as head of the office of psychological services. In December 1944 the U.S. Veterans Administration selected the University of Houston as the site for an official VA Advisement Center, augmenting the guidance program's effectiveness. The office provided assistance in application for admission to the university and obtaining compensation through the GI Bill. A special housing bureau helped veterans and their families locate places to live. Counselors, often former members of the armed forces themselves, aided ex-soldiers with registration, career guidance, and overall readjustment to civilian life.</p>

<p>Winfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, near Petersburg, Virginia.
After studying law at the College of William and Mary he embarked upon a
military career. During the War of 1812 he was captured by the British.
Following an exchange of prisoners, Scott fought again, was injured in the
battle of Lundy's Lane, and emerged from the war a national hero. After the war
Scott earned the reputation of a peacemaker by helping to ease the
Nullification Crisis in 1832 and settling border disputes with Canada. In 1838
Scott supervised the removal of the Cherokee from Georgia and other southern
states to reservations west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Scott was appointed commanding general of the U.S. Army in 1841.
During the Mexican-American War Scott commanded a seaborne invasion that led,
after a string of victories, to the conquest of Mexico City in 1847. Scott was
honored with an appointment to the brevet rank of lieutenant general for his
service during the war. Riding an unprecedented wave of popularity, Scott won
the Whig Party presidential nomination in 1852, but lost in the general
election to Democrat Franklin Pierce.</p>
<p>When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Scott was 75 years old and still
commander in chief of the U.S. Army. His proposed strategy to strangle
Confederate forces, called the Anaconda Plan, was criticized sharply by many.
Scott retired from military service, wrote his memoirs, traveled through
Europe, and lived to see his Anaconda Plan, in its essential form, effectively
employed to help bring an end to the Civil War. He died in West Point, New
York, on May 29, 1866.</p>

<p>Just as the University of Houston contributed to the war effort, following the war it contributed to the education of thousands of returning veterans. Many UH students used the GI Bill to further training obtained in the military, learn a vocational trade, or pursue college degrees. By 1945, a steady influx of veterans created a shortage in student housing. The Board of Regents realized the university needed more housing and on November 9, 1945 allotted $194,000 for temporary quarters. A week later UH accepted a gift of three hundred trailers. The converted navy barracks and the trailers formed a nucleus of ex-servicemen's housing known as the Veterans Village. Rent ranged from $30 to $37.50 a month.</p>
<p>The Veterans Village became a community in itself, complete with a constitution, governing council, regular newsletter, and nursery school. A veteran's club also formed on campus and drew many of its members from those living in the Village. The Veterans Club and Veterans' Council concerned themselves with veterans rights and even petitioned Congress for an investigation into local bureau of veterans affairs in late 1945 and early 1946 when numerous UH students did not receive their disbursements. In 1956, due to deteriorating conditions, the last trailer was removed as the Veterans Village yielded to the expanding campus.</p>

<p>William Wilberforce Edgerton was born August 4, 1845 in Waverly, New York to Dorothy Doud and John Leffingwell Edgerton. He was the third of four children, two older sisters and one younger brother. At the age of twelve he left home to live on his own due to the break-up of his family. His father was a traveling lecturer and teacher and was away much of the time. His younger brother lived with his sister Martha and her husband, and his mother moved in with friends in Sparta, Wisconsin, during the Civil War.</p>
<p>Edgerton survived on his own by his wits and succession of small jobs. He spent some time "peddling" but found it a poor way to make a living. He tried harness making, bar tending, and eventually even spent some time working at a race track. By the age of seventeen he found himself working as a blacksmith's apprentice. After a couple of setbacks of the Union forces and a major campaign for new recruits by President Lincoln, Edgerton decided to join the Union Army, and did so in the early part of 1862. He remained at the rank of private throughout the war, and received an honorable discharge on June 18, 1865.</p>
<p>Following his discharge, Edgerton opened a shoe store in Factoryville, New York. The shoe business failed the following year and he moved to Wisconsin. He entered Rush Medical School in Chicago and graduated fourth in his class in 1872. He established a practice in Fort Scott, Kansas for a brief time and then decided to become a country doctor in Wheeling, Missouri. He was married in 1876 and had three children.</p>
<p>After a series of personal tragedies and illnesses, he abandoned his medical practice and bought a general merchandise store in Wheeling, Missouri. He operated it profitably until 1889, at which time he became the president of the local bank. He also later served as Mayor of Wheeling. William Wilberforce Edgerton died on November 11, 1931.</p>

<p>Fritz Reuter Leiber, Jr. was born in Chicago on December 24, 1910 to Shakespearean actors Fritz Leiber, Sr. and Virginia Bronson Leiber. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1932 with a degree in psychology and physiology, and, in 1936, married Jonquil Stephens, a British poet with similar interests in the supernatural. They had one son, Justin Leiber, in 1938. Several years after Jonquil's death in 1969, he married Margo Skinner. His employment throughout the years included editorial positions and teaching drama, but Fritz Leiber primarily supported himself with his writing.</p>
<p>Producing stories in the genres of fantasy, science, horror, and supernatural fiction from the mid 1930s until his death in 1992, Fritz Leiber won several prominent fantasy and science fiction awards such as the Hugo, the Nebula, and the World Fantasy Association Awards. Although he wrote numerous stories in variety of styles, Leiber is perhaps best known for the heroic Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser characters he created with his college friend, Harry Otto Fischer (1910-1986), and which he continued to embellish through a series of short stories and novels throughout his long writing career and correspondence with Fischer.</p>

<p>Tatiana Semenova was born in St. Petersburg, Russia on July 17, 1920. She moved with her family to Paris when she was five. At the age of seven she began studying at the dancing school of Matilda Kchessinska, a legendary Russian ballerina and wife of Grand Duke Andrei of Russia.</p>
<p>Madame Semenova made her stage debut when she was eleven with a Russian opera company formed in London by Sir Thomas Beecham. The following year she began her formal dance career as a member of the Col. Vassili de Basil's famed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, touring the United States and South America. In 1937 Semenova joined the Paris Opera Ballet as premiere danseuse starring in stage entertainments with Lucien Boyer, Sascha Guitry, Maurice Chevalier and Charles Trenet.</p>
<p>During World War II, in coordination with the United Service Organizations (USO), Semonova formed a group called the Foxhole Ballet to tour Europe and Africa. While performing in Rome on a bomb damaged stage her leg went through a weak board; she severed the cartilage in her left knee and suffered a compound fracture in her right arm. The accident ended her dancing career.</p>
<p>In early 1946 Semenova returned to America and began her teaching career at the School of Dance Arts, Carnegie Hall, in New York City. Backed by a former USO contact, she formed American Youth Ballet in 1950 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1954, Semonova brought the American Youth Ballet to Houston. The following year, the newly formed Houston Foundation for Ballet invited her to form the Houston Ballet Academy - the precursor to the Houston Ballet. She remained director of the Academy for eleven years. Academy dancers also appeared in selected Houston Grand Opera performances.</p>
<p>In 1966, the Houston Ballet Academy Board of Directors pressed for a professional performing company under a new artistic director. Semonova declined an offer to continue as teacher and advisor. She resigned to form her own company, Ballet of Houston, which debuted in 1968. The company thrived through the middle 1980s. Despite increasing physical problems Semenova continued to teach privately in Houston until her death at the age of 76 on September 24, 1996. She is buried next to her mother, Olga Semenova, in the cemetery of St. Michael Island in Venice, Italy.</p>

<p>Colonel Israel Shreve was born in 1739 in New Jersey. Before rising to a position of military leadership in General George Washington's Continental Army during the American Revolution, he worked as a farmer in Gloucester County.</p>
<p>On October 31, 1775, Shreve was appointed Lieutenant Colonel of the Second Regiment of New Jersey troops. On November 28, 1776, he was promoted to Colonel for the reorganized line, which was now known as the Second New Jersey Regiment, Second Establishment.</p>
<p>The 2nd N.J. Regiment fought at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, and at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777. They also spent the cold winter of 1777, short of clothing and food supplies, with Washington's troops at Valley Forge.</p>
<p>On June 28, 1778, Shreve played a part in the strange events of the Battle of Monmouth. Major General Charles Lee led the advance column against the British troops, but gave his men hasty orders to retreat after being startled by a counterattack from the British. He did not give word of his decision to General Washington, who was following behind him with the main army. As an angry Washington met up with columns of confused troops falling back from the front, he pressed the approaching Colonel Israel Shreve for an explanation. "Colonel Shreve answered in a very significant manner, smiling, that he did not know, but that he had retreated by order, he did not say by whose order." Following the Battle of Monmouth, Lee was court-martialled and removed from command.</p>
<p>In July of 1779, Shreve and the 2nd N.J. Regiment joined Major General John Sullivan in his campaign against the Tory-allied Iroquois Indians. Shreve was appointed commander of the expedition's base at Fort Sullivan at Tioga, while General Sullivan and his troops went on a punishing spree against the Indians, burning 40 of their towns and destroying corn, vegetables, and orchards.</p>
<p>According to one source, Shreve was "immensely fat" and such an incompetent officer that in December of 1780 Washington declined to promote him to Brigadier General, saying, "Here I drop the curtain." Shreve retired from the army on January 1, 1781, but for inexplicable reasons remained in command through the rest of the month. In early January, troops in the Pennsylvania Line mutinied over lack of pay and other grievances. When the New Jersey Line followed suit on January 20, Shreve by all accounts botched or neglected handling the situation. At the end of January, Elias Dayton took over as Colonel.</p>
<p>Shreve apparently participated in the General Assembly of New Jersey following the end of his military career. In April 1783, members of the New Jersey Line requested that he represent them to the Assembly on the issue of receiving five years' full pay at the end of their service, rather than half-pay for life.</p>
<p>Shreve returned to farming after the war, eventually settling in the west with his wife and children. He died in 1799.</p>

<p>Stephen Fuller Austin was born on November 3, 1793 in Virginia to Maria and Moses Austin. He was educated in Connecticut and at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He later became involved in his father's lead mining business in Missouri. Austin also studied law in New Orleans. During his time in Missouri, Austin served in the state legislature for five years.</p>
<p>Following his father's death in 1821, Austin took over the responsibilities of his father's land grant of 200,000 acres from the Spanish, obtaining ratification for the grant from the newly established Mexican government. Austin succeeded in settling hundreds of families in his colony, creating Anglo-Texas. Austin attempted to prevent his colony from being entangled in the constant political turmoil in Mexico during the 1820s and first years of the 1830s. Austin worked to establish formal relations with Native Americans in the area.</p>
<p>Unable to prevent colonists from fighting against Mexican rule, Austin participated in the Texas Revolution in 1835 as commander of the volunteer army from his colony's region. Austin also acted as a Commissioner, responsible for raising support for Texas from the United States during the Revolution. Following the Revolution, Austin was defeated in his bid for the presidency of Texas. He served as the Secretary of State under President Sam Houston, the man who had defeated him in the election. Austin died on December 27, 1836.</p>

<head>Biographical Information</head>
<p>Minnie Fisher Cunningham, woman suffrage leader and leading liberal Democrat, the daughter
of Horatio White and Sallie Comer (Abercrombie) Fisher, was born on March 19, 1882, on
Fisher Farms, near New Waverly, Texas. Her father was a prominent planter who served in the
House of Representatives of the Seventh Texas Legislature in 1857-58. He introduced her to
politics by taking her to political meetings at Huntsville. After having been educated by
her mother, Minnie passed a state examination to earn a teaching certificate when she was
sixteen. She taught for a year before enrolling in the University of Texas Medical Branch at
Galveston. In 1901 she became one of the first women to receive a degree in pharmacy in
Texas; she worked as a pharmacist in Huntsville for a year, but she later said that inequity
in pay "made a suffragette out of me." In 1902 she married Beverly Jean (Bill) Cunningham, a
lawyer and insurance executive. His successful race for county attorney as a reform
candidate was her first taste of the campaign trail, but the marriage was unhappy, in part
because of her increasing political activity and his alcoholism.</p>
<p>The Cunninghams moved to Galveston in 1907. By 1910 she was elected president of the
Galveston Equal Suffrage Association and toured Texas to speak for the cause. In 1915 she
was elected to the first of four annual terms as president of the Texas Woman Suffrage
Association (subsequently the Texas Equal Suffrage Association). The number of local
auxiliaries quadrupled during her first year in office, largely because of her leadership.
In 1917 she moved to Austin, opened state suffrage headquarters near the Capitol, and began
a campaign that culminated in legislative approval for woman suffrage in state primary
elections in 1918.</p>
<p>In 1919 Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association,
persuaded Minnie Cunningham to lobby Congress for the Nineteenth Amendment. When the
amendment finally was passed and submitted to the states for ratification, Cunningham said
she "pursued governors all over the west" and urged them to ratify it. That same year, she
helped organize the National League of Women Voters and became its executive secretary.
Twenty years later Eleanor Roosevelt recalled that Cunningham's address at the league's
second annual convention made her feel "that you had no right to be a slacker as a citizen,
you had no right not to take an active part in what was happening to your country as a
whole."</p>
<p>Minnie Cunningham was widowed in 1927 and traveled to Texas to settle her husband's estate.
The following year she became the first Texas woman to run for the United States Senate. She
challenged Earle B. Mayfield, the incumbent, with a platform that advocated prohibition,
tariff reduction, tax reform, farm relief, flood control, cooperation with the League of
Nations, and opposition to the Ku Klux Klan. She finished fifth of six in the primary,
carrying only her home county, Walker. She then campaigned for Thomas T. Connally, the
runner-up, who edged out Mayfield in the runoff.</p>
<p>From 1930 to 1939 Cunningham worked in College Station as an editor for the Texas A&amp;M
Extension Service. She returned to Washington in 1939 to work as an information specialist
for the Women's Division of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt is credited with having given her the nickname by which she later became
widely known, "Minnie Fish." She resigned in 1943 to protest a rule impeding the flow of
information to farmers.</p>
<p>In 1944, at the Democratic state convention, anti-Roosevelt forces elected "uninstructed"
delegates to the national convention, effectively disenfranchising the voters of Texas.
Outraged, Roosevelt supporters elected their own slate of delegates at a rump convention.
When a coalition of liberal Democrats failed to draft J. Frank Dobie as a candidate for
governor, Cunningham ran herself. Angry that the incumbent governor, Coke Stevenson, did not
take a public stand on the split, she ran an outspoken campaign, calling on Stevenson to
declare his views, and prevented his leading the anti-Roosevelt delegation to the national
convention. Stevenson won the primary by a landslide. Nevertheless, in a field of nine
candidates, Cunningham finished second.</p>
<p>In 1946 she retired to Fisher Farms in New Waverly to raise cattle and pecans, but she
continued to campaign for the Democratic party and organized ad hoc committees to support
liberal causes. When the board of regents fired the president of the University of Texas,
Homer P. Rainey, she opposed the regents' decision and supported Rainey's unsuccessful bid
for the governorship. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of
Education she supported civil rights on her local school board. In 1952 she stumped for
Adlai Stevenson for president and Ralph Yarborough for governor. Prepared to mortgage her
farm to ensure the continuation of a liberal voice in Texas journalism, she played a pivotal
role in founding the Texas Observer in 1954. Also in the 1950s she helped start Democrats of
Texas, an organization of liberals. In 1960, at the age of seventy-eight, she managed the
campaign headquarters for John F. Kennedy in New Waverly. Minnie Cunningham died on December
9, 1964, and was buried in New Waverly.</p>

<p>Faculty Association</p>
<p>The Faculty Association of the University of Houston Constitution and
By - Laws, adopted</p>
<p>January 20, 1947 outlined the principle purposes as: to foster a bond
of fellowship among its members; to promote the progress of the University of
Houston; to act as a service organization and open forum, and to direct the
operation of the Faculty Club. Membership was limited to full time faculty,
including research faculty of the University of Houston whose duties were
primarily non-administrative.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1962, a faculty committee concluded that the first
three parts of the Faculty Association Constitution were being served by the
Faculty Senate, and that the sole purpose of the Faculty Associates seemed to
be; "To direct the operation of the Faculty Club." The merger Committee
recommended the amalgamation of the two associations and that a committee
composed of the Chairman of the two organization plus two members at large be
appointed to rewrite the constitution and by laws of the new organization to be
named: University of Houston Faculty Club.</p>
<p>Faculty Assembly</p>
<p>The Faculty Assembly consisted of almost 100 representatives from the
institutional department and colleges, with the number of representatives
varying from four to one, depending upon the student enrollment within the
component involved. The Assembly had an elected president and secretary, a
14-person Faculty Council with its own Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and
representative to the Executive Council; and an eight-person Steering
Committee. Dr. T.C. Sinclair stated that the purpose of the Faculty Assembly
would be to create a "real faculty community of scholars" and that the work of
the Assembly would be carried on largely by committees. </p>
<p>Faculty Senate</p>
<p>Faculty Senate adopted its formal Constitution in May 1961, with the
goal of providing</p>
<p>"an instrument for cooperative action in attaining such ends as the
member may select." The Faculty Senate reorganized, freely, in 1962 at the
beginning of the Hoffman administration and formed several new committees
including a Committee on University Committees, Student Life, Educational
Policy, and Faculty Affairs. The first official faculty handbook was also
completed during this period. The Faculty Senate consists of 52 permanent
members elected by the faculty.</p>
<p>Shared governance is now a major goal of the organization and is
defined by the Faculty Senate as the "collective commitment of the faculty and
administration at the University of Houston to work cooperatively, together
with the University Constituencies, to achieve a common vision of excellence
for the University. </p>

<p>Samuel Houston, known as the Father of Texas, was born on March 2, 1793, in Virginia. His father, Samuel Houston, was a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Following his father's death in 1807, his mother, Elizabeth (Paxton) Houston moved the family to Tennessee. Sam Houston did not have a formal education, instead attending school when possible.</p>
<p>Sam Houston had an active political life. Trained in law, he was elected as district attorney for Nashville at the age of 25. Soon after, he was appointed adjutant general of Tennessee. He was elected to Congress from Tennessee in 1823 and again in 1825. In 1827 he was elected governor of Tennessee. He resigned from this position in 1829 and began working in Indian territory for the Cherokees. He was made a member of the Cherokee Nation.</p>
<p>Houston first traveled in Texas in 1832. He attended the Convention of 1833 as a delegate from Nacogdoches, although he does not appear to have been a long-term resident of the area until 1835. In November 1835 he was elected major general of the Texas Army. He signed the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836. On April 21, 1836, he led the Texas Army to victory over the forces of General Santa Anna in the Battle of San Jacinto.</p>
<p>On September 5, 1836, Houston was elected President of the Republic of Texas. September 6, 1841, he was elected again to that position, having served as a representative to the Texas Congress during Mirabeau Lamar's presidency. On February 21, 1846, Houston was elected to the U. S. Senate where he served almost 14 years. In 1859 he was elected as governor of Texas. Because he did not support the dissolution of the Union, he was removed from office in 1861.</p>
<p>Sam Houston died on July 26, 1863, on his farm near Huntsville, Texas.</p>

<p>Mary Smith was born on July 24, 1819 in territory that later became Lawrence County, Arkansas. Her mother, a widow, moved her family to Brazoria County, Texas in 1834 when Mary was 15. The family settled on a farm in Brazoria County. Her mother married John Woodruff, a widower with several children. The Woodruff-Smith family left the farm during the Texas Revolution for safer regions farther east, returning after the Battle of San Jacinto.</p>
<p>Mary married Hugh McCrory on July 23, 1837 in Houston. McCrory was a soldier with Felix Huston's volunteers who became a Houston businessman following his release. McCrory died a few weeks after his marriage to Mary.</p>
<p>Mary met Anson Jones when he began boarding at the Woodruff house in Houston while he was serving in the Texas legislature. They planned to marry in 1838, following the end of Mary's year of mourning, but had to put aside their plans when Jones was appointed ambassador to the United States from Texas. Following his return the couple was married on May 17, 1840. Jones served as President of the Republic of Texas from 1844 to 1846, when Texas became part of the United States and James Pinkney Henderson became the first governor of the State of Texas.</p>
<p>Mary and Anson Jones had four children: Samuel Houston (later changed to Samuel Edward) (born [1841]), Charles Edward (born [1843]), Sallie S. (born [1845]), and Cromwell Anson (born [1849]). Jones committed suicide in January 1858, following a defeated bid to become the senator from Texas. Mary was widowed a second time at age 39.</p>
<p>Following Jones' death in 1858, Mary moved the family to Galveston, then to a farm in Harris County. Her husband had acquired land throughout east Texas during his life, and dealing with taxes, claims, and sales of the land occupied much of Mary's time throughout her life, as evidenced by her letters. She relied heavily on her children to assist her in her dealings with these legal and financial problems.</p>
<p>Samuel Edward and Charles served in the Confederate Army, where Charles died at the Battle of Shiloh. Samuel Edwards became a successful dentist. Sallie married R. G. Ashe and had at least one son, C. E. Ashe, who became a lawyer. Cromwell Anson became a lawyer and served as judge in Harris County, Texas until his death in 1888.</p>
<p>Mary became actively involved in the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, serving as its first president. She died on December 31, 1907. Her daughter, Sallie (Jones) Ashe, became an active member of the organization as well.</p>

<p>George Kirksey, sportswriter, traveler, and baseball promoter, was born in Hillsboro, Texas on February 22, 1904. Following his graduation from high school in Hillsboro in 1923, he attended the University of Texas at Austin for two and a half years, where he studied journalism and worked part-time for local newspapers.</p>
<p>Kirksey became a sportswriter for United Press in 1927. During the 1930s he became a well-known figure in sports journalism, publishing hundreds of articles. In 1933 he was sent by UP to China, India, Egypt, and Italy to write a number of travel stories. He married Ethel Shutta, singer and actress, in 1940.</p>
<p>During World War II, Kirksey joined the Air Force as a public relations officer with the rank of First Lieutenant with the Ninth Army Air Force Division. By the end of the war, Kirksey had achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, received several commendations for his work, and had been in Egypt, Libya, England, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>Following his return from service, Kirksey and his wife moved to Houston. Kirksey opened a public relations firm and became involved in several local enterprises. He founded the Houston Civil War Round Table during the mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Kirksey's primary activity involved bringing major league baseball to Houston. In the late 1940s Kirksey began this work, which would include several different attempts to force the major leagues into allowing Houston to have a team. Kirksey was a supporter of the Continental League, which would have been a direct competitor with the American and National Leagues, and led a group of prominent Houstonians in their futile attempt to purchase the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952.</p>
<p>In 1957 he joined with several other men including R. E. "Bob" Smith, Roy Hofheinz, and Paul Richards to form the Houston Sports Association. This group would eventually become the owners of the Colt .45s (later known as the Houston Astros), following the expansion of the National League into Houston in 1962.</p>
<p>Kirksey held the position of Executive Vice-President within the Houston Sports Association until 1966. During this time, he was instrumental in the promotion of the team and the "Eighth Wonder of the World," the Astrodome. Kirksey was also involved in the various controversies surrounding the Astrodome and its baseball team. In 1965 Kirksey realized that he was being pushed from the Houston Sports Association, as Roy Hofheinz moved to take control of the organization.</p>
<p>On July 21, 1961 he married Billie Joyce Smith. He and Ethel Shutta Kirksey had divorced in 1957. Kirksey had no children of his own but had two step-sons from his marriage with Ethel Shutta. Kirksey and Billie Joyce (Smith) Kirksey were divorced on November 13, 1964.</p>
<p>After Kirksey's contract with the Houston Sports Association was denied renewal, he sold his share of the Astros to Roy Hofheinz in 1965, who later became sole owner of the team. Kirksey toyed with creating a new football team in Houston to challenge Bud Adams' Oilers, but quickly lost interest.</p>
<p>Kirksey became fairly wealthy from the sale of his share of the Astros, as well as the sale of his stock in KTRK, the first commercial television station in Houston. With this new-found wealth, Kirksey began traveling, primarily in Europe and the Caribbean. During this time he wrote a series of travel articles that were published in the Houston Post, and he became involved in auto racing. Kirksey spent most of his last years traveling in Western Europe. Kirksey died in France in 1971 in an automobile accident.</p>

The two armies were camped within a mile of each other near Harrisburg, Texas.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 21, the outnumbered Texans, led by Sam Houston, staged a surprise attack and routed the Mexican forces within twenty minutes. General Santa Anna escaped initially, only to be discovered later disguised as a Mexican soldier.</p>
<p>Due to the events at the Battle of San Jacinto, the Republic of Texas gained its freedom from Mexico, and remained independent until 1845, when it was annexed to the United States.</p>

<p>Charles Tellus Townsend was a local police officer who captured photographs of the aftermath of the Texas City Disaster in 1947.</p>
<p>One of the worst disasters in Texas history occurred on April 16, 1947, when the ship SS Grandcamp exploded at 9:12 A.M. at the docks in Texas City. The French-owned vessel, carrying explosive ammonium nitrate caught fire early in the morning, and while attempts were being made to extinguish the fire, the ship exploded. The entire dock area was destroyed, along with the nearby Monsanto Chemical Company, other smaller companies, grain warehouses, and numerous oil and chemical storage tanks. Smaller explosions and fires were ignited, by flying debris, along the industrial area and also throughout the city. Fragments of iron, parts of the ship's cargo, and dock equipment were hurled into businesses, houses, and public buildings. A fifteen-foot tidal wave caused by the force swept the dock area. The concussion of the explosion, felt as far away as Port Arthur, damaged or destroyed at least 1,000 residences and buildings throughout Texas City. The ship SS High Flyer, in dock for repairs and also carrying ammonium nitrate, was ignited by the first explosion; it was towed 100 feet from the docks before it exploded about sixteen hours later, at 1:10 A.M. on April 17. The first explosion had killed twenty-six Texas City firemen and destroyed all of the city's fire-fighting equipment, including four trucks, leaving the city helpless in the wake of the second explosion. Probably the exact number of people killed will never be known, although the ship's anchor monument records 576 persons known dead, 398 of whom were identified, and 178 listed as missing.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Donald Barthelme, Sr. was a prominent Houston architect and professor
at the University of Houston and Rice University. He was the first Houston
architect to attain international recognition, and during the 1950s was one of
the city’s best known architects. His career was notable because he combined
a distinguished architectural practice with an intense commitment to
architectural education.</p>
<p>Barthelme was born in Galveston, Texas on August 4, 1907. He attended
the Rice Institute in Houston for two years before transferring in 1926 to the
University of Pennsylvania, where he studied under the French master Paul
Philippe Cret. He graduated in 1930, winning the Arthur Spayd Brook Bronze
Medal for Design. After graduation he worked first in Cret’s office and then
in the Philadelphia firm of Zantzinger, Borie, and Medary.</p>
<p>The Great Depression forced Barthelme to return to Texas late in 1932.
He practiced on his own in Galveston for several years, surviving on small
commissions. In 1935 he moved to Houston to work for noted architect John F.
Staub, but stayed only a few months before being called to Dallas to work on
the Texas Centennial Exposition. There he was the lead designer of the Hall of
State, the centerpiece of the exposition and today considered a masterpiece of
the Art Deco style. In 1937 he returned to Staub’s office in Houston, where
he remained for two years before leaving to open his own practice. In the early
1940s he did war-related work, first as a designer on the Avion Village Housing
Project near Dallas, and later as supervising architect for the Big Spring Air
Base in West Texas and defense housing projects in Galveston and Sweeny, Texas.
</p>
<p>Barthelme’s career began in earnest in 1942, with the first of many
projects for the West Columbia Independent School District in Brazoria County,
Texas. Over the next two decades his school designs earned national and
international awards and appeared in numerous publications. His best known
project, and arguably his best work, was the West Columbia Elementary School
(1951). He designed other elementary schools in West Columbia and Sweeny,
Texas; additions to the high schools in West Columbia and Sweeny; and finally,
the West Columbia Senior High School (1963). During the 1950s he was
acknowledged as an expert on the design of schools, and wrote and lectured
extensively on the subject. This led to his election in 1955 as a Fellow of the
American Institute of Architects, an honor accorded architects who make a
significant contribution to the advancement of architecture. </p>
<p>Although he retired from active practice in 1963, he continued to
participate in competitions and in 1964 was one of seven finalists in the
competition to design the headquarters building for the American Institute of
Architects in Washington, D.C. His other works include the Barthelme Residence
(1941), St. Rose of Lima Church and School (1948), the Adams Petroleum Center
(1957), and Highland Heights Elementary School (1959) in Houston. St. Rose of
Lima was the first modernist Catholic church in Houston, and was the first
Houston building to win an award of merit from the A.I.A.</p>
<p>Barthelme began his other major professional endeavor in 1946, when he
joined the faculty of the Architecture Department at the University of Houston.
He helped shape the program in its early years and was an influential member of
the faculty until his retirement in 1973. He also served as William Ward Watkin
Professor and chairman of the Architecture Department at Rice University from
1959 to 1961. He is remembered at both institutions for his rigorous standards
and for his efforts to redesign the curriculum to integrate all parts of the
architectural education process. He also was a visiting professor at the
University of Pennsylvania and Tulane University.</p>
<p>In retirement Barthelme turned to writing, as he recorded ideas
developed over a lifetime of practice and teaching. In the late 1970s he began
writing a book promoting his philosophy that architects should be more
concerned with the user’s experience of architecture than with its purely
formal aspects. Together with his voluminous lecture notes, the partial
manuscript and related materials in the collection form a body of writing that
captures the humanist values he tried to instill in his students.</p>
<p>Barthelme married Helen Bechtold (1907–1995) of Philadelphia on June
21, 1930. From 1931 to 1947 the couple had five children: Donald, Joan, Peter,
Frederick, and Steven. Donald (1931–1989) achieved fame as a writer and
novelist and from 1980 to 1989 was a professor at the University of Houston,
where he helped establish the reputation of the University’s acclaimed
Creative Writing Program. The Donald Barthelme Literary Papers are housed in a
separate collection in the University of Houston Libraries’ Department of
Special Collections. Also accomplished writers, Frederick and Steven Barthelme
teach Creative Writing at the University of Southern Mississippi on the faculty
of the university’s Center for Writers. Peter has also published several
novels, while Joan served for many years as an executive with a large Houston
oil company. </p>
<p>Donald Barthelme, Sr. died on July 16, 1996.</p>

4th, a group of ABDA ships attempted to intercept a Japanese force in the
Makassar Straits, but were attacked by Japanese bombers. One of the bombs
destroyed the <emph render="italic">Houston's</emph> rear 8-inch gun turret,
killing 48 men and injuring 20 others. </p>
<p>On February 27, the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> was among a
fleet of ABDA ships that engaged a Japanese task force that was advancing on
eastern Java. In the eight-hour Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese inflicted
defeat upon the ABDA ships, sinking or crippling two Dutch cruisers and three
destroyers. Although the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> was hit twice by
Japanese 8" shells, she and the Australian light cruiser HMAS
<emph render="italic">Perth</emph> both survived the battle.</p>
<p>On the night of February 28, the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph>
and the <emph render="italic">Perth</emph> attempted to pass through Sunda
Strait in an effort to reach the safer waters of the Indian Ocean. As they
approached the entrance to the strait, they unexpectedly encountered a Japanese
force that was protecting the invasion fleet. In the ensuing battle, four
torpedoes struck and sunk the <emph render="italic">Perth.</emph> The
<emph render="italic">Houston</emph> managed to hit three destroyers and sink a
minesweeper, but was struck by four torpedoes and started to sink. Following
orders to abandon ship, crew members jumped over the sides and began to swim
for the distant shore of Java. The Battle of Sunda Strait and the sinking of
the ship took the lives of 700 of the <emph render="italic">Houston's</emph>
1068 crew members.</p>
<p>When news of the ship’s sinking reached Houstonians, they raised
money to build the light cruiser USS Houston (CL-81), as well as a small
aircraft carrier. On Memorial Day, 1942, one thousand “Houston Volunteers”
were sworn into the Navy to symbolically replace the <emph render="italic">Houston's</emph> crew, who were all presumed dead.</p>
<p>In Java or its surrounding waters, the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> crew members who survived the sinking were taken
prisoner by the Japanese. They were marched to the town of Serang and held
there until April 1942, when most of the men were transported to "Bicycle Camp"
in Batavia. There the men of the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> were
joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, a National
Guard unit from Texas (nicknamed the “Lost Battalion”). </p>
<p>In October, the majority of the POWs were taken to Moulmein, Burma,
while the rest were sent to work in various camps throughout Asia. There they
became slave labor for a Japanese project to build a railroad for transporting
troops and supplies from Thailand to Burma. Sixty-one thousand Allied
prisoners-of-war and over 200,000 Asian natives worked on the Burma-Thai
Railway, which eventually stretched 250 miles between mountains, across rivers,
and through jungles. The men were fed starvation rations, beaten frequently,
and subject to illnesses such as beri beri, pellagra, malaria, and tropical
ulcers.</p>
<p>Nearly 13,000 Allied POWs and 100,000 Asian natives died building the
“Death Railway,” including 79 men from the <emph render="italic">Houston</emph>. Upon the railway's completion in October 1943,
the surviving POWs were scattered to various camps in Singapore, Burma,
Indochina, and Japan. On August 16, 1945, the POWs learned that the war was
over and they were to return home. </p>
<p>Following the war, survivor Otto Schwarz formed the USS
<emph render="italic">Houston</emph> Survivors Association, whose newsletter
was named the <emph render="italic">Blue Bonnet</emph> after the original
ship's newsletter. Many survivors kept in touch by attending annual reunions
with their friends from the Lost Battalion. In 1981, the survivors donated a
collection of archival materials and memorabilia to the UH Libraries, which
built a Cruiser Houston Memorial Room to display the items. On March 21, 1981,
they celebrated the launch of another ship named “Houston,” the nuclear
powered submarine USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (SSN-713). And in
1995, the Texas Commandery of the Naval Order of the United States dedicated a
monument to the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> and her crew in
downtown Houston. </p>
<p>In 1991 the Survivors Association formed a complementary group called
the Next Generation, made up of children and younger relatives of survivors.
Under the direction of Next Generation members Val Roberts-Poss and Lin Drees,
and co-editor Otto Schwarz, the <emph render="italic">Blue Bonnet</emph>
continues to come out four times a year. Roberts-Poss and Drees also organize
an annual memorial service in Houston at the site of the downtown monument.</p>

<p>Donald Barthelme, short story writer, novelist, editor, journalist,
and teacher, was born in Philadelphia on April 7, 1931. In 1933, his family
moved to Houston, Texas where his father, Donald Barthelme, Sr., soon
established himself as a well-known architect in the style of Mies and
Corbusier. Barthelme got an early start in journalism at St. Thomas and Lamar
High Schools in Houston. </p>
<p>In the fall of 1949, he enrolled at the University of Houston where he
worked on the staff of the <emph render="italic">Daily Cougar</emph> and, as a
20-year-old sophomore journalism major, was the youngest student in the
<emph render="italic">Cougar</emph>'s history to hold the position of editor.
Before graduating, he was drafted into the Army in February of 1953, served in
Korea and worked on an Army newspaper there. When he returned to Houston in
late 1954, he began working as a reporter for the <emph render="italic">Houston
Post</emph>. In September of 1955, he began working for Farris Block at the
University of Houston News Service, writing speeches for the President of the
University, and, the next year, he succeeded Block as editor of
<emph render="italic">Acta Diurna</emph>, a weekly newsletter for University of
Houston faculty and staff.</p>
<p>The University of Houston published the first issue of
<emph render="italic">Forum</emph> in September 1956. Founded by Barthelme and
edited by him until 1960, this quarterly journal featured articles on a wide
range of topics including philosophy, literary criticism, economics,
anthropology, psychology, biology, mathematics, architecture, film, music, and
theater. In 1961, Barthelme became director of the Contemporary Arts Museum in
Houston but resigned the following year to move to New York and pursue his
career as a writer.</p>
<p>Once in New York, he began to publish frequently in the
<emph render="italic">New Yorker</emph> where Roger Angell became his editor
and mentor. As a writer, Barthelme has been characterized as an avant-garde or
postmodern stylist who relies more on language than plot or character. Upon
arriving in New York, he also served as editor of Harold Rosenberg and Thomas
Hess's art and literature journal, <emph render="italic">Location</emph>, for
the publication's short life of two issues. He lived in New York for 18 years,
occasionally teaching at the City University of New York, and then, in 1980,
moved back to Houston to serve as the Director of the Creative Writing Program
at the University of Houston. Barthelme died of throat cancer in 1989 at the
age of 58.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Kenneth Patchen, a pioneer in avant-garde poetry, the picture poem, and poetry jazz, was born on December 13, 1911 in Niles, Ohio. Patchen seemed destined to a life of physical labor in the local steel mills before a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin took him away from the industrial Ohio valley and allowed him to take part in the Alexander Meikeljohn Experimental College. After completing a year at the University of Wisconsin and a few
months at the Commonwealth College in Mena, Arkansas, he ended his university studies and began three years of traveling and working at odd jobs.
</p>
<p>In December of 1933, Patchen met Miriam Oikemos, an anti-war organizer and college student from Smith College, whom he married on June 28, 1934. Miriam Patchen was an active participant in her husband's endeavors, working beside him writing bibliographies and biographical sketches under the assumed name Gail Eaton. Miriam also took care of her husband during his intervals of poor health, especially during physical the decline of his last twelve years.</p>
<p>Patchen's first book, Before the Brave, was published in 1936. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for this work the same year.</p>
<p>Patchen sought to expand the experiential element of poetry and he made two significant contributions: the picture poem and poetry-jazz. The first contribution was a fusion of painting and poetry in which he combined fanciful, colorful images with his unusual verse in his childlike hand. This form, known as the picture poem, was released in portfolios filled with silk screen printings of Patchen's original art work.</p>
<p>In the late 50s, Patchen redirected his focus from the visual realm to the audio frontier. The result was poetry-jazz ,the reading of poetry against the backdrop of jazz music.Traveling to Los Angeles and San Francisco, Patchen appeared at night clubs such as the Black Hawk, made college appearances and recorded with the Allyn Ferguson Jazz Sextet.</p>
<p>Kenneth Patchen's work was produced amidst constant physical pain. The pain was the result of a back injury sustained when he was twenty-six. For the rest of his life he was haunted by surgeries, misdiagnoses, surgical mishaps and suffering, which often times limited his creative explorations. Fellow poets such as T.S Eliot, Thorton Wilder, Archibald MacLeish, W.H. Auden, e.e. cummings and others banded together to set up a surgery fund for Patchen in the early fifties. A surgery in 1956 gave Patchen some relief, but a surgical mistake in 1959 left him almost completely bedridden for the rest of his life. Patchen refused to take pain medication because he felt it would dull his creative powers.</p>
<p>Between 1936 and the conclusion of his writing career Patchen published 43 books of poetry, prose and picture poems. Although often associated with the Beat movement, he took great care to dissassociate himself from any form of labeling. He died on January 8, 1972 in Palo Alto, California, where he and Miriam had lived for the preceding twenty years.</p>

<p>Jan de Hartog was born in Haarlem, Netherlands on April 22, 1914. His father, Arnold Hendrik, was a theologian; his mother, Lucretia Meijjes de Hartog, a scholar of medieval mysticism. He attended Amsterdam Naval College, and worked as a sailor, war correspondent and naval inspector before achieving success as an author and playwright.</p>
<p>Although de Hartog published five detective novels under the pseudonym F. R. Eckmar in the 1930's, his first noteworthy work was the novel Holland's Glorie (1940). Published in Dutch 10 days before the outbreak of the Second World War, the work sold over one million copies and was regarded as an essential expression of Dutch identity in wartime. The book made him a public figure in the Netherlands, and he used this platform to speak out against German occupation. In early 1942, de Hartog was forced to go into hiding and eventually fled the Netherlands under threat of arrest. After a lengthy journey across Western Europe, he arrived in England in July, 1943.</p>
<p>De Hartog spent the next decade in England, writing novels and plays in English. In 1946, he married Angela Priestly, daughter of English writer J.B. Priestly. One of his first English language works was the play Skipper Next to God, about a captain carrying European Jews to the United States. It debuted in London in 1945 and was later performed on Broadway. The 1951 comedy The Four Poster brought de Hartog his broadest and most enduring success. After runs in London and American repertory theater, its Broadway run, starring Hume Cronin and Jessica Tandy, earned the 1952 Tony award for Best Play. De Hartog collaborated on a French adaptation with the writer Collette, and the work was later adapted as a musical, I Do I Do!, and a television play. His novels of this period included The Lost Sea (1951), The Little Ark (1951), and A Sailor's Life (1955).</p>
<p>His marriage to Marjorie Mein in 1961 led de Hartog to become a Quaker. The couple lived on a 146-ton houseboat for several years before marrying, and first came to Houston on boat travel. In 1962, Jan assumed a residency in playwriting at the University of Houston, during which time the couple volunteered at Jefferson Davis Hospital. As a volunteer, de Hartog was exposed to the horrible conditions facing patients and staff at Harris County's charity hospital. His work, The Hospital, exposes the conditions and treatment received by patients at Jefferson Davis Hospital (later renamed Ben Taub Hospital). His book received national acclaim, drawing attention to needed changes in the charity hospital system in Houston. In the wake of The Hospital's publication, the de Hartogs became a target of threats and unwanted harassment which ultimately led to the couple leaving Houston in 1964.</p>
<p>The de Hartogs remained active in progressive social causes, using the proceeds from The Hospital book to finance aide programs. Further involvement in peace and social justice efforts lead the couple to become advocates of charity to Korean and Vietnamese war orphans, and in the process they adopted two Korean children. He chronicled these events in the 1969 work, The Children.</p>
<p>De Hartog's long and varied career also included having several works adapted for the screen. His novel, Stella (1951), was adapted for the screen with Sophia Loren and William Holden, as was The Spiral Road (1957), which starred Rock Hudson. His other notable works included novels The Captain (1967), The Commodore (1986), a trilogy fictionalizing the history of the Society of Friends- The Peaceable Kingdom (1972), The Lamb's War (1980) and The Peculiar People (1992), The Centurion (1989), and The Outer Buoy (1994).</p>
<p>The de Hartogs returned to Houston in 1993. In 2002, Jan was presented with an Hononary Doctor of Humane Letters at the University of Houston. Jan de Hartog died September 22, 2002.</p>

part in a notorious Houston double murder, with Lowry's account of the death of
her son. After moving to Los Angeles in 1992, she published her most recent
work, <emph render="italic">The Track of Real Desires</emph> (1994), a novel
which returns to the Eunola setting of her earlier books.</p>

<p>Few of the major figures in the history of Houston have had as
widespread an influence as Joseph Stephen Cullinan. At times, the word
paradoxical comes to mind when the scope of his diverse interests is examined.
A leading early exponent for the Texas oil industry, Cullinan was yet an ardent
conservationist, who argued for governmental controls over the petroleum
business out of concern for preserving natural resources. Although he
maintained a fairly consistent record of lifetime support for the Democratic
Party, Cullinan advocated the Progressive candidacy of Robert LaFollette in
1924 and in the later years of his life supported the reactionary Liberty
League after he became disenchanted with the policies of the New Deal. Despite
his flirtations with nativist movements, he strongly opposed the Ku Klux Klan
as a result of his own Irish Catholic background, even though he disavowed any
affiliation with organized religion.</p>
<p>Arriving in Corsicana, Texas from his native Pennsylvania, where he
was born on December 31, 1860, Cullinan immediately became involved in the
exploration and drilling of the Corsicana oil fields, borrowing on his own
experiences as an oil field worker for Standard Oil. After the discoveries at
Spindletop in 1901 shifted the geographical emphasis of the Texas oil industry
to the Beaumont area, Cullinan moved his own center of operations there, where
he became president of the newly-formed Texas Company in 1902. Recognizing the
potential of Houston as an oil center, Cullinan moved the headquarters of the
Texas Company there in 1908.</p>

<emph render="italic">A Garden Revisited</emph> (1931). He briefly left
publishing and lived for a time in Austria and the U.S.S.R. as a poet and a
journalist prior to the start of World War Two. </p>
<p>His first periodical, <emph render="italic">New Writing</emph>,
appeared in 1935 and by 1940 the series reached a broad audience both in
Britain and on the frontlines of World War Two. Formatted to fit into the side
pockets of combat trousers, it averaged monthly sales of up to 75,000. </p>
<p>Lehmann returned to Hogarth Press in 1938 as a partner and general
manager and worked as editor of several anthologies showcasing the works of
promising new writers. In 1946 Lehmann established his own publishing company,
John Lehmann Limited. After the demise of Lehmann Ltd., he founded and edited
<emph render="italic">London Magazine</emph>. He relinquished control over the
periodical in 1961 and subsequently wrote several biographies, including
<emph render="italic">Rupert Brooke: His Life and His Legend</emph> and
<emph render="italic">Thrown to the Woolfs: Leonard and Virginia Woolf and the
Hogarth Press</emph>, and three autobiographies which were collected, revised,
and condensed into the book <emph render="italic">In My Own Time: Memoirs of a

<emph render="italic">A Garden Revisited and Other Poems</emph> and
<emph render="italic">Collected Poems, 1930-1963</emph>, and the novels
<emph render="italic">Evil Was Abroad</emph> and <emph render="italic">In a
Purely Pagan Sense</emph>. </p>
<p>He frequently lectured in the US in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
After a long illness and unsuccessful hip operations severely limited his
mobility, John Lehmann died on April 7, 1987. The <emph render="italic">New

editor of his time. . . . There is scarcely a writer [of his generation] in
Britain . . . who hasn't at one time or other been grateful for his passionate
scrutiny."</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Donald Barthelme was born in Philadelphia in 1931 to parents Donald
Barthelme Sr. and Helen (Bechtold) Barthelme. In 1932, the family moved to
Houston, where Donald Barthelme Sr. developed an architectural practice and
taught at the University of Houston and Rice University. Barthelme had four
younger siblings: Joan (born 1932), Peter (born 1938), Frederick (born 1943),
and Steven (born 1947).</p>
<p>Barthelme enrolled at the University of Houston in 1949, where he took
courses in journalism, literature, creative writing, and philosophy. He became
a reporter, critic, and editor for the school's newspaper,
<emph render="italic">The Cougar</emph>. </p>
<p>In July 1951, he left the University of Houston for a job at the
<emph render="italic">Houston Post</emph>, where he reviewed movies, plays, and
concerts. From July 1953 to December 1954 he served in Korea, writing for the
2nd Infantry Division's official publication. Following his return to Houston,
Barthelme took a public relations job at the University of Houston. There he
founded and became editor of the interdisciplinary journal
<emph render="italic">Forum</emph>. In 1961, Barthelme became acting director
of the Contemporary Arts Museum. The following year he moved to New York City
to edit a new journal of art and literature called <emph render="italic">Location</emph>. </p>
<p>In 1961, Barthelme's short story "The Darling Duckling at School"
(later renamed "Me and Mrs. Mandible") appeared in the journal
<emph render="italic">Contact</emph>. Inspired by Samuel Beckett, Barthelme
rejected the constraints of traditional plot, setting, and character
development in favor of verbal collages full of absurdity and wit. In 1963,
Barthelme published the story "L'lapse" in the <emph render="italic">New
Yorker</emph>, quickly becoming a regular contributor. </p>
<p>In 1964 Barthelme released his first collection of stories,
<emph render="italic">Come Back, Dr. Caligari</emph>. From that point on, he
stayed at the forefront of American literature for three decades. Barthelme
published nine more story collections, and 129 stories and "casuals" in the
<emph render="italic">New Yorker</emph>. Always innovative, he created "collage
stories" that combined images and text, and "dialogue stories" in which two
disembodied voices alternate in conversation. He also published three novels -
<emph render="italic">Snow White</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Dead
Father</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Paradise</emph>. In 1972 he released a
children's book, <emph render="italic">The Slightly Irregular Fire
Engine</emph>, winning the National Book Award for Children's Literature. </p>
<p>Barthelme remains best known for Sixty Stories, a 1981 anthology of
his finest work from the sixties and seventies. Sixty Stories was nnominated
for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction,
and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 1982.</p>
<p>Donald Barthelme taught creative writing at City College in New York
from 1974-75. In 1979, he was invited to teach in the Creative Writing Program
at the University of Houston. Initially he taught in Houston one semester a
year, while continuing to live in New York City. In 1983, Barthelme moved to
Houston to become a full-time professor. A beloved teacher, he eventually
became director of the Creative Writing Progam, a position he held until his
death.</p>

<p>Maxine Mesinger (1925-2001), author of the social column, "Big City Beat" for the Houston Chronicle from 1964 to 2000. Born in Houston in 1925 to Ella and Julian "Drake" David, Mesinger graduated from San Jacinto High School and attended Texas Women's University, Indiana University, and University of Houston. She married Emil Mesinger in 1944; they have two children, Julianne and Jay.</p>
<p>After a short career in Houston television, Mesinger was hired as a columnist for the Houston Chronicle in 1964. Known for her lively writing style (she coined terms such as "swankienda" and "playcation") and candid access to Houston society, Mesinger's columns intersected with her own life in her famed friendships with notables such as Frank Sinatra, Barbara Walters, Carol Channing, Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli and Shirley MacLaine. Known as "Miss Moonlight", she covered local events as well as happenings on the national scale. Her columns trace Houston's economic and political growth through the lens of an at times outrageous society life. Her Houston Chronicle obituary summarized this by stating "Mesinger watched Houston grow from a dusty cowtown to a sophisticated international city."</p>

<p>Toni Beauchamp was born in Houston Texas on September 11, 1945 to Margaret Brown and Raymond Gin. Due to racial tensions and pressures placed on her parents, which resulted in their divorce, Toni was reared until school age by her nurturing maternal grandmother, Minnie Bell Caddell Brown. This experience fueled her desire to bridge the racial gap in later years. Toni's mother eventually married John Nobler, and Toni soon gained a half sister, Carolyn.</p>
<p>While attending Lamar High School in 1961, Toni met her future husband and soul mate Jeff, who was then a student at UT Austin. Toni and Jeff were married in 1963 and would spend the next 48 years together working alongside each other in various ventures. Toni played a major role to the success of their first company, Intermat, which they sold in 1997.</p>
<p>Toni’s love for the arts prompted her to pursue a career in Art History. As a result, she earned her BA from the University of Houston and her MA from The University of Texas at Austin. She firmly believed in the transformative power of public art, and her 1983 Master's thesis on James Johnson Sweeney and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston was a groundbreaking work of art history scholarship. The thesis recounted the life of the renowned museum curator and director, not only as a biographical narrative but also as an exploration of the city's art institutions and the development of the local art world. This publication generated many of the concepts that Toni would explore in later publications.</p>
<p>Her deep passions for all things art and her immense contributions to the art and civic worlds enabled her to affect change through her endless hours of service on boards and advisory committees.

<p>Founded on 13 March 1988, the North America Taiwanese Women’s Association (NATWA) organized during an era when Taiwanese women had no independent organization to represent them. In 1987, Ms. Maysing Yang became the Taiwanese American Association’s (TAA) first female president and ushered in a new era for Taiwanese women. Enlisting the services of Ms. Annette Lu, founder of Taiwan’s women’s movement, to aid in planning, the first steps toward a women’s branch of the TAA began to take shape. In March of 1988, thirty Taiwanese women from the United States and Canada met in Los Angeles and under the guidance of Ms. Lu, voted to form NATWA.</p>
<p>The members voted Fu-Mei-Chang of San Jose first President, with Grace Chou serving as Vice-President and president elect. At the same time, seven by-law board members were also elected and in July of the same year 45 members voted to approve the official by-laws. The seven board members, having concluded their duties, became the first seven regional board members representing US East, US Midwest, US West, US South, US Great Plains, US Southeast, and Canada. The organization continued to grow for the following six years when the sixth president, Ying Lee, broadened NATWA’s structure. During her tenure, Ms. Lee organized committees and create formal job descriptions for office holders.</p>
<p>NATWA continues to grow to this day with the participation of over 1,000 members. Run primarily by volunteers, the organization boasts a healthy financial standing due to its publications, especially its yearly calendar. Though faced with obstacles on the world stage, NATWA has garnered more support in the foreign community and in December 2000, NATWA became one of the five collaborating members of the World Taiwanese Congress.</p>

<p>The Women’s Resource Center (WRC) opened on Tuesday, March 9, 2004 as a result of the recommendations of the University Commission on Women (UCW).  In September 1999, President Arthur K. Smith appointed 24 UH-affiliated women to the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women for a two-year period to address the issues and concerns of women on the University of Houston campus. The Commission was created to examine the lack of women in higher administrative positions and the workplace climate for women on campus. The Commission was later expanded to include men. The Commission’s first action was to undertake a campus-wide survey and developed a report with numerous recommendations, one of which was the creation of a university supported Women’s Resource Center. The recommendation was realized with the opening of the WRC in 2004.</p>
<p>The goals of the WRC are to provide a comfortable place where UH students, staff, and faculty can seek information on a variety of topics, obtain confidential referrals to appropriate campus and community resources, and discuss issues of concern; to educate the University of Houston community on topics that concern women with a special focus on violence against women due to gender, sexual identity, race, or disability; to identify and research issues that affect University of Houston women; to serve as a liaison between women on campus and the administration, often by working with the University Commission on Women; and to celebrate the achievements of University of Houston women by featuring a UH female faculty, staff or student each month on our web site in the "Spotlight" feature.</p>

Two months later, at the request of the commission, President Smith expanded the commission to thirty-five members, including males and other identified persons. The following year work groups were formed and consultants began gathering information on the status of women at the University of Houston. The Committee on the Status of Women (CSW) also proposed the formation of a Women’s Resource Center (WRC) to President Smith who deferred his final decision on the proposal until the commission’s final report. On September 21, 2001 the Final Report with executive summary was forwarded to President Smith.</p>
<p>In 2002 Kathy Anzivino and Anne Jacobson were elected as co-chairs of the commission and committees began work on specific recommendations including the process of creating a single, permanent, campus wide advisory group on women's issues at the university. The University Commission on Women became a permanent organization in May of 2003 upon President Smith’s approval of the bylaws recommended for its operations. On January 12, 2004 the commission held its first official meeting.</p>

<p>Incorporated in March 1997, the River Oaks Area Democratic Women's (ROADwomen) main goal was to fill a void in Democratic activity within the city of Houston, Texas. Organizations for Democratic women that had operated in the city prior to 1997 had fallen into inactivity leaving no representation for these politically activity women, as opposed to the twenty-five groups that existed for Republican women in Harris County. ROADwomen became a “home for the politically disengaged upwardly mobile Democratic woman” in the area. The goals for the ROADwomen were, and continue to be efforts to elect Democrats to office, with a special emphasis on electing pro-choice Democratic women; to influence the Democratic Party to continue its historic role as a party that promotes social justice and equal rights for all people; and act as an organization that educates Houstonians about important political issues affecting them.</p>
<p>The founding members consisted of Dalia Stokes, Elizabeth Guffy, Sherry Merfish, Muffie Moroney, Judy Reiner, and Kay Staley. Since 1997, the organization has worked with like-minded groups to support and elect quality Democratic candidates at all levels of government.</p>

<p>Deborah Tucker and Sarah Buel formed the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence (NCDSV) in 1998 to provide customized training and consultation on domestic and sexual violence issues at the national level. Both Tucker and Sarah come from strong backgrounds in the fight against domestic violence. In 1973, Tucker volunteered with the first rape crisis center in Texas. She became the Assistant Director of the Austin Rape Crisis Center and then became the Executive Director of the Austin Center for Battered Women from 1977 until 1982 (www.ncdsv.org). Tucker was the first Executive Director of the Texas Council on Family Violence, 1982 - 1996.</p>
<p>Sarah, herself a domestic violence survivor, has worked for more than 30 years with battered women and abused children within the legal system. Sarah is currently the Faculty Director of the Diane Halle Center for Family Justice at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University. Prior to her current position she was a Clinical Professor at The University of Texas School of Law, having started, then co-directed, their Domestic Violence Clinic. She teaches "Domestic Violence and the Law", and some of her students’ papers have been included in the NCDSV records.</p>
<p>Deborah Tucker and Sarah Buel together formed a consulting firm in 1996 called Tucker, Buel, and Associates. The firm provided customized consultation and training to end violence against women. In May of 1998, the two women joined forces again and co-founded the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence.</p>
<p>The organization has played a national role in several areas. It participated in the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, it collaborated in training with the National Sheriffs’ Association and the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement, and several staff members of the NCDSV participated in the Department of Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence (DTFDV). The National Defense Authorization Act established the DTFDV in 1999. Twelve senior members from the Department of Defense and twelve subject matter experts from the private sector comprised the members of the task force. The duty of the task force was to review and evaluate current Family Advocacy Programs and policies and make recommendations for improvement. The task force provided the Department of Defense with a strategic plan to improve domestic violence programs. Staff traveled to both Asian and European military installations to evaluate existing programs and to make recommendations. Tucker served as Co-Chair of this task force from 2000-2003.</p>

<p>The Harris County Women’s Political Caucus was founded in April of 1972 as one of the local affiliates of the Texas Women’s Political Caucus and National Women’s Political Caucus. The by-laws of the caucus defined its purpose as organizing Harris County women so that “they may unite in political action, especially against sexism, racism, institutional violence, and poverty.” (Bylaws, Folder 1, Box 1). Founding members of the Harris County Women’s Political Caucus included many well-known Harris County activists, business leaders, philanthropists and politicians such as Betty Barnes, Helen Cassidy, Peggy Hall, Ruth Milburn, and Poppy Northcut. Throughout the rest of the 1970s the Harris County Political Caucus was very successful in women’s rights advocacy. It collected data about discrimination against women, lobbied political leaders at the local and state level for pro-women legislation such as the ratification of the state and national Equal Rights Amendments, and supported the political campaigns of women seeking public office. The caucus also successfully lobbied for the creation of a Women’s Advocate for the city of Houston.</p>
<p>By 1981 the Harris County Political Caucus was one of the fastest growing affiliates of the National Women’s Political Caucus in the nation, having increased its membership by 260% (“A brief history” Harris County Women’s Political Caucus). The caucus continued its social and political activism in the 1980s, taking an active role in opposing anti-choice legislation in Texas and supporting the mayoral race of Kathy Whitmire.</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, now known as Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, opened its doors in February of 1936 under the name Maternal Health Center of Houston. Under the direction of Agnese Carter Nelms and her brother-in-law Dr. Judson L. Taylor the Maternal Health Center was dedicated to helping poor and indigent women in Houston receive health care and an education on family planning. The original purpose of the Maternal Health Center was stated as, “to establish and maintain a free medical clinic for the use and benefit of mothers and prospective mothers of the City of Houston and to furnish mothers and prospective mothers of Houston free medical advice on maternal health” (Anderson 8). Eventually, through Agnese Nelms’ tireless work and advocacy of family planning and the birth control movement, the Maternal Health Center gained the support of many of Houston’s prominent community leaders. The first board of directors included many of Houston’s elite, and the wealthiest and most successful businessmen and their wives, such as Mrs. Will Clayton, Maurice and Susan McAshan, the Rev. J. Elmer Ferguson, Rosalie Farish, and Mrs. John Bullington (11 Anderson).</p>
<p>Birth control and family planning remained controversial for the next several decades and the Maternal Health Center volunteers kept the clinic alive through word of mouth and door-to-door grass roots campaigning. They remained loosely affiliated with the American Birth Control League, which eventually became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942. This affiliation with the American Birth Control League would lead, ultimately, to the incorporation of the Maternal Health Center with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s the Maternal Health Center was renamed to the Planned Parenthood Center of Houston, and after the legalization of birth control with the Supreme Court’s 1965 <emph render="italic">Griswold vs. Connecticut </emph>decision the Center grew to include many satellite clinics and thus renamed itself to Planned Parenthood of Houston.</p>
<p>The institution continued to grow, adding vasectomy clinics, more women’s clinics and focusing on public outreach and education, until it merged with several other Planned Parenthoods in Texas to become, in 1978, Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas. By 1984 the organization was seeing as many as 60,000 patients a year (5 Molan).</p>
<p>In 2010 Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas was renamed again to the Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast as it absorbed clinics in Louisiana and other areas of Texas. It continues to grow, expanding its public education and outreach services, expanding sex education access in schools and offering low cost health care, contraception and counseling and abortions. Its slogan remains “every child a wanted child.”</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1985, the walls of Lower Manhattan’s Soho and West Village neighborhoods became plastered with “Public Service Announcements” railing against sexism in the art world. At the bottom of each poster was stamped:</p>
<p>“The Guerilla Girls</p>
<p>Conscience of the art world.”</p>
<p>The anonymous art collective of gorilla-masked women that was behind the feminist propaganda campaign began appearing soon thereafter at well-known museums and Galleries in New York City. The enigmatic hominid-clad protesters quickly gained notoriety and copycat groups began springing up in cities throughout North America.</p>
<p>In May of 1987, one such group, the self-styled Houston “Gorilla Girls,” made their first “hit” at the Glassell School of Art in Houston’s Museum District. They then went on to demonstrate against what they perceived as sexism and racism at high-profile Houston art venues such as the Menil, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, and the Lawndale Arts Center.</p>
<p>The Houston Gorilla Girls’ string of “hits,” performances, and installations ran from 1987 to 1997, when they performed a final show in Verona, Italy at the Villa Carlotta. During their period of activity they became a fixture of the Houston arts scene and are credited with helping open its doors to more female and minority artists. To date, the identities and whereabouts of the Houston Gorilla Girls remain unknown.</p>

<p>Leonor Villegas de Magnón, daughter of Joaquín and Helosia Villegas, was born in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico on June 12, 1876. Educated at the Ursuline Convent in San Antonio and later the Academy of the Holy Cross in Austin, she received a teaching degree in 1895 from the Academy of Mount Saint Ursula in New York City. She married Adolfo Magnón, an American citizen, and the couple had three children, Leonor, Joaquín, and Adolfo. Leonor’s father left Mexico at the outbreak of the Mexican revolution, and when he died in 1910 the war prevented Leonor from returning to Mexico after his funeral. She stayed in Laredo, Texas where she opened a Kindergarten in her home.</p>
<p>Sympathetic to Francisco Madero and his opposition to the Díaz administration, Magnón, along with her friend Jovita Idar, wrote for La Crónica, a Laredo Spanish language newspaper published by Nicasio Idar. When war broke out again in Mexico in 1913 and Nuevo Laredo was attacked, Idar and Magnón crossed the Rio Grande to help nurse the wounded. Leonor then formed and financed La Cruz Blanca (the White Cross) to provide more organized medical assistance and medical supplies to wounded soldiers. Eventually she transformed her home, garage and school into a hospital for soldiers who crossed the border. Unfortunately, American army officials accused her of violating neutrality laws and took many of the soldiers into custody at Fort McIntosh. Leonor hired a lawyer in order to secure their release and after a time Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan ordered the state to comply. Later on, Leonor and twenty five other nurses joined Venustiano Carranza’s army and continued their work with La Cruz Blanca. She was awarded five medals for her work during the Revolution, and in the post war years continued her social and political activism. She opened a bilingual school for children in Laredo and founded a community action women’s organization, La unión de progreso, y caridad. She also worked for the State Democratic executive committee, Women’s Division of Texas in the 1930s.

<p>Pen &amp; Pixel Graphics, Inc. was founded in September 1992 by brothers Shawn and Aaron Brauch in Houston, TX. The Brauch brothers got their start in the music business by working for Rap-A-Lot Records in Houston before recognizing that demand for their graphic design work was high enough for them to start their own company.</p>
<p>Pen &amp; Pixel was innovative in its wide use of Photoshop to create CD covers filled with layers of special effects, highly stylized lettering, and plenty of “bling” (flashy jewelry, expensive clothes, luxury cars, and piles of cash). The company became associated mainly with rap and hip hop musicians in the 1990s, working with renowned artists such as Master P and Lil Wayne and record labels such as No Limit Records and Cash Money Records.</p>
<p>In addition to CD covers, Pen &amp; Pixel also produced artwork for posters, logos, and videos.</p>

<head>Biographical Information:</head>
<p>Burdette Watts Keeland, Jr. was an influential Houston architect. He was well known for his design work, his service as an educator, his long tenure on the City of Houston Planning Commission, and his community involvement with the Park People and other groups.</p>
<p>Keeland was born in Mart, Texas on February 2, 1926, but moved with his family to Houston six months later. He attended Lamar High School, graduating in 1943. He enrolled at Texas A&amp;M University briefly before enlisting in the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1944. He served with U.S. occupation forces in Japan and was discharged in mid 1946. After another short stay at Texas A&amp;M, he enrolled at the University of Houston in the architecture program. In 1947 he married Margaret Scott ("Margie"). From 1950 to 1957 they had four children: Margaret, Burdette III, Ruth, and Bonnie.</p>
<p>Keeland received a Bachelor's degree from the University of Houston in 1950. He began teaching design there in 1954 and was an influential member of the faculty until his death in 2000. He was briefly on the faculty at Rice University and served as lecturer and guest design critic at other noted architecture schools in the United States and Mexico City. Professional organizations recognized Keeland's distinguished teaching career on several occasions. He received outstanding educator awards from the American Institute of Architects, Houston Chapter, in 1987, and the Texas Society of Architects in 1993. In 1992 he was honored at the University of Houston Architecture Alumni Association's Burdette Keeland Roast. In 2000 he was the subject of a retrospective exhibition of his work at the University of Houston's College of Architecture.</p>
<p>His long career at the university was also significant because of his association with Howard Barnstone. An important Houston architect, Barnstone was Keeland's close friend and colleague until Barnstone's death in 1987. In the early 1950s he introduced Keeland to Houston art collectors and philanthropists John and Dominique de Menil and to New York architect Philip Johnson. These relationships had a profound effect on Keeland for the rest of his life. In 1959 Barnstone was also instrumental in Keeland's admission to the graduate architecture program at Barnstone's alma mater, Yale University. Of his many accomplishments, Keeland was perhaps most proud of his role in 1981 to secure for Philip Johnson the commission to design the new building for the College of Architecture. (Among the oversized memorabilia in the collection is the large construction sign for the building, given to Keeland when it was completed.)</p>
<p>In 1964 Mayor Louie Welch appointed Keeland to the Houston Planning Commission. Keeland became chairman in 1981 and served in that capacity until 1991. On January 31 of that year the city honored him by proclaiming the day "Burdette Keeland Day." He was a tireless advocate of the benefits of urban planning, including land-use zoning, a position that was not always popular in the city.</p>
<p>Keeland was a prolific designer and had a successful practice, particularly from 1950 to 1980. Although he never obtained state licensing as an architect, he was well respected by his peers. Over several decades his projects were published consistently in national and international magazines and won a number of design awards.</p>
<p>His career as a designer can be broken into several periods. In the 1950s, influenced by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, Keeland's work followed the Miesian aesthetic of flat-roof pavilions defined by an exposed steel frame. While several examples of this period survive, the best is the Meyerland Parade of Homes House (1955) on Jackwood Street, designed for homebuilder W. K. "Buck" King.</p>
<p>His year at Yale from 1959-60 exposed him to the ideas of other nationally-known architects, such as Paul Rudolph and Louis Kahn. As a result, in the 1960s his work was less predictable, as he explored a number of other approaches to modern architecture. An important example of his work of this decade was his Essex-Houck office building (1961; demolished 1990s), an homage to Louis Kahn.</p>
<p>During the 1970s Keeland moved from architectural design into real estate development, as he adopted the model of a design-build practice. He developed several townhouse complexes in his Kirby Drive-area neighborhood of Houston. They are remarkable for their sensitive scale and relationship to the street. However, his most significant building of this period was the large 4101 Greenbriar office building (1975), which he designed and developed in partnership with other investors.</p>
<p>He also designed the proposed 4141 Greenbriar Building (1983) to be built next door, but Houston's economic depression of the 1980s halted the project. There was little private or commercial construction in the city during this time and Keeland's professional practice suffered. A highlight of the period, however, was his remodeling of his family's residence at 2907 Ferndale St. (1986) with its three-story tower and fanciful supporting column.</p>
<p>In 1986, Keeland suffered a heart attack, the first of a series of health problems to slow him in the last decade of his life. During the 1990s he undertook several residential projects and helped host a number of fund-raisers for the College of Architecture. At two of those, in 1994 and 1998, he welcomed his friend Philip Johnson as guest of honor.</p>
<p>After architecture, Keeland's greatest passion was cemeteries, an interest he developed on a trip to Milan in the late 1960s. There he was inspired by a graveyard filled with interesting and varied funerary monuments. For the rest of his life he studied and documented cemeteries around the world and collected material for a book on the subject, which was never published. He advocated an enlightened approach to these places, suggesting that the living treat them as park space. Keeland invested some of his creative energy in designing headstones and monuments, a number of which were executed for clients. He created a line of designer tombs for a Texas monument company. His largest project was an addition to the Cedarvale Cemetery in Bay City, Texas in the early 1990s. In 1994 his unusual interest earned him feature stories in a number of regional newspapers and a profile in Texas Monthly magazine the following year.</p>
<p>Burdette Keeland, Jr. died on May 26, 2000.</p>

<p>Carlos Garza was born in Mexico and moved to Houston with his family in the 1970s. As a teenager in Bellaire, he fell in love with hip hop music and culture. In the mid-1980s Carlos began break dancing under the name DJ Pace Master. He and a few friends formed the Dynamic Crew, a break dancing group which performed at parties and participated in contests. After a year of break dancing, he decided to switch to DJing and began performing under the name DJ Styles. In 1986, Carlos began working at Soundwaves and, due to his love of the genre, was put in charge of ordering all of the hip hop music. This role allowed him to develop relationships with major hip hop record labels, which came in handy when he started working as a hip hop music producer. Garza has worked as a producer for hip hop artists such as the Odd Squad, Devin the Dude, and the Coughee Brothaz, and continues producing, mixing, and mastering hip hop music to this day.</p>

<p>DJ Screw was born Robert Earl Davis, Jr. on July 20, 1971, and he began DJing and making mixtapes as a teenager while living on the Southside of Houston. By the early 1990s, Davis began to develop his innovative “chopped and screwed” technique of using recording technology to repeat phrases (a process known as chopping) and slow a song’s tempo (known as screwing). Davis became known as DJ Screw and distributed “screw tapes” featuring his technique.</p>
<p>As the popularity of the “chopped and screwed” technique grew, DJ Screw began to receive requests to make tapes tailored for friends and local rappers, often to celebrate an event such as a birthday. These tapes would include a selection of slowed down tracks, shoutouts by DJ Screw, and freestyles by rappers over the beats at the beginning and end of the tapes. To create the “chopped and screwed” effect on these tapes, DJ Screw simultaneously played two copies of the same record on a turntable and slowed each down using the turntable’s pitch control function. He then used the crossfader to switch between the records to repeat beats, words, and phrases. This process would create a master cassette. DJ Screw would then slow the tempo further by using a four-track’s pitch control function to manipulate the master cassettes and produce the final tape. He began selling copies of these “screw tapes” or “grey tapes” (so called because of their color) from his home.</p>
<p>The screw tapes helped to develop the careers of numerous local rappers, who would subsequently become known as the Screwed Up Click (S.U.C.). Prominent members of the S.U.C. included the Botany Boys, Fat Pat, HAWK, Lil’ Keke, E.S.G., Big Pokey, Big Moe, Lil’ O, Al-D, Yungstar, and Lil’ Flip. The music of the S.U.C. often addressed local culture, particularly the city’s custom car culture and the use of recreational drugs, especially marijuana and codeine.</p>
<p>DJ Screw achieved broader popularity in the mid-1990s, and he continued to sell tapes while releasing four studio albums on Bigtyme Recordz: “All Screwed Up,” “3 'N The Mornin' (Part One),” “3 'N The Mornin' (Part Two),” and “I Wanna Get High with Da Blanksta.” As a member of Dead End Alliance (D.E.A.) with Fat Pat, HAWK and Kay-K, he also appeared on the album “Screwed for Life.” In 1998, DJ Screw opened the store Screwed Up Records and Tapes in order to meet demand for his mixtapes.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2000, DJ Screw was found dead in his recording studio at the age of 29. His death was ruled an overdose of codeine and other drugs. The “chopped and screwed” genre that he created continues to influence recording artists, both locally and nationally, and his legacy is honored by fans around the world.</p>

In the early 2000s, he spent six years working on his book True Norwegian Black Metal, for which he photographed several Norwegian black metal bands. After that project, he brought this documentary approach back to his hometown to explore the development of Houston hip hop.</p>
<p>Houston Rap, published in 2013 by Sinecure Press, is the joint creation of Beste and Lance Scott Walker. The product of nearly a decade of work, it documents Houston’s hip hop community, particularly in the Third Ward, Fifth Ward, and South Park neighborhoods. Comprised of photographs by Beste interspersed with excerpts from interviews conducted by Walker, the book features a wide swath of rappers, producers, and other members of Houston’s hip hop community. The rappers run the gamut from the very famous, like Bun B and Geto Boys, to the virtually unknown. The photographs often show the subjects in unguarded personal moments, revealing a world very unlike what the public sees on album covers and promotional materials. The interviews provide further insight into the communities and stories described in the artists’ lyrics.</p>
<p>Lance Scott Walker is a journalist, and native Texan, who has written for many publications, including the Houston Chronicle, Houston Press, USA Today, and RollingStone.com. Extended versions of the oral histories conducted by Walker for Houston Rap can be found in its companion, Houston Rap Tapes.</p>

<p>Steve Fournier moved to Houston as an adolescent in the late 1960s. Fournier began DJing professionally in the late 1970s, quickly becoming a fixture in the Houston night club scene. He DJed at several prominent Houston clubs, including Struts Disco, the Boneshaker, and the Rhinestone Wrangler. An avid rap music fan, Fournier was a driving force behind its increasing presence in the clubs, slipping more and more hip hop into his mixes and hosting live rap contests. Fournier also founded the Rap Pool of America in 1985, which became the largest rap record pool in the country. It began with 30 DJs who paid him a monthly fee in return for the latest hip hop albums, and eventually grew to over 200 members. The Rap Pool of America ended in 1998, but Fournier continued working in the rap industry as a consultant to record companies and major labels until about 2002. Although he is now working in a field completely outside the music industry, Fournier still has a strong interest in hip hop and stays involved through occasional consulting and by speaking at music seminars and conferences.</p>

<p>The original Frontier Fiesta was only presented in 1940 and 1941 and conceived by Dr.
Kemmerer, who later became president. The monies raised at the first Fiesta, $2,000,
contributed to the construction of a campus recreation building. During World War II
Frontier Fiesta took a hiatus, but resumed with vigor in 1946. Frontier Fiesta was held in
"Fiesta City," which was built each year by students. The buildings each housed different
productions. Concessions and contests, including a beard growing contest, were also part of
the events.</p>
<p>During its heyday Frontier Fiesta would attract as many as 100,000 people to the UH campus
including celebrities and visitors from all over the nation. The 1955 Fiesta signed over a
check for $106,000 to help pay for the University's swimming pool. By the early 1950s
Frontier Fiesta had been proclaimed as the "Greatest College Show on Earth."</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, probably including students missing classes and concerns about
budget management, Frontier Fiesta was discontinued after 1959. Although briefly replaced in
1961 by Cougar Capers, it would be 33 years before Frontier Fiesta would return to the
University of Houston. In 1992 a group of alumni joined an energetic group of student
leaders to resurrect the long-gone tradition. This group along with the University of
Houston's Athletic Department brought Fiesta back to the campus where it had begun. Frontier
Fiesta celebrates everything that makes the University of Houston important to the Houston
community today – the talent and leadership ability of its students, the opportunity to
educate Houston's future leaders, and scholarship opportunities for deserving students.</p>

<p>Lynn Randolph is an artist, feminist, and human rights activist whose work spans the past four decades, from the 1960s to the 21st century. Reared in the refinery town of Port Arthur, Texas, she obtained a BFA from the University of Texas at Austin in 1961. After receiving her degree she moved to Houston, where she has lived and worked ever since. Randolph’s paintings have been exhibited widely in the United States and reproductions of her work have appeared in books, journals, and academic papers throughout the world.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, Randolph received several important awards. In the summer of 1987 she went to Yaddo, the artists colony in Saratoga Springs, New York. In the summer of 1989 she started a year-long residence at The Bunting Institute (now the Radcliffe Institute) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Lynn Randolph's paintings have been in well over fifty exhibitions. Her one-person exhibitions have been scarcer, because she works slowly and meticulously. She calls her work metaphoric realism. The paintings have been predominantly figurative, until the last eight years when she started painting images of the Texas coast. Her most recent work uses birds as metaphors for angels, inspiration, and witnessing. Occasionally she is moved to address specific cultural and political injustices, as in her painting entitled "The Coronation of St. George," which was reproduced on the cover of The Nation magazine during the Republican convention in New York in 2004. Another painting depicting the administration of George W. Bush called "Scenes from Hell," was also published in the Nation as a full-page, color reproduction in 2007.</p>
<p>Randolph's paintings are in the permanent collection of several major museums and institutions, including The National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.; the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University; the Menil Collection in Houston; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the San Antonio Museum of Fine Arts and the Arizona State University Museum of Arts in Tempe.</p>
<p>From 1990 to 1996 Randolph engaged in a collaboration with the cultural critic Donna Haraway. This work was a dialogue of specific ideas and critiques relating to the use of technoscience at the end of the millennium and formed the images and text for Haraway’s book, "Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan_Meets_OncoMouse." Many of these images have been reproduced internationally in books, journals, and academic papers. Randolph has also presented numerous lectures and conference speeches across the United States since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Throughout her professional life Lynn Randolph has been involved with civil and human rights issues. When her children were young and their school was integrated, causing "white flight" from the neighborhood public school, she stayed put. She wrote lesson plans for grades one to six and trained forty volunteers to teach art to all of Poe School's students. It is now a fine arts magnet school with a paid art teacher. She was a charter member and chapter president of the Houston Women's Caucus for Art, and served as the regional vice-president for the national board. In 1988 she co-chaired the national meetings of the Women's Caucus for Art that occurred in Houston. In 1984 she and her friend Suzanne Bloom were co-organizers in Houston for Artist Call against U.S. intervention in Central America, an organization based in New York City.</p>
<p>In 1992 Randolph became a member of WAC, the Women's Action Coalition, also a New York group. She helped organize the group's actions in Houston during the Republican convention. WAC brought its drum corps to demonstrate during the convention, and Randolph helped WAC add more drummers from Houston. The Houston drum corps continued long after the convention. They were known as the Ilusas (deluded women) and Randolph performed with them until they disbanded in 1997.</p>
<p>In 1993 Lynn Randolph went to El Salvador with curator and museum director Marilyn Zeitlin to help organize an exhibition of Salvadoran artists called "Art Under Duress: El Salvador from 1980 to Present." The show was mounted at Arizona State University Museum with a catalogue and video tapes. It traveled to Houston and was shown at Lawndale Art Center where Randolph was a member of the artist board until the 1990s.</p>
<p>Lynn Randolph is currently an Artist-in-Residence at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center where she works with patients and staff in the Palliative Care Unit.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, Charles Botts began collecting, preserving, and archiving documents, publications, and other items of historical significance to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities of Houston , southeast Texas, and the United States. He did so informally and eventually under the roof of the Resurrection Metropolitan Community Church (RMCC) of Houston, Texas. Mr. Botts amassed a significant collection of items related to the LGBT community and its history. Upon his death in 1994, a handful of dedicated volunteers continued Charles Botts’ work. Larry Criscione became active at this time and is primarily responsible for the expansion of the collection. A great effort was made to assure that the collection is accessible and useful to students, researchers, and journalists needing access to this unique body of information. The volunteers have also put together displays from the materials for numerous functions, in order to educate the public on different aspects of LGBT History.</p>
<p>In 2001 tropical storm Allison flooded large portions of Houston. The church library including the LGBT material collected by Charles Botts were affected as was everything in the church. It was after this storm that Leif Hatlen became involved with the collection. Due to water damage caused by the storm, some of the library materials was destroyed, much of the rest of the materials was water damaged and any system of filing or sorting was lost. Leif began to re-sort the materials, developing lists and indexes in the process. Later in 2005, Mike Kelley (now deceased) began to volunteer with the collection and developed computerized indexes that has been used for the magazines and to organize the individual collections.</p>
<p>In 2011, when it became apparent that Resurrection church’s goals and intentions with respect to the collection differed from those of the volunteers, Larry Criscione formed and incorporated the Botts Collection of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History, Inc.

<p>Tennessee Gas (later Tenneco) and its Tennessee pipeline were elements of one of the largest diversified companies in the world. Wade Thompson founded Tenneco Gas shortly after the discovery of natural gas in 1933 in Macon County, Tennessee. In 1943 Henry Gardiner Symonds became the first president of the newly established Tennessee Gas Transmission Company (renamed Tenneco in 1966) in Houston.</p>
<p>A significant aspect of this collection of Tenneco records is the management and planning documents, notes, and speeches accumulated by Joe B. Foster, who held positions with Tenneco for thirty-one years. Among his roles with Tenneco, Foster served as chairman of Tenneco Oil Company, executive vice president of Tenneco Inc., and chairman of Tenneco Gas Pipeline Group. Foster left Tenneco in 1988</p>
<p>Foster graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 1957 with a B.S. in petroleum engineering and B.B.A. in business administration; he joined Tenneco as a junior petroleum engineer in Oklahoma City the same year. In 1968, Foster became Chief of Planning and Economic Analysis for Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production in Houston and assumed the role of president of Tenneco Oil in 1978. When the Tenneco board divested Tenneco Oil in 1988, Foster retired and founded the Newfield Exploration Company, serving as its chief executive officer until 2000.</p>
<p>Foster’s personal notes, speeches, presentations, and his contributions to the development of a history of Tenneco reveal his keen interest in planning and his personal ruminations on the processes of management. His speech development notes and collected sources and the subsequent speeches Foster delivered to Tenneco management groups, professional conferences, and non-profit gatherings offer insight into multiple responsibilities of leadership.</p>

<p>The Detering family has lived and worked in the Houston area for over a century, owning numerous Houston properties and several long-standing businesses. Herman Eberhard Detering (1862-1927) moved from Germany to Houston, Texas in 1881. Upon moving to Houston, his first job was working for Henke’s Grocery. Soon after, Detering purchased a lot at 3028 Washington Avenue, where he opened the Detering General Store. He married Helena “Lina” Stuer in 1891, and they made their home above the store. The five Detering children, Alma, Elsa Anna, Herman Eberhard, Carl August, and Lenora Lina, were all born at home on Washington Avenue. In 1895, Mr. Detering bought another business, the Houston Broom Factory, and located it behind the grocery store, on Center Street. The grocery store was closed in approximately 1913, after the family moved to McGowen Street. Herman Eberhard Detering also became a real estate entrepreneur early on, buying and selling land all over the Houston area. According to family lore, Eberhard believed Houston waterways would be used for transportation but did not know which bayous would be important, so he bought on all of them. He had several real estate partnerships, including Bottler &amp; Detering and Kalb &amp; Detering.</p>
<p>The Detering children continued in the family businesses and real estate ventures. In 1926, Carl Detering opened The Detering Company, a provider of building materials and supplies, in the same location as their father’s grocery store. He was joined shortly thereafter by his brother, Herman. Alma Detering kept an office at the Detering Company as well, and ran the Houston Broom Factory from there until its closure in the 1940s. Alma also oversaw the accounting for the family’s other businesses and properties during this time. The Woodridge Company (a partnership between Herman and Carl) and Carl Detering Developer (a business in which Alma and Herman were also heavily involved) are two examples of businesses created by the Detering children to manage real estate development. Other companies associated with the Detering family included the Detering Concrete Tile Company, Turning Basin Development Company, the Detering Company of Beaumont, Inc., and the Detering Galleries.</p>

<p>O.C. McDavid was born on May 30, 1911 in Ruth, Mississippi.  At the urging of his high school English teacher, McDavid forged a non-traditional path into a career in the newspaper industry.  He secured his first job sweeping up the print shop at the Enterprise Journal while in high school.  As his responsibilities grew to include running the print shop as well as writing, he attended high school part-time so that he could pursue his new career full-time.</p>
<p>McDavid’s career took an unexpected turn as the United States’ involvement in World War II became imminent.  As a member of the National Guard, McDavid received his federal induction and was quickly tapped to publish a camp newspaper named The Dixie.  After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, McDavid was stationed in the South Pacific.  There, in New Guinea, McDavid was placed in charge of establishing village governments with the local population and helped to provide local services such as sanitation, security, and health.</p>
<p>Following the war, McDavid returned to the newspaper industry, finally retiring at the age of 70.  He turned his time and energies to sculpting and painting, earning the George Ohr Public Service Award (honoring Mississippians who have supported crafts as art) in 1976.</p>
<p>He died on March 12, 1998 in Jackson, Mississippi.  The following year the Mississippi Press Association established an annual student journalism conference in his name.</p>

<p><emph render="italic">This is Our Home, It Is Not for Sale</emph> is a documentary film
produced by Jon Schwartz.</p>
<p> Jon Schwartz grew up in a neighborhood contiguous to Riverside, and produced his
three-hour documentary as something of a paean to the beauty and complexity of Riverside as
it was and as it evolved. Schwartz earned a degree in film and moved to the West Coast, but
he found the inspiration for his film project in a 1983 photography exhibit at the Houston
Public Library. Schwartz's research for the film included 300 preliminary interviews plus
magazine articles and academic papers on Houston. Schwartz was remarkably successful in
raising funds to produce his film, engaging the interest not only of funding organizations
but also former and current residents of Riverside.</p>
<p> Schwartz's film traces the history of Houston's Riverside neighborhood from land grant to
inner city neighborhood. Boundaries of Riverside are defined in the film as Alabama Street
on the north, University of Houston on the east, Old Spanish Trail on the south, and Almeda
Road on the west. Schwartz tells the story of Riverside through interviews, photos, and home
movies. Informally known as the Jewish River Oaks, Riverside became an idyllic neighborhood
close to downtown. Riverside was an all-white neighborhood until 1952 when the first black
family moved in; white flight followed. Real estate agents working house-to-house encouraged
owners to sell, but many residents resisted the inclination to move and posted yard signs
stating "This is Our Home, It's Not for Sale." Transformation became inevitable for a
constellation of reasons. Intrusions into the neighborhood included Highway 288 and the
Harris County Psychiatric Center. By the conclusion of the time period covered in the film
(mid-1980s), Riverside was a multi-ethnic neighborhood, combining characteristics of a
peaceful wooded residential area with the conflicts of an integrated urban neighborhood.</p>

<p>Cynthia Lee Macdonald was born in New York City in 1928 to Leonard Lee and Dorothy Kiam Lee. Significantly, her younger sister Virginia, to whom Cynthia was very close in age, died of scarlet fever at 5 or 6 years old. Macdonald’s parents divorced in 1940 and both eventually remarried. Leonard, a Hollywood scriptwriter for movies and television, lived in Los Angeles, while Dorothy returned to New York; Macdonald spent time on both coasts throughout her childhood and teen years.</p>
<p>Macdonald earned her Bachelor’s degree from Bennington College in Vermont in 1950. She married E.C. Macdonald in 1954 and had two children, Jennifer and Scott. Her budding career as an opera singer gave way to her poetry writing, prompting her enrollment at Sarah Lawrence College in New York to earn her Master’s degree in writing in 1970.</p>
<p>A career as a writing teacher soon followed. After teaching first at Sarah Lawrence College, then at Johns Hopkins University, she co-founded with Stanley Plumly the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston in 1979. She taught at UH until her retirement in the mid-2000s, receiving the Esther Farfel Award for faculty excellence along the way.</p>
<p>Macdonald became a widely published and award-winning poet. Her first of seven books of poetry, Amputations, was published in 1972, and she had individual poems published in dozens and dozens of esteemed magazines and journals such at The New Yorker, The Paris Review, and The Yale Review. Among the many honors and awards that Macdonald received for her writing were a Guggenheim Fellowship and the O.B. Hardison, Jr. Poetry Prize.</p>
<p>Macdonald was also a practicing psychoanalyst for many years, and a faculty member of the Houston-Galveston Psychoanalytic Institute.</p>
<p>Though born in New York, Cynthia Macdonald comes from old Houston stock: Her mother Dorothy was born in Houston in 1906 to Edward Kiam and Fanny Tim Kiam. The Kiam family had been in the city as far back as the mid-to-late 1800s. In 1893, Edward Kiam opened a clothing store in downtown Houston in a five-story brick building that still stands and is still known as “The Kiam Building” at 320 Main Street.</p>

<p>The Chocolate Bayou Theater Company’s origins date back to 1973 when Leonard Wagner established a semi-professional community theater in conjunction with Alvin Community College. When the college suspended its theater program, Wagner decided to transform the group into a non-profit professional theater in collaboration with Pat Miller. Their mission was to produce high quality, intimate professional theater while developing playwrights and a company of actors. Together they moved the Chocolate Bayou Theater Company to a new location a few miles north to Houston.</p>
<p>Chocolate Bayou established a reputation mounting new plays and supporting new playwrights through their Preston Jones New Play Symposium. The symposium was named for the playwright Preston Jones who donated his new play to CBTC for their first production. Jones, a close friend of Miller and Wagner, died two weeks before the play was produced.</p>
<p>Financial difficulties forced the company to close in 1987. Chocolate Bayou was enjoying critical and popular success but faced outstanding debts and the economic downturn in Houston. In its final year CBTC produced seven premieres of new plays. Attempts were made to revive CBTC but were unsuccessful. The company mounted more than 100 productions and received two Rockefeller Foundation grants.</p>

<p>The Faculty Wives Club and the Woman's Club of the University of Houston combined in 1962 to form the University of Houston Women's Association (UHWA). The UHWA provided a social and service organization for the wives of faculty and staff, and an ever-increasing number of female university faculty. Throughout each academic year the UHWA arranged various large-scale activities such as swimming parties, dinner theaters, and dances for its members, of which numbers usually ranged from two to three hundred dues-paying members. Smaller interest-based group functions included bridge games, book clubs, sewing parties, and gourmet cooking lessons. The organization also supported the student population through service events. The most notable of these is the Mary Harding Hoffman scholarship established in 1978. The scholarship provided children of University of Houston faculty or staff with tuition for their freshman year at the University of Houston on a merit basis.</p>
<p>An annually-elected executive board of officers led the University of Houston Women’s Association. The primary officers, consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer directed the affairs of the UHWA through smaller committees. The most consistently active committees during the organization's history included the newcomers, scholarship, and activities committees. The activities group also subdivided into smaller units gathering members with similar interests such as bridge, sewing, reading, and bowling.</p>

<p>In 1969, The University of Houston was one of four universities in the United States to utilize this new concept in education. The purpose of the “Open University” program was to provide better university education for large groups of students through successful self-study programs which covered the relationships between the sciences and society and the arts and society. Through the use of a wide range of multi-media material, including closed circuit television and radio programs and self-study texts, students were able to learn on their own without being required to spend numerous hours in the classroom.</p>

<p>Larry McMurtry is probably the most well-known writer to have emerged from Texas in the twentieth century, appealing to both critics and readers with his novels of the contemporary and historic American West. His trail-drive saga Lonesome Dove earned McMurtry the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1986, and many of his books have become national bestsellers. Lonesome Dove was turned into a highly-acclaimed television mini-series, and several of his novels have been made into films, most notably The Last Picture Show, which garnered McMurtry an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay, and Terms of Endearment.</p>
<p>Larry McMurtry was born in 1936, and grew up in Archer City, Texas, the son and the grandson of cattle ranchers. He completed his undergraduate studies at the North Texas State University, and received his M.A. in English from Rice University in 1960.</p>
<p>In 1961 he released his first novel, Horseman, Pass By. That novel and the two which followed, Leaving Cheyenne (1963) and The Last Picture Show (1966), were set in the imaginary town of Thalia, and explored small town life and the changes taking place in the rural West. Between 1963 and 1969, McMurtry also taught creative writing at Rice University.</p>
<p>In 1969 McMurtry moved to Washington D.C., where he became co-owner and operator of a rare book store called Booked Up. While living in Washington, he wrote three novels about turbulent relationships that were primarily set in Houston – Moving On (1970), All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers (1972), and Terms of Endearment (1975). His next three novels are generally considered less successful, transitional novels.</p>
<p>1986’s Lonesome Dove was a departure for McMurtry, a rambling story set in the West of the 1870s. Since writing Lonesome Dove, he has been equally prolific in two types of book – contemporary novels such as Texasville (1987) and Evening Star (1992) which revisit characters from earlier works, and historically based novels like Anything for Billy (1988) and Buffalo Girls (1990) which tell the stories of legendary figures such as Billy the Kid and Calamity Jane. McMurtry has also released three more novels featuring characters from Lonesome Dove, the 1993 sequel Streets of Laredo, the 1996 prequel Dead Man’s Walk, and the 1997 prequel Comanche Moon. Like Lonesome Dove, these novels were made into television mini-series.</p>
<p>McMurtry has continued to write novels, with the latest from the Last Picture Show series, Rhino Ranch, being released in 2009. In 2005, McMurtry won the Academy Award for his screenplay of the movie Brokeback Mountain, which he co-wrote with Diana Ossana.</p>
<p>In addition to novels, McMurtry has also published books of essays, film criticism, short stories, and several volumes of memoirs. He has one son, James Lawrence, and currently lives in Archer City, Texas, where he owns a rare book store.</p>

<p>River Oaks Business Women’s Exchange Club or ROBWEC was formed on February 12, 1976 when fewer than ten business and professional women met for the first time in the Travel Lodge. It was the idea of Marilyn Elam, a recent law school graduate who had moved to Houston to take a federal district court law clerkship. The small group of women continued to meet informally until July 2, 1976, when Jeanne Atherton moved the meetings to the River Oaks Country Club and officially organized the River Oaks Business Women’s Exchange Club. The plan was quickly implemented to recruit women of professional strength and power, each a leader in her field in the greater Houston area.</p>
<p>The purpose of ROBWEC is to bring together businesswomen of the city of Houston.

<p>Founded in 1900, The Texas Optometric Association (TOA) represents more than 1200 doctors of optometry, optometry students, and optometric technicians across the State of Texas. Originally, the organization was named the Texas Optical Association, later named the Texas Optometric Association. The TOA began organizing local societies in 1943. In 1987, it had 972 members and 21 local societies. TOA offers a variety of services including job referral, continuing education courses, insurance, travel benefits, periodicals, and meeting and conference opportunities. The Texas Optometric Association has been an essential advocate for Texas optometrists and has maintained its headquarters in Austin since 1951.</p>
<p>With the promise of substantial financial assistance from TOA pledges, the University of Houston College of Optometry, became the tenth optometry school in the nation, in 1952. At that time, the university was a private school, but in 1963, it became a state-supported college. Today UHCO is one of only 17 optometry schools in the United States. The institution offers a four-year program of instruction and clinical experience for the Doctor of Optometry degree. It also offers M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in physiological optics for those who plan careers in research or teaching. By 1987, it had awarded 23 Ph.D. degrees, 34 M.S. degrees, and more than 1,500 O.D. degrees.</p>

<p>The Houston Council of Texas Garden Clubs, Inc. was organized and federated April 22, 1943. A number of Houston garden clubs united to establish a Council with the responsibility of coordinating the activities of local clubs at the state and national levels. A Constitution and By-Laws were adopted at the second Council meeting, in May 1943. After sixty years, the Council dissolved in June 2003 due to decreasing attendance of member clubs.</p>
<p>The Houston Council of Texas Garden Clubs was very active in the community throughout its existence. The Council’s two major community service projects regarded the United States Veterans Administration Hospital and the Lighthouse for the Blind Garden Club. These were ongoing projects over many years. The Council was involved in several activities at the hospital. Beginning in 1951, the Council provided weekly flower arrangements at the hospital chapel, maintained planter boxes, and created several gardens for use as garden therapy for the patients. The Council sponsored the Lighthouse for the Blind Garden Club, founded in 1949. The club provided transportation and activities for its members and Braille transcriptions of club rosters. The Council was also involved in smaller community service projects over the years.</p>
<p>For much of its existence, the Council met once a month, September through May, at the Houston Garden Center in Hermann Park. Officers were elected for two year terms, with elections held in May. Activities included instructional programs and presentations at the meetings, and annual flower shows.</p>

<p>The city began on August 30, 1836, when Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen ran an advertisement in the Telegraph and Texas Register for the "Town of Houston." The town-site, which featured a mixture of timber and grassland, was on the level Coastal Plain in the middle of the future Harris County, at 95.4° west longitude and 30.3° north latitude. When first formed in 1949 the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area covered only Harris County and had a population of 806,701 people. The increasing use of automobiles also led to the building of expressways in the 1950s that extended over 200 miles by 1990. The prosperity after World War II brought the world famous Galleria shopping mall with its interior ice-skating rink in 1970. In the ordering of urban space Houston politicians and voters have continually rejected the use of zoning. The lack of zoning has not affected development to any great extent, however, since heavy industry concentrated in the area of the ship channel and subdivisions controlled construction through deed restrictions. This casual attitude toward land use encouraged business expansion.</p>

<p>Womynspace, Inc was a non-profit organization designed by and for women. Founded in 1985, it was directed by a collective of five women: Anita Davidson, Lynda Jones, Margo Shelton, Glena Stephenson and Rebecca Tallman. The organization operated under four basic tenets regarding the purpose of its existence. First and foremost, it sought to provide a gathering and healing place for women only. It provided space for artists and relief to women who were exploited as consumers. Lastly, it strived to add dimension to the “womyn’s” community. The organization also worked to establish an alternative living space in a communal setting; a coffeehouse that would provide artistic and gathering space; a shop and gallery space where “womyn” wares would be displayed and sold; a meeting and workshop space; and a forum for disseminating information throughout the womyn’s community.</p>

<p>Born April 26, 1926 in Houston, Texas, Ruby Kless Sondock attended Cottey College in Nevada, Missouri for two years before marrying Lt. Melvin A. Sondock in Houston, Texas in 1944. Years after having a family, Sondock attended the University of Houston Law Center and graduated as valedictorian of the 1962 law class. She was admitted to the Texas State Bar the year before her graduation from law school. Following law school, Sondock practiced law for seven years. Gov. Preston Smith appointed her judge of Harris County Domestic Relations Court No. 5 in 1973, making her the first woman in Harris County to hold a district level judgeship. She held the position for four years until Gov. Dolph Briscoe appointed her in 1977 to the 234th District Court; she became the first woman to hold that distinction in Harris County.</p>
<p>Sondock was appointed to the Texas Supreme Court by Gov. William P. Clements following the death of associate justice James G. Denton, who died of a heart attack on June 10, 1982. When the fifty-six year old Sondock was sworn in on June 25, she became the first woman justice on the court since 1925, when a special all-woman court served briefly to hear a single case involving the Woodmen of the World. Sondock completed Denton’s term, which ended December 31, 1982, and did not seek election. Instead she returned to the 234th District Court, to which she won reelection without opposition the following November.</p>
<p>Following her judicial service, Sondock began working as a private mediator in Houston. Her alma mater, the University of Houston Law Center, hosts a biennial lecture series in her name, "The Ruby Kless Sondock Lecture in Legal Ethics."</p>

<p>Dr. Bette Ann Stead, known as the Architect for C.T. Bauer's $40 million endowment, is professor emerita of the C. T. Bauer College of Business, University of Houston, where she taught for 34 years.  Dr. Stead's numerous articles have been published in the Academy of Management Journal, Business Horizons, Group and Organization Management, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Journal of Business Ethics, Information and Optimization Sciences, Journal of Library Administration, Journal of Nonprofit and Public Sector Marketing, Library Quarterly, Vital Speeches of the Day, etc.   In 1978, she co-authored Business English and Communication (McGraw-Hill).   Also in 1978, Stead published the first edition of Women in Management (Prentice Hall), which she used in her "Women in Administration" course. In 1985, the second edition was published.</p>
<p>In 1975, when Dr. Stead began teaching her groundbreaking course, "Women in Administration," women were denied membership in business and service organizations. On March 31, 1981, Dr. Stead presented a suggested constitution and bylaws to representatives from 20 business and scientific women’s organizations, which was used to establish the Federation of Houston Professional Women (FHPW), in September of that year. FHPW now has some fifty member organizations.  http://www.fhpw.org/our_history.html</p>
<p>In 1989, while serving as the Director of the Institute for Business, Ethics, and Public Issues, Dr. Stead presented a concept statement suggesting that the business school could bring together company representatives to discuss ethical concerns.  There was very little interest in establishing such an organization. On October 26 1995, she again forwarded her concept statement regarding the establishment of the Greater Houston Business Ethics Roundtable (GHBER).  This time, Dr. Stead did receive a positive response from local businesses. Shortly thereafter, GHBER was established to highlight the pivotal role of ethics in the workplace and to share "best practices." On November 16, 1999, GHBER presented Dr. Stead with the "1999 Dedicated Service Award," due to her efforts in creating this organization. In 2006 on GHBER's Tenth Anniversary, five $1000 scholarships were named in her honor. "The GHBER Bette Stead Scholarships" recognize her tireless dedication to education as well as the decisive role she played in establishing this organization. These 5 scholarships are awarded to Houston-area MBA students, and numerous major corporations belong to GHBER today.  http://www.ghber.org.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dr. Stead became the architect of the capital campaign needs assessment that led to C.T. Bauer's $40 million endowment of the University of Houston's College of Business Administration.  She has endowed three memorial scholarships in the C. T. Bauer College of Business honoring her aunt, paternal grandparents, and parents.  These scholarships are managed by the Cougar Investment Fund, L.L.C., which allows graduate students to gain valuable experience in money-management.</p>
<p>Dr. Stead has received the Distinguished Faculty Member Award, C. T. Bauer College of Business Alumni Association; Melcher Faculty Service Fellow for outstanding service productivity and contributions to  field, 1992-1993, 1993-1994, 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1999-2000; Melcher Award for Excellence in Service for accomplishments and contributions in all dimensions of professional service, 1995; Senior Service Award for outstanding service as mentor, scholar, and role model, Women in Management Division, Academy of Management, 1992; and was named Distinguished Alumna, Lamar University, 2004. She has endowed three memorial scholarships in the Lamar University College of Business honoring her aunt, paternal grandparents, and parents.  In 1970 she guided the work that won the MBA Magazine award, for best graduate research by a business student in the U. S. ($700 for student; $500 for UH Library).  She also was invited to the White House July 1, 1976, to attend the International Women's Year report ceremony presentation to President Gerald R. Ford.  In June 12-16, 1972, she was a participant in the "Global Strategy Discussions," Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island.</p>
<p>She developed a course called "Marketing for Nonprofits."  Her students completed over 150 projects for Houston-area nonprofits.  Her community service also includes being president, River Oaks Business Women's Exchange Club, 1991; president, advisory board, The Women's Home (founded 1957), 501 (c)(3), only agency in Houston offering women long-term residential care, psychiatric and nurse practitioner services, psychotherapy, chemical dependency services and vocational and spiritual development programs, 2002-2004; president, board of directors, Houston Compass, Inc., (501 (c)(3) provides job leads, bus tokens, and legal aid for street people; president, board of directors, Christ Church Cathedral (Episcopal) Endowment, 2003.  She chaired the $2M renovation of Christ Church Cathedral, 1994.  She also chaired the $4M capital expansion (1999) as well as the $10M affordable housing project (2001-now) for The Women's Home. </p>
<p>She has also published, The Adventures of December, The Women's Home Cat, about a real cat that has lived at The Women’s Home for some 20 years; and C. C. Billy Goat and the First Christ Church, based on an 1852 painting by Thomas Flintoff of the first Christ Church, which stands where Christ Church Cathedral stands today.  She has gifted the first printing and copyright for both stories to these organizations.</p>

<p>The Houston Comets was a Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Houston, Texas. They were formed in 1997, which was the inaugural season of the WNBA and were one of the original eight WNBA teams. The Comets were the first dynasty of the WNBA and they won more championships than any other team in the WNBA under the reigns of Head Coach Van Chancellor. They began as the sister team of the Houston Rockets under the ownership of Alexander Leslie from 1997 to 2006.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2000, the Comets dominated the WNBA as they won all four championships in the first four years of the league's existence with the leadership of Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson who were referred to as the “Big Three.” The Comets were known for courting great women's basketball stars in addition to the “Big Three” such as Kim Perrot, who succumbed to cancer in 1999 and college star Michelle Snow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Comets failed to make another WNBA Finals appearance after their 2000 Championship season. Changes in the roster, coaching staff, ownership and playing arena prompted the demise of the Comet’s Franchise. In 2001, 2-time league MVP Cynthia Cooper retired, and in 2007, Chancellor resigned as Head Coach and Alexander sold the Franchise to Hilton Koch. Chancellor was replaced by Assistant Coach, Karleen Thompson; and shortly thereafter, the team moved from playing its home games at the Toyota Center to Reliant Arena. Given these changes over the span of seven years, the Comets struggled greatly as they only moved past the First Round of the playoffs once, which was in their 2005 season, and they failed to make the playoffs 3 out of their last eight seasons. Due to this hardship, Koch put the team up from sale in 2008, but didn’t receive any offers from investors. Consequently, the team fell under the management of the WNBA and was disbanded in the same year.</p>

<p>Helen Barthelme was born December 18, 1927. She graduated as an honors student from Corpus Christi High School at the age of 15. After her parents separated, she moved to Houston with her mother and two sisters. About a year later, around the age of 17, she enrolled at the University of Houston, where she would later meet Donald Barthelme Jr., who would later become a famous author. She became editor of the school newspaper 'The Cougar.' After graduating with her bachelor's degree, she continued to work in the university's public relations department. She briefly left the university to start a corporate career, but returned as director of the Information Office in 1951.</p>
<p>In 1951, she married her first husband Pete Gilpin. The marriage dissolved in 1956, and she married Donald Barthelme shortly thereafter. She left her professional endeavors for a short time in order to become a housewife, but she disliked the role. She soon re-enrolled in philosophy and art classes at the University of Houston. In 1957, she became an account executive for an ad agency, and was invited to teach classes in journalism and literature at a four-year woman's university in Houston called Dominican College.</p>
<p>In 1959, Helen Barthelme started her own ad agency, and continued to teach at Dominican College. She and Donald Barthelme were divorced in 1965. She continued her education, getting her doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin. In 1972, she accepted an appointment with the Department of English at the University of Houston.

<p>The Houston Alumni Organization (HAO) was founded in the 1940’s by a group of former students. However, the first alumni association housed on campus was the Alumni Federation, one of many vehicles initiated during the 1940’s and 1950’s to draw alumni back to the University. [1] HAO is governed by an alumni board of directors and is a non-profit organization which operates for the benefit of the University of Houston and its alumni. It is responsible for the overall alumni program and coordinates the constituent programs of the campus’ colleges and departments. Constituent associations are organized by college, school, department, or special interest affiliation. Clubs are organized by geographical area. Each association and club has its own board of directors. [2] (see UH alumni website for current listing).</p>
<p>Mission Statement: The Alumni Association is dedicated to supporting and serving the University of Houston and its worldwide community of alumni and friends.</p>
<p>Vision Statement: UHAA activities reflect priorities of our alumni and complement aspirations of the university, the colleges, schools, and various institutional components such as admissions, advancement, athletics, community and government relations, the faculty, student life, and university events. Through area clubs and constituent and special interest groups, UHAA adds dimension to the outreach capabilities of the institution and provides avenues for active engagement and support.</p>
<p>By administering fiduciary oversight for alumni groups, managing scholarship programs, communicating broadly and effectively, sponsoring leadership recognition and awards ceremonies, and developing and sustaining lifelong relationships, UHAA expands the capacity for the university to prosper. It is a requisite link between the university and its alumni and friends.[3]</p>
<p>Today the HAO is also known as the University of Houston Alumni Association.</p>

<p>The University of Houston’s first athletic teams existed merely as student extracurricular activities during its years as the Houston Junior College (1927 -1934), and consisted of a girl’s basketball team, an ice hockey team, and a football team.</p>
<p>Over the years, as enrollment and construction increased at the university, so did the desire for a great athletics program. The first year of intercollegiate sports was 1946.</p>
<p>Since that time the University of Houston Department of Athletics has grown tremendously, and has seen the construction of eight on-campus facilities for the purpose of supporting its student athletes.</p>

<p>The College of Business was established in 1942. [1] Originally called the College of Business Administration, classes were held at the Downtown School and later at the University’s main campus. During WWII the College of Business Administration and Arts and Sciences collaborated in one of the institutions first interdisciplinary programs, Emergency Science-Management War Training, or ESMWT. Hundreds of civilian trainees were taught on campus and at the Downtown School in this program, which combined instruction in chemistry and business management. [2]</p>
<p>Upon seeing the necessity of a business school in Houston, many have given their time and money to seeing that the College of Business continues to be a valuable part of the University. On September 28, 1958 Jesse H. Jones gave a large sum of money for the construction of the Heyne Building, a much needed facility for the then rapidly expanding college. [3] On September 15, 1986, LeRoy and Lucile Melcher donated $3 million to the College of Business Administration. Melcher Hall, named in their honor, is home to the Dean and all programs and institutes of the College of Business. [4]</p>
<p>In 2000 the college was re-named after C.T. Bauer who made a $40 million gift to the school. Today, the Bauer College has 63 full-time faculty with diverse backgrounds and major publications, and over 60 teaching assistants and adjunct faculty from the corporate community who teach and conduct research. The college offers degrees in Accounting, Management Information Systems, Supply Chain Management, Finance, Management, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and MBA, and several certification programs. Bauer’s home at the UH in one of the world’s most global cities attracts students from 139 countries – making it the single most diverse business school in the United States. [5]</p>

<p>Architecture first appeared at the university in the 1945-1946 school year. Then it was a two-year program offered through the College of Technology. In 1946, both architecture and architectural engineering were being offered within the College of Engineering. While the study of architecture remained within the College of Engineering through the 1955-1956 school year, a "new plan" for architectural training was initiated in the fall of 1950. This plan integrated all phases of architectural instruction in four channels: design, construction, aesthetics, and graphics. The School of Architecture began in the fall of 1956 and in the fall of 1961 it became the College of Architecture. [1]</p>
<p>In March of 1997 Gerald D. Hines donated $7 million to the College of Architecture at the University of Houston. In honor of the gift, the school was renamed the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture. The gift was by far the largest ever received by the architecture school and among the 10 largest gifts received by UH. [2]</p>
<p>Today, the study of architecture at the University of Houston is focused on design as the fundamental, essential activity of the discipline. As a public college of architecture located in a major urban setting, the college is able to take advantage of the numerous cultural, professional and industrial resources of the fourth largest city in America. With its unique form and vitality, Houston provides an exceptional laboratory for exploring problems and potentials of contemporary society. [3]</p>

<p>The College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences is a fairly new college in its current state, but it has a long tradition at the university. In the early days of the university, the components of CLASS were part of the College of Arts and Sciences. In the early 1970s, this college was divided into the College of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Communication (HFAC), the College of Social Sciences (SOS), and the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NSM). In 2000, SOS and HFAC were brought together to form CLASS. Its departments and schools occupy buildings ranging from the oldest building on campus, Roy G. Cullen Hall, to among the newest, like the Moores School of Music building. CLASS faculty teach nearly 10,000 students every semester, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Some current CLASS departments have been offering baccalaureate degrees since UH became a four-year institution in the 1930s. The first doctoral degrees were conferred in departments like History and Political Science in the mid 1970s. The Sarah Campbell Blaffer Gallery, the university’s art museum that is housed in CLASS, was dedicated in 1973 and the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts, was completed in late 2005.</p>
<p>CLASS’s 15 departments and schools all offer undergraduate and master’s degrees, and seven offer doctoral degrees. The College also has seven programs offering undergraduate minors. Cultural centers, like the Sarah Campbell Blaffer Gallery and the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts also make their home in CLASS.</p>
<p>With disciplines ranging from Art to Theatre, Anthropology to Sociology, and African American Studies to Women’s Studies, the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences is the largest and most diverse of the twelve colleges at the University of Houston.</p>

<p>The College of Education was established in 1942. During WWII, the college had a vital wartime assignment recruiting and retraining teachers to take the places of the hundreds who left the profession for high-paying jobs in the war industry or for the armed services. Former teachers, particularly women, were urged to seek recertification, primarily through a unique Education Workshop. [1] In 1945, the School of Education was expanded to offer the degree of Doctor in Education. [2]</p>
<p>Farish Hall, dedicated in 1975, is the current location of the College of Education. A large endowment from Mrs. Stephen Power Farish was given to name the College of Education Building for her husband, a former UH regent. [3]</p>
<p>he College of Education works to shape and staff educational systems that are responsive to our rapidly changing society. The college prepares teachers, counselors, psychologists, school and higher education administrators and professionals for a variety of educational settings, including work in social agencies, medical facilities, businesses, and government posts. The college offers students both a broad range of innovative programs and the opportunity to learn about recent developments in educational practice and thought. The university's urban setting also offers students the opportunity to work with learners in a variety of settings.</p>
<p>The College of Education is home to four academic departments - Curriculum and Instruction, Educational Leadership and Cultural Studies, Educational Psychology, and Health and Human Performance - and several centers and institutes.</p>

<p>Officially opened in 1947 with 28 students and one professor, the Law Center has seen many changes. In 1950 the Bates College of Law moved from temporary classrooms to the basement of the M.D. Anderson Library. Full accreditation from the American Bar Association came on February 24, 1953. [1] Ground was broken for the current facility, consisting of three buildings, in 1969. When it became obvious that additional funds were needed to complete the Bates College of Law a grant of $400,000 was made available. Krost Hall, part of the UH Law Center, was named in honor of this grant.</p>
<p>Today, the primary objective of the Law Center is to provide a context for excellence in legal education and research. It seeks to provide broad, but intensive, training in the legal profession with students exposed to a variety of perspectives on law and legal systems. Students are expected to develop familiarity with contemporary law and the legal skills necessary to function as competent, ethical professionals. The Law Center emphasizes neither a theoretical nor a practical view of law, but believes that both are integral to legal education.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, the Law Center experienced dramatic qualitative and quantitative growth. The student body consists of more than 1,000 individuals drawn from all parts of the country in a highly competitive admissions program. Many law students have graduate degrees or professional recognition in other disciplines. The student body's quality, professional achievement, geographic origin, and ethnic diversity represent strengths of the Law Center. These strengths result in placement of graduates in major law firms in Houston and throughout the country.</p>
<p>Instruction is conducted primarily by full-time law faculty. Many are nationally recognized experts in fields such as health law, intellectual property law, international law, energy law, environmental law, commercial law, family law, Constitutional law and tax law.

<p>The College of Optometry was established in 1952 by the Board of Regents as the result of a request from the Texas Optometric Association, which pledged to contribute $20,000 annually for operations. At the time of its establishment, the school was the only one in the South and the fifth in the nation to be established in connection with a university and with college entrance requirements. [1] Today, the school is one of only 17 optometry schools in the United States, and currently the only one in Texas. [2]</p>
<p>The College of Optometry, the University Eye Institute, and the Weston A. Petty Optometry Library are located in the J. Davis Armistead Building. Originally called the UH College of Optometry Building, constructed in 1976, the building changed names in 1993 to become the J. Davis Armistead Building in honor of Dr. Armistead’s dedication to the university and the profession. [3]</p>
<p>The teaching and research activities of the college are facilitated by the year-round operation of an outpatient clinic, the University Eye Institute, up-to-date research laboratories, an extensive library collection, a computer center, and instructional services. The College of Optometry offers the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree and the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in physiological optics. [4]</p>

<p>The College of Technology had its beginnings in 1941 when local firms contributed funds for the third permanent building on campus for the new School of Technology. The first technical institute programs to be initiated by the new college in 1945 were also the first engineering technology programs in the state of Texas, accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. By 1962 the College of Technology offered 16 programs - 9 vocational and 7 engineering technology programs. By 1968 the college was granting a Bachelor of Science in Technology degree.</p>
<p>Throughout the decades since the 1940s, the School of Technology has grown to meet the ever-changing disciplines associated with technology and the growing diversity of the student body. Today the college is comprised of three different departments and a wide range of disciplines. The Engineering Technology department has carried forth the engineering technology programs that were the hallmark of the college's early years, and now cover the areas of computer engineering, networks, construction management, electrical power and mechanical technology. The Human Development and Consumer Sciences department covers the areas of Consumer Merchandising and Human Resources Development and the Information and Logistics Technology department covers the areas of information technology, printing and computer graphics, logistics and technical leadership.</p>
<p>The College of Technology continues to revise and update its programs as technology changes and as the marketplace grows in its needs for competent, well-trained technologists. We are currently in the process of developing a new department in Life Sciences Technology based upon the expanding fields of biomedical engineering, bioinformatics and the expanding medical marketplace within the Houston area and around the world.</p>

<p>Establishing the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management</p>
<p>When Conrad N. Hilton traveled through Cisco, Texas, in 1919, the only bed available to him was a couch in the lobby of the Mobley Hotel. Conrad Hilton slept on that couch, and then, on the spot, he bought the hotel. Hilton built his empire by decisively seizing opportunity, and in August 1969, he saw his biggest single opportunity yet.</p>
<p>Building a Hospitality College — From the Ground Up</p>
<p>In August 1969, James Taylor, the College's first dean, presented Eric Hilton, Conrad N. Hilton's son, with blueprints, plans and specifications for a hospitality college to be located at the University of Houston. Eric Hilton shared the plans with his brother Barron. "We both thought what an honor it would be to have a school like this in Texas where our father really got his start," explained Eric.</p>
<p>The brothers presented the plans to Conrad Hilton, who immediately pledged $1.5 million to the project. Classes began on September 16, 1969, and in October, the president of the University of Houston, Phillip Hoffman, hosted a black tie dinner in Conrad Hilton's honor.</p>
<p>"We are honored to be associated with one of the world's most outstanding and successful men in the hotel industry. His name, his gift and his interest in our program will contribute greatly to the development of one of the finest schools of this type anywhere," said President Hoffman.</p>
<p>Providing Opportunities</p>
<p>Today, students work and learn in a $28.8 million complex that includes the 86-room Hilton University of Houston Hotel, a 40,000 square-foot conference center, two full-service restaurants, three ballrooms, banquet facilities, a wine cellar and numerous labs and test kitchens. In the nearly 40 years since the college's founding, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation has contributed more than $45 million in scholarships, endowed faculty chairs, building expansions and updates.</p>
<p>Conrad N. Hilton hoped to provide a hospitality college in which men and women could learn from those who came before them and appreciate the cross-section of contemporary life represented within our industry. He wanted "to give students...the opportunity that I did not have."</p>
<p>Conrad N. Hilton's vision is our reality, and our students continue to make the Hilton family proud.</p>

<p>The Department of Engineering was formed in 1934 with the chartering of the University, and in the school year 1939-1940 it became one of the most popular departments in the University. During the first long-term on their new campus, 397 students took engineering courses in the new air-cooled Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building. This was approximately one-seventh of the enrollment of the University at the time. [1]</p>
<p>In the fall of 1947, the University of Houston established the Co-op Program. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Program was to help students gain practical experience and to supplement their studies in either the Engineering or Business schools. This program still exists today under the name Co-operative Education. [2]</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. H.R. Cullen had been the principal benefactors of the University and, in particular, the College of Engineering for many years. In 1958 there was a great deal of sentiment expressed to change the name of the University to Cullen University. The Cullens refused the honor since they felt that its identity and its role with respect to the community would be affected. Their name was therefore given to the College of Engineering. [3]</p>
<p>One year after the official name change, a Building Dedication Ceremony was held for the brand new Cullen College of Engineering Building on May 3, 1968. This ceremony included the unveiling of a framed portrait of H. R. Cullen which still hangs today. [4]</p>
<p>The University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Today, more than 2,600 students are enrolled in engineering courses—1,840 undergraduates, 78 post-baccalaureates, 725 masters and doctoral students in biomedical, chemical, civil, computer, electrical, environmental, industrial, and mechanical engineering. The college also offers graduate programs in aerospace, environmental, industrial power systems, materials, and petroleum engineering. Chemical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering have ranked among the top programs nationally. [5]</p>

<p>The University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work (GCSW) was established by the Texas State Legislature in 1967 with initial funding of $150,000. The “founding” faculty totaled seven individuals and twenty-six enrolled in the first class. The program was initially housed in a World War II Quonset Hut.</p>
<p>From these modest beginnings, the graduate program evolved over time to its current standing as a nationally recognized graduate social work program. The MSW (Master of Social Work) program has continually maintained its Council on Social Work Education professional accreditation since 1970 and in 1992 the PhD program was approved by the Texas State Coordinating Board.</p>
<p>Today, the College is housed in its own four-story building on campus and includes twenty-four fulltime faculty and approximately fifteen adjunct faculty. The faculty includes individuals whose writings have been considered for the Pulitzer prize as well as the 1997 Nobel Peace prize recipient – the GCSW is the only social work program in the world to have a Nobel laureate on faculty.</p>
<p>Today there are approximately 350 students enrolled in the MSW program with an additional 40 students in the PhD program. Students come from all walks of life, numerous states, and a number of international countries and they reflect the broad racial and ethnic diversity of our greater community.</p>
<p>The College’s academic offerings include the MSW and PhD with dual degree opportunities in business (Masters of Business Administration), law (Juris Doctorate), and Public Health (Masters in Public Health). Additionally the College offers certificates in gerontology, political social work, and trabajo social.</p>
<p>The College of Social Work offers wonderful international experiences including field placement opportunities and travel courses. Recently, students have traveled to England, Scotland, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, and mainland China for course work. To support the many international initiatives, the College has formal exchange agreements in place with City University of Hong Kong and the University of Wales.</p>
<p>More then 3,000 individuals have received their MSW degree from the University of Houston. The GCSW alumni continue to make significant differences in their clients’ lives, help formulate just social policies, while advocating and promoting justice for all people, no matter their stage in life.</p>

<p>The Honors Program was established in the late 1940s along with a governing committee and council. In an October 25, 1947 meeting of the Committee on Honors Courses and Graduation with Honors, the committee recommended “ a) That honors courses be defined as courses set up for superior students and the content be more extensive, more intensive and more profound than that of the regular courses. The requirements in honors courses will be on a higher academic level, b) That the purpose of the honors course be to make available to the superior students work of the highest caliber …e) That honors courses shall be limited to the freshman year at this time.” [1]</p>
<p>Since its start the Honors College has grown to become an important part of the University of Houston student experience. The Honors College invokes a sense of community amongst its students and faculty through exclusive amenities, a dynamic learning and mentoring environment, and special privileges.</p>
<p>Through a challenging curriculum taught by world-renowned faculty, Honors students receive a well-balanced education as well as one-on-one mentoring and personalized academic advising — all leading to success.</p>
<p>The Honors College Mission &amp; Vision website identifies its Vision: "The Honors College at the University of Houston is a nationally recognized, intellectually stimulating learning community. As a vibrant, leading presence within the University, the Honors College attracts highly talented and motivated students and educators to a collegial environment where tradition is honored and possibilities are both created and realized."

<p>In 2014, violent protests and civil unrest in Ukraine’s capital city of Kiev erupted into a revolution that sought to remove President Viktor Yanukovych. The standing government was ousted and plans were put in place to elect an interim government and restore the previous constitution. Russia refused to recognize the revolution and began an invasion of the Crimea, which Ukraine considered sovereign territory. The European Union backed the formation of a stable governing body in Ukraine, but pro-Russian factions within the country led to continued unrest and a standoff with Russian forces occupying Crimea and Sevastopol.</p>

<p>Kay B. Crooker was a professional and volunteer advocate for Houston’s quality of life for more than thirty years.  Appointed to the City of Houston Planning and Zoning Commission in 1984 and reappointed by five different Mayors, Crooker retired in 2008.  As a former president of Scenic Houston (a collection in the Houston History Archives) and board member with The Park People (Houston History Archives), Katy Prairie Conservancy, Buffalo Bayou Partnership, Quality of Life Coalition, and Trees for Houston, Crooker was key in the development of Houston’s Tree and Shrub ordinance .  Crooker was a strong advocate for zoning and was active in the most recent, unsuccessful campaign to enact zoning in Houston in 1993. </p>
<p>As a neighborhood activist, Crooker became the first woman to join the Tanglewood Homeowners Association’s board of directors.  Then the board elected her president of the board.  Subsequently, Crooker founded the Houston Homeowners Association and served for three years as its president.</p>
<p>Crooker expressed her philosophy of activism when she signed on with “1000 Friends of Houston – Houston deserves to be a better place to live.”  As a dedicated activist, Crooker worked devotedly to fulfill this claim for Houston’s future. Mrs. Crooker died on August 20, 2012. Her endless contributions and hard work for the city of Houston left a trail of great outcomes and her personal imprint on civic duty.</p>

<p>World Affairs Council (Gulf Coast/Houston) Records collection consists of documents relating to the Gulf Coast Council on Foreign Affairs, Gulf Coast World Affairs Council, and Houston World Affairs Council. In 1976, fourteen individuals founded Gulf Coast Council on Foreign Affairs as a result of their participation in College of the Mainland’s annual, eight-week Great Decisions foreign policy study-discussion program. Organization by-laws designed an organization that was self-sustaining through membership dues and fundraising.</p>
<p>Programs developed by the evolving organization encouraged public awareness of global conditions involving international political, economic, and military issues and introduced participants to the diversity of cultures around the world. It was the Council’s policy to provide information without assuming particular positions, operating from the premise that every citizen in a democratic society has the right and perhaps an obligation to be informed. Robert Handy served as the first Board Chairman, then functioned as the Council’s Executive Director. In 1984, when Handy resigned his administrative role with the Council to assume the position of Executive Director of the Houston World Trade Association, the Council had hundreds of members with chapters in Houston, Clear Lake, Lake Jackson and Galveston.</p>
<p>In 1984, the organization’s name changed to Gulf Coast World Affairs Council, and leadership moved to the Center for International Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. The Center’s Director William J. Cunningham, assumed the role of Executive Director of the Council.</p>
<p>During 1987-1988, the organization’s name changed again to Houston World Affairs Council. Later, these steps led to formation of the World Affairs Council of Houston, an organization still active and working to promote effective communication in a global community.</p>
<p>Records in this collection reflect the formative years of an organization devoted to promoting global understanding among local citizens, designing educational experiences locally as well as abroad, and creating opportunities for exchange of information in an international contexts.</p>

<p>Starting in 1970, Hana Ginzbarg spearheaded the campaign to rename and preserve Middle Bayou. Renamed became Armand Bayou to memorialize Armand Yramategui, a conservationist beloved by Houston’s environmental community. Ginzbarg devoted herself to the campaign to preserve Armand Bayou as “a small urban wilderness reserve” and protect it from impending residential development. Ginzbarg sent letters, made phone calls, photographed the bayou, attended political meetings, wrote press releases and newsletter columns, and generally performed like a whirling dervish for whom no task was too insignificant to merit her careful attention. It should be noted that Ginzbarg became acquainted with the bayou systems in Houston through her participation in the “Save Buffalo Bayou” campaign mounted by the Bayou Preservation Association in whose records also are preserved in the Houston History Archives.</p>
<p>As preserved by the campaign, Armand Bayou Nature Center includes 500 acres of the natural wetlands forest, prairie, and marsh habitats once abundant in the Houston/Galveston area. It offers habitat for 370 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and offers hiking trails, exhibits, field trips, Scout programs, birding, and a farm, and it an effective natural flood management system. Money, land, and development were the triggers in the Armand Bayou preservation campaign, rather than local government action.</p>

<p>The Stephen F. Austin High School Scottish Brigade drill team was founded by Beatrice Lytle in September of 1937. The Scottish Brigade’s mission was defined as service to school and community, as well as embracing the ideals of honor, spirit and loyalty. Drill teams played an important social role in the years that the Scottish Brigade was active. Girls’ sports teams were rare or nonexistent in many American high schools and colleges until the enforcement of Title IX in 1972, and drill teams like the Scottish Brigade offered a place to promote scholarship, discipline, respect, leadership skills, social skills and fitness to high school girls.</p>
<p>For the next forty years the Scottish Brigade performed at Austin High School football games, as well as drill team contests and city and state parades and festivals. The brigade disbanded on May 25, 1978. On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Scottish Brigade, the alumnae decided to form an association to keep the memory and spirit of the Scottish Brigade alive. In 1987 the Scottish Brigade Alumnae Association formed and is still active providing scholarships to Austin High School students and planning yearly meetings of Brigade alumnae.</p>

<p>Student organizations have been an important part of the University of Houston since before it was a four-year institution. Student organizations played a considerable role in the overall educational process at what was then called the Houston Junior College (established in 1927), in spite of difficulties of finding time for meetings and activities, of having facilities available, and of stretching already-taut student budgets for even the most modest dues and fees. [1]</p>
<p>The Cougar was actually the first extracurricular activity at HJC, pre-dating the original classes in journalism (which began in 1928-1929 under Fred R. Birney) by a full year. It was both a laboratory for journalism students and a student actiivty. [2]</p>
<p>Other “original” student organizations include a girl’s basketball team, an ice hockey team, the Student Council, The John R. Bender Dramatic Club, the HJC Oratorical Association, the Cougar Collegians, the Girl’s Outdoor Club, the Guild Savant, the Student Association, the Speakers’ Club, the Cougar, and the Houstonian.

<p>Today, the University of Houston is the second most ethnically diverse major research university in the United States. Students come to UH from more than 137 nations and from across the U.S. The student body comprises more than 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The diversity of the campus can be seen by the broad range of student organizations that exist. There are approximately 500 student organizations and 16 intercollegiate sports teams. These organizations vary in focus, from political or social, to religious. [4]</p>
<p>The Council of Ethnic Organizations (CEO) is a student-fee funded organization founded in 1972. It works with member organizations to promote cultural awareness, diversity, and inclusion. [6]</p>
<p>The Center for Student Involvement (CSI) helps students develop student organizations, coordinate events, and gain valuable skills in the process. [5]</p>

<p>Born at Le Havre in Normandy, in 1892, Jules Vern came to this country in 1930.  Jules Vern was called in 1934 to the University of Houston to occupy a chair of professor of French; he organized the study of French so it would be a pleasure for his students to learn this language.  When the Cullen Building was opened, he decorated his vast classroom with oil paintings, glass closets containing collections of rare objects, and shelves holding documentary books and foreign magazines.  Soon his department was outstanding.  He created a club, Le Quartier Latin, and a newspaper that he humorously called Le Feuille de Chou, written and published by his students. </p>
<p>With great success, he had previously founded Le Petit Théâtre Français de Houston, where many of the plays were his own and where French speaking Houstonians, professors of French, including the founder, and students performed.  The French Government recognized his efforts in awarding him the decoration Officier d’Académie.</p>
<p>But the great achievement of his life has been the creations of Le Bayou.  Jules Vern had the ambitious idea to publish a French magazine in Houston, a magazine in which would be found novels, short stories, essays, critiques, folklore, legends, and poetry concerning France and the South of the United States.  In spite of financial difficulties, his tremendous will and perseverance brought success, and Le Bayou was born.  In the following years, Le Bayou became known the world over, and was praised by the most prominent writers, not only of France, but of all the French-speaking countries.  In 1946, the Academie Française granted to this magazine Le Prix de la Langue Française and a medal engraved with its name.  Later, Jules A. Vern received coveted decoration of Officier de l’Instruction Publique as a reward for his literary achievements.</p>

first formed in 1949 the Houston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area covered only Harris
County and had a population of 806,701 people. The increasing use of automobiles also led to
the building of expressways in the 1950s that extended over 200 miles by 1990. The
prosperity after World War II brought the world famous Galleria shopping mall with its
interior ice-skating rink in 1970. In the ordering of urban space Houston politicians and

development to any great extent, however, since heavy industry concentrated in the area of
the ship channel and subdivisions controlled construction through deed restrictions. This

<p>Debra Danburg was a representative of the Democratic Party in the state of Texas from 1981 to 2003. She was a dynamic leader who brought about significant changes in many outdated laws. She is an attorney in private practice and has dealt with many criminal, as well as civil, cases. Debra Danburg represented district 137 in Houston, which encompassed Montrose, The Heights, Memorial Park, Greenway Plaza, Highland Village, the Galleria and Gulfton areas in Houston.</p>
<p>Debra Danburg was born in Houston in the year 1951. The Danburgs are long-time residents of the Heights, part of the District which Danburg served. She began working on her bachelor’s degree at the age of 16 at the University of Houston. She actively took part in the Student Association and was eventually elected for the post of vice-president in 1973-74. Danburg obtained a bachelor’s in sociology in 1974 and in 1979 received her law degree from the University of Houston Bates College of Law. She served as an administrative aide to Ron Waters from 1976-1980 before she ran for election as a Democratic Party candidate for the former District 79.</p>
<p>During the five years that she worked for Waters, Danburg researched, wrote and encouraged legislation. She was involved in issues ranging from the Equal Rights Amendment to street and sewer repairs. She obtained governmental appointments for constituents and prevented the merger of two local precincts, which would have disenfranchised voters. She was also a member of the Democratic Executive Committee during this time.</p>
<p>Debra Danburg was elected to the 67th Legislature for her first term in 1981. She served on various committees during her tenure in the Legislature. She was the Chair of the Elections Committee during the 73rd and 74th Legislatures (1993-1997) and of the Subcommittee on Budget &amp; Oversight in the 71st Legislature (1989-1991). Danburg was also the vice-chair of the Committee on Cultural and Historic Resources. Additionally, she was a member of the Committees on State Affairs, Business and Industry, Criminal Jurisprudence, State Affairs and Appropriations.</p>
<p>Debra Danburg was instrumental in bringing about legislation concerning women’s reproductive rights. She strongly opposed pro-life groups and successfully upheld laws protecting a woman’s right to choose. Danburg also argued for an “open mind” on abortion in order that women could have “clean, licensed and safe” abortions, thus preventing unnecessary deaths resulting from illegal and unsafe clinics.</p>
<p>One of her most significant achievements as a legislator was the passage of HB 1730, which made important changes in the old rape laws. Danburg coined the term “sexual assault” to replace “rape” which would henceforth include all genders and all acts of rape and attempted rape. The bill signified the amount of violence involved in the acts and hence removed any kind of “pleasure” references. Her law became a model for other states and was eventually applied nationwide. Danburg was also successful in passing HB 263, which ended spousal exemption from sexual assault. Spouses could now report marital rape, which eventually could lead to prosecution. She also introduced a landmark bill on stalking to join those other states where stalking was considered an offense.</p>
<p>Another of Danburg’s important accomplishments was the passage of the “3-G” legislation. She was the first woman to pass this bill, which would stop parole and “good time” early release of criminals convicted of capital murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery or aggravated sexual assault. It was observed that these criminals often commit violent acts within one year of their release. With the passage of this bill, such criminals would not be released until they served their full terms. Danburg also supported alternative punishments based on the brutality of the crimes. Some of the options included drug rehabilitation counseling, restitution centers and boot camps. She sponsored legislation that endorsed the Sexual Offender Treatment Program, aimed at rehabilitating sex crime offenders before they got out of prison. She supported the idea of reserving prisons for the worst offenders.</p>
<p>Danburg sponsored a number of initiatives toward preventing hate crimes. She worked to pass legislation which would grant and protect the rights of gays and lesbians. Her proposals sought to restrain perpetrators of hate crimes against homosexuals, religious groups and racial minorities. She filed legislation preventing discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, origin, or sexual orientation. She was responsible for introducing the first bill to allow marriages with no regard to sexual orientation. HIV/AIDS also was another major concern for Danburg. She passed legislation to facilitate easy purchase of drugs like AZT, to protect the right to insurance regardless of blood tests, and to create councils to aid state and local agencies to fight HIV and AIDS. She supported organizations such as the Houston Gay &amp; Lesbian Political Caucus, AIDS Foundation of Houston and The Diana Foundation, and she actively took part in Lesbian/Gay Pride Week.</p>
<p>The last of Debra Danburg’s major concerns, represented in this collection, was the Electric Utility Restructuring bill. Danburg was part of a delegation that visited California and Pennsylvania in order to study their utility models and hence implement a similar model in Texas. The bill allowed customers to choose their electric provider and, conversely, the providers could compete with each other to give their customers the best deals.</p>
<p>Danburg also was involved in many other issues concerning METRO and the Southwest Freeway in Houston, as well as a number of other concerns local to Houston. As a member of the House for twenty-two years, she was an experienced leader who played a key role in ensuring equal opportunity and justice to Texas citizens.</p>
<p>Danburg was the recipient of many awards within and outside the legislature. She received the Best Legislator Award during her first year at the Capitol. She received the Most Effective Legislator Award by the National Organization for Women and, in recognition of her activities, received the Outstanding Legislator Award in 1990 by the Texas Association of Symphony Orchestras. Her list of other awards include Alumna of the Year from the UH College of Social Sciences (1993), the Women’s Suffrage Award (1991) and the Environmental Defense Award (1987).</p>

<p>Women for Justice was a model program, which started in 1971 and gradually ended around 1997. The program, ran by women, became an independent organization in 1977 after originally being apart of the Women in Action’s Criminal Justice Division. It was dedicated to working with inmates, ex-offenders, all criminal justice agencies, Houston/Harris County Courts, and Goree State Prison.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the program was to teach offenders to deal with the trauma of incarceration while they awaited trial or served short term sentences. Moreover, the organization strived to help inmates and offenders understand the court system as it pertained to them. The program tracked as many clients as possible so that they could be assisted in making future plans. Additionally, a community based Resource Center was established. Social services were provided to inmates, ex-offenders, parolees and their families in a non-threatening atmosphere by a group of citizen volunteers aptly named Volunteers in Action.</p>
<p>The services provided varied greatly. The Christmas project, which was conducted during the week of Christmas, provided inmates with donated socks, toiletries, apparel, etc. Job counseling was provided free of charge to help former inmates and parolees in search of employment. There were daily/weekly prison visitations/workshops given by Volunteers in Action. Women for Justice received financial support from numerous organizations and companies such as Shell Oil Company, Exxon U.S.A, and First Presbyterian Church. In addition, the M.D. Anderson Foundation donated a house, which allowed for the organization to effectively perform daily activities and operations.</p>

<p>In 1969, Ninfa’s husband died suddenly, and she was left to raise five children. Ninfa mortgaged her house and opened a little taqueria on the site of the tortilla factory. In 1973, she opened a ten-table restaurant, serving her mother’s recipes and adding her own. With money from a friend in Mexico, Ninfa soon opened a second dining room and later pushed out a wall to expand again. Within ten years, the single restaurant expanded into a multi-million dollar business with nine restaurants in Houston and one in Dallas. In 1985, Ninfa employed 800-1000 people and served about two million people per year. Some believe that Ninfa Laurenzo laid the foundation for the Mexican restaurant industry in Houston.</p>
<p>Ninfa’s restaurants were so successful that expansion came fast and led to excessive debt. Restaurants opened too quickly and without reliable store managers. In 1985, Ninfa, USA became a subsidiary of McFaddin, which employed her sons as executives. Ninfa remained with Ninfa’s Inc. That arrangement did not last. By 1997, an Austin restaurant chain bought the company to pull it out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>With her success, Ninfa gave back to the community with nonprofit service. She served on the boards of the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston Community College System, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority and Houston Hispanic Forum. She received many rewards as well, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s Business Recognition Award, for example. In 1984, Vice-President George Bush appointed Ninfa to be one of five goodwill ambassadors to welcome Pope John Paul II to Puerto Rico. In 1996, Ninfa Laurenzo was named one of eight Legends of Texas along with Walter Cronkite and Barbara Jordan, for their impact on Texas and their local communities. Ninfa was inducted into the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame in 1998, and Theater under the Stars made her life into a musical.</p>
<p>Ninfa Laurenzo represented her community politically as well. In 1988, Ninfa seconded George H. W. Bush’s nomination for president in the Republican Convention in New Orleans. In 1992, Ninfa was co-chair of the hospitality committee for the Republican Convention in Houston where she opened the convention with a speech in both English and Spanish, and she led the delegates in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
<p>Through marriage, the Laurenzo family is tied to both the Mandolas and Carrabas. At the opening of a new restaurant, one of Ninfa’s sons, Tom Laurenzo said, “We have a story to tell about a woman who is a great cook and about her family that followed her into the business.” Ninfa Laurenzo died in 2001, but her restaurants and her children’s restaurants continue as landmarks in Houston’s cultural history.</p>

<p>Scenic Houston is a chapter of Scenic Texas, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that
focuses on promoting policies and actions that enhance the beauty and appeal of our
streetscapes and roadways. Scenic Houston works to reduce existing billboard blight, prevent
new billboard construction, foster attractive on-premises signage, incorporate
context-sensitive design in the planning of highways and other public projects, and protect
the natural beauty and distinctive character of our communities for the benefit of
successive generations.</p>
<p>Scenic Houston's roots are deep. In 1966, concerned Houstonians formed Billboards Limited
to fight against the mushrooming billboard blight in our city. Billboards Limited fought to
establish, for the first time ever, a City of Houston sign ordinance as a means to create
standards and regulations for billboards in the city. Despite overtures from Billboards
Limited to work together in this process, the billboard industry fought any kind of
regulation and would not compromise. In addition, City elected leadership of the era was
ineffective in leading stakeholders toward establishing effective standards. By 1980,
Houston was home to more than 10,000 billboards and was known in the media as the "Billboard
Capitol of the World".</p>
<p>Such a designation was recognized by not only Billboards Limited but a new generation of
community leaders as an economic development black eye for Houston. In 1980, Houston city
council unanimously passed an ordinance banning new billboard construction in the city. This
marked a significant turning point in the campaign for signage standards in the city, and
sparked a desire for statewide advocacy to protect the appearance and quality of life of
roads and streets statewide. As a result, in 1984, Billboards Limited was re-organized as
The Lone Star Roadside Council, a state-wide non-profit organization. A final name change
occurred in 1991 with the establishment of Scenic Texas, Inc. as the statewide entity and
Scenic Houston as its largest and most active local chapter.</p>
<p>Currently, the chapters of Scenic Texas are run by a mix of staff members and volunteers.
Scenic Houston has been able to attract generous donors from Houston. Successful in its
attempts to make Houston an uncommonly beautiful and economically dynamic city, Scenic
Houston believes that successful economic development can only be achieved if a high
priority is placed on quality of life issues. The organization seeks and supports public
policies, at all levels of government, which promote and enhance the visual quality of life
aspects of Houston's urban landscape.</p>

<p>Professor Ruth Pennybacker or "Miss Pennybacker", as she preferred, joined the U.H. faculty in 1935. Her application to the university included a letter of recommendation written by the distinguished Texas historian and writer J. Frank Dobie. Pennybacker, a 1934 Vassar graduate, went to work in the newly formed English Department at the University of Houston where she taught freshman composition and creative writing. A driving force in the creation of the U.H. creative writing program, Pennybacker also founded the Harvest, a campus publication for students, poets, and creative writers.</p>

<p>Faculty Association</p>
<p>The Faculty Association of the University of Houston Constitution and By - Laws, adopted January 20, 1947 outlined the principle purposes as: to foster a bond of fellowship among its members; to promote the progress of the University of Houston; to act as a service organization and open forum, and to direct the operation of the Faculty Club. Membership was limited to full time faculty, including research faculty of the University of Houston whose duties were primarily non-administrative.</p>
<p>On November 19, 1962, a faculty committee concluded that the first three parts of the Faculty Association Constitution were being served by the Faculty Senate, and that the sole purpose of the Faculty Associates seemed to be; "To direct the operation of the Faculty Club." The merger Committee recommended the amalgamation of the two associations and that a committee composed of the Chairman of the two organization plus two members at large be appointed to rewrite the constitution and by laws of the new organization to be named: University of Houston Faculty Club.</p>
<p>Faculty Assembly</p>
<p>The Faculty Assembly consisted of almost 100 representatives from the institutional department and colleges, with the number of representatives varying from four to one, depending upon the student enrollment within the component involved. The Assembly had an elected president and secretary, a 14-person Faculty Council with its own Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and representative to the Executive Council; and an eight-person Steering Committee. Dr. T.C. Sinclair stated that the purpose of the Faculty Assembly would be to create a "real faculty community of scholars" and that the work of the Assembly would be carried on largely by committees.</p>
<p>Faculty Senate</p>
<p>Faculty Senate adopted its formal Constitution in May 1961, with the goal of providing "an instrument for cooperative action in attaining such ends as the member may select." The Faculty Senate reorganized, freely, in 1962 at the beginning of the Hoffman administration and formed several new committees including a Committee on University Committees, Student Life, Educational Policy, and Faculty Affairs. The first official faculty handbook was also completed during this period. The Faculty Senate consists of 52 permanent members elected by the faculty.</p>
<p>Shared governance is now a major goal of the organization and is defined by the Faculty Senate as the "collective commitment of the faculty and administration at the University of Houston to work cooperatively, together with the University Constituencies, to achieve a common vision of excellence for the University.</p>

<p>The University of Houston played an important part in the United States' efforts during
the Second World War. Among its many contributions, the institution housed the first
Naval School established in a college, training more than five thousand Navy personnel
and several hundred Army and Navy pilots. Following the war, many of the nation's
servicemen and women returned to colleges and universities to take advantage of the
Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill of Rights. Under the
GI Bill, veterans received up to $500 a year from the government to cover tuition and
fees as well as a monthly stipend.</p>
<p>Just as the University of Houston contributed to the war effort, following the war it
contributed to the education of thousands of returning veterans. Dr. W.W. Kemmerer,
assistant to the university president, strongly influenced the university's successful
shift from a wartime to a peacetime stance. The postwar years were an era of significant
growth for the fledgling institution. Many UH students used the GI Bill to further
training obtained in the military, learn a vocational trade, or pursue college degrees.
Enrollment for Fall semester 1944 reached 2,720, a significant increase from the 1,104
students just a year before. By the 1947-1948 school year enrollment reached 10,882.</p>
<p>To aid veterans in their transition from military to student life, UH established a
guidance program with Richard O. Jonas as chief counselor and Roy A. Crouch as head of
the office of psychological services. In December 1944 the U.S. Veterans Administration
selected the University of Houston as the site for an official VA Advisement Center,
augmenting the guidance program's effectiveness. The office provided assistance in
application for admission to the university and obtaining compensation through the GI
Bill. A special housing bureau helped veterans and their families locate places to live.
Counselors, often former members of the armed forces themselves, aided ex-soldiers with
registration, career guidance, and overall readjustment to civilian life.</p>

Many UH students used the GI Bill to further training obtained in the military, learn a vocational trade, or pursue college degrees. By 1945, a steady influx of veterans created a shortage in student housing. The Board of Regents realized the university needed more housing and on November 9, 1945 allotted $194,000 for temporary quarters. A week later UH accepted a gift of three hundred trailers. The converted navy barracks and the trailers formed a nucleus of ex-servicemen's housing known as the Veterans Village. Rent ranged from $30 to $37.50 a month.</p>
<p>The Veterans Village became a community in itself, complete with a constitution, governing council, regular newsletter, and nursery school. A veteran's club also formed on campus and drew many of its members from those living in the Village. The Veterans Club and Veterans' Council concerned themselves with veterans rights and even petitioned Congress for an investigation into local bureau of veterans affairs in late 1945 and early 1946 when numerous UH students did not receive their disbursements. In 1956, due to deteriorating conditions, the last trailer was removed as the Veterans Village yielded to the expanding campus.</p>

<p>In December 1976, President Philip Hoffman began a project that he was particularly determined to bring to a successful conclusion. On December 7, at the Houston Country Club, he announced the 50th Anniversary of the University, with events to run throughout 1977. At that kickoff event, Hoffman also announced the UH 50 Fund, a fundraising campaign with the goal of raising between $23.5 and $32.5 million for priority needs by 1981. During this period the Cullen Foundation pledged $3 million to endow nine distinguished professorships contingent upon the university raising another $6 million in matching funds. The university selected four topical areas for the yearlong celebration: resources, technologies, lifestyles, and environments. These topics were interwoven in lectures and seminars throughout the year.</p>
<p>The events of the half-century observance were varied and included: the French government sending an arts festival; a series of noted speakers, seminars, and conferences; a German Expressionist art exhibition and lectures; a symposium in conjunction with the dedication of the new College of Optometry; and the dedication of the Freeman Wing of the library.</p>

<p>From its inception as a four-year institution in 1934 until the 1942-1943 academic year,
the University of Houston consisted of the General College and the Junior College. All areas
of academic study at the upper levels were pursued within the General College, while the
Junior College provided more vocational and technical training. With the 1942-44 catalog, a
new organizational plan was announced. This plan divided the General College into seven
schools, based primarily on different academic disciplines.</p>
<p> The College of Arts and Sciences, created in 1942, consisted of three divisions: the
Division of Cultural Arts, the Division of Sciences, and the Division of Social Sciences.
The departments within the College of Arts and Sciences were as varied as the divisions,
with students able to pursue both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in areas
ranging from drama and music to mathematics and physics.</p>
<p> The College of Arts and Sciences continued as the central instructional unit of the
University of Houston through the mid-1970s. The curricula encouraged students to explore
many fields of intellectual interest, while examining one field in depth. In late 1972,
President Philip Hoffman appointed a committee to investigate a possible reorganization of
the university's administration. One area of investigation was the possible division of the
College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p> The study found that the areas of responsibility of the Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences were "too broad," making the "offering of dynamic leadership to the college almost
impossible because of the numerous departments and special programs, which report to this
office." With the recommendations of the study group and President Hoffman, the Board of
Regents authorized the reorganization of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1975 the
College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three colleges: the College of Humanities and
Fine Arts, the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and the College of Social
Sciences.</p>

<p>The Petroleum Institute was an annual educational seminar, consisting of three courses, held at the University of Houston from 1958 until 1994. It was a joint effort between the Oil Information Committee of the Texas Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association and the Department of Curriculum and Instruction of the College of Education. University faculty and individuals from the petroleum industry conducted the Institute. The Institute was designed to inform participants about all aspects of the petroleum industry. By doing so, it crossed the traditional course content fields that had previously taught at UH. The areas where the content of the Institute could be used were as follows: 1. Sciences (emphasized earth science, geology, chemistry, and physics); 2. Environmental Studies; 3. Social Sciences (emphasized economics, geography, history, and political science).</p>
<p>The content of the courses included presentations by lecturers from the petroleum industry who were experts on a particular subject. The courses also included the development of teaching materials that could be used to infuse energy education into the curriculum. The three courses carried three semester hours of graduate credit and were accepted by many graduate programs within the Department of Curriculum and Instruction.</p>

<p>In response to student demands, the African American Studies Program was established during the late 1960s. The program offers courses that focus on the history and culture of African Americans and the contributions that people of African descent have made to American and world civilizations.</p>
<p>Over the past thirty years the African American Studies Program has added new courses, received additional and continuous funding, stimulated increased student interest, and expanded its associated cultural activities and community presence. Recruitment and retention of African American students has also been an important goal of the African American Studies Program. Enrollment now (as of 2002) stands at over 1,600 students.</p>
<p>The organization outlined its goals for the nineties as: (1) creating a new generation of leaders who challenge stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination and belief systems that hinder the intellectual emancipation and personal growth of all members of society, (2) promoting a mutual understanding between various ethnic and cultural groups of the university, and (3) developing an awareness of the richness of the African American experience and the contributions of African Americans to society.</p>

<p>Hazelwitch Productions was established in 1981 by a group of women dedicated to bringing
lesbian and feminist performers to the Houston community. The organization was
incorporated in April 1983 and, over a fifteen year period, produced around forty events
featuring musicians, comedians, and performance artists. In addition to performances,
Hazelwitch presented films, workshops, and counseling sessions.</p>
<p>At any one time there were between three and five active members in the corporation,
supported by a network of secondary members and volunteers. Key members were Cheryl
Wolfarth (the organization's founder), Tori Williams, Pokey Anderson, Cindy
Edwards, Katherine Hubbard, Kathy Wilcox, and Gail Eldridge. Remembering Hazelwitch,
Kathy Wilcox stressed the cooperative nature of the corporation's management and
pointed out that officers were chosen for legal reasons only; decisions were made by
consensus in an atmosphere of mutual support and with a strong commitment to feminist
ideals.</p>
<p>Although Hazelwitch did not publish a newsletter, events were promoted through the local
gay/lesbian press. One notable publicity outlet was "The Wand," the newsletter
of the lesbian collective "Womynspace" which had been active since the mid
1980s and has produced the group "Lesbians Over the Age of Fifty," or
"L.O.A.F." Pokey Anderson and Cheryl Wolfarth also publicized Hazelwitch on a
KPFT radio show which aired until 1994.</p>
<p>Typical venues for productions were churches, restaurants, university auditoriums, and
theaters, and Hazelwitch engaged the Houston Area Women's Center and local area
bookstores, among others, as outlets for ticket sales. The corporation also enjoyed the
sponsorship of organizations such as the University of Houston chapter of N.O.W. and the
Montrose Counseling Center. In turn they donated proceedings to groups such as the Aids
Foundation of Houston and KPFT Radio.</p>
<p>Despite frugal financial management the 1990s brought difficulties for the corporation
due to a decline in ticket sales to Hazelwitch events. Patty Larkin's appearance at
the Heinen Theatre in March 1996 was the corporation's last major production, and
the process of dissolution was initiated that same year. As lesbian performers have
begun to enjoy more mainstream success, their need for the kind of close-knit community
support, which Hazelwitch provided, has apparently waned. Nevertheless, it is largely
due to the groundbreaking efforts of organizations such as Hazelwitch that this on-going
transition to the mainstream is possible.</p>

<p>The Top Ladies of Distinction is a national professional and humanitarian organization,
incorporated in 1964 in Texas. In addition to the national organization, there are local
chapters throughout the United States, which hold area meetings. The original focus of
the organization was to promote scholarship for today's youth, to provide
experiences that would help youth develop social graces to perform comfortably in a
cultural society, to point up opportunities for youth to become employable, to help make
America beautiful, and to assist the aged. This changed in 1972 to focus on the Top
Teens of America (a program for young people, sponsored by the Top Ladies of

in the status of women. These programming areas have continued to be the main priorities

<p>In the course of her career Nikki Van Hightower has been Women's Advocate for the City of Houston, Moderator/Commentator at Radio Station KTRH, Executive Director of the Houston Area Women's Center, and Harris County Treasurer. She has held teaching positions at the University of Houston, Texas A &amp; M University, Lee Community College, the University of Texas School of Public Health, and the New York Institute of Technology. She has been an outspoken activist in the women's movement and a leading proponent of equality for women in the city of Houston.</p>
<p>Van Hightower became involved in the women's movement while in college in the early 1970s; she continued her involvement after moving to Houston in 1975. In 1976 she was appointed to the position of Women's Advocate by Mayor Fred Hofheinz, and was responsible for "coordinating efforts to secure equal rights for women" in Houston. In this capacity she served as the city liaison for the International Women's Year National Conference, which was held in Houston in 1977, and raised public awareness of women's issues with her daily presentation of the Women's Advocate Hour on Radio Station KTRH.</p>
<p>Van Hightower's criticism of inequalities in city employment practices, and her feminist activities, ensured her unpopularity with City Council members. In 1977 they voted to reduce her salary to $1.00 a year in an effort to force her to abandon the role of Women's Advocate. Hofheinz countered by reinstating her as "Affirmative Action Specialist," allowing her to carry out the same job under a different name. She remained in this position until Jim McConn, who succeeded Hofheinz as mayor, fired her in March 1978.</p>
<p>KTRH Radio subsequently hired Van Hightower to present daily commentaries and host the call-in show Doubletalk with Ed Brandon. She was fired from the station, apparently for being too controversial, in March 1979.</p>
<p>By this time she was committed to working with the Houston Area Women's Center, which she helped to establish in 1977. In 1979 she became the Center's Executive Director and held that position until 1986.</p>
<p>In 1983, Van Hightower entered elective politics, campaigning unsuccessfully for City Council At Large Position 4. In 1986, she launched a successful campaign for Harris County Treasurer, and took office in January 1987. For the next three years she fought policies which compromised the Treasurer's control of county finances. In 1990 she was unsuccessful in her bid as Democratic Nominee for State Treasurer. She currently holds the positions of Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, and Senior Lecturer with the Health Science Center at Texas A &amp; M University.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Van Hightower received numerous honors and awards and established an impressive vita of community involvement, publications, speaking engagements, and teaching appointments. Her refusal to be intimidated by the "old boy" political network, which she viewed as a fundamental obstacle to equality and justice, enabled her to implement significant changes for the citizens of Houston.</p>

<p>The Greater Houston Women's Foundation (GHWF) was established in 1990 by a group of Houston women who were concerned that only four to five percent of nationwide charitable donations were allocated to help women and girls. Consequently, the Greater Houston Women's Foundation was created to focus specifically on the needs of women and girls in Houston, and the mission of the Greater Houston Women's Foundation is to provide funding for projects and programs that benefit women and girls. Through grants, the Foundation gives back to the community seventy-five percent of the money donated.</p>
<p>Each year, the Greater Houston Women's Foundation awards grants to agencies and programs that are devoted to women and girls. The Grants Committee reviews proposals and makes its recommendations to the Board of Trustees, who then finalize the selection. The Foundation typically awards grants to seven to twelve agencies per year, at its annual Grants luncheon. The Foundation strives to award grants to a diversity of programs. Recent recipients include the Chinese Community Center, the Women's Home and the Women's Resource and Crisis Center in Galveston, Project Row Houses, Chinquapin School, ESCAPE Family Resource Center, the Houston READ Commission, and the San Jacinto Girl Scouts.</p>
<p>Education is another important component of the Greater Houston Women's Foundation The Foundation sponsors a number of educational seminars and conferences, many of which feature prominent Houston women who address issues such as career enhancement and the importance of self-confidence and self-esteem for women and girls. The main focus of the Foundation's educational efforts, is however, financial planning and money management.</p>
<p>The Greater Houston Women's Foundation and several institutions of higher learning in the Houston area, including the University of Houston, Texas Southern University, and Houston Community College, have worked together on research projects which examine current issues relevant to women. These studies have focused on topics such as the "glass ceiling" in the workplace, childcare and benefits, and girls and gangs. Copies of the completed research projects can be found in the Houston Public Library and its branches, and they are also distributed to elected officials. Based upon the findings of the research project, each year the Greater Houston Women's Foundation presents its Excellence awards to local businesses in recognition of their progressive policies. Recent recipients of the Excellence awards include Shell Oil Company, Mir Fox and Rodriquez, PanEnergy Corporation, and Browning-Ferris Industries.</p>
<p>Although no items relating to it are included in the collection, in 1992 the Greater Houston Women's Foundation, in conjunction with PBS station KUHT, developed and produced a television series entitled "Focus on Success." The Greater Houston Women's Foundation also participates in programs such as the national "Take Our Daughters to Work Day."

<p>The idea for a Hispanic women's leadership group originated in 1987, when a small group of Hispanic women in Houston planned a women's conference. The Hispanic Women's Leadership Conference Committee's March conference, held in conjunction with the YWCA, was a success. In June 1988, Hispanic Women in Leadership was formed as a separate, nonprofit, tax exempt organization. The organization has grown from the approximately twenty original members to over two hundred, the majority of whom are professional Hispanic women. Members include doctors, lawyers, accountants, educators, media representatives and other professionals who provide positive role models to women and girls.</p>
<p>Hispanic Women in Leadership's main goal is to promote leadership skills among Hispanic women in Houston. In conjunction with this goal, the organization promotes education of Hispanic women and girls, identifies successful role models, develops a network of professional women, and encourages Hispanic women to embrace and celebrate their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Hispanic Women in Leadership's major activity is their annual conference, held each spring in Houston. These conferences, which have grown over the years, have themes relevant to Hispanic women. They feature local and national educators and professional women and men who present workshops on issues such as the glass ceiling in the workplace and child care. The conferences raise money for scholarships to deserving young Hispanic women. In addition to the annual conference, Hispanic Women in Leadership also sponsors other fundraisers, such as fashion shows and garage sales.</p>

The Blossom Club's main activity each year is the annual flower show in May at the home of a member. Each show has a particular theme, such as First Ladies or International. In addition to the meetings and flower show, the Blossom Club also promotes civic responsibility. Members have donated their time and gardening talents to local hospitals and nursing homes by preparing decorated Christmas trees, cookie jars, and stamped cards. Although not included in the collection, the Blossom Club has received certificates for its cooperation during World War II with the USO, the Red Cross, the Bond Drive, and the Victory Vegetable Gardens.</p>

<p>Throughout 1980, the various Houston area chapters of the American Business Women's Association gathered at quarterly "Community Meetings" in order to "exercise greater impact" through coordinated organization. In March 1981 these meetings opened to other Houston area women's groups. The overwhelming response of women throughout the city suggested a need to create an "umbrella" organization. From this effort sprang the Federation of Houston Professional Women (FHPW), established in September 1981, and chartered by the state of Texas in 1982. The FHPW would "help professional women serve as a resource to each other and to the community by providing educational, networking, and support group activities to its members, focus on empowering individuals to achieve their goals by addressing general concerns of women in civic, community, personal, and professional pursuits, and unite individuals of our member organizations to promote a place of influence and power." Together, the various groups involved in the Federation would attempt to educate women about the political process to foster activism that would create a more favorable environment for business women in Houston. (General FHPW information is found in Box 1, Folder 7).</p>
<p>As of 1994, the FHPW Foundation, Advisory Board, Executive Board, Board of Directors, several committees, and the voting delegates of the member organizations composed this "organization of organizations." Various prominent personalities from the Houston area sat on the Advisory Board. The Board of Directors included the Executive Board and the Directors of the various committees; the number and names of the committees have varied over the years. Until 1993, the FHPW published its news in the Federation Exchange. After 1993, the newsletter became known as the Federation Focus. A bulk mailing, the Delegate Digest, informed delegates of upcoming activities. Delegates kept their organizations informed about FHPW activities, and had voting privileges in Federation decisions.</p>
<p>Initially, the Federation planned four major activities: quarterly general meetings, a spring event, an annual awards banquet, and various workshops throughout the year. As the organization grew, the executive body and number of meetings multiplied. The FHPW continued to hold quarterly meetings open to all women involved in the Federation, as well as annual Delegate Updates to inform new voting delegates about their responsibilities and the FHPW's activities. The Executive Board and Board of Directors met monthly, as did several committees. The Awards Banquets in the autumn of each year continue to honor prominent and active women in Houston's business community. The Federation continues its educational outreach not only through workshops, but also through community service and the sponsorship of conferences promoting women in business and politics.</p>
<p>The FHPW's Educational Foundation was planned in 1993 with a mission to award scholarships and gifts to aid and advance the education and knowledge of women in the community. FHPWEF received tax-exempt status 501(c)3 in 1994 and as a charitable foundation is able to receive funds from contributions by individuals or member organizations, gifts, and special fundraisers. The Educational Foundation's Governing Board includes the FHPW's current president and president-elect. Five additional members are nominated by a committee consisting of the Educational Foundation's current president and the FHPW's current president and immediate past president. The Educational Foundation's voting body is the Governing Board and the FHPW Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The surge of woman-centered activity that came in the wake of the 1977 National Women’s Conference inspired women in Houston’s artistic community to bind together and form their own chapter of the Women’s Caucus for Art. The National Women’s Caucus for Art had grown out of a discussion on gender at an art conference in San Francisco, California in 1972. The national organization’s stated purpose was “to win parity in the valuation of works by women; to create new opportunities for women to document, produce and exhibit works, and to assemble for the exchange of ideas, experience and constructive criticism.” On January 10, 1978, the Houston Women’s Caucus for Art expanded that mission to Houston and held its first organizational meeting. In 1980, the state of Texas recognized the group as a non-profit organization.</p>
<p>Meetings were held monthly, and membership quickly expanded. Members elected a board of directors, or executive board. The positions in this board have varied over the years, but consisted of a president, program coordinator, secretary, treasurer, exhibition coordinator, publicity coordinator, membership coordinator, newsletter editor, and special events coordinator in 1997. The board makes all of the major decisions for the organization; however, officers welcome input from a community advisory board and all members.</p>
<p>While the Caucus first met in the household of one of its members, the organization soon realized the need for a larger meeting space. Preferably, this space should have a gallery in which members could hold exhibitions. To obtain this, the Caucus joined other Montrose area organizations in the Neartown Association. This neighborhood community group helped to preserve and restore an old Montrose fire station at 1413 Westheimer, which became the meeting and exhibition hall for all groups. By 1983, the Caucus proved to be the most frequent user of the facility, and signed a long-term lease. In 1998, Harris County purchased the Firehouse and the Caucus continued to sublet its space as a gallery for experimental, up and coming, and member artists until 1999. During 1999, the county decided to use the entire building as office space, and so the Caucus relocated to 3015 Richmond, Suite 270, in the Upper Kirby Building. The Caucus has an office and a large meeting room available, but presently does not have a space to use as a gallery.</p>
<p>The Caucus has remained true to its purposes in over three decades of its existence. The group sponsors local artists through individual, group, and member shows. The organization has also helped to bring many artists of national renown and controversy to Houston, such as Matuschka, Judy Chicago, and Karen Finley. Not only has the Caucus shown a commitment to artistic expression, but it has also shown a commitment to feminist activism. Exhibitions have included artwork by survivors of domestic violence and art promoting awareness of breast cancer. Furthermore, the very existence of the HWCA has allowed many women an exhibition space that would otherwise be denied to them due to gender and racial discrimination in the art world.</p>

<p>The Women in Visual and Literary Arts (WIVLA) attempts to combine the talent of visual artists and writers in order to stimulate the creative process and provide a forum for female artistic endeavors through shows and networking. The organization began in 1993, the brainchild of "a writer, an artist, an art consultant and a gallery owner." Within a year, membership flourished quickly. The organization holds monthly meetings that include a featured speaker, and also holds exhibits and readings where members may present their latest work. In the future, WIVLA hopes to provide "studios, writing suites, workshop space, gallery, gift shop and library" in order to facilitate the flowering of artistic activity among the women of Houston.</p>

<p>Brigid's Place, the women's center at Christ Church Cathedral, a place of prayer, meditation, research, and mutual support, is dedicated to the spiritual and personal development of women. Brigid's Place was established in 1996 by Christ Church Cathedral's Women's Assembly when the Assembly recognized that it needed to expand both its resources and its space. The Women's Assembly itself was formed in 1993 as a network for progressive women of Christ Church Cathedral.</p>
<p>Originally, the Assembly envisioned Brigid's Place as a separate project, but the Assembly and Brigid's Place soon became closely identified with one another. Brigid's Place assists women in finding mentors, in forming support networks through Small Groups, and in searching for answers to questions about female spirituality, gender roles, theology, and other issues facing religious women in the modern world. Brigid's Place participants join Small Groups, which focus on specific issues of particular importance to women at different stages in life</p>
<p>Brigid's Place is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization with a board of directors; the Rotating Circle, composed of members from smaller communities who serve limited terms, is the advisory board of Brigid's Place. Brigid's Place also publishes an annual newsletter and brochures for their programs.</p>

<p>The Women's Fund for Health Education and Resiliency was founded in February 1979 by
Jacqueline and Wayne Goettsche with a seed endowment as the Women's Fund for Health
Education and Research (HER). Concerned that women's health issues lacked appropriate
funding and that research findings using only male subjects was applied indiscriminately to
women, the Goettsches established the Women's Fund to support research on women's health
issues and to disseminate women's health information through educational programs. The
Goettsches organized a fundraising initiation barbeque in May 1979 that drew nearly 100
attendees from Houston's social and medical elite. With this event, the Women's Fund
commemorated the signing of the Bylaws and officially launched the new organization.</p>
<p> As a non-profit foundation, the Women's Fund for HER has been dedicated to understanding,
improving, and promoting women's health by providing support for research and educational
programs. Fundraising through membership solicitation, special events, and corporate support
is a primary goal of the Women's Fund. In 1979, the Women's Fund began with about 200
charter members; by 2001 membership had increased to 605, 203 of which are lifetime members.
Membership categories include individual annual members, lifetime members, medical members,
and corporate members.</p>
<p> The Women's Fund for HER hosts a variety of events each year; central among them is the
Annual Benefit Luncheon held each fall. In 1983 the Women's Fund held its First Annual
Benefit Luncheon with Erma Bombeck as the guest speaker. Featured speakers have included
David Eisenhower, John Bradshaw, Suzanne Somers, and Liz Carpenter. Since 1991, the Women's
Fund has presented the John P. McGovern Fall Seminar, which offers specialized information
on topics such as allergies, chemical dependency, depression, and over-the-counter
medicines. An Annual Spring Seminar provides another venue for similar kinds of information.
The Program Committee organizes smaller and more frequent lecture/seminars throughout the
year, often in collaboration with volunteers representing local medical institutions, and so
many of the seminars are free. Membership coffees, held three to four times a year in a
member's home, feature presentations on women's health concerns such as heart disease or
alcoholism. Both Michael DeBakey and Ann Richards have spoken to attendees at these
membership coffees.</p>
<p> As part of their educational outreach, the Women's Fund publishes A Primer on Women's
Health, which is circulated to groups, agencies, and corporations without charge. To reach a
wider audience, the Women's Fund translated the Primer into Spanish. Local philanthropic
foundations and individuals support publication of the Primer. Another publication, Health
Notes, helps women track their medical histories and maintain records of tests and
diagnoses.</p>
<p> In addition to special events and the Primer, the Women's Fund has supported basic and
clinical research related to women's health concerns. Between 1980 and 1992 the Women's Fund
awarded 73 grants for medical research and services geared toward women's needs.</p>

<p>Church Women United is a national ecumenical organization dedicated to bringing together religious women in order to celebrate and expand their faith, to promote peace and prayer, and to join together as a community to encourage spirituality and advocacy. Church Women United is divided into four levels: national, regional, state, and local. At the national level, the United Council of Church Women was formed in December 1941, when delegates from three inter-denominational women's groups approved a constitution and established an office in New York City. This Council represented women from seventy Protestant denominations. In 1950, the Council became one of twelve interdenominational agencies that comprised the National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States. In 1966, the organization's name was changed to Church Women United in order to encourage the participation of non-Protestant women, such as Roman and Orthodox Catholics.</p>
<p>In 1911, a group of Houston women of different denominations formed the Houston City Federation of Missionary Society; by 1946 the organization was known as the Houston Council of Church Women. The name was changed to Church Women United of Houston in 1966, and to Church Women United in Houston in 1968. At the local level, groups are organized into committees that administer programs and projects; in Houston, the women hold meetings at the many Houston area churches that are members of CWU. Church Women United in Houston participates in worship services at area churches and works with other Houston organizations to promote awareness of a number of issues, including the elderly, women and children, and the environment. Members of the Houston group also participate in the three annual Church Women United celebrations: World Day of Prayer, May Fellowship Day, and World Community Day.</p>

<p>The Women's Studies Program at the University of Houston is an interdisciplinary
academic field that analyzes and investigates women's roles, needs, history, and
contributions to humankind. Women's Studies at UH was established in the summer of 1991.
The Program offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate minor and an interdisciplinary
graduate certificate -- both consist of courses drawn from the humanities, fine arts,
law, and social and health sciences. The mission of the Friends of Women's Studies is to
support the University of Houston Women's Studies Program through campus and community
activities, as well as financial and volunteer efforts. The central focus of the Friends
is the Women's Archive and Research Collections (WARC), a unique collection of documents
from active and historical Houston area women's organizations, individuals associated
with these organizations and local women's oral histories.</p>
<p>WARC, housed at the University of Houston Libraries' Special Collections Department,
opened in October 1996. The WARC collecting area focuses on the roles of women and
women's organizations that have made some impact on the lives of Houston area women. As
it grows, WARC is expanding to statewide scope.</p>
<p>Collections in WARC include those focused on cultural development and social action,
philanthropic, civic and professional associations, women's health issues, violence
against women, minority women's groups, and a professional athletic franchise. WARC also
includes the papers of several prominent Houston women. The collections document the
ways that women have united to achieve their goals, the range of their concerns, and the
impact they have had on the world around them. WARC also creates and preserves Texas
women's oral histories through the Living Archives series, which features interviews
with notable Houston women. The research collections support significant scholarly work
on women's issues by students, faculty, and visiting professors and promotes awareness
of women's contributions to culture through speakers, conferences, and other
activities.</p>
<p>The Friends of Women's Studies provides financial assistance to graduate and
undergraduate students and faculty and provides funds for graduate assistantships to
continue processing and expanding collections donated to WARC. Scholarships are
available to both undergraduates and graduates; UH faculty members may apply for
doctoral fellowships and summer fellowships. An annual travel grant is awarded to a
Women's Studies faculty member presenting research at conferences and a Student Essay
prize for essays on a women's studies topic. Long range plans include a conference on
Houston women's history and the endowment of a chair.</p>

<p>Wilmer Waldo was born in Houston in 1876 to J.P. and Mary Virginia Gentry Waldo. Educated in Civil Engineering at Princeton University, Waldo was instrumental in the planning and execution of myriad public and private infrastructure projects in the city of Houston and beyond. While perhaps most known for his role in planning the layout of the campus of Rice University, Waldo also contributed to railway construction projects in service of the Suderman-Dolson and Fred A. Jones Companies and completed numerous projects in the Houston community and across Southeast Texas as an individual contractor. In 1902, Waldo led the effort to move the now-famous Waldo Mansion from the original location at the corner of Rusk and Caroline to its present location on Westmoreland Avenue. Waldo resided in the mansion with his siblings until his death in 1962.</p>
