      <abstract label="Abstract:" encodinganalog="520$a">Donald Barthelme was
		  an experimental short story writer and novelist who contributed frequently to
		  <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph> magazine in the 1960s, 1970s, and
		  1980s. He remains best known for his classic collection <emph render="italic">Sixty Stories</emph>. Barthelme served as director of the
		  Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston for many years. The

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Donald Barthelme was born in Philadelphia in 1931 to parents Donald
		  Barthelme Sr. and Helen (Bechtold) Barthelme. In 1932, the family moved to
		  Houston, where Donald Barthelme Sr. developed an architectural practice and
		  taught at the University of Houston and Rice University. Barthelme had four
		  younger siblings: Joan (born 1932), Peter (born 1938), Frederick (born 1943),
		  and Steven (born 1947).</p>
      <p>Barthelme enrolled at the University of Houston in 1949, where he took
		  courses in journalism, literature, creative writing, and philosophy. He became
		  a reporter, critic, and editor for the school's newspaper,
		  <emph render="italic">The Cougar</emph>. </p>
      <p>In July 1951, he left the University of Houston for a job at the
		  <emph render="italic">Houston Post</emph>, where he reviewed movies, plays, and
		  concerts. From July 1953 to December 1954 he served in Korea, writing for the
		  2nd Infantry Division's official publication. Following his return to Houston,
		  Barthelme took a public relations job at the University of Houston. There he
		  founded and became editor of the interdisciplinary journal
		  <emph render="italic">Forum</emph>. In 1961, Barthelme became acting director
		  of the Contemporary Arts Museum. The following year he moved to New York City
		  to edit a new journal of art and literature called <emph render="italic">Location</emph>. </p>
      <p>In 1961, Barthelme's short story "The Darling Duckling at School"
		  (later renamed "Me and Mrs. Mandible") appeared in the journal
		  <emph render="italic">Contact</emph>. Inspired by Samuel Beckett, Barthelme
		  rejected the constraints of traditional plot, setting, and character
		  development in favor of verbal collages full of absurdity and wit. In 1963,
		  Barthelme published the story "L'lapse" in the <emph render="italic">New
		  Yorker</emph>, quickly becoming a regular contributor. </p>
      <p>In 1964 Barthelme released his first collection of stories,
		  <emph render="italic">Come Back, Dr. Caligari</emph>. From that point on, he
		  stayed at the forefront of American literature for three decades. Barthelme
		  published nine more story collections, and 129 stories and "casuals" in the
		  <emph render="italic">New Yorker</emph>. Always innovative, he created "collage
		  stories" that combined images and text, and "dialogue stories" in which two
		  disembodied voices alternate in conversation. He also published three novels -
		  <emph render="italic">Snow White</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Dead
		  Father</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Paradise</emph>. In 1972 he released a
		  children's book, <emph render="italic">The Slightly Irregular Fire
		  Engine</emph>, winning the National Book Award for Children's Literature. </p>
      <p>Barthelme remains best known for Sixty Stories, a 1981 anthology of
		  his finest work from the sixties and seventies. Sixty Stories was nnominated
		  for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction,
		  and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 1982.</p>
      <p>Donald Barthelme taught creative writing at City College in New York
		  from 1974-75. In 1979, he was invited to teach in the Creative Writing Program
		  at the University of Houston. Initially he taught in Houston one semester a
		  year, while continuing to live in New York City. In 1983, Barthelme moved to
		  Houston to become a full-time professor. A beloved teacher, he eventually
		  became director of the Creative Writing Progam, a position he held until his
		  death.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains typescript drafts, galley proofs, and page
		  proofs of Donald Barthelme's novels, collected works, short stories, and other
		  writings, plus collages and collage stories created by Barthelme. One of the
		  richest aspects of the collection is the large set of letters and cards from
		  Barthelme's writing friends and colleagues. The collection also includes about
		  a dozen photographs of Barthelme. In addition, material related to Barthelme's
		  teaching career is incorporated, notably student works that Barthelme received
		  during his years in the Creative Writing Program at the University of
		  Houston.</p>

      <p>This collection was acquired in 2002 from Marion Barthelme.</p>
      <p>A few miscellaneous items already owned by the University of Houston
		  Libraries were added to the collection. Typescripts of the short stories "City
		  Life," "City Life II," and "A Dream" were purchased from Joseph the Provider
		  Books in the 1980s. Four typescripts of Donald Barthelme's
		  <emph render="italic">Paris Review</emph> interview, one proof sheet of the
		  interview introduction, and letters from George Plimpton and J.D. O'Hara were
		  also purchased from Joseph the Provider Books in the 1980s. A speech on writers
		  delivered at University of Houston in 1974 was purchased from Detering Book
		  Gallery in 1979. The non-fiction piece "Woman is an imaginary being" was
		  transferred from the Donald Barthelme <emph render="italic">Forum</emph>
		  Collection. The <emph render="italic">Houston Chronicle</emph> article "Donald
		  Barthelme: Serious Writer at Play" was donated by Michael Berryhill in
		  2005.</p>

				The material related to a single work may include typescripts, page layouts,
				galley proofs, page proofs, dust jackets, and other formats. Materials are
				arranged in order of their production, beginning with typescripts and ending
				with dust jackets. Some of the short story collections include bound volumes
				which collected typescripts, photocopied drafts, and the printed pages of
				previously published stories together. Prior to 1975, Barthelme rarely kept
				early drafts of his work.</p>

          <head>Short Stories, [1959]-1987</head>
          <p>This series includes short stories in manuscript or typescript
				form. Barthelme rarely kept early drafts of his work, so many of these stories
				are in a finished or nearly finished stage and show minimal editing by the
				author. Some galley proofs, tear sheets, and paste ups are also included.</p>

          <p>An interview with Barthelme was published in the Summer 1981 issue
				of the <emph render="italic">Paris Review</emph> as part of its well known
				series of interviews with writers. J.D. O'Hara taped the initial conversation
				with Barthelme, transcribed the tape, and sent the transcript to Barthelme.
				Barthelme heavily reworked the transcript to make an entirely different draft.
				This series contains various drafts of the interview and some related
				correspondence. See also the J.D. O'Hara folder in the Correspondence
				series.</p>
