                              <p>Josephine Harris Stewart was a prominent social worker and activist who is recognized as a pioneer in the field of social group work. She was born June 9, 1924 in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is of Hungarian Jewish descent. She received a bachelor of science degree in education in 1945 from the University of Cincinnati Teachers College. Following graduation, she enlisted in the Women&#039;s Army Corps and was assigned as an occupational counselor in Des Moines, Iowa, until her discharge in September 1946. She graduated in 1949 from the University of Pittsburgh with a master of social work degree, with a specialization in social group work. In 1960 she earned an advanced curriculum certificate in community organization from the University of Pennsylvania, and completed all the requirements, except for the dissertation, for a doctoral degree in social work.</p>
                                       <p>Stewart&#039;s early career encompassed a number of jobs in the social work field, including teaching and social work practice at public and private social welfare agencies and hospitals. She was a social group worker at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, where she was the first social group worker in Kansas; the LaRue D. Carter Memorial Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, where she served as psychiatric social work supervisor; and the Rollman Institute of Psychiatry in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she was a psychiatric social work educational supervisor. She was also a family counselor at Jewish Family Service of Philadelphia. Her teaching positions include serving as field work instructor and lecturer in social group work at Indiana University and lecturer in social welfare and field work consultant at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1964 to 1975, Stewart was an assistant professor and lecturer at West Virginia University, where she taught a number of social work courses. In 1975 she moved to Houston, where she was the first social worker hired at Methodist Hospital. She retired from Methodist shortly before her death from lung cancer on September 26, 1990.</p>
                                       <p>Stewart was an activist for gay/lesbian and women&#039;s issues, particularly during her years in Houston. She was a charter member of the National Association of Social Workers and served the organization as national chairman on gay/lesbian issues during the 1980s. Stewart was also a co-founder of the Houston Area Women&#039;s Center.</p>

                                 <p>The collection arrived in little discernable order and the processor in consultation with the archivist has imposed an order. The collection is arranged primarily in chronological order and is divided into five series. Series two, three and four are based upon chronological and geographical divisions in Stewart&#039;s life: Pre-West Virginia University, West Virginia University, and Houston. Series One, Personal, contains information not easily assigned to the other series, and which spans most of Stewart&#039;s life. Series five, Ephemera, contains items such as tote bags, posters, newspaper clippings and plaques.</p>

                  <p>This series contains thirty-six folders dating from the 1940s to 1964. The items concern Stewart&#039;s life prior to her employment at West Virginia University in 1964. The series is divided into four sub-series, which are arranged chronologically: Correspondence, Miscellaneous, Social Work Practice, and Booklets. The sub-series Social Work Practice contains papers relating to Stewart&#039;s work at various public and private social welfare agencies and hospitals. Notes relating to therapy sessions with particular groups comprise the majority of the material in this sub-series. The sub-series Booklets contains assorted booklets, including reports, studies, journals, and brochures about hospitals and clinics. Some of the booklets do not pertain to social work, but have been included in this sub-series because of their date. The sub-series Miscellaneous contains information about Stewart&#039;s military service, and a copy of her master&#039;s thesis.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>This series contains sixty-one folders dating from 1964 to 1975, and it includes materials concerning Stewart&#039;s employment at West Virginia University. This series is divided into seven sub-series: Correspondence, Administrative, Classes, Fieldwork, Academic Papers, Booklets, and Social Work Practice. All of the sub-series have been arranged chronologically, except Classes and Academic Papers. The sub-series Classes is arranged by the course number of the class rather than chronologically, which is how Stewart had this material organized. Some of the folders contain information on a particular class from different semesters, years, or institutions. This material was kept together because Stewart organized it that way; she appears to have used the same teaching materials year after year. The Academic Papers sub-series contains papers written by professors and students and is arranged alphabetically by author.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>This series contains 149 folders dating from 1975 to 1990, and it concerns Stewart&#039;s time in Houston. The series is divided into nine sub-series, which are arranged chronologically: National Association of Social Workers; National Association of Social Workers, Chapters; Council on Social Work Education; Women&#039;s Movement; United States Commission on Civil Rights; Social Work Practice; Gay/Lesbian Issues; Booklets; and Miscellaneous/Personal. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is an organization with which Stewart was heavily involved in the 1980s. Although some of the NASW material dates from before Stewart moved to Houston, it has been placed in this series in order to keep it with other NASW items. The same applies to the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). At times, NASW and CSWE mailed out envelopes of information; the dates of material in each envelope varied and often included some things with dates up to one year old. The majority of these materials were still in their original envelopes from NASW and CSWE when Stewart&#039;s papers entered the archives. Despite the variety of dates, the material from each envelope has been kept together as originally compiled and sent. The date on each folder refers to the postmarked date on the envelope. Most of these mailings concern gay/lesbian issues. Other sub-series contain material on the women&#039;s movement, in which Stewart was involved, as well as items concerning social work practice.</p>
