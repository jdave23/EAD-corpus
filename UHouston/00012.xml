      <p>Historical Note</p>
      <p>The University of Houston was founded in 1927 as the Houston Junior College, operated by the Houston Independent School District. In 1934, the school was renamed the University of Houston and became a four-year college. In 1940, the first graduate degrees were awarded in the field of education. In 1945, the University became a separate, private entity with its own Board of Regents, chaired by Hugh Roy Cullen. Throughout this period E. E. Oberholtzer was the president of the University.</p>
      <p>In 1950, W. W. Kemmerer became acting president of the University. Kemmerer served as president from 1952 to 1953, when C. F. McElhinney became acting president. General A. D. Bruce, who served as president until 1956 when he became chancellor of the University, followed him in 1954. Clanton W. Williams became president in 1956. In 1961, Philip G. Hoffman became president of the University of Houston. He held this position until 1977, when he became president of the UH System.</p>
      <p>Biographical Notes</p>
      <p>Edison E. Oberholtzer</p>
      <p>From 1924-1927 Oberholtzer served as Superintendent of the Houston Independent School District. With the formation of the Houston Junior College in 1927 he was named president. He remained president through the change from a two-year to a four-year institution in 1934 and continued until shortly before his death in 1950.</p>
      <p>Walter W. Kemmerer</p>
      <p>In 1929 Oberholtzer offered Kemmerer the position of Director of Curriculum and Research with Houston Independent School District. He remained in this position until June 1934, when he was appointed vice-president of the University of Houston. In October 1943, the position of "vice-president" was eliminated and Kemmerer's title was changed to Comptroller and Director of Curriculum. In spring 1944 Oberholtzer created the office and title "Assistant to the President" for Kemmerer. With Oberholtzer's retirement in 1950 Kemmerer became first acting president on June 1, 1950 and president on April 15, 1952. He was asked to resign on April 27, 1953.</p>
      <p>Charles Flemming McElhinney</p>
      <p>Charles Flemming McElhinney (commonly known as C. F. McElhinney or "Mr. Mac") moved to Houston in 1934, taking the position of Assistant Director of Curriculum and Research for the Houston Independent School District from 1934-1939. He became Director of Research from 1939-1945, and business manager for the University of Houston which, until 1945, was operated by the Houston Independent School District. During this time he also served as a staff assistant to E. E. Oberholtzer. From 1945 until his retirement in 1973, McElhinney served as the business manager of the university. He also served as interim president of the University from 1953-1954, a position he agreed to serve in to allow time for the Board of Regents to select a new President.</p>
      <p>Andrew Davis Bruce</p>
      <p>General Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce was the third president and the first chancellor of the University of Houston. Bruce became president of the university on September 1, 1954 and chancellor in December 1956. He retired from the university after the 1960-61 academic year. In 1957 Bruce organized a Board of Governors, composed of the regents of the university and prominent Houstonians. In November 1959 the governing board sought state support for the University, which had grown rapidly in the preceding years. Bruce was one of the first to advocate tax support for the University of Houston.</p>
      <p>Clanton W. Williams</p>
      <p>Clanton Ware Williams served as the fourth president of the University of Houston from 1956-1960. Williams joined the University of Houston as Vice-President for Academic Affairs in January 1955. He was named president of the University at the December 10, 1956 meeting of the Board of Regents. At this same meeting, A.D. Bruce was named chancellor and chief executive officer of the university. With this new reporting structure, the president was entrusted with the internal affairs while the chancellor was charged with both external relationships and overall responsibility. From August 11, 1960 to September 1, 1961, Williams retained the title of president, but was on a leave of absence.</p>
      <p>Philip G. Hoffman</p>
      <p>In 1957 Philip Guthrie Hoffman came to the University of Houston as Vice President and Dean of Faculties. He was appointed as the fifth president of the University of Houston in September 1961, and was officially inaugurated on April 27, 1962. Hoffman served as president until 1977, when he became president of the University of Houston System. He remained in this position until his retirement in 1979. Some of the advances made during Hoffman's tenure include reorganization and augmentation of administrative staff, including shifts within the ranks of the academic deans; conducting an institution-wide self-study; completing a new master plan for campus development; and taking first steps toward the formation of a University of Houston System.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>In 1985 the President's Office transferred custody of most of its historic files to the Archives. At the time of transfer, the collection was referred to as the <emph render="italic">University of Houston Presidential Papers</emph> prior to 1979 and it consisted of forty-two boxes divided into three series. The first series of twenty-one boxes was processed in 1997 as the <emph render="italic">Presidents' Records 1927-1979</emph>. The other two series from this transfer were initially processed in 2001 as the <emph render="italic">Philip G. Hoffman Papers.</emph></p>
      <p>It was decided in 2002 that, while the processing of the <emph render="italic">University of Houston Presidential Papers</emph> Prior to 1979 as two separate collections was acceptable; it was not ideal for research purposes. To improve the accessibility to the collections it was determined that the <emph render="italic">Philip G. Hoffman Papers</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Presidents' Records</emph> should be combined back into one collection, the <emph render="italic">President's Office Records</emph>. As the bulk of the material within President's Records seemed to correspond most directly to the first series (Subject Files) within the Hoffman Papers that is where the majority of re-filing and integration was needed.</p>
      <p>The President's Office Records include correspondence, memoranda, publications, clippings, invitations, and related material dating from 1927-1981 that were received or created by the President of the University of Houston. The bulk of the material dates from the mid-1960s to 1978 and was generated during the presidency of Philip G. Hoffman.</p>
      <p>The files are rich in materials documenting the history of state support for the University, which was received in 1963, as well as materials showing the rise of student discontent on campus in the late 1960s and early 1970s. See particular student groups such as AABL (Afro-Americans for Black Liberation) for information about the group and its activities and the administration's reaction and response to their demands. This collection also documents the early history of the University of Houston System, with its campuses in Clear Lake, Victoria, and at UH-Downtown. There is also a substantial amount of material relating to the investment scandal of the late 1970s and to the self-study that was undertaken in the mid 1970s.</p>
      <p>Photographs in the collection have been transferred to the UH Historical Photographs Collection in the University Archives. A separation sheet notes their original location in the collection and provides a brief description of the items. All student transcripts in the collection have been removed and destroyed, following the Texas Open Records Act. For similar reasons, all materials relating to search committees and personnel decisions have been removed from the collection and are closed to the public.</p>
      <p>The collection is arranged into series and sub-series based primarily on how it was originally received in 1985. The nine series are Subject Files, Mission Self-Study, Coordinating Board, President's Cabinet, Investment Investigation, Council of Presidents, Speeches/Oral Interview/Biographical Information, Business/Personal, and President's Christmas Cards. For preservation and access reasons the collection has been re-boxed and re-foldered. New folder titles conform, as closely as possible, to original folder titles, except when the original was obviously incomplete, incorrect, or confusing. Original folder and item order has been maintained whenever possible. Exceptions were made when folders were obviously misfiled or when no order was apparent.</p>
      <p>An index to the collection is available. Please contact Special Collections for more information.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>This series contains twenty-seven folders that relate to the University's Mission Self-Study. President Hoffman and Vice President Emmett Fields announced the Mission Self-Study at the General Faculty Meeting on January 11, 1974. The purpose of the study was to fulfill a requirement by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools that each member institution conduct a self-study at least once each decade for re-accreditation purposes. The materials date from 1974 to 1976 and include extensive data used in the study and the results from the study itself. The original folder order was chronological and has been maintained except where folders were obviously misfiled.</p>

        <scopecontent>
          <p>This series containing 126 folders covers almost every aspect of the largest scandal in the history of the University of Houston, which involved short-term investments made on behalf of the university resulting in the loss of several millions of dollars. The materials date from 1970 to 1981, with the majority dating between the years of 1976 and 1978. The files in this series are presumed to be the President's office files and they consist of a variety of materials including reports, correspondence, financial documents, affidavits, and news clippings. This series has been divided into two sub-series based on how it arrived at the Archives. The two sub-series are General and Vice President Singleton's In-house Investigation. The materials within the sub-series were in no order so the Archivist has imposed one. All oversized materials have been boxed separately and are found at the end of this series.</p>

            <p>President Hoffman and the Board of Regents charged Vice President Roger Singleton to analyze the activities that had led to the Board of Regent's investigation into the university's investment fund activity.

The materials in this series include correspondence amongst the parties involved, copies of ledger entries and financial transactions, and other relevant materials. This sub-series has been divided into five sub-sub-series: Roger Singleton; Douglas G. MacLean; Correspondence; Financial, Banking, and Legal Materials; and General Research and Reference Materials.</p>

              <p>When Charles F. McElhinney retired in 1973, Douglas G. MacLean replaced him as the University's top financial officer. During MacLean's tenure, Sam Harwell, J. Treadway Brogdon, and Harold W. Scott all answered to him. After the improper activity was uncovered, MacLean was placed on a six-month administrative leave with pay. When the UH regents announced their findings regarding the investigation, one of their recommendations was that MacLean not be kept on staff when his leave of absence expired. The others who had been responsible for supervising Harwell's investment program either resigned or retired. This sub-sub-series relates directly to Douglas MacLean and the folders are arranged chronologically.</p>
