      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Producer and director Cheryl Crawford was born Sept. 24, 1902 in Akron, Ohio to Louella E. (Parker) and Robert K. Crawford. Crawford died on Oct. 7, 1986 in New York City.</p>
      <p>Although involved in at least one high school dramatic production, Crawford began her formal acting career while at Smith College, when she became involved with Smith College Dramatic Association. While a student, she produced <emph render="italic">Shakuntala</emph>, a Native American drama. During the summer of 1924 Crawford was associated with the Provincetown Players of Cape Cod. In 1925 she graduated from Smith College, cum laude.</p>
      <p>Following graduation, Crawford attended a school managed by the Theatre Guild in New York City. She worked with the Theatre Guild until 1930, working first as a secretary and a third assistant manager. Later she worked as a casting director and general assistant on Theatre Guild productions.</p>
      <p>In 1930 Crawford left the Theatre Guild to form the Group Theatre, sharing the responsibilities as director of the group with Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg. During this period she directed <emph render="italic">Big Night</emph> (1933), <emph render="italic">Till the Day I Die</emph> (1935), and <emph render="italic">Weep for the Virgins</emph> (1935) as well as assisting with the direction of the first production by the Group Theatre, <emph render="italic">The House of Connelly</emph> (1931). She left the Group Theatre in 1937 to begin directing on her own.</p>
      <p>Between 1937 and her death in 1986 Crawford was involved in the production of more than 100 shows. From 1937 through 1945 Crawford worked primarily on Broadway. While working at the Maplewood Theatre in New Jersey, 1940-1942, she produced different shows on a weekly basis and worked with such stars as Tallulah Bankhead, Ingrid Bergman, Gloria Swanson in productions such as <emph render="italic">The Time of Your Life</emph> and <emph render="italic">Charley's Aunt</emph>.</p>
      <p>In 1946 Crawford formed the American Repertory Theatre with Eva Le Gallienne and Margaret Webster. In 1947 Crawford united with Robert Lewis and Elia Kazan to form the Actors Studio. Crawford served as both a member of the board of directors and as an executive producer during the Actors Studio Theatre, which ran during 1963 and 1964.</p>
      <p>Crawford was active as a producer for fifty-five years, co-producing <emph render="italic">So Long on Lonely Street</emph> in 1986. During that time she produced musicals such as <emph render="italic">Brigadoon</emph>, <emph render="italic">Porgy and Bess</emph>, <emph render="italic">Paint Your Wagon</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Celebration</emph>. Crawford also produced four Tennessee Williams plays, among them <emph render="italic">Sweet Bird of Youth</emph>, in which Paul Newman starred, and <emph render="italic">Period of Adjustment</emph>. Some of the highlights from productions during the last decades of her life include <emph render="italic">Yentl</emph>, <emph render="italic">Mother Courage and Her Children</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Do You Turn Somersaults</emph>.</p>
      <p>Crawford's awards include an honorary Doctor of Literature from Smith College, awarded in 1962, and an Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award in 1951 for Tennessee William's <emph render="italic">The Rose Tattoo</emph>. She was named Woman of the Year in 1959. In 1964 she was awarded an Achievement Medal from Brandeis University.</p>

          <p>There are 438 items in this series. The correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent. Letters received and sent have been kept together, as that is the arrangement used by Crawford. Letters date from 1936 to 1977, with the bulk of the material dated 1950 through 1961.</p>
          <p>In some cases, the only correspondence with a particular person are the carbon copies saved by Crawford. People to which carbon copies of letters sent are all that were kept are: Judy Garland, Oscar Hammerstein, Burgess Meredith, Marilyn Monroe, Shelley Winters, and Audrey Wood. Major correspondents include Mary Martin and Richard Halliday, Marc Blitzstein, Tennessee Williams, and Thornton Wilder. A complete listing of letters sent and received is available.</p>
          <p>This series does not include correspondence related to specific productions which has been filed with other materials related to that production. Additional correspondence related to a particular production is located with other records of the production. There also is some correspondence in the General series, placed with related items such as the <emph render="italic">Diary of Anne Frank</emph> lawsuit file.</p>
          <p>There is little personal correspondence, as most items relate directly to activities in the theatre.</p>

          <p>These materials date from 1923 through 1978, with the bulk of the material dated 1948 through 1978. There are 275 programs in this series.</p>
          <p>The programs have been separated into two sub-series; plays in which Crawford was involved in some fashion and plays in which she was not involved. Both sub-series are arranged alphabetically by title of the performance. Plays in which Crawford was not involved are further divided into American and British productions. The British programs include a few playbills produced in London for British productions.</p>
          <p>There are no programs in this series which date after 1951 for productions in which Crawford was involved. Those interested in programs for Crawford productions dated after 1951 should check the Playbills series.</p>

          <p>This series has been separated into two sub-series; playbills for productions in which Crawford was involved, and playbills for productions in which she was not involved. All items are arranged alphabetically by the title of the production. The bulk of the materials are dated 1973-1978. There are 123 items in this series.</p>
          <p>Playbills are commercially produced programs for theatrical productions, generally produced in larger cities with strong theatrical encalves such as New York and London. The playbills include features on various performers, articles on fashion, and other stories related to the theater and of interest to theatregoers.</p>
          <p>The playbills for non-Crawford productions have been separated American and miscellaneous productions. The collection includes 11 playbills for Crawford productions, including <emph render="italic">The Rose Tattoo</emph>, for which Crawford won a Tony Award.</p>
          <p>A complete listing of playbills is available upon request.</p>

          <p>The sheet music collection includes 128 items. The series has been arranged into two sub-series to separate the oversize items. Both sub-series are arranged alphabetically by title, with the oversize items following the standard items. The majority of the series is dated between 1920 and 1940.</p>
          <p>There is a manuscript of "Johnny's Song," written by Kurt Weill with a note dedicating the song to Crawford. The manuscript and accompanying note are housed separately from the series in an oversized box.</p>
