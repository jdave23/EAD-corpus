<p>The Dr. Patrick J. Nicholson Papers consist of eleven records center cartons, one manuscript box and two oversized boxes. The collection includes correspondence, brochures, reports and newspaper articles concerning many university-related topics and a small amount of personal material. Some folders contain a variety of materials relating to that particular folder topic. Materials in the collection date from 1933 to 1979, with the majority dating from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>The collection is divided into four series: Correspondence, University of Houston, Personal, and Oversize. The collection arrived in little discernible order and with little arrangement. An arrangement scheme has been imposed in consultation with the Archivist. For preservation reasons the collection has been re-boxed and re-foldered. New folder titles conform, as much as possible, to original folder titles. Exceptions were made when the folder title was obviously incomplete, incorrect, or confusing. Original item order has been preserved whenever possible.</p>
<p>Much of the collection concerns the University of Houston, or involves University of Houston groups, regardless whether the words "University of Houston" are part of the folder title. Topics relating to the University of Houston include the university in general, fundraising activities, history of the university, financial statements, and testimony before the Higher Education Commission, among many others. While the personal portion of the collection is relatively small, it has been maintained to provide background information and perspective to the researcher. It includes a variety of materials including Nicholson's dissertation. Additionally the collection contains an extensive range of newspaper articles relating to both UH and non-UH subjects.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series dates from 1958 through 1969, with one folder from 1976. It is the largest (fifteen boxes) and the strongest series within this collection. It consists of letters from Nicholson to a variety of people including donors, potential donors, and well-known associates of the university among others. The folders in this series cover a wide range of university related topics. Due to Nicholson's job responsibilities as Vice President of University Development, fundraising receives a strong emphasis within the correspondence series. Materials are arranged chronologically.</p>

In general the folders in each sub-series are arranged chronologically.</p>
</scopecontent>

<p>In 1985 the President's Office transferred custody of most of its historic files to the Archives. At the time of transfer, the collection was referred to as the <emph render="italic">University of Houston Presidential Papers</emph> prior to 1979 and it consisted of forty-two boxes divided into three series. The first series of twenty-one boxes was processed in 1997 as the <emph render="italic">Presidents' Records 1927-1979</emph>. The other two series from this transfer were initially processed in 2001 as the <emph render="italic">Philip G. Hoffman Papers.</emph></p>
<p>It was decided in 2002 that, while the processing of the <emph render="italic">University of Houston Presidential Papers</emph> Prior to 1979 as two separate collections was acceptable; it was not ideal for research purposes. To improve the accessibility to the collections it was determined that the <emph render="italic">Philip G. Hoffman Papers</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Presidents' Records</emph> should be combined back into one collection, the <emph render="italic">President's Office Records</emph>. As the bulk of the material within President's Records seemed to correspond most directly to the first series (Subject Files) within the Hoffman Papers that is where the majority of re-filing and integration was needed.</p>
<p>The President's Office Records include correspondence, memoranda, publications, clippings, invitations, and related material dating from 1927-1981 that were received or created by the President of the University of Houston. The bulk of the material dates from the mid-1960s to 1978 and was generated during the presidency of Philip G. Hoffman.</p>
<p>The files are rich in materials documenting the history of state support for the University, which was received in 1963, as well as materials showing the rise of student discontent on campus in the late 1960s and early 1970s. See particular student groups such as AABL (Afro-Americans for Black Liberation) for information about the group and its activities and the administration's reaction and response to their demands. This collection also documents the early history of the University of Houston System, with its campuses in Clear Lake, Victoria, and at UH-Downtown. There is also a substantial amount of material relating to the investment scandal of the late 1970s and to the self-study that was undertaken in the mid 1970s.</p>
<p>Photographs in the collection have been transferred to the UH Historical Photographs Collection in the University Archives. A separation sheet notes their original location in the collection and provides a brief description of the items. All student transcripts in the collection have been removed and destroyed, following the Texas Open Records Act. For similar reasons, all materials relating to search committees and personnel decisions have been removed from the collection and are closed to the public.</p>
<p>The collection is arranged into series and sub-series based primarily on how it was originally received in 1985. The nine series are Subject Files, Mission Self-Study, Coordinating Board, President's Cabinet, Investment Investigation, Council of Presidents, Speeches/Oral Interview/Biographical Information, Business/Personal, and President's Christmas Cards. For preservation and access reasons the collection has been re-boxed and re-foldered. New folder titles conform, as closely as possible, to original folder titles, except when the original was obviously incomplete, incorrect, or confusing. Original folder and item order has been maintained whenever possible. Exceptions were made when folders were obviously misfiled or when no order was apparent.</p>
<p>An index to the collection is available. Please contact Special Collections for more information.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series is the largest in the collection containing forty-nine boxes of general working files that are presumed to be the President's office files. Materials date from 1927 to 1980, with the bulk of the materials dating between 1960 and 1978. The files cover almost every aspect of the University including student groups, commencement, committees, accreditation, the different colleges, national education related organizations and associations, and the other campuses within the University of Houston System. Files in this series have been arranged alphabetically and then chronologically when necessary.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains twenty-seven folders that relate to the University's Mission Self-Study. President Hoffman and Vice President Emmett Fields announced the Mission Self-Study at the General Faculty Meeting on January 11, 1974. The purpose of the study was to fulfill a requirement by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools that each member institution conduct a self-study at least once each decade for re-accreditation purposes. The materials date from 1974 to 1976 and include extensive data used in the study and the results from the study itself. The original folder order was chronological and has been maintained except where folders were obviously misfiled.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains eighty-five folders that relate to the Higher Education Coordinating Board. The Higher Education Coordinating Act of 1965 provided that the Coordinating Board shall "review periodically all degree and certificate programs offered by institutions of higher education…." (Section 10, Paragraph [5]). The materials in this series are extensive in nature consisting primarily of meeting minutes and date from 1968-1976. The series is divided into two sub-series, Active and Inactive, based on the order received.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains twenty-five folders that relate to meetings of the President's Cabinet. These materials are extensive in nature and include agendas and minutes for most of the President's Cabinet meetings from September 1977 through October 1979.

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series containing 126 folders covers almost every aspect of the largest scandal in the history of the University of Houston, which involved short-term investments made on behalf of the university resulting in the loss of several millions of dollars. The materials date from 1970 to 1981, with the majority dating between the years of 1976 and 1978. The files in this series are presumed to be the President's office files and they consist of a variety of materials including reports, correspondence, financial documents, affidavits, and news clippings. This series has been divided into two sub-series based on how it arrived at the Archives. The two sub-series are General and Vice President Singleton's In-house Investigation. The materials within the sub-series were in no order so the Archivist has imposed one. All oversized materials have been boxed separately and are found at the end of this series.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The items in this sub-series date from 1975-1981 and the folders have been arranged in roughly chronological order.</p>

<p>President Hoffman and the Board of Regents charged Vice President Roger Singleton to analyze the activities that had led to the Board of Regent's investigation into the university's investment fund activity. This sub-series consists primarily of working files and correspondence that he used during his investigation. The materials in this series include correspondence amongst the parties involved, copies of ledger entries and financial transactions, and other relevant materials.

MacLean; Correspondence; Financial, Banking, and Legal Materials; and General Research and Reference Materials.</p>
</scopecontent>

Later he served as Vice President and Dean of Faculties on an interim basis and as Executive Vice President of the University of Houston System. This sub-sub-series relates directly to Singleton himself and is arranged chronologically.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>When Charles F. McElhinney retired in 1973, Douglas G. MacLean replaced him as the University's top financial officer. During MacLean's tenure, Sam Harwell, J. Treadway Brogdon, and Harold W. Scott all answered to him. After the improper activity was uncovered, MacLean was placed on a six-month administrative leave with pay. When the UH regents announced their findings regarding the investigation, one of their recommendations was that MacLean not be kept on staff when his leave of absence expired. The others who had been responsible for supervising Harwell's investment program either resigned or retired. This sub-sub-series relates directly to Douglas MacLean and the folders are arranged chronologically.</p>
</scopecontent>

<p>The William A. Bernrieder Collection has a great deal of information about the history of the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (CA-30) as well as the USS <emph render="italic">Texas</emph> and Franklin Roosevelt's visit to Houston in 1936. Bernrieder corresponded with many of the leading businessmen and politicians in Houston during his lifetime, as well as officers in the Navy. The collection dates from 1917- 1988, with the bulk of the material dating from 1929-1936 and from 1970-1986.</p>
<p>Bernrieder kept a considerable amount of material from his early work regarding having a ship named for the city of Houston and added additional materials to his files throughout his life. There are also a number of items from A. D. Simpson, who was heavily involved in the Cruiser Houston Committee as well.</p>
<p>For the most part, arrangement has followed Bernrieder's subject files with some modification. File folders that could be sub-divided chronologically or by sub-topic have been refiled. Also, folders with materials covering the same topic which had originally been filed separately have been brought together. Because Bernrieder followed a subject arrangement for his files, correspondence is scattered throughout the collection.</p>
<p>There are a number of series within the collection, based on subject with the exception of the Correspondence series. The series are: Correspondence, Democratic Party, Franklin Roosevelt's Visit, USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> Campaign, USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph>, USS <emph render="italic">Texas</emph>, Publications, and Miscellaneous. Within each series are additional topics, arranged alphabetically by subject heading. The largest series is the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> series, which chronicles the history of the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph>.</p>
<p>Later additions to the collection have been incorporated into the subject files arrangement where possible. However, large amounts of correspondence which were donated after the initial gift of materials in 1979 have been given a simple chronological arrangement. Most of the correspondence in those files discusses the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> and related matters, although there is one letter, dated August 23, 1977 which includes Bernrieder's recollections of the Camp Logan riots in Houston in 1917.</p>
<p>For related materials, see the Cruiser Houston Collection, which includes materials donated by crew members from the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> and their families and friends. A large portion of the photographs in the Cruiser Houston Collection were given by Bernrieder, and have remained in that collection.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This is an artificial series, which incorporates all of the correspondence from later gifts by Bernrieder to the collection. The correspondence follows a chronological arrangement scheme. Most of the correspondence relates to the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> and Mr. Bernrieder's interest in the collection. Materials from the 1980s include a great deal of correspondence with Otto Schwarz, founder of the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> Survivors Association. Bernrieder corresponded with a number of officers in the United States Navy, as well as Texas and Houston politicians.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series relates primarily to the campaign to have a cruiser named after the city of Houston. The bulk of the materials is correspondence. A great deal of related materials may be found both the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> series as well as the Correspondence series. A small amount of information relating to the drive for a second Cruiser Houston is in this series (for related materials, see the files in the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> series under USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (CL-81)).</p>

<p>The correspondence relating to the launching of the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> is arranged chronologically. Invitations were sent to all major naval officers, many Houston and Texas politicians, members of the U.S. Cabinet, and dignitaries from Congress and from other states. Replies were received by nearly all those invited.</p>
<p>There are some materials relating to the two ships which followed the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (CA-30). Another ship named the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> was launched in 1943. Materials relating to that ship may be found in the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (CL-81) files. Materials relating to the nuclear submarine, the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> (SSN-713), may be located under that heading. Clippings have been placed in files, but have not been placed in order. Particular care must be taken when using the clippings as most are on highly acidic, fragile newsprint.</p>

<p>The George Kirksey Papers contain clippings, manuscripts, some correspondence, scrapbooks, and numerous photographs. Materials are dated between 1910 and 1971. The collection comprises 18 manuscript boxes and has 3,363 items.</p>
<p>The collection is divided into several series, based on a particular function of Kirksey's life or by form (photographs, scrapbooks, and miscellaneous items). The collection arrived at the University of Houston Special Collections unorganized for the most part. The collection had been created by friends of Kirksey's who cleaned out his apartment following his death and boxed up materials they deemed of possible value, which they sent to the University of Houston Libraries.</p>
<p>The series are primarily arranged by the work in which Kirksey was involved. The series include: Personal, Writing, Military, Public Relations, KTRK, Civil War Round Table, Houston Sports Association, Travel, Photographs, Scrapbooks, and Miscellaneous. Within each series, the materials are organized alphabetically and chronologically where applicable. Apart from the numerous clippings, most of the collection relates to his work as a United Press International correspondent, his service in the Air Force during World War II, and his work with the Houston Sports Association.</p>
<p>A large part of the collection is comprised of newspaper clippings and pages removed from various magazines. Kirksey was a voracious reader and during his life he collected numerous magazine clippings and pages on a variety of subjects. Unfortunately, Kirksey did not label his clippings for date or publication. Many of the clippings have been replaced by photocopies because of the deterioration of the original clippings. The clippings, tear sheets, and photocopies have been arranged within each topical series based on the subject of the clipping.</p>
<p>Kirksey also collected maps and brochures from different places he visited. These items have been retained for the most part, although a large set of National Geographic maps from the late 1950s and early 1960s have been removed from the collection. Again, these items have been placed within the appropriate series where applicable.</p>
<p>There are almost 700 photographs in the collection. Many of the photographs focus on Kirksey's service in the Air Force during World War II, the Astrodome, and the Colt .45s/Astros. A few of the photographs, related to baseball, have captions created for the press. Unfortunately, Kirksey did not label any of the photographs he kept, making identification of personal photographs and travel photographs nearly impossible. The photographs have been organized by topic, which corresponds to the other series. Some photographs are duplicated in the scrapbooks and may have a year or place assigned to them.</p>

The shots are not identified by place. Kirksey was in Egypt, England, France, and Germany during his service in the Air Force from 1942 to 1945.

The Baseball sub-series contains photographs of the Houston Colt .45s (later the Houston Astros), the Astrodome and Houston Sports Association activities. Many photographs taken for the publicity of the Colt .45s and the Astrodome are included in this group. There are also photographs pre-dating Kirksey's involvement with the HSA, which include Kirksey with various baseball players. Additional photographs may be found in the 1951-1968 scrapbook.

The Travel photographs were all taken during Kirksey's trip to India, China, and other eastern countries during 1933. Identified, larger copies of the photographs may be found in the 1931-1938 scrapbook.

The Miscellaneous photographs include some photographs in which the subject could not be identified, as well as photographs that had been autographed and sent to Kirksey. Included among the Miscellaneous photographs are autographed pictures from various dignitaries and sports figures.

Additional photographs related to Kirksey's travels in 1933, Ethel Shutta Kirksey, sports writing, and the Houston Sports Association may be found in the Scrapbooks.</p>

<p>There are nine scrapbooks in this series, dating from 1920 through 1968. Materials in the scrapbooks include newspaper clippings, tearsheets, invitations, identification cards, and photographs. Much of the material is neither dated nor identified. The first six scrapbooks cover Kirksey's life, primarily the 1920s through the 1960s. The remaining scrapbooks were compiled by Billie Joyce (Smith) Kirksey.
The first scrapbook is in poor condition. Items include carbon copies of Kirksey's earliest sports articles, clippings of many of his articles from the 1920s and early 1930s, Christmas cards, tickets and badges from various sporting events, and photographs. Extreme caution must be used while working with this scrapbook.
The second scrapbook includes clippings of stories written by Kirksey, photographs related to his travels in 1933 and his family, and letters received by Kirksey. There are also miscellaneous items. Items are dated 1931-1938.
The third scrapbook covers Kirksey's military career during World War II and covers 1942 through 1945. Most of the items are newspaper clippings written by Kirksey or about Kirksey. Included are stories about his service and announcements of his awards. There are also numerous photographs taken during his time in service. Some of the photographs have captions included.
The fourth scrapbook focuses on his work with the Houston Sports Association but includes materials on Kirksey's travels in Europe and on Kirksey's auto racing team which he started in 1966. The scrapbook includes clippings about the Colt .45s, articles written by Kirksey, photographs, press material, letters, and ephemeral items. Items are dated 1951-1968.
The fifth scrapbook is titled, "Houston Professional Football, Inc." and includes clippings regarding Kirksey's work to bring professional football to Houston. All clippings are from 1959. Some items are loose.
The sixth scrapbook is titled, "Anti-Baseball Book, 1965." In it are clippings detailing the perceived demise of baseball. There are also loose clippings that have been kept with the scrapbook. Clippings are dated 1964 through 1965.
The three remaining scrapbooks were compiled by Kirksey's second wife, Billie Joyce (Smith) Kirksey. These include clippings related to Billie Joyce's activities at the University of Houston while she was a student. The first scrapbook includes the 1945-1946. The second scrapbook focuses on 1946-1947. The third focuses on 1947-1949. Items included are newspaper clippings, graduation announcements, wedding announcements, invitations, cards, and favors. These two scrapbooks are in poor condition.</p>

<p>The Donald Barthelme, Sr. Architectural Papers cover the period 1924
to 1997 and are comprised of his architectural drawings; business and personal
files; memorabilia; photographic prints, negatives, and slides; as well as
lecture notes and other materials from his teaching career. The collection
occupies 35 linear feet and 15 drawers of flat files, and is stored in 43 boxes
and 92 oversize folders.</p>
<p>Barthelme’s architectural drawings document his professional
practice, from his earliest commissions in Galveston in 1933, to his last, in
Houston, in 1964. Of the 1,883 sheets of original drawings, the majority are
(a) studies and preliminary drawings and (b) working drawings. Few presentation
drawings survive, but many have been preserved in photographs. Of particular
interest are the materials for his two largest projects, the Adams Petroleum
Center and West Columbia Senior High School, because of the large number of
colored-pencil renderings, which he did to study different design ideas.
Missing are projects that he may have done in other offices, such as his
Philadelphia, Dallas, Staub, and defense work. With the exception of materials
for a few early projects, for the Adams Petroleum Center, and for the Kellaway
house, most of Barthelme’s business correspondence and project files are
believed to have been destroyed when he closed his office in 1963. </p>
<p>Barthelme is remembered as a teacher and a philosopher. He left
extensive lecture notes for his courses at the University of Houston and
memoranda that outlined his new curriculum for the Architecture Department at
Rice University. His lecture notes illustrate his ideas, but the best organized
statement of his philosophy of architecture is found in his writings. Of
special interest are his manuscript for a book, a handwritten critique of the
manuscript by an unknown reviewer (probably his son, Frederick), and an attempt
to articulate his ideas on architecture in a lengthy 1975 letter to John
McGinty, then head of the Houston Chapter of the A.I.A.</p>
<p>Other writings show the breadth of Barthelme’s interest in
education. In October 1959 he appeared at a conference at the University of
Michigan in which prominent architects discussed Dr. Lloyd Trump’s study for
educational reform, funded by the Ford Foundation. Barthelme presented his own
proposals for a new secondary school curriculum and a schematic design for a
high school. The conference proceedings were published the next year. Barthelme
also prepared 359 slides in connection with this presentation, which are part
of his photographic materials.</p>
<p>As an enthusiastic amateur photographer, Barthelme took thousands of
pictures and often did his own processing in a home darkroom. This large
photographic collection documents his architectural practice and his travels in
Mexico. It is comprised of 1,309 black-and-white prints¬¬ (most 8 x 10 and
larger); 999 4 x 5 black-and-white negatives; 67 35mm black-and-white
negatives; 840 2 ¼ x 3 ¼ black-and-white negatives; 49 2 ¼ x 3 ¼ color
glass-mount transparencies; and 2,856 35mm color slides. In many cases a print
has a corresponding negative, but these materials are not cross-referenced.
Many pictures of Barthelme’s buildings are known to be the work of Dallas
photographer Ulric Meisel, but unless noted otherwise, Barthelme is presumed to
be the photographer on the items in this series.</p>
<p>Among the photographic materials is a bound scrapbook of photographic
prints and clippings of Barthelme’s architectural projects. It also includes
important awards, certificates, and licenses, although some that had become
loose were removed to a separate folder. The scrapbook comprises 120 prints
(mounted and unmounted) and 72 leaves, or 116 total items.</p>
<p>When the Department of Special Collections processed Barthelme’s
papers, his heirs allowed the department to create digital files of a portion
of their large collection of family photographs, which were retained by the
heirs. This collection, covering the period 1930 to 1986, includes pictures of
Barthelme, his wife, and his children, mostly in and around the family home in
Houston. Approximately 150 sheets of photographic negatives are preserved in
2,887 digital images on CD-ROM, with record prints in a binder. This is
intended only as a study collection for scholars. The images are owned by the
Barthelme estate and may not be copied or reproduced without its written
permission.</p>
<p>Barthelme’s professional career is further recorded in his extensive
file of newspaper and magazine clippings. Personal materials include
biographical information, student work, interviews, and correspondence, as well
as artifacts and memorabilia.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The Personal Papers includes records generally created outside of
Barthelme's professional life, such as biographical information, student work,
interview transcripts, and correspondence. This series contains 28 folders
arranged in rough chronological order.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The Writings and Speeches Series contains files related to
Barthelme’s writings in draft or typescript form, and talks to student and
professional groups. The latter includes materials related to an important
conference on educational reform at the University of Michigan in which
Barthelme was one of the principal speakers. (See Scope and Contents Note for
details.) </p>

<p>Barthelme served as an architecture professor at the University of
Houston from 1946 to 1958 and from 1963 to 1973. This series contains his
lecture notes, studio problems, and other resource materials from this period
of his career arranged in subseries by topic, including the following: (1)
Barthelme’s notecards for talks and class lectures, contained in a small box,
with each talk separated by a divider; (2) Gradebooks, school curricula, course
descriptions, and other organizational material, arranged in rough
chronological order; (3) Articles and other reference materials Barthelme
quoted or used in his lectures, arranged chronologically within each of his
subject headings, using his titles, and for the most part following his order;
and (4) Barthelme’s class and lecture notes, arranged chronologically within
each of his subject headings, using his titles, and for the most part following
his order. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Barthelme was William Ward Watkin Professor of Architecture and
Chairman of the Architecture Department at Rice University from February 1959
to May 1961. This series also includes an extensive collection of his memoranda
to Rice faculty, including materials about his new curriculum, and related
material.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains Barthelme’s architectural drawings. They
fall into four categories: Studies and Preliminary Drawings; Working Drawings;
Prints; and Maps and Surveys. All are large format and are stored in flat files
in oversized folders. Some projects contain examples of more than one category
of drawings. Note that in 1955 the name of Sweeny Negro School changed to
“Carver Elementary School” and West Columbia Negro School became “Charlie
Brown School.” The schools appear under both names in Barthelme’s files and
in this finding aid. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Personal notes and bid specifications for many of Barthelme’s
projects have survived and are contained in this series. In letter-size and

<p>Barthelme’s photographic materials consist of black-and-white
prints in various sizes, including 8 x 10, 11 x 14, and 16 x 20; and
black-and-white negatives in 4 x 5, 2 ¼ x 3 ¼, and 35 mm. Most of the color
images are 2 ¼ x 3 ¼ glass-mount transparencies and 35mm color slides. Many
of the pictures of Barthelme’s projects are known to be the work of Dallas
photographer Ulric Meisel, but unless indicated otherwise, Barthelme is
presumed to be the photographer on all of the items in this series. </p>
<p>In the category of “photographic prints” is a scrapbook of
prints and clippings about Barthelme’s projects that he kept during his
career. Many of the prints have separated from the leaves of the scrapbook, and
because he later removed the spiral binding, the order of the items is
approximate. Important awards, certificates, and licenses that had become loose
were removed to a separate folder for such items, but duplicates or those that
were securely mounted remain in the scrapbook. These include the A.I.A. Award
of Merit for St. Rose of Lima Church (1949); the “Texas Architecture 1952”
exhibition Award of Merit for Sweeny Elementary School; The School Executive
Competition for Better School Design, Special Feature Award for Sweeny
Elementary (1952); and the Houston Chapter A.I.A. Award of Merit for Sweeny
H.S. additions (undated). The scrapbook comprises 120 prints (mounted and

<p>In March 2005, the Houston Mod organization sponsored an
exhibition at the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture concerning
Barthelme's Bousquet House (1940). At the time, the house, at 3981 Del Monte
Drive in Houston's River Oaks neighborhood, was the last surviving
Barthelme-designed residence in the city. It was demolished later in the year.
The exhibit coincided with efforts by a class from the University of Houston to
document the house for the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). The
exhibit featured a booklet, detailed photographs and drawings of the house in
2005, a scale model, the HABS drawings, and reproductions of Barthelme's
original drawings. Houston Mod donated the exhibition materials to the
University of Houston Libraries, Department of Special Collections, where they
were added to the Donald Barthelme, Sr. Architectural Papers. The booklet is
cataloged separately, but the exhibition boards and model are contained in the
following boxes.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Barthelme’s personal library of 59 books was separated from the
Donald Barthelme, Sr. Architectural Papers and transferred to the
University’s William R. Jenkins Architecture &amp; Art Library, where they
were integrated into its Closed Collections and Special Collections. Barthelme
earlier donated most of his books to the University’s Architecture Library in
1977 (the name of the library changed in 1986).</p>

<p>This series includes a variety of negatives and slides, as well as
digital copies of all negatives. The negatives are in a variety of formats and
sizes. Most of the negatives in this series were donated by Otto Schwarz and
the USS <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> Survivors Association, and many of
them are copy negatives of other images. </p>
<p>Box 4 contains CD-ROMs of digital images that were created by
Special Collections staff to provide better access to the negatives. Patrons
visiting the reading room in person may view the CD-ROMs on a laptop or at a
computer workstation in our reading room. A printed list of the contents of the
negatives is also available. The negatives were scanned at their original size
in order to serve as a positive image contact sheet for easier browsing.
Because the digital images on the CD-ROM are so small, patrons wishing to order

<p>Correspondence is divided into four sub-series by format:
Postcards from POW Camp, Telegrams, Letters, and Envelopes. The Postcards from
POW Camp series includes postcards written by <emph render="italic">Houston</emph> crew members while they were being held as
prisoners-of-war. These postcards were highly censored by the Japanese
military. The Postcards from POW Camp, Telegrams, and Envelopes sub-series are
each arranged by sender. If there are multiple items from the same sender, they
are further arranged by receiver. If there are multiple items from the same
sender to the same receiver, they are further arranged by date.</p>
<p>The Letters sub-series is organized somewhat differently. It
contains several large groups of letters that all pertain to one individual or
family: William C. Batchelor, Jr., Henry Nickel, Claude E. Parker, Frank
Pistole, William Slough, and the family of Francis B. Weiler. These groups of
letters are arranged separately from the rest. Each group is arranged by
sender, then by receiver, and then by date. The rest of the letters fall under
the General heading, where they are arranged by sender, then by receiver, and
then by date.</p>
<p>The letters of the family of Francis B. Weiler are photocopies of
materials in the collection of the Naval Museum, U.S. Naval Academy.</p>

the present.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 1997, a separate newsletter was put out by the

<p>The Patricia R. Cole and Nancy J. Flanakin National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence Records documents the organization’s work in providing training and consultation to organizations interested in the prevention of domestic and sexual violence. The collection includes correspondence, legal and legal style documentation, financial documents, printed materials, creative works, clippings, transparencies, forms, publications, posters, CDs, a VHS tape, note cards, handwritten notes, and ephemera created and maintained by The National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence (NCDSV). Because all records had been previously transferred from the organization to create a reference library at UT Austin, it was not possible to maintain original order. Additionally, the files of published literature in the field of domestic violence were removed as this material was deemed not an organic part of the organization's documentation. Where possible, folder contents were kept intact.</p>
<p>The records are arranged into six series with the bulk of the records dated 1998-2004. Administration, Conferences/Workshops, DTFDV (Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence), TCFV (Texas Council on Family Violence), Training/Education, and Tucker, Buel &amp; Associates comprise the main series. The Administration series contains approximately half of the total records. Half of this first series consists of correspondence and a third consists of records of the co-founder, Sarah Buel.</p>

Administration, Conferences/Workshops, DTFDV (Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence), TCFV (Texas Council on Family Violence), Training/Education, and Tucker, Buel &amp; Associates comprise the main series. The Administration series contains approximately half of the total records. Half of this first series consists of correspondence and a third consists of records of the co-founder, Sarah Buel.</p>
<p>Administration records (1977-2007, 200 folders) are grouped into seven sub-series; Board of Directors, Donations, Executive Director, Memberships, Resume, Staff, and Staff Projects. Notable records include keynote speeches given by Sarah Buel at various conferences, Buel’s published works on domestic violence, and papers submitted by students of her “Domestic Violence and the Law” class taught during Buel’s time at the University of Texas Law School. Email threads in Nancy Flanakin’s correspondence reveal the NCDSV involvement in issues of national importance. An example of this is the 2004 correspondence showing the organizations involvement in reinstating the domestic violence exclusion in the Homeless Management Information System law. Under this act, domestic violence organizations were being forced to reveal shelter locations in order to sustain certain kinds of funding. Notable documents also include Patricia Cole’s work on welfare reform in regards to domestic violence victims and the Staff Bios contained in the Grant Proposal for Women’s Safety Initiative under the sub-series of Staff Projects.</p>
<p>The Conferences/Workshops records (1995-2005, 38 folders) contain conference folders or packets along with publications, printed material, forms, correspondence, ephemera, and handwritten notes. NCDSV members either participated in or attended the conferences/workshops listed. Notable records include Patricia Cole’s work on poverty and domestic violence at the Tenth Annual National Conference on Domestic Violence and Sarah Buel’s “Expert Witness” presentation at the 2001 Workshop of the same name.</p>
<p>The DTFDV (Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence) records (1996-2004, 101 folders) illuminate staff involvement during the three year period that DTFDV operated. This series is divided into four sub-series: Documents/Reports, Meetings, Site Visits, and Staff Documents. Under the sub-series “Meetings”, the April 2000 Initial Meeting documents the purpose, mission, and vision of the DTFDV.</p>
<p>The TCFV (Texas Council on Family Violence) records (1980-2007, 60 folders) are divided into six sub-series: Administration, Conferences, Ephemera, Manuals, National Domestic Hotline, and Reports/Documents.

<p>The Burdette Keeland Papers cover the period 1926 to 2000 and are comprised of his architectural drawings, business and personal files, memorabilia, photographic prints, and negatives, as well as materials from his teaching career. The collection occupies 25 linear feet of shelves and 15 drawers of flat files. It is stored in 40 boxes, 112 oversize folders, and 5 tubes for rolled material. It also includes one oversized construction sign and one piece of framed artwork.</p>
<p>The largest category of documents concerns Keeland's architectural practice. This category is comprised of his architectural drawings, project files, photographs, and magazines in which his work was published. The majority of the original drawings are (a) studies and preliminary drawings and (b) working drawings. Keeland was a talented artist and created presentation drawings in pen and ink for many projects. These are of special interest and are noted in the finding aid for those projects.</p>
<p>Other important categories include Keeland's correspondence files, clippings files, travel photographs, papers from the City of Houston Planning Commission, and files related to his teaching career with the University of Houston.</p>
<p>Also, Keeland amassed an extensive collection of photographic slides of the architecture he encountered on his travels. These slides were separated from the Burdette Keeland Papers and transferred to the Visual Resources Center at the University’s Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture. At present they have not been processed or catalogued.</p>

Also included are recordings of the 1989 Keeland roast; Keeland’s 1996 “40 Proof” retrospective lecture; and the 2000 Keeland memorial service at the College of Architecture.

<p>Keeland acquired through his wife a collection of photographic negatives owned by Harry Walker (1894-1971), husband of Carrie Scott Walker (1895-1981), Mrs. Keeland’s aunt. The negatives cover the period from the turn of the twentieth century to the 1940s and record Walker’s life growing up in Beaumont, Texas, and his adult life after his move to Houston in the late 1910s. Walker was apparently the photographer on most of the negatives. Although most of the subjects are unidentified, the pictures provide an important view of domestic life and dress during that era. Of interest are photographs of Walker’s home at 1914 Bissonnet, Houston, with views of the area that includes Poe Elementary School when the neighborhood was new in 1929. Historical views of Houston from the 1920s include Rice Institute, Hermann Hospital, the Houston Ship Channel, and the San Jacinto Trust Company, his employer. There are also historic images of pioneer aviatrix Katherine Stinson flying a Wright Brothers biplane about 1915. The names of the folders and the filing system are Walker’s, except that the Rice, Hermann, and Stinson photographs have been moved to separate folders. Another folder includes several photographs of downtown Houston in the snow, about 1925, with views of Union Station and nearby buildings.</p>

<p>Keeland was appointed to the Houston Planning Commission in 1964 by Mayor Louie Welch. In 1981 he became chairman and served in that capacity until he left the commission in 1991. During this time Houston experienced phenomenal growth, thus challenging the planning commission to find ways to respond to these pressures in a city without comprehensive zoning or other land use laws. During Keeland’s tenure on the commission, major issues included the city’s first tree ordinance, the controversial proposal to extend Chimney Rock Road across Buffalo Bayou, and the extensive study and preparation for the zoning referendum election of 1994, which ultimately was unsuccessful. As chairman Keeland was an advocate of land use planning and, in particular, the enactment of a city-wide zoning ordinance. His files reflect these issues and others. A number of the zoning reference materials relate to a Planning and Zoning Commission Workshop held at the Woodlands Conference Center in 1992.</p>

ADATs became very popular among recording studios in the 1990s due to their high quality and affordability. The tapes in this series contain recordings by many prominent Houston hip hop artists, mostly notably several sets of tapes containing master recordings by DJ Screw. The tapes are arranged alphabetically by artist, and titles were taken directly from the tapes. Due to the fragility of the original ADATs, they cannot be played directly. Digital copies of the individual audio tracks can be accessed in the Special Collections Reading Room by advance request. These materials may require up to one week to access. Contact Julie Grob (jgrob@uh.edu) for more information.</p>

<p>The Mexico Documents Collection is a result of combining several smaller artificial collections into one in order to improve organization and facilitate access. The collection chronicles the history of Mexico from Spanish rule to the Mexican Revolution. The material has been arranged chronologically into four series: the Colonial Period to Mexican Independence to the Mexican-American War, the Mexican-American War to the Mexican Revolution, and documents with unknown dates. The bulk of the collection is from the period from Mexican Independence to the end of the Mexican-American War (1825-1849).</p>
<p>The documents primarily consist of personal and official correspondence, government orders, decrees, and announcements of Mexican officials. Notable individuals include Santa Anna de Lopez, Jose Joaquin de Hererra and Porfirio Diaz. Additionally, some materials document American military actions in Mexico during the Mexican-American War. Lastly, there are an assortment of documents chronicling religion in Mexico as well as business and land transactions.</p>
<p>Many of the documents have English translations available as well as biographical information.</p>

<p>This collection consists of 59 exhibition panels, two large light boxes with transparencies, and mounting hardware. The exhibition purports to show fifty Hines projects, but the materials received from the donor include only 48.</p>
<p>In 2007 the American Institute of Architects, Houston Chapter celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the Hines Company with an exhibition entitled, “HINES / 50 YEARS / 50 SELECTED WORKS.” The exhibition appeared at the AIA Houston offices and at the gallery of the Williams Tower in Houston. The large text panel describes the content of the exhibition as follows:</p>
<p>HINES / 50 YEARS / 50 SELECTED WORKS</p>
<p>Ultimately, the remarkable legacy of Hines will be measured in the powerful and profound architecture it has constructed throughout the world. Gerald D. Hines is known for his singular ability to do the right thing at the right time. His vision and architectural sensibility have consistently driven decisions since 1957 when he hired Neuhaus &amp; Taylor, a premier Houston architectural firm, to design his first small development. The measured growth of Hines from a one-man show to an international operation of 3,350 employees began with the transformation of the Richmond Avenue Corridor. Expanding into downtown Houston, Hines remade the city’s skyline engendering national recognition that remade the city’s reputation as well. From Houston, Hines reached into other large U.S. cities with projects that, like the Houston buildings, attracted attention for extraordinary design, innovative construction, and workable space. By the 1990s international projects, first in Mexico and Europe then Asia, rivaled those in the U.S. in terms of size and architectural significance.</p>
<p>The 50 projects in this exhibition were carefully chosen to show chronological, geographic, and architectural diversity. Each represents many others that could have been included. Architectural firms headquartered in Houston – Neuhaus &amp; Taylor, Wilson, Morris Crain &amp; Anderson (now Morris Architects), and Kendall/Heaton Associates stand alongside nationally known architects such as Cesar Pelli, Frank Gehry, Philip Johnson, Kevin Roche, David Childs, Bruce Graham, Eugene Kohn, Mario Cucinella, Norman Foster, I.M. Pei, Harry Cobb, Robert A.M. Stern, and many others. Hines buildings are never formulaic, and even those designed by the same architect are distinctive. The variety of building types, spaces, places and architecture that Hines continues to develop brings richness to an oeuvre that will engage and fascinate generations to come.</p>

Materials regarding the Faculty Wives' Club, the Women's Club of the University of Houston, and the American Association of University Women, initially found among the UHWA documents, were removed and arranged in separate collections.

<p>The Larry McMurtry Collection contains multiple typescript manuscript drafts of the novels Leaving Cheyenne, The Last Picture Show, Moving On, Somebody's Darling, Cadillac Jack: A Novel, The Desert Rose, Lonesome Dove, and Texasville, plus manuscript notes and publisher's copies related to some of these works. The collection also contains the typescript manuscripts and first galley proofs for the book of essays In a Narrow Grave.</p>
<p>The McMurtry Collection includes a screenplay for Hud (the film adaptation of McMurtry's Horseman, Pass By), and the screenplay for the John Cougar Mellencamp film project Falling from Grace (titled Ridin' the Cage and Indiana Moon in these drafts). Also in the collection are scripts for the cable television movies Montana and Memphis (titled September, September in these drafts), which was adapted from a novel by Shelby Foote and co-written with Cybil Shepherd. Many scripts are included which have not been produced, such as Cantrell and Somebody's Darling, which credits Diane Keaton as co-writer in some drafts.</p>
<p>The collection includes a large amount of correspondence. There are three major sections of correspondence – from McMurtry to his friend and Bookman store owner Grace David, from McMurtry to his friend Mike Kunkel, and from Harper and Row editor John Leggett to McMurtry. The Leggett correspondence concerns changes to the manuscripts for Horseman, Pass By and Leaving Cheyenne. Other correspondence includes that from McMurtry to book dealer Miles Karpilow.</p>
<p>A wide-ranging collection, the Larry McMurtry Collection also includes short prose and poetry, numerous literary reviews written by McMurtry, news articles about his books and films, notes on projects considered, transcriptions of taped interviews used as research for The Desert Rose, scripts which McMurtry worked on as an advisor without receiving credit, photographs, and other miscellaneous documents.</p>
<p>The collection is organized into six major series: McMurtry’s Writings, Correspondence, Other Projects, Works by Other Authors, Photographs and Miscellaneous. The first series, McMurtry’s Writings, contains the bulk of the collection contents. This series is divided into three sub-series: Novels, Scripts and Other Writings. Most individual works are given their own sub-series, and these are arranged alphabetically. The Correspondence, Other Projects, and Miscellaneous series have also been subdivided.</p>
<p>Additional manuscript material of Larry McMurtry is held at the University of North Texas in Denton, Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, and Rice University in Houston. The Texana Collection of the Willis Library at the University of North Texas contains some of McMurtry's student literary submissions and papers, plus typescript manuscripts of Horseman, Pass By and Leaving Cheyenne. The Southwestern Writers Collection at the Alkek Library of Southwest Texas State University includes the screenplay and many other materials from the television mini-series Lonesome Dove, and a typescript of the 1972 screenplay Streets of Laredo, on which the Lonesome Dove novel was based. The Woodson Research Center of Fondren Library at Rice University has two collections of papers documenting McMurtry’s collaboration with Diana Ossana. These collections contain drafts, correspondence, and related materials.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>

<p>This bulk of this series consists of typescripts, notes, and research for McMurtry’s writings. Issues of American Film magazine which contain McMurtry’s essays on film that were later compiled into the book Film Flam have been separated from the collection and cataloged.</p>

<p>The collection arrived in generally good order and condition. Some material from the late 1950s to early 1960s was very brittle, and has been placed in protective mylar. The collection includes an almost complete run of minutes, financials, and yearbooks.</p>
<p>The collection includes several large, typical scrapbooks and several smaller types of scrapbooks. These scrapbooks were compiled and submitted for various awards at the local and state levels. Most of the information on the Council’s two major activities, the Veterans Administration Hospital and the Lighthouse for the Blind Garden Club, as well as smaller projects, are contained in these books. The scrapbooks contain photographs, newspaper and magazine clippings, ribbons, correspondence, newsletters, and other material documenting the Council’s involvement in various community service projects.</p>
<p>The large scrapbooks were in very fragile condition. Items had been glued or taped onto the pages, most of the tape was no longer sticky, and items were loose throughout the books. The pages were very acidic and some had torn; some of the photographs had begun to discolor. Several of the scrapbooks contained loose material at the end. These scrapbooks have been disassembled for preservation purposes: pages with newsprint copied onto acid free paper, tape removed if possible, acid free tissue paper placed between the pages of the most fragile scrapbooks. The other type of scrapbook is a small, three-clasp pocket folder. These pocket folders have been disassembled and the material kept in original order.</p>
<p>The collection is divided into five series: Administrative, Projects and Activities, Awards, Yearbooks, and Memorabilia. The material in the collection has been arranged, for the most part, chronologically.</p>

<p>The U.H. Forensics Team Records contains newspaper articles, schedules of tournament events, correspondence, tapes, and photographs relating to the U.H. Forensics Team between the years of 1956-1973. Typically the newspaper articles describe the team's performance at various national tournaments. During the 1960s, the U.H. Forensics Team was considered as one of the top rated teams in the country, defeating teams like Harvard in 11 debates while only losing to them 4 times. In 1969, the U.H. debate team won 137 of the 159 debates that they participated in with Dr. William English winning coach of the year. Following the 1969 season, Dr. English spoke about team members Mike Miller, a political science junior, and David Seikel, a political science senior, and said that the two held the "best record of any intercollegiate debate team ever." He then added, "There probably never will be a better team."</p>
<p>The U.H. Forensics Team Records arrived at the archives in very good order, which has been maintained where possible. The collection consists mainly of newspaper clippings directly related to the organization and to the debates that it participated in, however there are a small number of photographs, tournament results, and tapes of the National Debate Tournaments from 1956-1966 also found in the collection.</p>
<p>For preservation and access reasons the collection has been re-boxed and re-foldered. New folder titles conform, as closely as possible, to original folder titles, except when the original was obviously incomplete, incorrect, or confusing. Original folder and item order has been maintained whenever possible. Exceptions were made when folders were obviously misfiled or when no order was apparent.</p>

<p>This is an artificial and disparate collection of Texana, or materials relating to the history of Texas. In order for the collection to be useful to researchers, an artificial order was imposed by the processor. The collection is divided into seven series: Pre-Republic (to 1836); Republic (1836-1845); Annexation and Early Statehood (1845-1860); Civil War and Expansion (1861-1901); Modern Statehood (1901-1956); Claude Elliott Papers; and Governors Ferguson/Sterling Papers. Series, sub-series, and folder titles have been standardized as much as possible. The first five series, directly relating to Texas history, each contain the same three sub-series: Documents, Printed Material, and Creative Works. Folders are arranged in alphabetical order and items within the folders are arranged chronologically.</p>
<p>The standardized folder titles are fairly broad in order to accommodate the varied nature of the collection. In general, a folder entitled Land will contain deeds; a folder entitled Legal will contain miscellaneous items such as wills and probate documents, indentures, and promissory notes; and a folder entitled Government will contain sheriff’s documents and gubernatorial appointments to local offices. In a few instances, such as with the Annexation of Texas, the amount and focus of the material warrants a specific folder title.</p>
<p>In some instances, items from the twentieth century, such as newspaper or periodical articles, have been placed in an earlier series if the information pertains to an event or person in an earlier period. For example, twentieth century articles on brands have been placed with the nineteenth century brand book.</p>
<p>Some material in the collection was owned previously by Dr. Alexander Dienst, Jr. (1870-1938) of Temple, Texas, a historian and collector of Texana. His handwritten notes and commentary appear on some of the items. He was a friend and supporter of Governor James E. Ferguson.</p>

<p>The Business Manager Records of C. F. McElhinney are the records McElhinney generated during his tenure at the University of Houston (1945-1973). The collection has been arranged into six series: Board of Regents, Staff Conference Meetings, Legislative Activities, Building Files, President’s Office, and the Houston College for Negroes. The materials in the collection date from 1945-1974, with the bulk of the materials dating from the 1960s and 1970s. Included in the collection are university-related correspondence, minutes, agendas, reports, financial reports, bids, and contracts. There are no photographs or personal papers in the collection.</p>
<p>Key correspondents in the collection include C. F. McElhinney, Philip Hoffman, Patrick J. Nicholson, E. E. Oberholtzer, W. W. Kemmerer, and Clanton W. Williams.</p>
<p>The materials follow the organization in which McElhinney left them, with some minor rearrangement within folders to follow chronological order. All folder titles use the headings provided by McElhinney.</p>
<p>Materials in the collection document the administrative activities of the University, including Camp Wheeler, construction on the Houston College for Negroes campus (now Texas Southern University), the legislative activities of the University during its campaign for state support in the 1960s, the development of KUHT Channel 8 and KUHF, the campus radio station.</p>

<p>This is the largest series, 10.5 boxes or 488 folders, with the bulk of the records dating from the 1950s through 1973. The materials are arranged in chronological order with some exceptions and include agendas, minutes, memoranda, reports, budgets and financial reports. Also included in this series are the records of several sub-committees of the Board of Regents/Board of Governors. These include the committees on which McElhinney served: the Finance Committee, the Executive Committee, the Building Committee, the Planning Committee, and the Investment Committee. During 1957 some re-organization was undertaken, which created a Board of Governors to serve in an advisory capacity to the Board of Regents. This changed again in 1963, when the University of Houston gained state funding and the Board of Governors was eliminated. Generally the files are organized by month, with agendas and any attached materials followed by the minutes for that meeting.

Of particular interest are materials attached to the minutes and agendas, which include reports or memos from many of the faculty and administrators on campus. These reports address the initiation of new programs on campus as well as several major issues: construction on campus, desegregation, the campaign for state support in the early 1960s, Camp Wheeler, KUHT, and KUHF. These materials have been left with the agendas with which they were attached and therefore are found throughout the series. Materials on KUHT and KUHF, in particular, are scattered throughout this series, although there is a folder from the Ad-Hoc Television Committee in 1959 and a folder specifically on KUHT from 1966.</p>

<p>The collection contains financial, promotional, and managerial records of Hazelwitch
Productions from the date of its receipt of Certificate of Operation in July 1981 to its
final production in 1996. With the exception of some of the financial records, there was
no consistent scheme of organization in the collection. Material is arranged in five
series: Financial Records, Production Management, Promotional Material, Dissolution
Materials, and Miscellaneous. Financial records constitute two-thirds of the collection.
Although there is no documentation of finances before the organization's
incorporation in 1983, evidence of detailed accounting, and tax records from 1984-1996
provide insight into the day-to-day running of the corporation during these years.</p>
<p>There is very little correspondence in the collection, but dated notes and performance
agreements document management of the corporation's productions from 1989-1996. The
collection provides very little coverage of performances before 1989, beyond an
inclusive collection of promotional material from 1982-1996.</p>
<p>The last two series in the collection, Miscellaneous and Dissolution Materials, were
added to the collection separately during the summer of 1998, and were therefore
processed separately. They contain financial materials and material pertaining to
productions. The collection also contains two placards; both have been placed in the

<p>There are forty-six folders in this series dating from 1984-1996. Initially, all
receipts of purchases, telephone bills, postal service invoices, and receipts of
deposits made, were kept with duplicates of checks written from the Hazelwitch
account. These records have been maintained in this order in folders 12-21. After
1987 check duplicates were filed separately and were apparently not retained after
1990. Folder 22 contains a package of records, which had been collected
separately, possibly for the purpose of preparing tax returns. In general no
consistent filing scheme was used for receipts and bills after 1989 and receipts
have been organized in chronological order by date of purchase. Of particular note
from this period are the financial statements prepared by Katherine Hubbard from
1992-1995, which reveal the financial status of Hazelwitch Productions, Inc.
during its final years of operation. Tax records in the series include franchise

<p>This collection documents the career of Nikki Van Hightower from the time of her appointment as Women's Advocate up to, and including, her work as Harris County Treasurer. It contains material dating from 1967 to 1997, with the bulk of the material dating from 1977 to 1989. Types of material within the collection include correspondence, memoranda, reports, studies, speeches, commentaries, press statements, publications, diaries, photographs and clippings.</p>
<p>The papers were originally filed in broad subject categories which have, where possible, been retained in the eight series titles: Women's Advocate, Radio, Houston Area Women's Center, International Women's Year, Political Publicity, Speeches, Personal Files, and Clippings. In order to facilitate research, files were broken down into a more detailed topical arrangement. Folders are arranged alphabetically by title within series and sub-series. Where possible, papers are arranged chronologically within folders. When dates are consistently lacking, as with the speeches and radio commentaries, material is arranged alphabetically by title.</p>
<p>Van Hightower's work as Women's Advocate is particularly well documented in the collection. The papers reveal the significance of that position in relation to city government and to the fact that Houston was chosen as the site of the International Women's Year National Conference in 1977.</p>
<p>The papers representing Van Hightower's work at KTRH reveal the extremes of opposition and support which could be engendered by the kind of direct approach to controversial social issues which Van Hightower took in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Also notable are the speeches and clippings. The speeches constitute a substantial portion of the collection, revealing the range of subjects oh which Van Hightower spoke, and the extent of her community involvement. The clippings provide a valuable insight into media treatment of feminism during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The Houston Area Women's Center series is the smallest in the collection. Van Hightower's work as Executive Director for the Center is more fully documented in the Houston Area Women's Center collection, also housed in the Carey C. Shuart Women's Research Collection.</p>

<p>This series contains thirty-one folders. Papers date from 1973 to 1978, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1976 to 1978. The series is divided into three sub-series: General Files, Reports and Studies, and Women's Rights Coordinating Council. Of particular note are the correspondence and memoranda files, which document the particular practices and policies with which Van Hightower took issue, and the range of opposition and support she received in response. Also noteworthy are the studies on the status of women in Houston.</p>

<p>There are forty-five folders in this series, with two sub-series representing the two different capacities in which Van Hightower worked with Radio Station KTRH: Daily Commentaries/ Doubletalk, and Women's Advocate Hour. Material dates from 1976 to 1979. The correspondence in the first sub-series consists almost entirely of letters from listeners. Correspondence in the second sub-series relates primarily to arrangements for the show. Guests of note on the Women's Advocate Hour included Ellie Smeal, then President of the National Organization of Women, and Gloria Steinem.</p>

<p>This series contains ten folders with material dating from 1977 to 1986.

The series also contains reports and publications.</p>

<p>This series contains thirty-seven folders in three sub-series, which reflect the original arrangement: Texas Women's Meeting, Houston Conference Preparations, and National Conference. Material dates from 1976 to 1987, with the bulk of the material being from 1977.

In the first sub-series, folders labeled "Committee Materials" contain papers relating to the activities of the Coordinating, Advisory, and Executive Committees of the Texas Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year Decade. Because separation of these papers would have disrupted the original order entirely, these folders contain a combination of agendas, minutes, membership lists, procedures, rules and memoranda. For the same reason, the term "correspondence" should be interpreted loosely here.

Notable correspondents in this series include Judge Elizabeth Athanasakos (Presiding Officer of the National Committee on the Observance of International Women's Year), Hilary Whittaker (Conference Coordinator), and Bella Abzug (Secretariat for International Women's Year).</p>

<p>There are one hundred twenty-nine folders in this series. Although much of the material is not dated, some speeches have had dates supplied using information from Van Hightower's 1997 resume. Dates covered are 1967 to 1994. The series is divided into seven sub-series: Education, Government and Finance, History and Status of the Women's Movement, Women in Business and Political Life, Women in Crisis, Miscellaneous Subjects, and Speaking Engagement Arrangements. The first six sub-series contain full text versions and plans of speeches, presentations, statements, and testimonies. Folders also contain notes and accompanying material when applicable. Since the majority of speeches and plans were titled, they are arranged alphabetically by title in individual folders. Speeches with the same or similar titles may be foldered together. Titles of sub-series were imposed by the processor, and some assumptions had to be made about which speeches accompanying material was originally related. Untitled speeches are located at the end of the appropriate sub-series. In most cases there is no indication of the audience to which a speech was addressed. Those named include the following: American Association of University Women American Society for Public Administration Bay Area Turning Point Auxiliary Club Center for Women's Opportunities Conference for County Councils on the Status of Women First South Central Women's Studies Conference Gulf Coast Community Services Association Gulf Coast Section Society of Petroleum Engineers Houston Chapter of Hadassah Houston Independent School Board Houston Philosophical Society Houston Police Department Independent School Association of the Southwest National Council of Jewish Women National Management Association, Lockheed Northshore Rotary Club Palacios High School Rotary Club of Houston Society for Histopathologists Society for Medical Technology Texas 71st Air Force Junior R.O.T.C.

<p>This series contains thirty-eight folders of material dating from 1974 to 1997, with the bulk of the material from 1974 to 1989. Correspondence files contain a variety of communications relating to Van Hightower's involvement in clubs and committees, notifications of awards and honors, letters of thanks and congratulations, and letters from personal friends and family. Correspondents of note include Betty Ford, Ann Richards, Liz Carpenter, and Eleanor Tinsley.

A significant portion of the correspondence could be considered "business" rather than personal. Since it is difficult, however, to determine the division between Van Hightower's personal and official community involvement, most of the correspondence was left in these personal files, with the exception of some material pertaining to the Houston Area Women's Center. Van Hightower's resume, in box 12 folder 13, provides a comprehensive survey of her achievements. The series also contains some photographs which are filed with accompanying correspondence, or at the end of the series.</p>

<p>This series contains thirteen folders, dating from 1990 to 1998. It includes mostly thank-you notes, general correspondence to and from members of the organization, and internal memoranda. The creator had a separate folder, labeled "thank-you notes," which was arranged in roughly chronological order by year. Some items had post-it notes saying "correspo from member" or just "correspo," but all the items were in the "thank-you notes" folder.

<p>This series contains twenty folders, dating from 1990 to 1994. It contains records and documents pertaining to membership in the Greater Houston Women's Foundation. The materials in this series have been left in their original order. The creator organized the membership applications according to the monetary donation level. The items were then arranged alphabetically by member's name. The database membership record has been left in its original order, with some additions. Not all of the pages of the database membership record are numbered, and so page numbers and letters have been assigned to the unnumbered pages to ensure that they remain in their original order. For example, the page following 7 is 7a. In some cases, page numbers, such as 28, are missing, and there is only one page (27a) between 27 and 29. In other cases, there is a page between the numbered pages (32a is between 32 and 33), or multiple pages between numbered pages (33a and 33b are between 33 and 34). When a charter member's application was missing, the creator inserted a blank sheet with the charter member's name. The membership lists for 1992 and 1993 were arranged according to zip code, rather than alphabetically, and that arrangement has been retained. Some of the membership applications are dated and others are not. Some of these dates may pertain to a renewal of membership, rather than to an original membership.

<p>The Hispanic Women in Leadership collection contains information about the group's conferences, meetings, organization, and programs. The conferences series is the largest, as the annual conference is the main activity of Hispanic Women. The group organized their papers in three-ring binders, but in order to facilitate access to the collection, the material has for the most part been re-arranged chronologically in broad series such as administrative, correspondence, and conferences, and then further divided into sub-series. For preservation reasons, facsimiles on thermofax paper and newspaper articles have been copied onto regular paper, and newspapers have been placed in a separate oversize box.</p>

They contain basic information on the group's history, organization, and leadership. The President sub-series contains six folders, dating from 1989 to 1999, and includes mainly financial records. The Secretary sub-series contains nineteen folders, dating from 1988 to 1999. This sub-series contains items such as agendas and minutes of board and general meetings, calendars, membership information, newsletters, and news clippings. A separation sheet in the folder indicates if a newspaper has been removed to the oversize box. The material in both the President and Secretary sub-series is arranged chronologically. In order to facilitate access, the material in the President and Secretary sub-series has been significantly re-arranged and a new order imposed. Hispanic Women in Leadership used binders to arrange the majority of the papers in the Administrative series. Each officer, at the beginning of their term of office, was given a binder for their papers. Some of the binders were better organized than others, and some of the binders for a particular officer or year were missing. There was also a lot of duplication of papers. To create a consistent and clear arrangement, the material has been divided functionally between the offices of president and secretary. These were the only consistent binders, and many of the papers in other binders, such as vice-president, were also found in the president or secretary binders.</p>

<p>The papers for the Houston Women’s Caucus for Art (HWCA) span from its founding in 1978 to 2004. Some items, however, pre-date this period. The largest portion of the records is devoted to photos and to art exhibitions sponsored by the Caucus. The next largest portion includes newsletters, grant applications and fundraising, financial records, and conferences. The remainder of the collection is devoted to information pertaining to the business of the Caucus, membership, and the visual arts in Houston. Many of the items located in this collection do not specifically deal with the HWCA. Some are more general art news, activism, arts organizations, or other chapters of the National Women’s Caucus for Art. These materials have been retained in order to give researchers a sense of the networking, interests, and activities of the Caucus beyond the city of Houston.</p>
<p>The collection has fifteen series: Administration; Firehouse Gallery; Newsletters; Shows; Events; Fundraising; Members; Finances; Conferences; Photos; Clippings; General Visual Arts; Posters; Lectures, Papers and Speeches; and Printed Materials. The original arrangement varied according to year. Generally, previous record keepers tended to organize the documents around fundraising, particularly grant applications, and around art shows sponsored by the Caucus. This current organization was imposed by the archivist, and follows a topical arrangement.</p>

<p>Information on the formation and business operation of the Houston Women’s Caucus for Art from 1978 to 2000 lies in the Administration series. This series contains six sub-series: Documentation, Correspondence, Board, Meetings, Mode, and Office. The Documentation sub-series includes such official organizational information as the by-laws, articles of incorporation, mission statement, various guidelines, and the official history of the HWCA. The Correspondence sub-series contains all general correspondence to HWCA. Letters referring to specific events or grants were kept in those categories. The Board sub-series includes rosters of the officers for the Community Advisory board and the Executive Board, as well as descriptions of board positions. This sub-series also contains two folders, President (Joy Mullet), and Chapter Representative, that duplicate most of the information found throughout the collection. These two folders have been kept intact, as they were found in the original order of the collection, in order to give researchers insight into the activity of a president and chapter representative through the course of their tenure. The Meetings sub-series contains the outline for the original meeting of the HWCA, and the announcements, agenda, and minutes for subsequent meetings. This set is incomplete. The MODE sub-series contains the documentation of activities to identify and address organizational deficiencies under the Management Assistance and Organizational Development Enterprise (MODE) and Intensive Service Program (ISP) offered through the Cultural Arts Council of Houston/Harris County. The Office sub-series includes media mailing lists, notes scribbled on scrap paper, information of office supplies and printers, and the address for the HWCA web site.</p>

<p>The Newsletters series spans the years 1978 to 2003. They are divided into four sub-series: Houston, Other Chapters, Regional, and National. The National newsletter changed titles several times, from simply Newsletter, to Hue Points, to Update, Member News, and Artlines. An incomplete set of these can be found in the National sub-series. Researchers wishing to find a full set of National newsletters should refer to the National Women’s Caucus for Art archives in New Jersey. The Regional sub-series contains only one folder, and is not specific to any region. The Other Chapters sub-series contains newsletters for various WCA chapters throughout the nation. This sub-series is arranged alphabetically according to state, then according to chapter within that state. None of the sets of these newsletters are complete, and researchers should refer to those individual chapters for more information. Although the National, Regional, and Chapter sub-series do not contain all of the newsletters for those organizations, they have been retained in this collection in order for researchers to ascertain the interaction of the HWCA with their sister organizations throughout the nation. The Houston sub-series contains an incomplete set of newsletters for the HWCA, arranged chronologically. This set is almost complete, missing most of 1986, 1987, 1989, and 1990.</p>

Unknown photographs and undated photographs are at the end of each sub-series. Most people depicted in the photographs are unidentified. Those who are identifiable are labeled on the tissue paper separating the photographs. Each folder indicates the number of items in the folder, and the type of photo - black and white (b/w), or color. Where possible, the artist of a particular work has been identified.</p>

<p>The Clippings series includes all newspaper and magazine clippings found throughout the original arrangement of the HWCA papers. Due to the great number and concern for preservation of these clippings, they were separated into their own series and copied onto acid-free paper when possible. Some clippings were too large to copy and have been removed into Box 14, although they remain in the Clippings series. The folders are arranged alphabetically by subject, then chronologically. They predominantly follow a similar pattern as the series for the collection.</p>

There are six sub-series, arranged alphabetically: Artists, Art Spaces, Journals, Organizations, Politics, Miscellaneous. The Artists sub-series contains an alphabetical arrangement of resumes and biographies of various artists, predominantly from the Houston area and involved with the HWCA.

The Organizations sub-series contains fliers, brochures, and other information about different artists’ groups or organizations supporting the arts. The Politics sub-series includes information on different political issues and candidates involving women and the arts.

<p>Although the Women's Assembly founded Brigid's Place in 1996, the papers in ththe processed portion of this collection span from 1974 to 2011. Some research items date to the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original accession of papers arrived in five boxes, which split naturally into the two categories of the Women's Assembly and Brigid's Place. The papers were arranged topically and chronologically.</p>
<p>The largest portion of the papers concern the Women's Assembly and Brigid's Place, which are the first two series of the collection. Because the activities of the Women's Assembly quickly became synonymous with Brigid's Place, the papers of the Assembly are included with Brigid's Place beginning with 1996, the year of its foundation. Therefore, the papers relating to the Women's Assembly from 1993 through 1995 were placed in the Women's Assembly series. All papers from 1996 on are in the Brigid's Place series; however, researchers may note some overlap with 1996, and should check both series for complete documentation. These two series contain administrative records; agendas, minutes, notes and fliers for the Rotating Circle and Small Groups; the records of activities, speakers, and ministries for both organizations; and publications.</p>
<p>Papers filed throughout the collection, but which did not directly relate to the functioning and activities of either Brigid's Place or the Women's Assembly, are arranged into two more series: Christ Church, and Other Related Information. The Christ Church series contains various newsletters, minutes, and documents relating to the Christ Church Cathedral, and to other organizations associated with the parish. Other Related Information contains information regarding other religious and women's organization not directly tied to Christ Church, as well as various research materials. The current organization is primarily topical by series and sub-series, and is either topical or chronological within the sub-series.</p>
<p>Two additional boxes of materials were acquired in 2013 and have not yet been processed. These are currently described as Series 5, but may later be integrated with other series once processed.</p>

<p>Brigid's Place contains the papers relating to the administration and activities of the women's center at Christ Church Cathedral, beginning in January 1996 and continuing through 1999. This series is divided into eight sub-series: Administration, Rotating Circle, Small Groups, Ministries, Activities, Speakers, Labyrinth, and Publications. The Administration sub-series contains the documentation for the creation and organization of Brigid's Place, as well as some financial records, correspondence, and information regarding its board of directors. The folders are arranged alphabetically by subject. The Rotating Circle and the Small Groups sub-series include agendas, minutes, notes, and fliers for the Rotating Circle administrative committee and for the various topical committees of Brigid's Place. The Rotating Circle folders are arranged chronologically, while the Small Groups folders are arranged alphabetically by group name. The Ministries sub-series contains similar information, as well as descriptions and plans for the different outreach programs associated with Brigid's Place. Those folders are arranged chronologically. The Activities and the Speakers sub-series include the plans, budgets, attendance records, fliers, and brochures for various liturgical events, workshops, retreats, and educational lectures sponsored by Brigid's Place. The sub-series are arranged chronologically. Information regarding the research and execution of the Labyrinth, a major project of Brigid's Place in conjunction with other Houston area religious organizations during 1997, is contained in the Labyrinth sub-series. The Publications sub-series contains The Women's Journal newsletter, and Lenten Meditations, a group of prayers for women during the season of Lent.</p>

<p>The sub-series for the Women's Assembly are nearly identical to those of Brigid's Place: Administration, Rotating Circle, Small Groups, Ministries, Activities, Speakers, and Publications. The materials are dated 1993-1996. Because Brigid's Place is an extension of the Women's Assembly, the duplicated sub-series contain the same types of papers that are included in Brigid's Place, and follow the same arrangement.</p>

<p>The Christ Church sub-series and folders contain papers relating to Christ Church Cathedral and its other organizations for the years 1985 through 1999. The folders in this series are arranged alphabetically by topic: Administration, Cathedral Organizations, Cathedral Bulletin, Events, and Miscellaneous. The Administration folders are arranged alphabetically, and contain church policies, brochures, parish reports and plans of action. The Cathedral Organizations includes minutes, information, and fliers concerning Christ Church organizations other than the Women's Assembly or Brigid's Place. The folders are arranged alphabetically. The two Cathedral Bulletin folders contain an incomplete set of newsletters for the Cathedral from 1992-1999. The Events folder contains fliers for various church functions.

<p>The Other Related Information series contains papers not directly related to Christ Church Cathedral, the Women's Assembly, or Brigid's Place, dated 1986 through 1999. Four sub-series are found in the Other Related Information series: Organizations, Conferences/Events, Research, and Printed Materials. The Organizations sub-series folders are arranged into two groups: Women's and Religious. Women's Organizations include both secular and religious groups focusing primarily on women. Religious Organizations include only religious groups that have no particular gender association. The folders in the two Organizations groups are arranged alphabetically. The Conferences/Events sub-series includes programs and information for conferences or similar events that were not sponsored by Christ Church, the Women's Assembly, or Brigid's Place. These folders are arranged alphabetically. The Research sub-series contains clippings, papers, notes, brochures and publications relating to the various issues that concerned the women of Brigid's Place. These folders are arranged alphabetically by topic. All of the material in the Other Related Information series provides context for the different activities, networking, and ideas that influenced the creation and functioning of Brigid's Place. The oversized box contains three issues of New York Times Magazine, January and April 1990, and June 1993; three issues of the Texas Episcopalian, September 1996, and March and May 1999. The box also contains one page from the April 1995 Texas Episcopalian, and ten sheets of butcher paper with notes written on them.</p>

<p>The collection arrived in little discernable order and the processor in consultation with the archivist has imposed an order. The collection is arranged primarily in chronological order and is divided into five series. Series two, three and four are based upon chronological and geographical divisions in Stewart's life: Pre-West Virginia University, West Virginia University, and Houston.

The series is divided into four sub-series, which are arranged chronologically: Correspondence, Miscellaneous, Social Work Practice, and Booklets. The sub-series Social Work Practice contains papers relating to Stewart's work at various public and private social welfare agencies and hospitals. Notes relating to therapy sessions with particular groups comprise the majority of the material in this sub-series. The sub-series Booklets contains assorted booklets, including reports, studies, journals, and brochures about hospitals and clinics. Some of the booklets do not pertain to social work, but have been included in this sub-series because of their date. The sub-series Miscellaneous contains information about Stewart's military service, and a copy of her master's thesis.</p>

<p>This series contains sixty-one folders dating from 1964 to 1975, and it includes materials concerning Stewart's employment at West Virginia University. This series is divided into seven sub-series: Correspondence, Administrative, Classes, Fieldwork, Academic Papers, Booklets, and Social Work Practice. All of the sub-series have been arranged chronologically, except Classes and Academic Papers. The sub-series Classes is arranged by the course number of the class rather than chronologically, which is how Stewart had this material organized. Some of the folders contain information on a particular class from different semesters, years, or institutions. This material was kept together because Stewart organized it that way; she appears to have used the same teaching materials year after year. The Academic Papers sub-series contains papers written by professors and students and is arranged alphabetically by author.</p>

<p>This series contains 149 folders dating from 1975 to 1990, and it concerns Stewart's time in Houston. The series is divided into nine sub-series, which are arranged chronologically: National Association of Social Workers; National Association of Social Workers, Chapters; Council on Social Work Education; Women's Movement; United States Commission on Civil Rights; Social Work Practice; Gay/Lesbian Issues; Booklets; and Miscellaneous/Personal. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) is an organization with which Stewart was heavily involved in the 1980s. Although some of the NASW material dates from before Stewart moved to Houston, it has been placed in this series in order to keep it with other NASW items. The same applies to the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). At times, NASW and CSWE mailed out envelopes of information; the dates of material in each envelope varied and often included some things with dates up to one year old. The majority of these materials were still in their original envelopes from NASW and CSWE when Stewart's papers entered the archives. Despite the variety of dates, the material from each envelope has been kept together as originally compiled and sent. The date on each folder refers to the postmarked date on the envelope. Most of these mailings concern gay/lesbian issues. Other sub-series contain material on the women's movement, in which Stewart was involved, as well as items concerning social work practice.</p>

<p>To raise the funds needed to support the goals of the Women's Fund, organizers
established an Annual Benefit Luncheon in 1983, with humorist Erma Bombeck as the
first featured speaker. Bombeck's charisma and the labors of Women's Fund volunteers
drew 1,046 attendees and netted the organization nearly $25,000. Every year since, the
Annual Benefit Luncheons and celebrities such as David Eisenhower, John Bradshaw, Ann
Richards, and Liz Carpenter help raise money for the Women's Fund's education and
outreach programs. Demonstrating remarkable fundraising skill, the Women's Fund
invited Florence Henderson as the featured speaker in 2001, resulting in $150,000 net
profit. Annual benefit materials were in good chronological order when received by the
archives, but considerations for easy access and the volume of documents required
imposing parallel subdivisions for each benefit year to create consistency among the
events. The amount of material in some categories required splitting the materials
chronologically into more than one folder.</p>

<p>Contained within the Membership Coffees subseries are event arrangements, hosts, and
speakers for the coffees that the Women's Fund established to solicit, reward, and
inform members about salient issues in women's health and medicine. Held at a member's
home, these coffees offered information on women's health not generally discussed in
public at the time that the Women's Fund was established. These events were an
opportunity for women who volunteered in many organizations around Houston to afford
themselves some time dedicated to women's concerns. Membership coffees were the site
of announcements for annual grant awards that supported research and education
projects. Documents related to the coffees are arranged chronologically.</p>

<p>Outreach Events were organized to fill niches of need in the Women's Fund
programming. Women's and Girls' Health Day offered a day-long venue of health and
wellness programming, including presentations, posters, free consultations with health
care educators. Additionally, it offered opportunities for hundreds of Houston area
students to compete for cash prizes and college scholarships. A Denim Affair honored a
previous benefit luncheon presenter, Janice Woods Windle, on the occasion of the
televising of her novel, True Women. The event also served as a fundraiser for the
Women's Fund. A celebration luncheon to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
organization was held in 1999. Corporate members and sponsors, individual members and
other health-affiliated organizations joined to celebrate 20 years of contribution,
education, and progress toward women's issues.</p>

<p>The Granting Process Series includes all the documents related to the process of
announcing, reviewing, and awarding grants for medical and educational research. In
1980, the Women's Fund began funding research grants. Funding for those early grants was
modest, but over 18 years, the Women's Fund approved and funded 147 grant applications.
Total expended funds for these dates top $1,000,000. Besides formal medical research,
the organization funded several outreach service programs with far reaching effects.
This series includes three subseries: Grant Administration, Grant Applications, and
Research and Review Committee.</p>

<p>In 1985 the Women's Fund produced a Primer on Women's Health, a free brochure
circulated to inform women throughout the Houston community on women's vital health
issues. Revised every two years, the Primer promotes the latest in health maintenance
information. To date, the Women's Fund, with the help of generous sponsors, has
distributed 232,500 copies of the English edition to agencies, corporations, schools,
churches, and hospitals. To reach a broader representation of the Houston community,
the Women's Fund produced a Primer in Spanish in 1987 and since then the Women's Fund

<p>This series contains information related to Holly Hall, a non-profit retirement community in Houston. In 1949, CWU in Houston proposed building a retirement home. By the next year, the project had grown to the extent that CWU in Houston was no longer able to financially sponsor the home, and in 1951 that task was relegated to the Holly Hall Board of Directors. However, Church Women United in Houston continued to act as Holly Hall's spiritual sponsor; CWU in Houston raised over $12,000 in 1951 for the project, and several CWU officers served on the Board of Directors of Holly Hall. Ground was broken and a cornerstone laid in 1951, and the home opened in 1952. For more information, please visit the Holly Hall web site at www.hollyhall.org.</p>

department as well as newsletters published by the Women's Studies and Friends of
Women's Studies and various ephemera and memorabilia. The bulk of the papers are dated

recent papers include invitations to events organized by the Friends of Women's Studies,
such as the annual Table Talk luncheon and other events sponsored by the Friends of

<p>The records are arranged chronologically and divided into series by year, although the
first series contains the records from the first 3 years of the UH Women's Studies due
to a paucity of documents. Subsequent series correspond to a single year of operation.
This chronological arrangement is intended to continue expanding as more materials from
UH Women's Studies and the Friends of Women's Studies become available. Each series is

<p>The FCC requires broadcasters to produce a daily program log on all their broadcasts.
If they were to find any variations to the broadcast schedule, they are to produce a
document called the Discrepancy Report. The original log is updated with that
information to produce an 'As-Run Log.' The FCC no longer requires broadcasters to
maintain a hard copy of the 'As-Run Log,' as long as they have an electronic
version.</p>

<p>Jim Fisher worked as volunteer and part-time employee for KUHT during 1983-1991, and
worked with Bob Cozens throughout that time. He became full-time in 1991, and assisted
in the post-production, and editing of film and video projects. In the late 80s he
became the station's Development Producer, the fourth person to hold that position. The
job involved producing a number of the station's special projects. A short time later
the Development Producer's position was combined with the Promotion group to form the
station's first Creative Services Department, also temporarily referred to as Department
X. Jim was the first supervisor of the Creative Services Department, and after two years
he left that department and became the Senior Producer of Special Projects. Most of
Jim's productions now deal with a historical aspect; he is referred to as the "go-to
guy" for all things involving KUHT archival holdings. These are Jim Fisher's working
production files.</p>

<p>On February 23, 1965, forty school administrators met to discuss the Gulf Region
Educational Television Affiliates known as "GRETA." GRETA was an organization designed
to offer educational television to various school districts. A board of school
administrators governed the organization. Through the cooperation of school
administrators, teachers, and Channel 8 personnel, programs were developed into the
school curriculum. In his book, Public Television America's First Station, William Hawes
noted, "GRETA materials were primarily considered supplementary to classroom
instruction, although in some cases they were dominant." By 1977, GRETA broadcast
in-school programming to sixty area school districts.</p>
