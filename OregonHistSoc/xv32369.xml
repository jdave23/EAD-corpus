      <p>Donald (Don) Bruce Hobart was born in Hell Canyon country in November
		  6, 1918. He later moved to Spokane, WA with his parents. </p>
      <p>December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed by the
		  Japanese, Hobart enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He flew P-40s and P-51s as
		  part of the Flying Tigers in China, earning a Purple Heart among other medals.
		  He was shot down and hiked 300 miles to safety in 32 days with the help of the
		  Chinese underground. </p>
      <p>After the war, Hobart joined the fire department and owned an archery
		  shop in St. John, Oregon. He married Delores “Dot” Andrews in 1943; they were
		  together for 56 years before she died in a traffic accident in 1998. Hobart had
		  three children: Michael, born in 1945; Patricia, 1947; and Douglas, 1948. </p>
      <p>Partnering with Rudy Lachenmeir, owner of Fishing and Hunting News,
		  during the 1950s, Hobart travelled around Oregon shooting and narrating films
		  for KGW. </p>
      <p>In the 1960s, Hobart started his own film company, launching with two
		  full-length feature films focusing on Alaskan wildlife. These films evolved
		  into his series “High and Wild.” “High and Wild” was amongst the first outdoor
		  shows to air, starting on Portland’s KGW (8) and later on KPTV (12). Episodes
		  primarily covered Oregon, Washington, Alaska, California, Idaho, and Montana as
		  well as parts of Canada including British Columbia. </p>
      <p>Hobart’s subsequent series “Wild World of People” focused on the much
		  the same region of “High and Wild” but with a focus on the unique people and
		  events within the area, often using materials initially shot during “High and
		  Wild.” Footage from “Wild World of People” was bought by the producers of the
		  national show “Real People” who then incorporated some of its footage. </p>
      <p>Hobart spent his later life living with his son Doug and
		  daughter-in-law Sue in Scappoose, OR. Hobart died March 19, 2012, at age 95.

      <p>The collection includes 52 episodes of Hobart’s wildlife series “High
		  &amp; Wild” and 26 episodes of his series “Wild World of People” focusing on

		  also include films such as “Hood River Story,” “Wemme Fire Test,” “Trout
		  Unlimited,” and “The Way to the Top,” focusing on skiing at Timberline Lodge.
		  Other gems include a safety and education film "Prudence en Motoneige"

		  Gifford Pinchot National Forest, frontier reenactments and shooting contests,
		  demolition explosions, a wedding home video, Alaskan hunting trips, man-made
		  forest brush burning, and reels of fish and wildlife adventures. Each can
