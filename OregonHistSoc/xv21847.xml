      <p>The albums in this collection were individually designated as Album 612 and Album 626 by the Oregon Historical Society Research Library. In February 2024, the two albums were reprocessed and cataloged together as a single collection under a new collection number, Org. Lot 1435.Â The collection was previously titled "Hollywood place" and cataloged as Album 612. Album 626 had not previously been cataloged.</p>

      <p>Collection consists of two copies of a photograph album, both with the text "Hollywood Place / August 1922" printed on the cover in gold. The albums were designated as Album 612 and Album 626 by the Oregon Historical Society Research Library. The albums each contain the same five black and white photographs of the grounds, plantings, and landscaping at a residence, possibly the W. C. Holman residence on SW Riverside in the Dunthorpe area, south of Portland, Oregon. The house is partially visible in some images. Album 626 also contains four additional loose black and white prints, which are the same size and style as the bound photographs, and have the following text stamped on the back: "E. Thayer / 165 1/2 Third Street / Phone ATwater 2731." The loose prints depict more scenes of plantings and grounds, including a dirt tennis court. </p>
      <p>Album 612 is also accompanied by a smaller loose print, location unidentified, depicting a dirt road or trail in a forest. The relationship between the loose print and the album, if any, is unknown.</p>
