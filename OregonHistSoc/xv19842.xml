      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>James Boyce Montgomery was a railroad contractor who grew wealthy
		  through construction projects in the eastern and western U.S. Born near
		  Harrisburg, Penn., in 1832, he worked first as a journalist, eventually
		  becoming editor and publisher of the Pittsburgh 
	 <title render="italic">Morning Post</title>. He moved on to railroad
	 construction in the late 1850s and built bridges and rail lines in Pennsylvania
	 and vicinity in the following decade. He served on the boards of many railroad
	 companies and purchased a portion of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. He
	 moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1870 and constructed portions of the Northern
	 Pacific Railroad, travelling to Europe to raise capital and obtain materials.
	 In addition he organized other enterprises, such as the dredging of the
	 Columbia River channel and construction of docks in the Portland area. He was
	 also an influential figure in Republican party circles, although his only major
	 public office was that of Multnomah County representative to the Oregon
	 legislature, to which he was elected in 1890.</p>
      <p>In 1861 Montgomery married Rachael Anthony and the couple had one son,
		  Henry Moorhead Montgomery (1863-1932). After Rachael's death in 1863, James
		  Montgomery married Mary S. Phelps in 1866. She came from a prominent Missouri
		  family and was the daughter of John Smith Phelps, who served as the governor of
		  the state from 1877 to 1886. Mary Phelps Montgomery (1846-1943) led a strenuous
		  and long life filled with travels, social activities, and active club work. She
		  served as hostess for her father during his gubernatorial term in Missouri;
		  lived in Berlin in the late 1880s and at later periods; served on the Board of
		  Lady Managers for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis;
		  organized the Portland chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and
		  Colonial Dames of America; travelled extensively; befriended famous people,
		  such as President Ulysses S. Grant; and managed her husband's financial affairs
		  after his death in 1900. Among her seven children were: Mary Montgomery Talbot,
		  Antoinette Montgomery Frissel (b. 1871), Phelps Montgomery (b. 1872), Eliza
		  Montgomery (b. 1874), Constance Montgomery Burrell (b. 1875), Russell
		  Montgomery (1877-1900); and Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum (b. 1887).</p>
      <p>Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum pursued a literary career and wrote essays,
		  plays and novels. She lived much of her youth in Europe and had a brief love
		  affair around 1912 with an Italian nobleman, Adolfo de Bosis. In 1914 she
		  married a U.S. naval officer, Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum II, who was stationed in
		  London and later became the commandant of the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola,
		  Florida. The two travelled throughout Europe and the Middle East and settled
		  eventually near Tryon, North Carolina, in the late 1930s. Among their children
		  were Wilfrid Zogbaum (1915-1965), an artist and musician, David Zogbaum, and
		  Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum III (called "Fair").</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The collection provides a sampling of personal papers from three
		  generations of a wealthy American family. Although the materials probably
		  represent only a small percentage of the family's output, they are filled with
		  great detail and vivid descriptions. The writing in the letters and diaries is
		  well composed and fairly legible throughout.</p>
      <p>The correspondence between James and Mary Montgomery, which dates from
		  the late 1870s to the late 1890s, provides details of their family life, their
		  social engagements, their travels, and their observations on current events.
		  James's letters contain some information about contemporary politics and his
		  business ventures, although most of the writing is family-oriented.</p>
      <p>A large file of letters from Adolfo de Bosis to Margaret Montgomery date
		  from 1912 and contain often extravagant declarations of love. Most are written
		  in Italian. One letter from Margaret to Adolfo is included as well, and this is
		  possibly a draft of her final communication with him. A file of letters from
		  Margaret to her friend Lady Johnstone give Margaret's own emotional account of
		  the affair with de Bosis. Additional letters are from other family members and
		  friends, including Margaret's sons Wilfrid and Rufus, and her husband. Of
		  particular interest is a bound set of letters written by Margaret to her mother
		  from Europe and elsewhere. Titled "Letters of Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum.
		  London, Paris, Ragusa, Zagreb, Constantinope, Hawaii," the letters date from
		  1913 to 1929 and are packed with details of travels, children, and daily life.
		  Additional letters from Margaret to her mother, unbound, are also of the same
		  nature.</p>
      <p>Most of the diaries in the collection were written by Mary Phelps
		  Montgomery and date mainly from the 1890s through the 1910s. They contain
		  details of her active social life, her travels across the U.S. and Europe, her
		  work for the Daughters of the American Revolution, and her activities relating
		  to the St. Louis Exposition of 1904. She mentions meetings with prominent
		  political figures, friendships with German nobility in Berlin, and visits to
		  the White House, among many other topics. Also included are some entries
		  written in Portland, with mention of people prominent in local society. Two
		  diaries of Mary's daughter Margaret Zogbaum provide details of her travels in
		  Europe and the Middle East with her husband and children. Her writing is highly
		  descriptive and vivid.</p>
