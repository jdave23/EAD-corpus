      <head>Biography of Julia Ruuttila:</head>
      <p>Julia Ruuttila (1907-1991) was born in Eugene, Oregon, to John and Ella
		  Godman, who were labor and women's suffrage activists. She grew up in logging
		  camps and on a farm, as well as in Eugene. After one short-lived early marriage
		  to William Bowen, Julia attended the University of Oregon during the 1925-1926
		  school year and then married Maurice "Butch" Bertram and had her only child,
		  Michael Jack, in 1928. After living in California, Oregon, Denver and Chicago,
		  the Bertrams returned to Oregon in early 1929. Butch worked at the West Oregon
		  lumber mill in Linnton, and Julia bought a typewriter. In 1943, Julia divorced
		  Butch and married Ben Eaton, a seaman. That marriage lasted until 1946. She
		  married Oscar Ruuttila in 1951, and they lived in Astoria, Oregon, until his
		  sudden death from a heart attack in 1962. They had no children but raised
		  Julia's grandson, Shane McDonald.</p>
      <p>Julia's labor activism included organizing for the woodworkers' union,
		  and she was instrumental in organizing women's auxiliaries of the woodworkers'
		  and longshoremen's unions. In 1936, Julia created the Free Ray Becker Committee
		  to obtain the release of the last IWW prisoner from the Centralia, Washington,
		  tragedy of 1919. She became a lifelong activist on behalf of workers, for
		  peace, and against racial prejudice and political repression, forming many
		  committees and participating in many protests.</p>
      <p>Although she wrote poetry, novels, and stories, Julia became best known
		  for her journalism. She wrote for union papers, <emph render="italic">The
		  Timber Worker</emph> (International Woodworkers of America) and the
		  <emph render="italic">Dispatcher</emph> (International Longshoremen's and
		  Warehousemen's Union); the <emph render="italic">People's</emph> W<emph render="italic">orld</emph>; and for Federated Press, a news service. She wrote
		  under several names: Julia Godman, Julia Bertram, Julia Eaton, and Julia
		  Ruuttila, as well as pen names, Kathleen Cronin and Kathleen Ruuttila.</p>
      <p>After World War II, Julia worked as a secretary for the State Public
		  Welfare Commission before being dismissed for her writing and political
		  activities. She then worked as a secretary for the Longshoremen's Union and
		  fishermen's unions. In 1956, she was subpoenaed to testify at the House
		  Un-American Activities Committee hearings in Seattle, Washington, based in part
		  on her participation in the Oregon Committee for Protection of the Foreign
		  Born. She had been the subject of FBI surveillance since the early 1940s.</p>
      <p>Julia continued her journalism and activism into old age and spent much
		  of 1970 doing interviews and research on Louise Bryant for Virginia Gardner,
		  who published <emph render="italic">Friend and Lover: The Life of Louise
		  Bryant</emph> in 1982. Ill health forced Julia to move to the Marshall Union
		  Manor, a union-operated retirement home, in 1976. Soon, she was editing the
		  Manor's newsletter. Julia became a historical resource herself, frequently
		  speaking to high school and college classes and organizations on labor, civil
		  rights, and women's history. She spent the last years of her life with her
		  grandson, Shane, and his family in Anchorage, Alaska, where she continued to
		  participate in committees and protests.</p>
      <p>NOTE: <emph render="italic">Sticking to the Union</emph>:
		  <emph render="italic">An Oral History of the Life and Times of Julia
		  Ruuttila</emph> by Sandy Polishuk provides a full account of Julia's life, much
		  of it in her own words.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The Julia Ruuttila Papers consist of correspondence, ephemera, legal
		  papers, interview transcripts and reports, manuscripts, published materials,
		  and her FBI File, which was obtained by her biographer, Sandy Polishuk, under
		  the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
      <p>Correspondence, manuscripts, and published materials do not represent
		  her full output but provide a good sampling of her career as a journalist and
		  writer and of her wide-ranging activities on behalf of labor, civil rights, and
		  peace movements protesting the Vietnam and Gulf wars. The collection also
		  reflects her research contributions to a biography of Louise Bryant,
		  <emph render="italic">Friend and Lover</emph>, by Virginia Gardner.</p>
      <p>Much of the collection is original materials, but it also includes
		  photocopied materials. A few of these were collected by Julia Ruuttila in the
		  course of her work, but most of the photocopies, including family
		  correspondence, were collected by Sandy Polishuk.</p>
      <p>The collection includes Julia's own contributions to the history of
		  labor, civil rights, and peace movements as reflected in her correspondence,
		  manuscripts, and published materials. Although most of her published work is
		  journalistic in nature, the collection reflects her love of writing poetry and
		  includes an unpublished novel.</p>

      <p>Julia Ruuttila made several donations of papers to the Oregon Historical

          <p>The author, Virginia Gardner, received a Rabinowitz Foundation
					 grant for reseach into Louise Bryant's background and youth. She arranged for
					 Julia Ruuttila to conduct interviews and do other research for the Oregon
					 portion of this work, beginning in 1970. In the course of this research,
					 Gardner and Ruuttila corresponded, and Gardner sent Julia copies of
					 correspondence from others on background. The book, <emph render="italic">Friend and Lover: The Life of Louise Bryant</emph>, was
					 published in 1982. The series is organized into three subseries: 1) Virginia
					 Gardner, 2) Julia Ruuttila, and 3) California and Nevada Research. It includes
					 correspondence, interview notes and transcripts, manuscript, research materials
					 (dates given are dates of materials, not dates they were collected), and book

          <p>The FBI placed Julia under surveillance beginning in 1941 as a
					 suspected subversive. With Julia's permission, Sandy Polishuk requested
					 Ruuttila's FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act in January 1990.
					 However, the files did not arrive until more than a year after Julia's death.
					 The FBI provided about 500 pages of the total 1,236 pages in Ruuttila's file.
					 Some of the pages are photocopies of her published writings, some are copies of
					 newspaper articles covering her activities, but most are reports and memos.
					 These include annual reports, lists of participants in demonstrations, and
					 narrative reports of organizations and activities. Much detail is blacked out.
					 Some files are from Headquarters (HQ) and some from the Portland District
					 office (PD). They are arranged in that order.</p>
