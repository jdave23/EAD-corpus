      <head>Biography of Porter W. Yett:</head>
      <p>Porter W. Yett was born in Tennessee in 1892, and came to Portland with
		  his family while still a young child. In 1911, at the age of 19, he joined with
		  William D. Wheelwright and Sanderson Reed to form the City Motor Trucking
		  Company, delivering paving materials to construction projects around Portland.
		  Mr. Yett was the manager of the company. In 1927, while continuing to operate
		  City Motor Trucking, he became interested in transit concrete mixers, trucks
		  which mixed concrete while they were en route to the construction site. The
		  following year he was one of the founders of Swigert, Hart &amp; Yett Company
		  which specialized in concrete mixing and delivery. He made several improvements
		  to the trucks over the years. An active athlete and outdoorsman, he was
		  involved in baseball, boxing, football, fishing and hunting. He died in
		  1962.</p>
