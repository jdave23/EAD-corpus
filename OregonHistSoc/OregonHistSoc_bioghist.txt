He worked as a civil engineer and a draftsman before becoming a Presbyterian minister in 1892. In 1894, when Reverend George Ross of the Presbyterian church in Tualatin Plains (known as the Old Scotch Church) died, Dierdorff was appointed as his replacement. Later that same year, he married Ross's daughter, Emma Ross (1870-1960). The couple had three sons: Ross Ainsworth Dierdorff (1896-1964), William Henry Dierdorff (1898-1975), and John Dierdorff (1899-1989).

was to enforce fishing regulations and the 1848 Territorial Constitution to
ensure the conservation of salmon runs. Under the direction of Hollister

wildlife from exploitative hunting. Since then, the ODFW has enforced

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The first Fred Meyer grocery store opened in downtown Portland, Oregon
in 1922. The store's founder, Fred G. Meyer, opened more stores in downtown
Portland in the 1920s and 1930s, then expanded into the outlying areas of
Portland and beyond. By the 1990s there were stores bearing the Fred Meyer name
throughout Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Arizona and
Alaska. In addition to the supermarket stores, Fred Meyer, Inc. also included
jewelry stores, restaurants, federal savings and loan banks, print shops,
bakeries, dairies and music stores.</p>
<p>Fred G. Meyer pioneered the concept of one-stop shopping, the idea
that all household goods could be purchased at one store. At Fred Meyer stores,
customers could buy groceries, clothing, auto supplies, furniture, appliances,
hardware, garden supplies and more. Fred Meyer was also among the first to
develop self-serve drug stores at a time when all pharmaceutical products had
to be purchased through a pharmacist. Fred Meyer stores are also known for
their advertising slogan, "My-Te-Fine," which was also the name of the in-house
brand of packaged foods. </p>
<p>In the 1960s through the 1990s, Fred Meyer, Inc. expanded by acquiring
many smaller grocery store chains throughout the West including Marketime and
QFC in Washington, B&amp;B Stores in Montana, Grand Central and Smith's Food
and Drug in Utah, Valu-Mart in Alaska and Smitty's Marketplace in Arizona. In
1999, Fred Meyer, Inc. merged with Kroger, Inc., making the combined company
the largest grocery store chain in the country.</p>
<p>Fred G. Meyer was born Frederick Grubmeyer in 1886 in Brooklyn, New
York. He moved West in the 1900s starting in Alaska and eventually making his
way to Portland, Oregon. He married Eva Chatfield Chiles who would become his
business partner and the inspiration behind Eve's Restaurants which were coffee
shops attached to many Fred Meyer stores. Fred G. Meyer died in 1978 at the age
of 92. His will established a charitable trust to create a philanthropic
organization now known as the Meyer Memorial Trust which is now one of the
largest private foundations in the nation.</p>

<p>The Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, also referred to as Oregonship, was the largest of three shipyards established in the Pacific Northwest by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser during World War II. The shipyard opened in 1941 and was located on the Willamette River near the St. Johns neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It initially built merchant ships for the British government, then began to produce them for the U.S. Maritime Commission. The first Northwest-built Liberty ship, a type of vessel used to transport troops and cargo, launched from the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation on September 27, 1941. Over the course of the war, the shipyard built 330 Liberty ships, as well as Victory ships and attack transports. The shipyard ceased operations shortly after the end of World War II.</p>

William D. Wheelwright and Sanderson Reed to form the City Motor Trucking
Company, delivering paving materials to construction projects around Portland.
Mr. Yett was the manager of the company. In 1927, while continuing to operate
City Motor Trucking, he became interested in transit concrete mixers, trucks
which mixed concrete while they were en route to the construction site. The
following year he was one of the founders of Swigert, Hart &amp; Yett Company
which specialized in concrete mixing and delivery. He made several improvements
to the trucks over the years. An active athlete and outdoorsman, he was
involved in baseball, boxing, football, fishing and hunting. He died in

<p>The Oregonian was founded as a weekly paper in 1850 by William W.
Chapman, Stephen Coffin, and Thomas Jefferson Dryer. Despite his first name,
Dryer was a Whig, and later a Republican; these leanings would have a lasting
effect on the paper's editorial stance.</p>
<p>In 1860, Dryer left Portland to campaign on behalf of Abraham Lincoln,
leaving the English-born Henry L. Pittock in charge of the paper. The following
year, Pittock began publishing the Oregonian as a daily newspaper. In 1865,
Pittock hired Harvey W. Scott to be editor of the paper. Scott remained editor
until his death in 1910, with the exception of the years 1872-1877, when W.
Lair Hill was editor. Notable editors and publishers of the Oregonian since
Pittock and Scott have included Palmer Hoyt, Ronald G. Callvert, Ben Hur
Lampman, Michael J. Frey, Robert Notson, J. Richard Nokes, and Fred

and format of the paper as a means of modernizing it. Publishing mogul Samuel

<p>James Boyce Montgomery was a railroad contractor who grew wealthy
through construction projects in the eastern and western U.S. Born near
Harrisburg, Penn., in 1832, he worked first as a journalist, eventually
becoming editor and publisher of the Pittsburgh
<title render="italic">Morning Post</title>. He moved on to railroad
construction in the late 1850s and built bridges and rail lines in Pennsylvania
and vicinity in the following decade. He served on the boards of many railroad
companies and purchased a portion of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. He
moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1870 and constructed portions of the Northern
Pacific Railroad, travelling to Europe to raise capital and obtain materials.
In addition he organized other enterprises, such as the dredging of the
Columbia River channel and construction of docks in the Portland area. He was
also an influential figure in Republican party circles, although his only major
public office was that of Multnomah County representative to the Oregon
legislature, to which he was elected in 1890.</p>
<p>In 1861 Montgomery married Rachael Anthony and the couple had one son,
Henry Moorhead Montgomery (1863-1932). After Rachael's death in 1863, James
Montgomery married Mary S. Phelps in 1866. She came from a prominent Missouri
family and was the daughter of John Smith Phelps, who served as the governor of
the state from 1877 to 1886. Mary Phelps Montgomery (1846-1943) led a strenuous
and long life filled with travels, social activities, and active club work. She
served as hostess for her father during his gubernatorial term in Missouri;
lived in Berlin in the late 1880s and at later periods; served on the Board of
Lady Managers for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis;
organized the Portland chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and
Colonial Dames of America; travelled extensively; befriended famous people,
such as President Ulysses S. Grant; and managed her husband's financial affairs
after his death in 1900. Among her seven children were: Mary Montgomery Talbot,
Antoinette Montgomery Frissel (b. 1871), Phelps Montgomery (b. 1872), Eliza
Montgomery (b. 1874), Constance Montgomery Burrell (b. 1875), Russell
Montgomery (1877-1900); and Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum (b. 1887).</p>
<p>Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum pursued a literary career and wrote essays,
plays and novels. She lived much of her youth in Europe and had a brief love
affair around 1912 with an Italian nobleman, Adolfo de Bosis. In 1914 she
married a U.S. naval officer, Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum II, who was stationed in
London and later became the commandant of the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola,
Florida. The two travelled throughout Europe and the Middle East and settled
eventually near Tryon, North Carolina, in the late 1930s. Among their children

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Amos Burg (1901-1986) was born in Portland, Or., to Amos Burg, Sr., and
Minerva Ann James Burg (Annie Laurie Burg). Burg, Sr. (1863-1938), immigrated
from Norway in 1877 to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he worked in the laundry
business and married Minerva Ann James in 1889. They and their infant son,
Charles, moved to Portland in 1890, and the senior Burg became part owner of
the City Laundry. In Portland, the couple had seven more children, including
Amos, Jr. The Burgs' longtime family home at 1706 N.E. Dekum Avenue was still
standing as of 2004.</p>
<p>Upon graduation from grammar school in June 1917, Burg persuaded his
parents to let him go to sea as bell boy on the passenger ship,
<title render="italic">Rose City</title>, Portland to San Francisco and Los
Angeles. At the end of the summer, he returned to Portland to start high school
but the call of the sea was so strong that he returned to sea, where during
many voyages in the next several years, he continued his education using the
<title>Encyclopaedia Britannica</title>. This whetted his appetite for more
learning, so between voyages, he completed a college preparatory course at the
Oregon Institute of Technology and then enrolled in science, photography, and
journalism courses at the University of Oregon (Eugene) and Oregon State
College (now Oregon State University, Corvallis) between adventures
(1926-1929), although he never earned a degree. He helped to finance his
education and adventures by using his sea voyages as an opportunity to earn
some money importing Oriental rug, silks, and pearls.</p>
<p>Burg was heralded for making the first complete canoe voyage on the
Columbia River from its headwaters in Columbia Lake, B.C., to the Pacific Oct.
20, 1924-Jan. 7, 1925. The newspapers followed his adventure, and this voyage
started his lecture career, as he became a sought-after speaker in Portland and
elsewhere in western Oregon. By 1930, he was becoming a successsful lecturer on
the national circuit with tales of his adventures, illustrated with his own
films and slides, accompanied by narration in his self-depracating witty style.
Burg followed up his Columbia River triumph in the summer of 1925 with a canoe
voyage from the headwaters of the Snake River at Jackson Lake, Wyo., through
Hells Canyon, and down the Columbia River to its mouth. At the Cascades of the
Columbia (site of the Bonneville Dam in 2004), Fox Movietone and International
Newsreel cameramen persuaded Burg to run the cascades in his canoe, which
resulted in International newsreel headlines, "Amos Burg first man to attempt
passage of swirling Columbia waters in frail craft." Well into the 1930s, Burg
continued to make periodic canoe trips on the Columbia, Snake, Yukon and
Northwest Territories rivers, culminating in his 1938 trip to film Buzz
Holmstrom's re-creation of his 1937 one-man trip down the Green and Colorado
rivers. Burg took the first inflatable rubber raft down the Colorado on this
trip, and his film,
<title render="italic">Conquering the Colorado</title> won an Academy Award
nomination for short subjects in 1939.</p>
<p>Burg extended his travels around the world aboard the yacht,
<title render="italic">Camargo</title>, 1931-1932, and followed up in
1933-1934 with a trip in a small boat around Cape Horn. Filmmaking for ERPI and
Encyclopaedia Britannica subsequently took him throughout the western United
States, Central and South America, Alaska, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, Burg settled down in Alaska, working forst for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and then establishing himself with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game, 1955-1974. He established the department's
Information and Education Section and made many films as part of his work. He
also made the Alaska Centennial film,
<title render="italic">Juneau, Alaska's Capital City</title>. He continued
to make many river trips well after his retirement. He died in Alaska in 1985,
and his ashes have since been scattered on many of the rivers he voyaged.</p>

<p>Donald (Don) Bruce Hobart was born in Hell Canyon country in November
6, 1918. He later moved to Spokane, WA with his parents. </p>
<p>December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed by the
Japanese, Hobart enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He flew P-40s and P-51s as
part of the Flying Tigers in China, earning a Purple Heart among other medals.
He was shot down and hiked 300 miles to safety in 32 days with the help of the
Chinese underground. </p>
<p>After the war, Hobart joined the fire department and owned an archery
shop in St. John, Oregon. He married Delores “Dot” Andrews in 1943; they were
together for 56 years before she died in a traffic accident in 1998. Hobart had
three children: Michael, born in 1945; Patricia, 1947; and Douglas, 1948. </p>
<p>Partnering with Rudy Lachenmeir, owner of Fishing and Hunting News,
during the 1950s, Hobart travelled around Oregon shooting and narrating films
for KGW. </p>
<p>In the 1960s, Hobart started his own film company, launching with two
full-length feature films focusing on Alaskan wildlife. These films evolved
into his series “High and Wild.” “High and Wild” was amongst the first outdoor
shows to air, starting on Portland’s KGW (8) and later on KPTV (12). Episodes
primarily covered Oregon, Washington, Alaska, California, Idaho, and Montana as
well as parts of Canada including British Columbia. </p>
<p>Hobart’s subsequent series “Wild World of People” focused on the much
the same region of “High and Wild” but with a focus on the unique people and
events within the area, often using materials initially shot during “High and
Wild.” Footage from “Wild World of People” was bought by the producers of the
national show “Real People” who then incorporated some of its footage. </p>
<p>Hobart spent his later life living with his son Doug and
daughter-in-law Sue in Scappoose, OR. Hobart died March 19, 2012, at age 95.

<p>Ballot Measure 9 on the 1992 general election ballot in Oregon was an
attempt by the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) to amend the Oregon constitution
to prohibit the enactment of laws by the state, counties, or cities that outlaw
discrimination against homosexual or bisexual persons, and to require public
schools in Oregon to teach students that homosexuality was "wrong,"
"unnatural," "perverse," and "abnormal." The Campaign for a Hate Free Oregon
(CHFO) was the organization formed to defeat Measure 9.</p>
<p>On November 3, 1992, after a vigorous campaign attracting national
attention, Measure 9 lost 56.5% - 43.5% -- although the measure carried 21 of
Oregon's 36 counties. The same day, Colorado voted on a measure (Amendment 2)
containing a similar prohibition against the enactment of civil rights laws for
homosexual and bisexual persons. The Colorado measure passed 53% - 47% but was
ultimately found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court on May 20,
1996 in the case
<title render="italic">Romer v. Evans et al.</title> These were the first

<p>Ivan L. Collins (1906-1971) was born in Dufur, Oregon and grew up in
Wasco County. Operatic aspirations led him to Los Angeles in the 1930s. While
in California, in 1935, Collins constructed a "prairie schooner" from a model
kit while recovering from an illness. His dissatisfaction with the model's
authenticity made him realize that correct knowledge about the design and
construction of the entire range of recently "extinct" horse-drawn wagons of
the nineteenth century was in danger of being entirely lost. From the late
1930s through the 1940s, while he earned his living constructing models at
movie studios and as an aircraft mockup builder at Lockheed, Collins devoted
his personal time and resources to researching and constructing wagons. By the
end of the 1940s he had completed about forty wagons and had secured a
publisher for
<title>Horse Power Days</title> (Stanford University Press, 1953 / 388.3
C712h), an illustrated book about his work.</p>
<p>Collins moved his family to Eugene in 1950, where he worked as a
designer for the University of Oregon physical plant. His ongoing avocation of
model wagon building found a home at the University in 1965 when he retired to
half time at the Physical Plant and became director and curator of the
incipient wagon museum. He continued building and researching until his death
in February 1971. Shortly thereafter, his family donated his collection and

built on the same spot in 1871. It was the third church building, though,
located at SW Park and Madison, which would become best known. Completed in
1895 at considerable expense, it was one of few American churches built in the
Venetian Gothic style, and for several decades it was the tallest building in
Portland. This building continued to house the church into the 21st century,
although some of its smaller towers were removed in 1951.</p>

<head>Biography of Julia Ruuttila:</head>
<p>Julia Ruuttila (1907-1991) was born in Eugene, Oregon, to John and Ella
Godman, who were labor and women's suffrage activists. She grew up in logging
camps and on a farm, as well as in Eugene. After one short-lived early marriage
to William Bowen, Julia attended the University of Oregon during the 1925-1926
school year and then married Maurice "Butch" Bertram and had her only child,
Michael Jack, in 1928. After living in California, Oregon, Denver and Chicago,
the Bertrams returned to Oregon in early 1929. Butch worked at the West Oregon
lumber mill in Linnton, and Julia bought a typewriter. In 1943, Julia divorced
Butch and married Ben Eaton, a seaman. That marriage lasted until 1946. She
married Oscar Ruuttila in 1951, and they lived in Astoria, Oregon, until his
sudden death from a heart attack in 1962. They had no children but raised
Julia's grandson, Shane McDonald.</p>
<p>Julia's labor activism included organizing for the woodworkers' union,
and she was instrumental in organizing women's auxiliaries of the woodworkers'
and longshoremen's unions. In 1936, Julia created the Free Ray Becker Committee
to obtain the release of the last IWW prisoner from the Centralia, Washington,
tragedy of 1919. She became a lifelong activist on behalf of workers, for
peace, and against racial prejudice and political repression, forming many
committees and participating in many protests.</p>
<p>Although she wrote poetry, novels, and stories, Julia became best known
for her journalism. She wrote for union papers, <emph render="italic">The
Timber Worker</emph> (International Woodworkers of America) and the
<emph render="italic">Dispatcher</emph> (International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union); the <emph render="italic">People's</emph> W<emph render="italic">orld</emph>; and for Federated Press, a news service. She wrote
under several names: Julia Godman, Julia Bertram, Julia Eaton, and Julia
Ruuttila, as well as pen names, Kathleen Cronin and Kathleen Ruuttila.</p>
<p>After World War II, Julia worked as a secretary for the State Public
Welfare Commission before being dismissed for her writing and political
activities. She then worked as a secretary for the Longshoremen's Union and
fishermen's unions. In 1956, she was subpoenaed to testify at the House
Un-American Activities Committee hearings in Seattle, Washington, based in part
on her participation in the Oregon Committee for Protection of the Foreign
Born. She had been the subject of FBI surveillance since the early 1940s.</p>
<p>Julia continued her journalism and activism into old age and spent much
of 1970 doing interviews and research on Louise Bryant for Virginia Gardner,
who published <emph render="italic">Friend and Lover: The Life of Louise
Bryant</emph> in 1982. Ill health forced Julia to move to the Marshall Union
Manor, a union-operated retirement home, in 1976. Soon, she was editing the
Manor's newsletter. Julia became a historical resource herself, frequently
speaking to high school and college classes and organizations on labor, civil
rights, and women's history. She spent the last years of her life with her
grandson, Shane, and his family in Anchorage, Alaska, where she continued to
participate in committees and protests.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The West Coast Lumber Manufacturers Association was incorporated in
1911 in Centralia, Wash., with the merger of the Pacific Coast Lumber
Manufacturers Association, the Southwest Washington Lumber Manufacturers
Association, and the Oregon and Washington Lumber Manufacturers Association.
The new trade association, headquartered in Tacoma, Wash., represented the
Douglas fir industry, then centered in western Washington. By 1916 the
organization had become the West Coast Lumbermen's Assocation (WCLA), and its
offices moved to Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, the WCLA had become an important representative for
manufacturers of Douglas fir, West Coast hemlock, Western red cedar, and Sitka
spruce wood products. In 1928, Colonel William B. Greeley, former chief of the
U.S. Forest Service, became the Secretary-Manager of the organization. His
reforms brought loggers, wood preservation plants, mill-work plants and other
related branches of the industry together into a stronger association. During
the 1920s and 1930s, the center of lumber production gradually shifted from
Washington to Oregon, and in 1946 the WCLA transferred its headquarters to
Portland, Or.</p>
<p>The WCLA was incorporated under the laws of Washington as a stock
corporation, with member companies each holding one share. Membership in the
association was entirely voluntary. For decades the association was supported
by dues assessed on logs and/or lumber produced by member companies. In 1949,
the WCLA dues structure was changed to one based solely on lumber
production.</p>
<p>The WCLA provided many services to its member companies, one of the
most important being the rationalization of the largely chaotic West Coast
lumber industry during the 1910s and 1920s. As the industry evolved, the
association's activities became more sophisticated, and by the 1950s the WCLA
supported its members in many ways. The Traffic Department negotiated with
railroad, trucking and shipping lines for favorable freight rates. The
Statistical Department produced regular reports about conditions within the
West Coast lumber industry. The Accounting Service assisted member companies
with accounting, cost analysis, and taxation problems. The Promotion Department
produced literature and advertising publications, newspaper and radio spots,
motion pictures, and a membership directory to market the products of the West
Coast lumber industry. The Technical Service Department, staffed by engineers,
conducted research to develop new and improved uses for West Coast lumber
products and produced publications such as the
<title render="italic">Douglas Fir Use Book</title>. The Public Relations
Department produced stories and news releases about the positive impact of the
lumber industry on the economy of the Pacific Northwest and attempted to
counter negative publicity. James Stevens, Public Relations Counsel of the WCLA
and author of stories about the legend of Paul Bunyan, produced hundreds of
issues of
<title render="italic">Out of the Woods</title>, a newspaper column about
conditions within the industry. The Educational Program Department, which was
closely related to Public Relations, provided literature, slides, filmstrips
and motion pictures to schools.</p>
<p>The WCLA worked closely with the National Lumber Manufacturers
Association (NLMA) and other regional and national organizations to advance the
interests of the lumber industry. The West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau
(WCLIB), a separate but closely allied organization to the WCLA, established
standard lumber grading rules, maintained uniform grades, trained and
supervisied mill graders, licensed mills to use official grade stamps, and
issued Certificates of Inspection when requested. The WCLIB concentrated on
rail and truck shipments in the domestic and export markets. Another closely
allied organization, the Industrial Forestry Association (IFA), promoted forest
conservation practices through educational and public relations activities and
served as the certifying agency of the tree farm program in the Douglas fir
region of western Oregon and western Washington.</p>
<p>By the early 1960s, business leaders determined that a stronger
regional association was needed in the face of growing national and
international competition in the lumber industry. In 1964, the West Coast
Lumbermen's Association merged with the Western Pine Association (WPA), a trade
association which represented lumber interests east of the Cascade Mountains in
Oregon, Washington and California. A new organization, the Western Wood
Products Association (WWPA), was formed from this union, and in 1969 the WCLA
was dissolved as a corporation.</p>

<p>Charles A. Lindbergh (1902-1974) learned to fly in 1922 and became
famous five years later when he made the first solo non-stop flight across the
Atlantic Ocean May 20-21, 1927. In July of that year, he began a flying tour of
the United States under the sponsorship of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund. He
reached Portland, Or., Sept. 14, 1927, landing on Swan Island. Two days later
he left for San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 1932, Lindbergh again made headlines when his son was kidnapped and
killed. The media attention during the investigation and trial convinced
Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to move to Europe for several
years. Returning in 1939, Charles Lindbergh became active in the America First
movement opposing U.S. participation in World War II. The movement disbanded
after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. During World War II, he worked with
the Ford Motor Company to convert automobile plants to airplane production. In
1944 he flew many combat missions in the Pacific war, although he was a
civilian.</p>
<p>After the war ended, Lindbergh retired from public life to write and

active in the conservation movement. He died in 1974.</p>

<p>Simeon Gannett Reed was an important figure in the economic development of Portland and Oregon in the late 19th century. He was born in East Abington (now Rockland), Massachusetts, in 1830. After finishing his education at age 15, he worked in a dry goods store in Boston and as a shoe cutter in East Abington. He entered the grain and flour business in Quincy, Massachusetts, and later married Amanda Wood, who was a member of a wealthy and prominent Quincy family. The Reeds came to California in 1852 and soon departed for Oregon. After a number of ventures, Reed became a clerk for the Portland, Oregon, general merchandise firm of W.S. Ladd and Company. He purchased the firm in partnership with William S. Ladd's sons, forming Ladd, Reed and Company in 1859. He invested money in steamship ventures and, in 1860, became a partner with Captain John C. Ainsworth and others in the Oregon Steam and Navigation Company, the principal shipping firm on the Columbia River. In 1879, the company was purchased by railroad magnate Henry Villard and merged with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, and Reed became vice president and manager of the new firm. Reed also invested heavily in railroad, mining, land development, and industrial ventures, including the Oregon Iron and Steel Company at Oswego. Among his mining interests was the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mining &amp; Concentrating Company in Idaho. He took an active interest in livestock breeding and owned the Ladd and Reed Farm Company, along with William S. Ladd. The company possessed large tracts of farm land in the Willamette and Tualatin valleys.</p>
<p>As Reed's health declined, he and Amanda Wood Reed moved from Oregon to Pasadena, California, in 1892. He planned to build a large house there at Carmelita, but died in 1895 before it was completed. Amanda Wood Reed lived in the house until her death in 1904. Reed had wanted the bulk of his estate to be used in establishing a college in Portland; however, after the death of Amanda Wood Reed, the couple's legacy became entangled in litigation. It was only through the efforts of Amanda Wood Reed's nephew, Martin Winch (who had managed the Reeds' finances for many years), that funds were eventually secured for the building of what is now Reed College.</p>

<p>Charles F. Berg Company was first established as Lennon's in Portland,
Or. in 1907 when the San Francisco retailer by that name purchased John
Allesina's Umbrella Store at 309 Morrison Street. Charles F. Berg joined the
firm that same year and moved to Portland to manage the new store. Berg sold
women's specialty items such as umbrellas, gloves, and hosiery at Lennon's
until 1921, when he became sole owner of the Portland store and changed its
name to Charles F. Berg. Shortly thereafter, he expanded the store to include
moderately priced to better women's apparel and opened shops at other downtown
locations. "Who's Your Hosier?" and "Glovingly Yours" became well-known
advertising slogans for the stores. </p>
<p>Forrest Berg joined the staff in 1922 to manage the store's newly
opened Ready-to-Wear Department. At a time when most stores catered to the
"mature woman," he saw a market for younger fashions, and under his direction,
Berg's became a leader in selling apparel in smaller sizes to younger women.
The store formed the first college board in the Pacific Northwest in 1924 and,
in the early 1940s, added high school boards. These students boards, which were
representative of local colleges and high schools, were employed as sales
clerks on alternate Saturdays throughout the year. Board members were also
actively involved in sales promotions such as fashion shows and "Date with Dad"
nights. The 1920s also saw the introduction of the "Chumley" label. Later the
slogan "Chumley Young Fashions" was adopted. </p>
<p>In 1929 Charles Berg leased and significantly renovated in the art
deco style Dolph Building at 614 S.W. Broadway, and in 1930, the store moved to
that location. The building was added to the National Register of Historic
Sites in 1983. In response to the growth of west suburban Portland, Charles F.
Berg, Inc. purchased the Dark Horse store in Beaverton in 1960. Renamed The
Charles F. Berg Dark Horse, the Beaverton store operated with the same
merchandise and took part in the same promotions and employee activities as the
downtown Portland store. Forrest T. Berg sold the company to Rusans, a
Washington clothing chain, in 1975. </p>

<p>Since its founding in 1898, the Oregon Historical Society has
collected ephemera of all kinds, most of it documenting the history of Oregon
and the Pacific Northwest. Around the mid-20th century, librarians at the
Society began organizing these materials into what became known as "Topical
Collections" formed around particular subjects, such as business and education.
One such collection, "Ethnology," served as a catch-all for items related to
population groups that share common ties of ancestry and culture. Often
materials from other collections were separated from the original sources and
added to the Ethnology Collection. Although this practice has since been
discontinued, some materials are still filed in Ethnology if they come from
accessions composed primarily of unrelated ephemera items. "Ethnic groups" are
defined as people who are bound together by common ties of ancestry and
culture.</p>

<p>The Special Righteousness Committee came about in opposition to the
Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) and their 1992 Oregon Ballot Measure 9. This
measure would have amended the Oregon state constitution to define
homosexuality as "abnormal" and "wrong," and would have prevented any
protections of lesbian and gay citizens under state laws. The Special
Righteousness Committee -- whose name was derived from the OCA's slogan "no
special rights" -- used humor and elaborately illustrated graphics to lampoon
the OCA initiative. The group facetiously supported additional constitutional
amendments based on admonishments within the biblical book of Leviticus, such
as "No special rights for oyster eaters."</p>

<p>June D. Drake (the middle initial "D" did not stand for anything) was born in Marquam, Oregon, in 1880 to Charles Wesley Drake and Fannie Aurora Milster Drake. In the fall of 1889, the Drake family moved to Silverton, Oregon, and Charles Drake built the family home at 401 South Water Street. He later owned the Commercial Hotel on Main Street, which was sold in 1891 to hardware store owner Adolf Wolf. Charles Drake also served as mayor of Silverton before his death in 1911.</p>
<p>In 1900, June D. Drake and his brother, Emory Roy Drake, founded their photography business, Drake Bros. Studio, buying out the business of pioneer Silverton photographer William L. Jones. The brothers operated their studio together until 1908, when Emory Drake left to become a music teacher in Sacramento. This studio burned to the ground on March 27, 1908, and thousands of the brothers' original negatives were destroyed. After the fire, members of the Silverton community built June Drake a temporary studio at 311 North Water Street. He operated his business there from April 1908 until September 1911, when he moved into a new studio building at 303 North Water Street. Drake continued his photography there until his retirement in 1960, when the building was sold to Standard Oil Co. and torn down.</p>
<p>Though he was well known for his portraiture and town scenes, one of June D. Drake's greatest achievements was the establishment of Silver Falls State Park. Beginning around 1902, he photographed the waterfalls and created brochures and booklets to bring statewide attention to the need to protect the land from logging interests. Working with Silverton and Salem citizens and Oregon state legislators, Drake organized an effort to buy the land around the falls and sell it to the state. On April 2, 1931, the Oregon State Park Commission accepted the proposal, and Silver Falls State Park officially opened to the public in July 1933. Many of the signs still in existence in the park were originally erected by June Drake, and Drake Falls in the park was named after him.</p>
<p>June D. Drake married Eleanor Schoenfield in 1904. The couple's home in Silverton was the first in the town to be wired for electricity. The Drakes had two children, Charles Henry, born in 1909, and Ardith Maxine, born in 1915. In addition to his career as a photographer, June Drake was also a member of the Knights of Pythias and served as secretary of the Silverton Chamber of Commerce, chief of the Silverton Fire Department, and a member of the city council. He also founded the Silverton Historical Society in 1930.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ephraim Peter Roberts was born at Danbury, Vermont, October 23, 1825.
After completing studies at Williams College in 1854, he entered Bangor
Theological Seminary in Maine, and was ordained by the Congregational Church at
Bangor on July 28, 1857. On Septermber 8, 1857, he married Myra Holman
Farrington of Holden, Maine, born there September 22, 1835. Both having been
certified as missionaries by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions, they sailed from Boston on October 30, 1857, en route to Micronesia
via Cape Horn and Honolulu. Fellow passengers on the
<title render="italic">Eliza and Ella</title> were the David Dwight
Baldwins, also newlyweds, on their way to the American Board mission at
Lahaina, Maui.</p>
<p>After a six month voyage to Honolulu, the Roberts stayed there three
months until the missionary packet
<title render="italic">Morning Star</title> was made ready for its second
voyage to Micronesia. The ship sailed June 30, 1858, with Ephraim and Myra
Roberts, Mrs. Luther Halsey Gulick and three of her children, and Mrs. Gulick's
brother-in-law, Theodore W. Gulick. They arrived at Ponape, Caroline Islands,
on August 18th.</p>
<p>The Roberts spent the next three years at Shalong, Ponape, replacing Dr.
and Mrs. Luther H. Gulick who, with the A. A. Sturges', had established the
Ponape mission in 1852. During these years the first two of the Roberts' nine
children were born. By mid-summer of 1861 their fellow missionaries to
Micronesia decided that the Roberts' should leave Ponape for a number reasons.
Two-year-old Charlotte Roberts had somewhat fragile health, and fear for her
life was heightened by the death of the Sturges' little girl at Ronkiti,
Ponape. Also, whaling vessels were calling less frequently at the islands, life
there was increasingly isolated, and mission work was not proceeding as had
been hoped. When Mrs. Sturges's health seriously failed, making necessary her
return to Honolulu, the Roberts were urged to go too.</p>
<p>They again sailed on the
<title render="italic">Morning Star</title>, in July of 1861, wound up
their American Board affairs in Honolulu, and embarked for San Francisco in
September. From there they sailed to Portland, Oregon, and settled for a time
at White Salmon, Washington Territory. In 1868 they took up a homestead near
The Dalles, Oregon, engaged in sheep raising and fruit growing, and devoted
much time to the Congregational Church in that area. Ephraim Roberts died
February 6, 1893, and Myra Roberts died February 18, 1912.</p>

<p>The Valley Migrant League (VML), which was founded in 1964, was first
funded in May 1965 by the Office of Economic Opportunity as part of Great
Society anti-poverty programs to serve migrant farm workers in the Willamette
Valley of Oregon. It operated programs until the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>The VML established its administrative headquarters in Woodburn, with
Area Opportunity Centers in Aumsville, Dayton, Hillsboro, Independence, Salem,
Sandy, and Woodburn. Initially, the board and administration was predominately
non-farm worker, but by 1967, more than half of the board was composed of
seasonal or ex-seasonal farm workers. By 1968, farm workers dominated the VML's
operations.</p>
<p>Other Valley Migrant League programs included adult education through
evening classes, Winter Day Schools, and existing community schools;
publication of a newspaper,

<p>Portland, Oregon, began as a clearing on the west bank of the
Willamette River in 1844. The new city was incorporated in 1851 and prospered
because of its advantageous location near the confluence of the Willamette and
Columbia Rivers, among other factors. Its growth was spurred by flourishing
agriculture in the Willamette Valley, the California gold rush, the Indian wars
of the 1850s, and gold discoveries in eastern Oregon and Idaho in the 1860s. By
the Civil War, Portland was the principal metropolis of the Pacific Northwest
with a population of around 3000. The arrival of the Northern Pacific and Union
Pacific railroads in 1883 and 1884 contributed to a new boom in prosperity, and
in 1891 the city annexed the municipalities of Albina and East Portland on the
east side of the Willamette. Residential growth was most dramatic in the
eastern districts after 1900, and expansion was especially rapid after the
Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. By 1910 Portland's population
was over 207,000, and it continued its rapid growth up to the 1930s.</p>

He was instrumental in the establishment of a public school system for the new Oregon Territory, and went on to serve as school superintendent for both Clackamas and Multnomah counties. He moved to Portland in 1865 and became the pastor of the First Congregational Church there. After leaving that post in 1872, he returned to missionary work and was appointed Superintendent of Missions of Congregational Churches of Oregon and Washington Territory. He continued as head of the Oregon superintendency after 1885. </p>
<p>Among the family of Nancy Bates Atkinson was her sister Lydia, who married the Reverend Lewis Grout, a classmate of George H. Atkinson at Andover Theological Seminary and later a missionary. The Grouts were assigned to a Zulu mission in Natal, South Africa, and sailed from Boston in 1846.</p>

<p>Mary V. Dodge was born Mary Bourne Thompson in 1876 in Arkansas. As a child, she was introduced to the violin while attending a school run by Catholic nuns; the instrument became so important to her that she later changed her middle initial to "V," for "Violin." She moved to Portland, Oregon, in the 1890s, where she taught at the Shattuck School. In 1910, she married Mott Dodge, a civil engineer. Soon after, the couple moved to Burns, Oregon, when Mott Dodge got a job platting roads. While in Burns, Mary V. Dodge played violin for the local children, and then established a children's orchestra, the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra. The Sagebrush Symphony played its first concert in Burns in 1912, and in subsequent years toured throughout Oregon. These tours were interrupted by the United States' entry into World War I, and the orchestra disbanded when Dodge moved back to Portland in 1918.</p>
<p>In Portland, Dodge became the music director at Irvington School. In 1923, she engaged Russian immigrant Jacques Gershkovitch to lead this orchestra, which became the Portland Junior Symphony (later the Portland Youth Philharmonic) and gave its first public performance on February 14, 1925. Dodge continued to teach violin. She died on New Year's Eve, 1954.</p>

<p>Walter Boychuk (1886-1967) worked as a photographer in Oregon for half a
century, making portraits of everyone from ordinary citizens to nationally
known figures, including Sen. Wayne Morse, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Eleanor
Roosevelt, Lowell Thomas, and Norman Thomas. </p>
<p>Boychuk was born Oct. 25, 1886, at Galatia, Austria. He immigrated to
Canada in 1903 and came to Portland in 1906, where he began working as a
photographer around 1912. For a few years during the late 1920s, he was
associated with photographer Frank I. Jones in Boychuk-Jones Studio. They did
commercial photography for the Portland Commission on Public Docks, Port of
Portland, and other clients. Beginning about 1930, Boychuk operated Boychuk
Studio at various locations in Portland until 1949. At that time he estimated
he had served 8,000 customers. He continued to work out of his farm home near
Tigard in semi-retirement. </p>
<p>In addition to his portrait and commercial work, Boychuk also gained
recognition for his architectural and scenic photography. He photographed the
buildings designed by a number of prominent architects. In 1930, he was
selected by a committee of the Oregon chapter of the American Institute of
Architects to create a portfolio of Oregon landmarks for submission to the
Pictorial Archives of Early American Architecture. This was a project of the
Library of Congress, funded by the Carnegie Foundation. Boychuk also served as
photographer for the subsequent Historic American Buildings Survey in the
mid-1930s. </p>
<p>Based on his architectural work, Boychuk was named official photographer
for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition at San Francisco. There he
spent two months photographing fair buildings, inside and out and under
different lighting conditions, in both black-and-white and color. He also was
an avid mountaineer, skier, and member of the Mazamas mountaineering
organization. </p>
<p>Although relatively little known compared with other Oregon
photographers such as Ray Atkeson and Benjamin Gifford, Boychuk brought his
artist’s eye and meticulous printing skills to a body of work that is among the
best produced in the state. </p>

<p>Flax was grown at least by 1844 near Tualatin, and was grown by other
farmers throughout the mid-19th century. A flax oil mill was established at
Salem in 1867, and the first flax-spinning mill was operating at Albany by the
1870s. An exhibit of Oregon flax won the bronze medal and certificate of merit
at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. By the 1890s, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture was touting Oregon and Washington as good flax
growing areas; however, costly hand labor required to harvest and process it
and competition with European producers limited flax production.</p>
<p>In 1915, the state of Oregon built a flax processing plant at the
state penitentiary in Salem, and this plant became known as the State Flax
Industry. The state joined the Works Progress Administration to construct three
cooperative processing plants at Springfield, Canby, and Mount Angel in 1936.
Six processing plants and two spinning mills were operating in Oregon by 1941,
and production reached its peak during World War II.</p>
<p>The state’s flax production, which continued to be centered in the
Willamette Valley, primarily produced linen tow, rope, and other lower grade
products rather than fine linen.</p>

<p>Measure 13 was a ballot measure placed on the ballot for the 1994
November election in Oregon. The measure, written by the right-wing group
Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), called for the state constitution to be amended
so that homosexuals were denied “minority status” protections, and so that
public schools and other organizations would be barred from “promoting or
expressing approval of homosexuality.” The measure was remarkably similar to
1992’s Measure 9, which had also been authored by the Oregon Citizens Alliance
and been defeated at the polls. Thanks to a vigorous opposition campaign,
Measure 13 also failed at the polls, with 52% of voters rejecting the measure.
In the aftermath of the 1994 election, staffers from the No on 13 campaign
formed the gay rights advocacy group Basic Rights Oregon.</p>
<p>Measure 36 was a 2004 Oregon initiative which sought to amend the
state constitution so as to explicitly define marriage as being between one man
and one woman. Basic Rights Oregon led the campaign opposing the measure.
However, the measure ultimately passed, 56.63% to 43.37%, and the Oregon
Constitution was amended so as to officially bar legal recognition of same-sex
marriages. In May 2014, United States District Judge Michael McShane ruled that
the clause prohibiting same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, as it violated
the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

British general John Burgoyne, who had been defeated at the Battle of Saratoga
during the American Revolution. William S. Burgoyne attended several
institutions of higher education, including the Kimball School of Theology at
Willamette University, and became a Methodist minister. </p>

It also helped to organize local promotion committees in cities and towns around Oregon. The group focused on educational activities such as lectures, classes, and presentations to school groups, as well as publications, exhibits, government lobbying, and assistance with law enforcement.

<p>Joseph L. Miller (1910- ), a native of Chicago, trained as a medical
doctor. He moved to Oregon in 1940 with his wife, Amy, and he opened a medical
practice in Portland, Or. In 1948, the family bought 94 acres near the Bull Run
Reserve, in the vicinity of Marmot, Clackamas County, Oregon. There they built
a small cabin, mostly for summer camping, and in 1975 established a permanent
home on three acres. They donated the remaining 91 acres to the Portland
Audubon Society in 1977.</p>
<p>In 1971, Miller discovered that the United States Forest Service (USFS)
had, since 1958, allowed commercial logging in the watershed in spite of a 1904
Trespass Act and planned to open a 30,000-acre area for recreational purposes.
Such strong opposition was expressed at a public meeting, which Miller
attended, that the USFS and the Portland Water Bureau withdrew the plan. Miller
then began a systematic effort to collect and disseminate information on the
Bull Run Reserve to focus public attention on the need for watershed
protection. In 1974, he organized the Bull Run Citizens' Advisory Committee,
which evolved into the Bull Run Interest Group (BRIG) by 1975. BRIG was active
at varying levels until about 1993. Miller was most concerned about the secrecy
and lack of public information and input that he believed characterized the
activities of the USFS and Portland Water Bureau, which managed the Bull Run
Watershed.</p>
<p>In 1975, Miller and two co-plaintiffs initiated a class-action lawsuit
against the USFS for allowing public access and logging in violation of the
Trespass Act and won their case. However, in 1977 Congress nullified the act,
and new legislation, introduced by Rep. Robert Duncan and Sen. Mark Hatfield of
Oregon, specified that the Bull Run Reserve could be managed by the Forest
Service according to prevailing multiple-use principles. Use of the watershed
need not be confined to water production, though that use should be
primary.</p>
<p> Miller's crusade to restore the protections of the Trespass Act
continued after 1977, and, with the public scrutiny that he inspired, serious
degradation of the watershed diminished. His efforts included further
litigation and stays to stop what he considered to be dubious timber sales
after “blowdowns.”</p>

<p>The Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and
Oriental Fair was an international event celebrating the 100th anniversary of
the Lewis and Clark expedition. It was held in Portland, Oregon, from June 1 to
October 15, 1905, and was designed to promote trade between the Pacific
Northwest and Asia, to promote the wealth of Oregon through its forestry,
industry and agriculture, and to promote the arts of the region.</p>
<p>Plans for a Portland exposition were considered as early as 1895, but
it was not until 1900 that a provisional commitee of Portland businessmen began
to seriously develop the idea. In December of that year the Oregon Historical
Society and
<title render="italic">Oregonian</title> editor Harvey Scott proposed
holding the fair in 1905 as the centennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
Besides Scott, the early leaders of the effort were banker and former U.S.
senator Henry W. Corbett, who became the exposition corporation's first
president, and J. M. Long of the Portland Board of Trade. Incorporation papers
were filed in October of 1901 and journalist Henry E. Reed was hired to promote
the enterprise throughout the U.S. and abroad. In November of 1901, $300,000 of
stock was issued and quickly purchased. The involvement of the state of Oregon
was coordinated by the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission with
Jefferson Myers as chairman. By September of 1902 a site for the fair had been
chosen — the Guild's Lake area northwest of downtown Portland. Work began in
the early months of 1903. Later that year Harvey Scott assumed the presidency
of the corporation after the death of Henry Corbett. A long campaign to gain
U.S. Government support succeeded finally in April of 1904 with President
Roosevelt's signing of an appropration bill. </p>
<p>The original layout of the exposition grounds was developed by John
Olmsted, son of Central Park's planner Frederick Law Olmsted. The work of
construction was overseen by Oskar Huber, Superintendent of Works, and
architectural decisions were made by Portland architect Ion Lewis. Using as a
model the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the main buildings of
the Portland fair were situated on a ridge overlooking Guild's Lake and the
Willamette River, with massive exhibition halls fronting a central "sunken
garden" which led down the hill to a stepped esplanade and a bandstand at the
water's edge. A street of amusement concessions called The Trail led to the
long Bridge of Nations which connected the shore to the U.S. Government Island
containing a massive double-towered pavilion. Notable among the other
exposition buildings were the American Inn — a vast hotel for visitors situated
at lakeside — and the Forestry Building — a huge log cabin made from gigantic
tree trunks, which survived until destroyed by fire in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Although Portland's exposition was one of many world's fairs that took
place around the same time, its managers learned much from the efforts of other
cities, most notably St. Louis's Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. The
Portland fair was promoted at St. Louis by Colonel Henry E. Dosch, who headed
the Oregon section and served later as Director of Exhibits of the Lewis &amp;
Clark fair. Many of Portland's exhibits and amusements came directly from St.
Louis.</p>
<p>Among the the thousands of exhibits, the most popular was that of
Japan, situated in the Oriental Exhibit Palace. The amusements of The Trail
were not as well-attended as hoped, this due in part to efforts at a Sunday
closure. Aside from trained elks, baby incubators, aerial artists, and other
acts, the most elaborate of the shows was Bolossy Kiralfy's
<title render="italic">Carnival of Venice</title> — an extravagnza
involving hundreds of dancers on a 400-foot stage. Also held at the fair were a
number of national and international conferences and congresses, among them a
women's suffrage congress attended by Susan B. Anthony, an historical
conference, and a national educational conference.</p>
<p>The administration of the exposition was handled with great
effeciency. Heading the corporation was the President (orignally the
Director-General), H. W. Goode. Henry E. Reed was the corporations' Secretary
and also the Exposition's Director of Exploitation. Other officers were
Director of Exhibits Henry E. Dosch; John A. Wakefield, Director of Concessions
and Admissions; Ion Lewis, Director of Architecture; Frank Vincent Du Mond,
Chief of Fine Arts; J. F. Batchelder, Superintendent of Mines and Metallurgy;
and Oskar Huber, Director of Works.</p>
<p>The exposition was a great success on many levels. Attendance figures
were 1,558,000 paid admissions and 966,000 free passes, well above projections.
The corporation made a net profit of $84,461 and was one of the few U.S.
expositions to end with a positive balance. More importantly, the fair
succeeded in promoting Oregon in general and Portland in particular. It is
likely that the exposition contributed substantially to Portland's great
economic and population boom from 1905 to 1912.</p>
