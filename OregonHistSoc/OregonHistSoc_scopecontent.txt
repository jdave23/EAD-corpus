<p>The films in the Porter W. Yett Motion Picture Collection were taken by
Mr. Yett in the early years of the Swigert, Hart &amp; Yett Company to document
their construction projects. The films were used for marketing and promotion of
the company's services and products. Several cement and concrete projects are
featured including ramps to the Broadway Bridge, widening and paving several
Portland streets, the Denver Avenue viaduct, and grain elevators on the
Willamette River. A number of buildings are included, among them a Buick
warehouse, Shell Oil plant, an addition to Mt. Tabor Presbyterian Church, and
Grand Central Public Market. The collection also contains films taken during
trips to Crater Lake, Boston, and New York.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>The film starts with an outdoor use of the Yett Transit System
for delivering cement, showing a truck on a ramp next to the building site.
Using up only three feet of the street, so traffic can pass, the mixer truck
pours concrete into a hopper which is lifted to the top of the construction
site and dumped into the form. The second scene shows a similar truck pouring
concrete into indoor forms for a warehouse floor.</p>
</scopecontent>

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Documentation of the "old method" of road paving in which the
materials to form the concrete were delivered separately and mixed on site. The
film shows the stockpiles of gravel and sand, the bags of dry cement along the
side of the project, and the mixing machine which produced each load of
concrete.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Filmed on a large construction site, this reel demonstrates the
use of a large chute for delivering concrete several stories below street
level. Mixers pour concrete directly into some of the chutes which appear to be
about two stories long. Other trucks pour their loads into hoppers which lift
the concrete up to the beginning of the chute. All of the chutes are delivering
concrete to a rebar-covered floor area.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film begins with concrete being poured into a portable mixer
truck at Swigert, Hart &amp; Yett's main plant. Gravel is delivered, and dumped
into a pit from where a conveyor belt takes it up to the hopper to be added to
the mixture. The scene moves to a road-paving site where several children watch
the crew pouring and smoothing the cement. Mr. Yett explains the procedure to
Mr. Morse and Mr. Fleming. Hoses sprinkle water on the curing concrete after it
has been leveled and tamped using a long board. The group next moves to an
alley in a residential area where there is little extra space between the
houses to demonstrate how well the mixer trucks work in tight areas. The men
stand on boards suspended over the street to smooth the concrete as there is no
room to use their usual long-handled rollers. The film ends with Mr. Buck
inspecting a newly paved road.</p>
<p>Appearing: Clay S. Morse (Multnomah County commissioner), Porter
W. Yett (Manager, Swigert, Hart &amp; Yett, Inc.), Angus Fleming (chief
Portland city street inspector), George Buck (Multnomah County road

building, then a site near the Steel Bridge, a round storage building, and a
site requiring cement footings, possibly the Broadway Bridge ramp.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film begins with a large crane hoisting a section of metal
support into place. Then the roadbed is prepared and poured. Trolley tracks
supports are laid in the concrete on the outside lanes of the viaduct. The film
includes many views of the steel reinforcements for the concrete. It also shows
a small tractor. Lindstrom &amp; Feigenson are the contractors for the
project.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film is in four segments. The first shows the Swigert, Hart
&amp; Yett plant where mobile mixers are being loaded. The second documents
building a cement wall at the Shell Oil Plant in northwest Portland. The third
shows mixer trucks delivering to a building site where a hopper is used is used
to pour concrete. The fourth shows the beginning of the construction of the
Sunday School building at Mt. Tabor Presbyterian Church on Belmont Street. In
one scene a trolley passes the building site.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This film shows the building of a concrete wall, partially below
ground level. Wheelbarrows are used to move the concrete from the mixer truck
to the forms. The film ends with the finished wall.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film documents the construction of the Grand Central Public
Market building (later Grand Central Bowl, a bowling alley) on SE Morrison
between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. The footage includes several pans of the
neighboring buildings, as well as images of the construction work. Construction
scenes include pouring the concrete floor, driving pilings, moving concrete
with wheelbarrows, filling forms around rebar, and smoothing out the poured
concrete.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film shows the construction of a ramp to the Broadway
Bridge, emphasizing the retaining walls and the closely spaced reinforcing
steel that the concrete must surround. There are also scenes (repeated in other
films) that show the Portland railyards, men wiring reinforcing steel rods
together into a framework, the use of timber falsework, excavating with
dragline and shovels, and a elevator used to raise concrete from the mixer
truck to the hopper for filling wheelbarrows. There is also a scene of men
using chewing tobacco.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film begins with a steam-powered pile driver working in the
midst of a large construction site. Part of the site is a lumber storage yard
for the building of forms. After the pilings are all in place, reinforcing
steel rods are laid in a mesh over them. There are many scenes of the concrete
being poured by wheelbarrows on various levels of the construction, and men
adjusting equipment throughout the site. By the end of the film the grain silos
are more than one story high. In the final scenes, a man sits atop the chute
pouring cement from the hopper into the wheelbarrows to operate the control
gate.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film opens with a close look at the retaining walls on the
10th Avenue ramp to the Broadway Bridge. The next section shows concrete being
poured between the ties on railway tracks, and steel reinforcement being wired
together. There are several views of timber falsework, followed by digging
using dragline and shovels. The end of the film returns to the Broadway Bridge
site.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The film shows two paving projects. The first widens East
Broadway (now NE Broadway) by several feet on each edge of the street. One side
of the street is nearly finished when this footage was taken. Workmen are
pouring and filling the other side. Traffic moves down the middle of the road,
on the old street bed, and on the side streets. The second project is the
paving of Omaha Avenue (now N. Omaha Ave.). One side of the street has been
finished, and work continues on the other half. The project is inspected by
several men, including Charles Swigert, part owner of Perfect Mix Cement.</p>

<p>The collection provides a sampling of personal papers from three
generations of a wealthy American family. Although the materials probably
represent only a small percentage of the family's output, they are filled with
great detail and vivid descriptions. The writing in the letters and diaries is
well composed and fairly legible throughout.</p>
<p>The correspondence between James and Mary Montgomery, which dates from
the late 1870s to the late 1890s, provides details of their family life, their
social engagements, their travels, and their observations on current events.
James's letters contain some information about contemporary politics and his
business ventures, although most of the writing is family-oriented.</p>
<p>A large file of letters from Adolfo de Bosis to Margaret Montgomery date
from 1912 and contain often extravagant declarations of love. Most are written
in Italian. One letter from Margaret to Adolfo is included as well, and this is
possibly a draft of her final communication with him. A file of letters from
Margaret to her friend Lady Johnstone give Margaret's own emotional account of
the affair with de Bosis. Additional letters are from other family members and
friends, including Margaret's sons Wilfrid and Rufus, and her husband. Of
particular interest is a bound set of letters written by Margaret to her mother
from Europe and elsewhere. Titled "Letters of Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum.
London, Paris, Ragusa, Zagreb, Constantinope, Hawaii," the letters date from
1913 to 1929 and are packed with details of travels, children, and daily life.
Additional letters from Margaret to her mother, unbound, are also of the same
nature.</p>
<p>Most of the diaries in the collection were written by Mary Phelps
Montgomery and date mainly from the 1890s through the 1910s. They contain
details of her active social life, her travels across the U.S. and Europe, her
work for the Daughters of the American Revolution, and her activities relating
to the St. Louis Exposition of 1904. She mentions meetings with prominent
political figures, friendships with German nobility in Berlin, and visits to
the White House, among many other topics. Also included are some entries
written in Portland, with mention of people prominent in local society. Two
diaries of Mary's daughter Margaret Zogbaum provide details of her travels in
Europe and the Middle East with her husband and children. Her writing is highly
descriptive and vivid.</p>

<p>The collection documents not only Burg's life, adventures, work, and
family, but also traces his development as a photographer, from teenage years,
when he took snapshots of his sea voyages around the world, to the late 1920s,
when he started producing photographs that graced the pages of glossy magazines
such as
<title render="italic">National Geographic</title> and films for
Encyclopaedia Brittanica Films and ERPI Classroom Films. He became an expert at
taking shots of people, and his photography of children is particularly
striking. The collection includes prints, negatives, slides, and lantern

<p>Images document ships, crews, life and work aboard ship, and

photographs of Amos Burg. The bulk of the photographs of his merchant seaman
career are contained in three photograph albums. Album 450-1 includes his first
voyages from 1918-1920. He may not have had a camera until he shipped on the SS

<title>Katia</title> in September 1918, so voyages before that
time are documented by postcards and other photomechanical prints and a
teenager's purple prose. Most of Burg's photographs in this album document his
voyage aboard the
<title>Katia</title> on the Northern Circle route to Japan and
on to other Asian ports, then through the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal to
Marseilles, France. The 2.5-inch by 3.5-inch prints are fading, but they give a
hint of the photographic strengths and skills Burg would develop, particularly
in photographing people. Album 450-2 includes good quality prints by Burg of
his voyage aboard the SS
<title>President Madison</title> in 1923, and Album 450-3

of horse-drawn vehicles. The collection concentrates on the period from about
1940 to 1971. Much of the collection preserves correspondence between Collins
and the other wagon research experts in the United States. Numerous newspaper
and magazine clippings reflect Collins' obsession with his topic. Of particular
historical interest is both the scale plans of his wagons, which hold specific
construction details that are now difficult to find, and the journals, notes
and sketches which document how Collins located examples to work from and how
he learned to construct historically accurate models.</p>

<p>The Julia Ruuttila Papers consist of correspondence, ephemera, legal
papers, interview transcripts and reports, manuscripts, published materials,
and her FBI File, which was obtained by her biographer, Sandy Polishuk, under
the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>Correspondence, manuscripts, and published materials do not represent
her full output but provide a good sampling of her career as a journalist and
writer and of her wide-ranging activities on behalf of labor, civil rights, and
peace movements protesting the Vietnam and Gulf wars. The collection also
reflects her research contributions to a biography of Louise Bryant,
<emph render="italic">Friend and Lover</emph>, by Virginia Gardner.</p>
<p>Much of the collection is original materials, but it also includes
photocopied materials. A few of these were collected by Julia Ruuttila in the

<p>The collection includes Julia's own contributions to the history of
labor, civil rights, and peace movements as reflected in her correspondence,
manuscripts, and published materials. Although most of her published work is
journalistic in nature, the collection reflects her love of writing poetry and
includes an unpublished novel.</p>

<p>The FBI placed Julia under surveillance beginning in 1941 as a
suspected subversive. With Julia's permission, Sandy Polishuk requested
Ruuttila's FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act in January 1990.
However, the files did not arrive until more than a year after Julia's death.
The FBI provided about 500 pages of the total 1,236 pages in Ruuttila's file.
Some of the pages are photocopies of her published writings, some are copies of
newspaper articles covering her activities, but most are reports and memos.
These include annual reports, lists of participants in demonstrations, and
narrative reports of organizations and activities. Much detail is blacked out.

<p>As a grassroots nonprofit organization, LCP records show the
establishment of an organization from the initial thoughts of its founding
members through the passing of its 20th Anniversary; its connecting ties to the
Community Education Project; the by-laws and mission statements that developed
over the years to best represent the changing lesbian community; the financial
struggle of depending on grants and donations to survive while best serving its
community; and the shaping of an organization as the issues and images of the
lesbian, gay and transgender community shifted over time.</p>
<p> The LCP collection includes records of administrative, financial,
legal, personnel, board of director, committee, media, and membership
activities within the organization as well as key social and political issues,
events, and organizations of interest to LCP during its tenure. The collection
also includes the LCP publication
<title render="italic">On Track</title>. Letters from the lesbians
throughout Oregon in thanks of the LCP can also be found in the collection.

<p>The collection consists of images taken throughout Portland, Oregon,
with emphasis on the downtown and eastern portions of the city. Included are
street scenes, thoroughfares, business establishments, and neighborhood views.
The bulk of the images appear to date from the late 1920s and early 1930s. Many
may have been created in relation to specific city projects, such as street
paving, sewer installation, and improvement of blighted neighborhoods. Visible
in many of the photographs from the early 1930s is a man holding a number --
probably a city employee engaged in a particular project. In general, the
photographs provide detailed documentation of the city's built environment,
much of which is still extant.</p>

<p>Boychuk donated his photographic collection to the Oregon Historical
Society about six months before his death in 1967. The collection represents
the images he had retained until that time, and it provides a good sample of
the kinds of photographic work he did during the course of his career. The
images date from circa 1915 through the 1960s, but the bulk of the collection
is from the 1920s through the 1940s.</p>
<p>Group 1 of this collection contains biographical material on Walter
Boychuk and his wife, Anna, that was collected while this collection was being
processed. Group 2 consists of the copy prints made from Boychuk’s original
negatives; this representative sampling of his work was printed courtesy of a
conservation grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust and contains photographs taken
by Boychuk of various locations in Oregon and other states, portraits, ships
and transportation, and other subjects, as well as his work for the Historic
American Buildings Survey in 1930-1951 and the Golden Gate International
Exposition in San Francisco in 1940. Group 3 is a collection of signed, mounted
prints of architectural images, which Boychuk made for the Pictorial Archives
of Early American Architecture at the Library of Congress in 1930, and includes
some produced for the Historic American Buildings Survey as well; these are
annotated with his negative numbers. Group 4 consists of a printed booklet of
photomechanical reproductions of Boychuk's photographs, entitled "Pictorial
Oregon." Group 5 consists of an oversized album, titled “Pacific Northwest by
Boychuk,” which provides a retrospective of images Boychuk made throughout his
career, most identified in his handwriting and annotated with his negative
numbers.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The group includes a folder of background material on the
Boychuks and their studio collected in the course of processing the collection.
It also includes photographs of Walter and Anna Boychuk and personal greeting
cards they created using his photographs. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The prints made at the Oregon Historical Society from Walter
Boychuk’s original negatives represent the full range of his photographic work:
architectural, portrait, landscape, and commercial. The Oregon Historical
Society made prints from Boychuk’s original negatives circa 1970, and these
were placed in the Photograph Subject Files in the Research Library. Around
1998, the Meyer Memorial Trust funded a negative survey and preservation
printing of the collection. Prints from both of these projects are included in
Group 1. </p>

<p>Images document Joseph L. Miller's crusade to protect the Bull Run
Reserve and watershed from logging and recreation damage and to expand public
awareness of the threat to its famed pristine water through formation of the
Bull Run Interest Group (BRIG) and lawsuits he initiated against the U.S.
Forest Service. Bull Run is the main source of water for Portland, Or., and
other smaller communities in the area. Photographs showing the impact of
logging on the Bull Run Watershed make up the bulk of the collection. Primary
formats represented are black-and-white and color photographic prints, ranging
from snapshot size to 8x10 (some with negatives), black-and-white and color
aerial photographs, and 35 mm color slides. Some prints are attached to two
posters, and the collection also includes two color postcards and related
papers.</p>
<p>Miller made some of the photographs himself and obtained the remainder
from other photographers and sources, including the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and U.S. Forest Service. Many of the black-and-white and color images
were used to illustrate publications produced by BRIG and by Miller personally,
and two groups are marked as exhibits in class action lawsuits that Miller and
others brought against the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

<p>The records of the exposition cover all aspects of the enterprise,
from its inception to its final demolition. The bulk of the materials cover the
years 1904 and 1905 and relate to the logistics of organizing exhibits and
concessions, hiring workers, planning the fair grounds, constructing the
buildings, and operating the Exposition on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Because of the broad scope of the Exposition, the collection provides
a valuable documentation of all manner of commercial, industrial, agricultural,
and entertainment enterprises taking place the years 1904-1905. Especially well
documented are Oregon's own enterprises. A comprehensive list of award
recipients can be found in the series "Division of Exhibits," subseries
"Awards."</p>
<p>Extensive correspondence with bands, orchestras, and other musical
organizations is noteworthy, as are letters from all manner of entertainers. A
file of letters and photographs from the prize fighter John L. Sullivan is of
particular interest. Another significant group of materials are the employment
inquiries from hundreds of people seeking positions with the fair company,
including a large percentage of women. The records of the Oregon Education
Exhibits contain a large number of bound books of student writing, drawings,
and photographs.</p>
<p>Although most officers of the Exposition are represented, a large
percentage of the correspondence comes from the offices of the President, Henry
W. Goode; the Secretary and Director of Exploitation, Henry E. Reed; the
Director of Exhibits, Henry E. Dosch; and the Director of Concessions and
Admissions, John Wakefield. In some cases files of correspondence between two
particular officers can be found under each of the officers' departments. Most
files contain both incoming letters and carbon copies of outgoing letters.</p>
<p>Although written records of construction are included — such as
specifications for some buildings — very few blueprints or scale drawings are
present. A large collection of blueprints and scale drawings of the exposition
is held by the Oregon State Archives in Salem. Visual documentation is provided
by a series of illustrated works in the series "Publications," however the bulk
of the photographic record is housed in the photograph collection of the Oregon
Historical Society in the Kiser Collection (Org. Lot 140).</p>
