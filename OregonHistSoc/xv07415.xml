      <p>The Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, also referred to as Oregonship, was the largest of three shipyards established in the Pacific Northwest by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser during World War II. The shipyard opened in 1941 and was located on the Willamette River near the St. Johns neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It initially built merchant ships for the British government, then began to produce them for the U.S. Maritime Commission. The first Northwest-built Liberty ship, a type of vessel used to transport troops and cargo, launched from the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation on September 27, 1941. Over the course of the war, the shipyard built 330 Liberty ships, as well as Victory ships and attack transports. The shipyard ceased operations shortly after the end of World War II.</p>
