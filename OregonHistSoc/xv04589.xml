		<p>The first Fred Meyer grocery store opened in downtown Portland, Oregon
		  in 1922. The store's founder, Fred G. Meyer, opened more stores in downtown
		  Portland in the 1920s and 1930s, then expanded into the outlying areas of
		  Portland and beyond. By the 1990s there were stores bearing the Fred Meyer name
		  throughout Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Arizona and
		  Alaska. In addition to the supermarket stores, Fred Meyer, Inc. also included
		  jewelry stores, restaurants, federal savings and loan banks, print shops,
		  bakeries, dairies and music stores.</p> 
		<p>Fred G. Meyer pioneered the concept of one-stop shopping, the idea
		  that all household goods could be purchased at one store. At Fred Meyer stores,
		  customers could buy groceries, clothing, auto supplies, furniture, appliances,
		  hardware, garden supplies and more. Fred Meyer was also among the first to
		  develop self-serve drug stores at a time when all pharmaceutical products had
		  to be purchased through a pharmacist. Fred Meyer stores are also known for
		  their advertising slogan, "My-Te-Fine," which was also the name of the in-house
		  brand of packaged foods. </p> 
		<p>In the 1960s through the 1990s, Fred Meyer, Inc. expanded by acquiring
		  many smaller grocery store chains throughout the West including Marketime and
		  QFC in Washington, B&amp;B Stores in Montana, Grand Central and Smith's Food
		  and Drug in Utah, Valu-Mart in Alaska and Smitty's Marketplace in Arizona. In
		  1999, Fred Meyer, Inc. merged with Kroger, Inc., making the combined company
		  the largest grocery store chain in the country.</p> 
		<p>Fred G. Meyer was born Frederick Grubmeyer in 1886 in Brooklyn, New
		  York. He moved West in the 1900s starting in Alaska and eventually making his
		  way to Portland, Oregon. He married Eva Chatfield Chiles who would become his
		  business partner and the inspiration behind Eve's Restaurants which were coffee
		  shops attached to many Fred Meyer stores. Fred G. Meyer died in 1978 at the age
		  of 92. His will established a charitable trust to create a philanthropic
		  organization now known as the Meyer Memorial Trust which is now one of the
		  largest private foundations in the nation.</p>

	 <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_"> 
		<p>The collection includes materials from the stores' beginnings in 1922
		  and continuing through 2010. It includes materials from many Fred Meyer stores
		  located throughout the Western United States, but the bulk of the materials
		  originate from stores and facilities in Oregon. This collection concentrates on
		  materials related to the stores and business of Fred Meyer, Inc. and not on the
		  personal papers of Fred G. Meyer. There are nevertheless some personal
		  materials of Fred G. Meyer as well as materials from many of the executives who
		  worked at Fred Meyer, Inc. </p> 
		<p>Most of the collection consists of photographs taken in this 88 year
		  time span. Subjects include: store opening celebrations; exteriors and
		  interiors of the stores; company meetings and parties; merchandise displays;
		  promotional events; portraits of management figures and product shots used in
		  advertising. The photographs are dispersed throughout the collection. In
		  addition to prints, the photography collection also includes slides, negatives,
		  transparencies and hand-drawn art.</p> 
		<p>A sizable part of the collection also includes newspaper clippings of
		  relevant news stories or print advertisements. Many of these clippings include
		  the hand-written notes of Fred G. Meyer. Several large scrap books include an
		  extensive collection of advertisements from the 1930s through the 1970s.</p> 
		<p>Annual reports were only published in those years when Fred Meyer,
		  Inc. was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The collection of
		  employee newsletters does have a few gaps, but is by and large a complete
		  collection of the newsletters from 1949-2010.</p>
