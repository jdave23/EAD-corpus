The first Fred Meyer grocery store opened in downtown Portland, Oregon in 1922. The store's founder, Fred G. Meyer, opened more stores in downtown Portland in the 1920s and 1930s, then expanded into the outlying areas of Portland and beyond.

In addition to the supermarket stores, Fred Meyer, Inc. also included jewelry stores, restaurants, federal savings and loan banks, print shops, bakeries, dairies and music stores.
Fred G. Meyer pioneered the concept of one-stop shopping, the idea that all household goods could be purchased at one store. At Fred Meyer stores, customers could buy groceries, clothing, auto supplies, furniture, appliances, hardware, garden supplies and more. Fred Meyer was also among the first to develop self-serve drug stores at a time when all pharmaceutical products had to be purchased through a pharmacist. Fred Meyer stores are also known for their advertising slogan, "My-Te-Fine," which was also the name of the in-house brand of packaged foods.

The Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, also referred to as Oregonship, was the largest of three shipyards established in the Pacific Northwest by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser during World War II. The shipyard opened in 1941 and was located on the Willamette River near the St. Johns neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It initially built merchant ships for the British government, then began to produce them for the U.S. Maritime Commission. The first Northwest-built Liberty ship, a type of vessel used to transport troops and cargo, launched from the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation on September 27, 1941. Over the course of the war, the shipyard built 330 Liberty ships, as well as Victory ships and attack transports. The shipyard ceased operations shortly after the end of World War II.

The Oregonian was founded as a weekly paper in 1850 by William W. Chapman, Stephen Coffin, and Thomas Jefferson Dryer. Despite his first name, Dryer was a Whig, and later a Republican; these leanings would have a lasting effect on the paper's editorial stance.
In 1860, Dryer left Portland to campaign on behalf of Abraham Lincoln, leaving the English-born Henry L. Pittock in charge of the paper. The following year, Pittock began publishing the Oregonian as a daily newspaper. In 1865, Pittock hired Harvey W. Scott to be editor of the paper. Scott remained editor until his death in 1910, with the exception of the years 1872-1877, when W. Lair Hill was editor. Notable editors and publishers of the Oregonian since Pittock and Scott have included Palmer Hoyt, Ronald G. Callvert, Ben Hur Lampman, Michael J. Frey, Robert Notson, J. Richard Nokes, and Fred Stickel.
In the 1930s, the paper, struggling financially, hired Stars and Stripes founder Colonel Guy T. Viskiniskki, who dramatically changed the layout and format of the paper as a means of modernizing it. Publishing mogul Samuel I. Newhouse purchased the Oregonian in 1950, ending local ownership. In 1982, when the Oregonian's main rival, the Oregon Journal, went out of business, the Journal's staff and production, which had shared offices with the Oregonian since 1961, were absorbed into the Oregonian.
As of 2016, the Oregonian was the oldest continuously published newspaper in the Pacific Northwest.

In 1918, the branch was one of several women's organizations that raised funds to found the Waverly Baby Home. In the 1930s, the branch offered a "Free Time School" for young women who were unable to attend college. During World War II, its members helped found and staff a "baby lounge" at Union Station where parents who were traveling with young children could rest and see to their children's needs while waiting between trains; it was one of four such facilities in the U.S. Starting in 1954, the branch published a catalog of local nurseries, daycares, and kindergartens. In the 1950s, branch president Marion Stearns advocated for the establishment of an educational television station in Portland, culminating in legislation to fund the Oregon Public Broadcasting System in 1959. In 1973, the branch published a book about Oregon history, "Land of the Multnomahs," as a fundraiser for fellowship programs.

Jesse Looney (1800-1869) was a farmer and legislator.
James Boyce Montgomery was a railroad contractor who grew wealthy through construction projects in the eastern and western U.S. Born near Harrisburg, Penn., in 1832, he worked first as a journalist, eventually becoming editor and publisher of the Pittsburgh Morning Post. He moved on to railroad construction in the late 1850s and built bridges and rail lines in Pennsylvania and vicinity in the following decade. He served on the boards of many railroad companies and purchased a portion of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. He moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1870 and constructed portions of the Northern Pacific Railroad, travelling to Europe to raise capital and obtain materials. In addition he organized other enterprises, such as the dredging of the Columbia River channel and construction of docks in the Portland area. He was also an influential figure in Republican party circles, although his only major public office was that of Multnomah County representative to the Oregon legislature, to which he was elected in 1890.
In 1861 Montgomery married Rachael Anthony and the couple had one son, Henry Moorhead Montgomery (1863-1932). After Rachael's death in 1863, James Montgomery married Mary S. Phelps in 1866. She came from a prominent Missouri family and was the daughter of John Smith Phelps, who served as the governor of the state from 1877 to 1886. Mary Phelps Montgomery (1846-1943) led a strenuous and long life filled with travels, social activities, and active club work. She served as hostess for her father during his gubernatorial term in Missouri; lived in Berlin in the late 1880s and at later periods; served on the Board of Lady Managers for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis; organized the Portland chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and Colonial Dames of America; travelled extensively; befriended famous people, such as President Ulysses S. Grant; and managed her husband's financial affairs after his death in 1900. Among her seven children were: Mary Montgomery Talbot, Antoinette Montgomery Frissel (b. 1871), Phelps Montgomery (b. 1872), Eliza Montgomery (b. 1874), Constance Montgomery Burrell (b. 1875), Russell Montgomery (1877-1900); and Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum (b. 1887).
Margaret Montgomery Zogbaum pursued a literary career and wrote essays, plays and novels. She lived much of her youth in Europe and had a brief love affair around 1912 with an Italian nobleman, Adolfo de Bosis. In 1914 she married a U.S. naval officer, Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum II, who was stationed in London and later became the commandant of the U.S. Naval Station in Pensacola, Florida. The two travelled throughout Europe and the Middle East and settled eventually near Tryon, North Carolina, in the late 1930s. Among their children were Wilfrid Zogbaum (1915-1965), an artist and musician, David Zogbaum, and Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum III (called "Fair").
Charles Samuel A. (Sam) Jackson (1860-1924) was born in Virginia and moved to Pendleton, Oregon, in the early 1880s. He gradually acquired ownership of the East Oregonian newspaper. He married native Virginian, Maria Clopton (1862-1956), in Pendleton in 1886. They had two sons, Francis Clopton Jackson (1887-1919) and Phillip Ludwell Jackson (1893-1953).
In 1902, Sam Jackson moved to Portland and acquired the newly established Oregon Journal, an evening newspaper which he promoted as a civic-minded people's newspaper. The paper's success necessitated building new quarters at Broadway and Yamhill in 1912, a location which was itself subsequently outgrown. In 1948, the Journal relocated to the former Public Market building on Front Street between Yamhill and Taylor.
Maria Jackson was active in civic and Episcopal Church affairs. The family home on Salmon Street became the site of the clubhouse for the Portland Federation of Women's Clubs. The Jacksons' son, Phillip, and their grandson, C. S. Jackson, II (1914-1947), were active in management of the Oregon Journal and other family enterprises. In addition to their Portland home, the family built a log lodge on Clear Creek near Carver, Oregon.

The Spokane, Portland and Seattle (SP & S) Railway operated rail lines in Oregon and Washington between 1905 and 1970. James J. Hill incorporated the railway in 1905 to connect his two transcontinental railway lines, the Northern Pacific (NP) and Great Northern (GN) railways. The company was initially named the Portland & Seattle Railway, and Spokane was added to the name in 1908. SP & S also oversaw the operation of the Oregon Electric Railway, the Oregon Traction Company, and the Oregon Trunk Railroad. SP & S merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970.
The Portland Reporter newspaper was born out of a long and bitter strike by union workers against the Samuel Newhouse-owned Oregonian, a morning paper, and the Oregon Journal, an afternoon newspaper controlled by trustees of the founding Jackson Family. The striked started in November 1959, and the unions launched the Portland Reporter as a weekly on Feb. 11, 1960. It went semi-weekly April 12, 1960, and daily (except Sunday) on Feb. 11, 1961. At its height, circulation reached 78,000 in spite of the fact that the two dailies continued to publish using non-union labor. In August 1961, Newhouse bought the Oregon Journal and moved it into his Oregonian plant. The Portland Reporter generated national attention for its challenge to Portland's newspaper monopoly until it folded in October 1964. Strikers continued to picket the dailies until April 4, 1965, but the Newhouse monopoly had essentially broken the strike long before.
A few months after the Portland Reporter started publishing, it moved into an old brick building at 1714 NW Overton Street after the labor unions refurbished it for their newspaper's new home. The building still stands in Northwest Portland as of 2004.

Amos Burg (1901-1986) was born in Portland, Or., to Amos Burg, Sr., and Minerva Ann James Burg (Annie Laurie Burg). Burg, Sr. (1863-1938), immigrated from Norway in 1877 to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where he worked in the laundry business and married Minerva Ann James in 1889. They and their infant son, Charles, moved to Portland in 1890, and the senior Burg became part owner of the City Laundry. In Portland, the couple had seven more children, including Amos, Jr. The Burgs' longtime family home at 1706 N.E. Dekum Avenue was still standing as of 2004.
Upon graduation from grammar school in June 1917, Burg persuaded his parents to let him go to sea as bell boy on the passenger ship, Rose City, Portland to San Francisco and Los Angeles. At the end of the summer, he returned to Portland to start high school but the call of the sea was so strong that he returned to sea, where during many voyages in the next several years, he continued his education using the Encyclopaedia Britannica. This whetted his appetite for more learning, so between voyages, he completed a college preparatory course at the Oregon Institute of Technology and then enrolled in science, photography, and journalism courses at the University of Oregon (Eugene) and Oregon State College (now Oregon State University, Corvallis) between adventures (1926-1929), although he never earned a degree. He helped to finance his education and adventures by using his sea voyages as an opportunity to earn some money importing Oriental rug, silks, and pearls.
Burg was heralded for making the first complete canoe voyage on the Columbia River from its headwaters in Columbia Lake, B.C., to the Pacific Oct. 20, 1924-Jan. 7, 1925. The newspapers followed his adventure, and this voyage started his lecture career, as he became a sought-after speaker in Portland and elsewhere in western Oregon. By 1930, he was becoming a successsful lecturer on the national circuit with tales of his adventures, illustrated with his own films and slides, accompanied by narration in his self-depracating witty style. Burg followed up his Columbia River triumph in the summer of 1925 with a canoe voyage from the headwaters of the Snake River at Jackson Lake, Wyo., through Hells Canyon, and down the Columbia River to its mouth. At the Cascades of the Columbia (site of the Bonneville Dam in 2004), Fox Movietone and International Newsreel cameramen persuaded Burg to run the cascades in his canoe, which resulted in International newsreel headlines, "Amos Burg first man to attempt passage of swirling Columbia waters in frail craft." Well into the 1930s, Burg continued to make periodic canoe trips on the Columbia, Snake, Yukon and Northwest Territories rivers, culminating in his 1938 trip to film Buzz Holmstrom's re-creation of his 1937 one-man trip down the Green and Colorado rivers. Burg took the first inflatable rubber raft down the Colorado on this trip, and his film, Conquering the Colorado won an Academy Award nomination for short subjects in 1939.
Burg extended his travels around the world aboard the yacht, Camargo, 1931-1932, and followed up in 1933-1934 with a trip in a small boat around Cape Horn. Filmmaking for ERPI and Encyclopaedia Britannica subsequently took him throughout the western United States, Central and South America, Alaska, Europe, and Asia.
In the early 1950s, Burg settled down in Alaska, working forst for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and then establishing himself with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 1955-1974. He established the department's Information and Education Section and made many films as part of his work. He also made the Alaska Centennial film, Juneau, Alaska's Capital City. He continued to make many river trips well after his retirement. He died in Alaska in 1985, and his ashes have since been scattered on many of the rivers he voyaged.

Donald (Don) Bruce Hobart was born in Hell Canyon country in November 6, 1918. He later moved to Spokane, WA with his parents.
December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, Hobart enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He flew P-40s and P-51s as part of the Flying Tigers in China, earning a Purple Heart among other medals. He was shot down and hiked 300 miles to safety in 32 days with the help of the Chinese underground.
After the war, Hobart joined the fire department and owned an archery shop in St. John, Oregon. He married Delores “Dot” Andrews in 1943; they were together for 56 years before she died in a traffic accident in 1998. Hobart had three children: Michael, born in 1945; Patricia, 1947; and Douglas, 1948.
Partnering with Rudy Lachenmeir, owner of Fishing and Hunting News, during the 1950s, Hobart travelled around Oregon shooting and narrating films for KGW.
In the 1960s, Hobart started his own film company, launching with two full-length feature films focusing on Alaskan wildlife. These films evolved into his series “High and Wild.” “High and Wild” was amongst the first outdoor shows to air, starting on Portland’s KGW (8) and later on KPTV (12). Episodes primarily covered Oregon, Washington, Alaska, California, Idaho, and Montana as well as parts of Canada including British Columbia.
Hobart’s subsequent series “Wild World of People” focused on the much the same region of “High and Wild” but with a focus on the unique people and events within the area, often using materials initially shot during “High and Wild.” Footage from “Wild World of People” was bought by the producers of the national show “Real People” who then incorporated some of its footage.
Hobart spent his later life living with his son Doug and daughter-in-law Sue in Scappoose, OR. Hobart died March 19, 2012, at age 95.

Biography of Benjamin Freeman Kendall:
Benjamin Freeman Kendall was a political figure and Indian agent in early Washington Territory. He owned and operated the newspaper Overland Press in Olympia, and it was there that he wrote of the incendiary activities of a Mr. Howe, a farmer of Ford's Prairie. Howe and Kendall began a feud which culminated in fight in the streets of Olympia in late 1862, Howe being wounded by Kendall's gunfire. This resulted in an incident in January of 1863 in which Howe's son Horace shot and killed Kendall at the latter's office in Olympia. Howe was arrested but acquitted, and it was rumored that Kendall's political enemies may have precipitated the assassination.

Ballot Measure 9 on the 1992 general election ballot in Oregon was an attempt by the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) to amend the Oregon constitution to prohibit the enactment of laws by the state, counties, or cities that outlaw discrimination against homosexual or bisexual persons, and to require public schools in Oregon to teach students that homosexuality was "wrong," "unnatural," "perverse," and "abnormal." The Campaign for a Hate Free Oregon (CHFO) was the organization formed to defeat Measure 9.
On November 3, 1992, after a vigorous campaign attracting national attention, Measure 9 lost 56.5% - 43.5% -- although the measure carried 21 of Oregon's 36 counties. The same day, Colorado voted on a measure (Amendment 2) containing a similar prohibition against the enactment of civil rights laws for homosexual and bisexual persons. The Colorado measure passed 53% - 47% but was ultimately found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court on May 20, 1996 in the case Romer v. Evans et al. These were the first such statewide ballot measures in the United States. Later efforts in Idaho in 1994 and Maine in 1995, and another attempt in Oregon in 1994 (Measure 13), all were defeated by voters.

Ivan L. Collins (1906-1971) was born in Dufur, Oregon and grew up in Wasco County. Operatic aspirations led him to Los Angeles in the 1930s. While in California, in 1935, Collins constructed a "prairie schooner" from a model kit while recovering from an illness. His dissatisfaction with the model's authenticity made him realize that correct knowledge about the design and construction of the entire range of recently "extinct" horse-drawn wagons of the nineteenth century was in danger of being entirely lost. From the late 1930s through the 1940s, while he earned his living constructing models at movie studios and as an aircraft mockup builder at Lockheed, Collins devoted his personal time and resources to researching and constructing wagons. By the end of the 1940s he had completed about forty wagons and had secured a publisher for Horse Power Days (Stanford University Press, 1953 / 388.3 C712h), an illustrated book about his work.
Collins moved his family to Eugene in 1950, where he worked as a designer for the University of Oregon physical plant. His ongoing avocation of model wagon building found a home at the University in 1965 when he retired to half time at the Physical Plant and became director and curator of the incipient wagon museum. He continued building and researching until his death in February 1971. Shortly thereafter, his family donated his collection and research to the Oregon Historical Society.

The First Congregational Church of Portland was founded by Reverend Horace Lyman, who began its construction in 1850 and opened it at what is today SW Second Avenue and SW Jefferson Street on June 15, 1851. A larger church was built on the same spot in 1871. It was the third church building, though, located at SW Park and Madison, which would become best known. Completed in 1895 at considerable expense, it was one of few American churches built in the Venetian Gothic style, and for several decades it was the tallest building in Portland. This building continued to house the church into the 21st century, although some of its smaller towers were removed in 1951.
Throughout its history, the First Congregational Church has been involved in music and the arts, forming its first choir in 1856, and hosting art exhibitions as early as 1875. The church also has a history in engaging social issues. It hosted a convention for women suffragists in 1905, and in 1992 its congregation voted overwhelmingly in favor of welcoming openly gay and lesbian parishioners.
Since 1960, the First Congregational Church has been a United Church of Christ church.

Biography of Julia Ruuttila:
Julia Ruuttila (1907-1991) was born in Eugene, Oregon, to John and Ella Godman, who were labor and women's suffrage activists. She grew up in logging camps and on a farm, as well as in Eugene. After one short-lived early marriage to William Bowen, Julia attended the University of Oregon during the 1925-1926 school year and then married Maurice "Butch" Bertram and had her only child, Michael Jack, in 1928. After living in California, Oregon, Denver and Chicago, the Bertrams returned to Oregon in early 1929. Butch worked at the West Oregon lumber mill in Linnton, and Julia bought a typewriter. In 1943, Julia divorced Butch and married Ben Eaton, a seaman. That marriage lasted until 1946. She married Oscar Ruuttila in 1951, and they lived in Astoria, Oregon, until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1962. They had no children but raised Julia's grandson, Shane McDonald.
Julia's labor activism included organizing for the woodworkers' union, and she was instrumental in organizing women's auxiliaries of the woodworkers' and longshoremen's unions. In 1936, Julia created the Free Ray Becker Committee to obtain the release of the last IWW prisoner from the Centralia, Washington, tragedy of 1919. She became a lifelong activist on behalf of workers, for peace, and against racial prejudice and political repression, forming many committees and participating in many protests.
Although she wrote poetry, novels, and stories, Julia became best known for her journalism. She wrote for union papers, The Timber Worker (International Woodworkers of America) and the Dispatcher (International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union); the People's World; and for Federated Press, a news service. She wrote under several names: Julia Godman, Julia Bertram, Julia Eaton, and Julia Ruuttila, as well as pen names, Kathleen Cronin and Kathleen Ruuttila.
After World War II, Julia worked as a secretary for the State Public Welfare Commission before being dismissed for her writing and political activities. She then worked as a secretary for the Longshoremen's Union and fishermen's unions. In 1956, she was subpoenaed to testify at the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in Seattle, Washington, based in part on her participation in the Oregon Committee for Protection of the Foreign Born. She had been the subject of FBI surveillance since the early 1940s.
Julia continued her journalism and activism into old age and spent much of 1970 doing interviews and research on Louise Bryant for Virginia Gardner, who published Friend and Lover: The Life of Louise Bryant in 1982. Ill health forced Julia to move to the Marshall Union Manor, a union-operated retirement home, in 1976. Soon, she was editing the Manor's newsletter. Julia became a historical resource herself, frequently speaking to high school and college classes and organizations on labor, civil rights, and women's history. She spent the last years of her life with her grandson, Shane, and his family in Anchorage, Alaska, where she continued to participate in committees and protests.

The West Coast Lumber Manufacturers Association was incorporated in 1911 in Centralia, Wash., with the merger of the Pacific Coast Lumber Manufacturers Association, the Southwest Washington Lumber Manufacturers Association, and the Oregon and Washington Lumber Manufacturers Association. The new trade association, headquartered in Tacoma, Wash., represented the Douglas fir industry, then centered in western Washington. By 1916 the organization had become the West Coast Lumbermen's Assocation (WCLA), and its offices moved to Seattle, Wash.
By the 1920s, the WCLA had become an important representative for manufacturers of Douglas fir, West Coast hemlock, Western red cedar, and Sitka spruce wood products. In 1928, Colonel William B. Greeley, former chief of the U.S. Forest Service, became the Secretary-Manager of the organization. His reforms brought loggers, wood preservation plants, mill-work plants and other related branches of the industry together into a stronger association. During the 1920s and 1930s, the center of lumber production gradually shifted from Washington to Oregon, and in 1946 the WCLA transferred its headquarters to Portland, Or.
The WCLA was incorporated under the laws of Washington as a stock corporation, with member companies each holding one share. Membership in the association was entirely voluntary. For decades the association was supported by dues assessed on logs and/or lumber produced by member companies. In 1949, the WCLA dues structure was changed to one based solely on lumber production.
The WCLA provided many services to its member companies, one of the most important being the rationalization of the largely chaotic West Coast lumber industry during the 1910s and 1920s. As the industry evolved, the association's activities became more sophisticated, and by the 1950s the WCLA supported its members in many ways. The Traffic Department negotiated with railroad, trucking and shipping lines for favorable freight rates. The Statistical Department produced regular reports about conditions within the West Coast lumber industry. The Accounting Service assisted member companies with accounting, cost analysis, and taxation problems. The Promotion Department produced literature and advertising publications, newspaper and radio spots, motion pictures, and a membership directory to market the products of the West Coast lumber industry. The Technical Service Department, staffed by engineers, conducted research to develop new and improved uses for West Coast lumber products and produced publications such as the Douglas Fir Use Book. The Public Relations Department produced stories and news releases about the positive impact of the lumber industry on the economy of the Pacific Northwest and attempted to counter negative publicity. James Stevens, Public Relations Counsel of the WCLA and author of stories about the legend of Paul Bunyan, produced hundreds of issues of Out of the Woods, a newspaper column about conditions within the industry. The Educational Program Department, which was closely related to Public Relations, provided literature, slides, filmstrips and motion pictures to schools.
The WCLA worked closely with the National Lumber Manufacturers Association (NLMA) and other regional and national organizations to advance the interests of the lumber industry. The West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau (WCLIB), a separate but closely allied organization to the WCLA, established standard lumber grading rules, maintained uniform grades, trained and supervised mill graders, licensed mills to use official grade stamps, and issued Certificates of Inspection when requested. The WCLIB concentrated on rail and truck shipments in the domestic and export markets. Another closely allied organization, the Industrial Forestry Association (IFA), promoted forest conservation practices through educational and public relations activities and served as the certifying agency of the tree farm program in the Douglas fir region of western Oregon and western Washington.
By the early 1960s, business leaders determined that a stronger regional association was needed in the face of growing national and international competition in the lumber industry. In 1964, the West Coast Lumbermen's Association merged with the Western Pine Association (WPA), a trade association which represented lumber interests east of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, Washington and California. A new organization, the Western Wood Products Association (WWPA), was formed from this union, and in 1969 the WCLA was dissolved as a corporation.

Two days later he left for San Francisco.
In 1932, Lindbergh again made headlines when his son was kidnapped and killed. The media attention during the investigation and trial convinced Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to move to Europe for several years. Returning in 1939, Charles Lindbergh became active in the America First movement opposing U.S. participation in World War II. The movement disbanded after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. During World War II, he worked with the Ford Motor Company to convert automobile plants to airplane production. In 1944 he flew many combat missions in the Pacific war, although he was a civilian.

The Reeds came to California in 1852 and soon departed for Oregon. After a number of ventures, Reed became a clerk for the Portland, Oregon, general merchandise firm of W.S. Ladd and Company. He purchased the firm in partnership with William S. Ladd's sons, forming Ladd, Reed and Company in 1859. He invested money in steamship ventures and, in 1860, became a partner with Captain John C. Ainsworth and others in the Oregon Steam and Navigation Company, the principal shipping firm on the Columbia River. In 1879, the company was purchased by railroad magnate Henry Villard and merged with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, and Reed became vice president and manager of the new firm. Reed also invested heavily in railroad, mining, land development, and industrial ventures, including the Oregon Iron and Steel Company at Oswego. Among his mining interests was the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mining & Concentrating Company in Idaho. He took an active interest in livestock breeding and owned the Ladd and Reed Farm Company, along with William S. Ladd. The company possessed large tracts of farm land in the Willamette and Tualatin valleys.
As Reed's health declined, he and Amanda Wood Reed moved from Oregon to Pasadena, California, in 1892. He planned to build a large house there at Carmelita, but died in 1895 before it was completed. Amanda Wood Reed lived in the house until her death in 1904. Reed had wanted the bulk of his estate to be used in establishing a college in Portland; however, after the death of Amanda Wood Reed, the couple's legacy became entangled in litigation. It was only through the efforts of Amanda Wood Reed's nephew, Martin Winch (who had managed the Reeds' finances for many years), that funds were eventually secured for the building of what is now Reed College.
Van Evera Bailey (1903-1980) was a Portland architect best known for his residential design work.
Charles F. Berg Company was first established as Lennon's in Portland, Or. in 1907 when the San Francisco retailer by that name purchased John Allesina's Umbrella Store at 309 Morrison Street. Charles F. Berg joined the firm that same year and moved to Portland to manage the new store. Berg sold women's specialty items such as umbrellas, gloves, and hosiery at Lennon's until 1921, when he became sole owner of the Portland store and changed its name to Charles F. Berg. Shortly thereafter, he expanded the store to include moderately priced to better women's apparel and opened shops at other downtown locations. "Who's Your Hosier?" and "Glovingly Yours" became well-known advertising slogans for the stores.
Forrest Berg joined the staff in 1922 to manage the store's newly opened Ready-to-Wear Department. At a time when most stores catered to the "mature woman," he saw a market for younger fashions, and under his direction, Berg's became a leader in selling apparel in smaller sizes to younger women. The store formed the first college board in the Pacific Northwest in 1924 and, in the early 1940s, added high school boards. These students boards, which were representative of local colleges and high schools, were employed as sales clerks on alternate Saturdays throughout the year. Board members were also actively involved in sales promotions such as fashion shows and "Date with Dad" nights. The 1920s also saw the introduction of the "Chumley" label. Later the slogan "Chumley Young Fashions" was adopted.
In 1929 Charles Berg leased and significantly renovated in the art deco style Dolph Building at 614 S.W. Broadway, and in 1930, the store moved to that location. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Sites in 1983. In response to the growth of west suburban Portland, Charles F. Berg, Inc. purchased the Dark Horse store in Beaverton in 1960. Renamed The Charles F. Berg Dark Horse, the Beaverton store operated with the same merchandise and took part in the same promotions and employee activities as the downtown Portland store. Forrest T. Berg sold the company to Rusans, a Washington clothing chain, in 1975.
For additional historical background, such as explanations of special store promotions and staff activities, see Folder A in Box 1. Included there are descriptions of store activities provided by Doris Wills Setzer, formerly Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Charles F. Berg, Inc. Ms. Setzer provided valuable assistance in organizing and identifying photographs in the collection.
Since its founding in 1898, the Oregon Historical Society has collected ephemera of all kinds, most of it documenting the history of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Around the mid-20th century, librarians at the Society began organizing these materials into what became known as "Topical Collections" formed around particular subjects, such as business and education. One such collection, "Ethnology," served as a catch-all for items related to population groups that share common ties of ancestry and culture. Often materials from other collections were separated from the original sources and added to the Ethnology Collection. Although this practice has since been discontinued, some materials are still filed in Ethnology if they come from accessions composed primarily of unrelated ephemera items. "Ethnic groups" are defined as people who are bound together by common ties of ancestry and culture.

The Special Righteousness Committee came about in opposition to the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) and their 1992 Oregon Ballot Measure 9. This measure would have amended the Oregon state constitution to define homosexuality as "abnormal" and "wrong," and would have prevented any protections of lesbian and gay citizens under state laws. The Special Righteousness Committee -- whose name was derived from the OCA's slogan "no special rights" -- used humor and elaborately illustrated graphics to lampoon the OCA initiative. The group facetiously supported additional constitutional amendments based on admonishments within the biblical book of Leviticus, such as "No special rights for oyster eaters."

June D. Drake (the middle initial "D" did not stand for anything) was born in Marquam, Oregon, in 1880 to Charles Wesley Drake and Fannie Aurora Milster Drake. In the fall of 1889, the Drake family moved to Silverton, Oregon, and Charles Drake built the family home at 401 South Water Street. He later owned the Commercial Hotel on Main Street, which was sold in 1891 to hardware store owner Adolf Wolf. Charles Drake also served as mayor of Silverton before his death in 1911.
In 1900, June D. Drake and his brother, Emory Roy Drake, founded their photography business, Drake Bros. Studio, buying out the business of pioneer Silverton photographer William L. Jones. The brothers operated their studio together until 1908, when Emory Drake left to become a music teacher in Sacramento. This studio burned to the ground on March 27, 1908, and thousands of the brothers' original negatives were destroyed. After the fire, members of the Silverton community built June Drake a temporary studio at 311 North Water Street. He operated his business there from April 1908 until September 1911, when he moved into a new studio building at 303 North Water Street. Drake continued his photography there until his retirement in 1960, when the building was sold to Standard Oil Co. and torn down.
Though he was well known for his portraiture and town scenes, one of June D. Drake's greatest achievements was the establishment of Silver Falls State Park. Beginning around 1902, he photographed the waterfalls and created brochures and booklets to bring statewide attention to the need to protect the land from logging interests. Working with Silverton and Salem citizens and Oregon state legislators, Drake organized an effort to buy the land around the falls and sell it to the state. On April 2, 1931, the Oregon State Park Commission accepted the proposal, and Silver Falls State Park officially opened to the public in July 1933. Many of the signs still in existence in the park were originally erected by June Drake, and Drake Falls in the park was named after him.
June D. Drake married Eleanor Schoenfield in 1904. The couple's home in Silverton was the first in the town to be wired for electricity. The Drakes had two children, Charles Henry, born in 1909, and Ardith Maxine, born in 1915. In addition to his career as a photographer, June Drake was also a member of the Knights of Pythias and served as secretary of the Silverton Chamber of Commerce, chief of the Silverton Fire Department, and a member of the city council. He also founded the Silverton Historical Society in 1930.

Ephraim Peter Roberts was born at Danbury, Vermont, October 23, 1825. After completing studies at Williams College in 1854, he entered Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine, and was ordained by the Congregational Church at Bangor on July 28, 1857. On September 8, 1857, he married Myra Holman Farrington of Holden, Maine, born there September 22, 1835. Both having been certified as missionaries by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, they sailed from Boston on October 30, 1857, en route to Micronesia via Cape Horn and Honolulu. Fellow passengers on the Eliza and Ella were the David Dwight Baldwins, also newlyweds, on their way to the American Board mission at Lahaina, Maui.
After a six month voyage to Honolulu, the Roberts stayed there three months until the missionary packet Morning Star was made ready for its second voyage to Micronesia. The ship sailed June 30, 1858, with Ephraim and Myra Roberts, Mrs. Luther Halsey Gulick and three of her children, and Mrs. Gulick's brother-in-law, Theodore W. Gulick. They arrived at Ponape, Caroline Islands, on August 18th.
The Roberts spent the next three years at Shalong, Ponape, replacing Dr. and Mrs. Luther H. Gulick who, with the A. A. Sturges', had established the Ponape mission in 1852. During these years the first two of the Roberts' nine children were born. By mid-summer of 1861 their fellow missionaries to Micronesia decided that the Roberts' should leave Ponape for a number reasons. Two-year-old Charlotte Roberts had somewhat fragile health, and fear for her life was heightened by the death of the Sturges' little girl at Ronkiti, Ponape. Also, whaling vessels were calling less frequently at the islands, life there was increasingly isolated, and mission work was not proceeding as had been hoped. When Mrs. Sturges's health seriously failed, making necessary her return to Honolulu, the Roberts were urged to go too.
They again sailed on the Morning Star, in July of 1861, wound up their American Board affairs in Honolulu, and embarked for San Francisco in September. From there they sailed to Portland, Oregon, and settled for a time at White Salmon, Washington Territory. In 1868 they took up a homestead near The Dalles, Oregon, engaged in sheep raising and fruit growing, and devoted much time to the Congregational Church in that area. Ephraim Roberts died February 6, 1893, and Myra Roberts died February 18, 1912.
The Valley Migrant League (VML), which was founded in 1964, was first funded in May 1965 by the Office of Economic Opportunity as part of Great Society anti-poverty programs to serve migrant farm workers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. It operated programs until the mid-1970s.
The VML established its administrative headquarters in Woodburn, with Area Opportunity Centers in Aumsville, Dayton, Hillsboro, Independence, Salem, Sandy, and Woodburn. Initially, the board and administration was predominately non-farm worker, but by 1967, more than half of the board was composed of seasonal or ex-seasonal farm workers. By 1968, farm workers dominated the VML's operations.
Other Valley Migrant League programs included adult education through evening classes, Winter Day Schools, and existing community schools; publication of a newspaper, Opportunity News (and later Relampago); job development, counseling and placement; housing; and child care centers.

Portland, Oregon, began as a clearing on the west bank of the Willamette River in 1844. The new city was incorporated in 1851 and prospered because of its advantageous location near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, among other factors. Its growth was spurred by flourishing agriculture in the Willamette Valley, the California gold rush, the Indian wars of the 1850s, and gold discoveries in eastern Oregon and Idaho in the 1860s. By the Civil War, Portland was the principal metropolis of the Pacific Northwest with a population of around 3000. The arrival of the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads in 1883 and 1884 contributed to a new boom in prosperity, and in 1891 the city annexed the municipalities of Albina and East Portland on the east side of the Willamette. Residential growth was most dramatic in the eastern districts after 1900, and expansion was especially rapid after the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. By 1910 Portland's population was over 207,000, and it continued its rapid growth up to the 1930s.

Mary V. Dodge was born Mary Bourne Thompson in 1876 in Arkansas. As a child, she was introduced to the violin while attending a school run by Catholic nuns; the instrument became so important to her that she later changed her middle initial to "V," for "Violin." She moved to Portland, Oregon, in the 1890s, where she taught at the Shattuck School. In 1910, she married Mott Dodge, a civil engineer. Soon after, the couple moved to Burns, Oregon, when Mott Dodge got a job platting roads. While in Burns, Mary V. Dodge played violin for the local children, and then established a children's orchestra, the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra. The Sagebrush Symphony played its first concert in Burns in 1912, and in subsequent years toured throughout Oregon. These tours were interrupted by the United States' entry into World War I, and the orchestra disbanded when Dodge moved back to Portland in 1918.
In Portland, Dodge became the music director at Irvington School. In 1923, she engaged Russian immigrant Jacques Gershkovitch to lead this orchestra, which became the Portland Junior Symphony (later the Portland Youth Philharmonic) and gave its first public performance on February 14, 1925. Dodge continued to teach violin. She died on New Year's Eve, 1954.

Walter Boychuk (1886-1967) worked as a photographer in Oregon for half a century, making portraits of everyone from ordinary citizens to nationally known figures, including Sen. Wayne Morse, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lowell Thomas, and Norman Thomas.
Boychuk was born Oct. 25, 1886, at Galatia, Austria. He immigrated to Canada in 1903 and came to Portland in 1906, where he began working as a photographer around 1912. For a few years during the late 1920s, he was associated with photographer Frank I. Jones in Boychuk-Jones Studio. They did commercial photography for the Portland Commission on Public Docks, Port of Portland, and other clients. Beginning about 1930, Boychuk operated Boychuk Studio at various locations in Portland until 1949. At that time he estimated he had served 8,000 customers. He continued to work out of his farm home near Tigard in semi-retirement.
In addition to his portrait and commercial work, Boychuk also gained recognition for his architectural and scenic photography. He photographed the buildings designed by a number of prominent architects. In 1930, he was selected by a committee of the Oregon chapter of the American Institute of Architects to create a portfolio of Oregon landmarks for submission to the Pictorial Archives of Early American Architecture. This was a project of the Library of Congress, funded by the Carnegie Foundation. Boychuk also served as photographer for the subsequent Historic American Buildings Survey in the mid-1930s.
Based on his architectural work, Boychuk was named official photographer for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition at San Francisco. There he spent two months photographing fair buildings, inside and out and under different lighting conditions, in both black-and-white and color. He also was an avid mountaineer, skier, and member of the Mazamas mountaineering organization.
Although relatively little known compared with other Oregon photographers such as Ray Atkeson and Benjamin Gifford, Boychuk brought his artist’s eye and meticulous printing skills to a body of work that is among the best produced in the state.

Flax was grown at least by 1844 near Tualatin, and was grown by other farmers throughout the mid-19th century. A flax oil mill was established at Salem in 1867, and the first flax-spinning mill was operating at Albany by the 1870s. An exhibit of Oregon flax won the bronze medal and certificate of merit at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876. By the 1890s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was touting Oregon and Washington as good flax growing areas; however, costly hand labor required to harvest and process it and competition with European producers limited flax production.
In 1915, the state of Oregon built a flax processing plant at the state penitentiary in Salem, and this plant became known as the State Flax Industry. The state joined the Works Progress Administration to construct three cooperative processing plants at Springfield, Canby, and Mount Angel in 1936. Six processing plants and two spinning mills were operating in Oregon by 1941, and production reached its peak during World War II.
The state’s flax production, which continued to be centered in the Willamette Valley, primarily produced linen tow, rope, and other lower grade products rather than fine linen.

Measure 13 was a ballot measure placed on the ballot for the 1994 November election in Oregon. The measure, written by the right-wing group Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), called for the state constitution to be amended so that homosexuals were denied “minority status” protections, and so that public schools and other organizations would be barred from “promoting or expressing approval of homosexuality.” The measure was remarkably similar to 1992’s Measure 9, which had also been authored by the Oregon Citizens Alliance and been defeated at the polls. Thanks to a vigorous opposition campaign, Measure 13 also failed at the polls, with 52% of voters rejecting the measure. In the aftermath of the 1994 election, staffers from the No on 13 campaign formed the gay rights advocacy group Basic Rights Oregon.
Measure 36 was a 2004 Oregon initiative which sought to amend the state constitution so as to explicitly define marriage as being between one man and one woman. Basic Rights Oregon led the campaign opposing the measure. However, the measure ultimately passed, 56.63% to 43.37%, and the Oregon Constitution was amended so as to officially bar legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In May 2014, United States District Judge Michael McShane ruled that the clause prohibiting same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, as it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution’s 14th Amendment. Since then, Oregon has legally recognized same-sex marriages.

Biography of Benjamin Franklin Dowell:
Benjamin Franklin Dowell was born in Albemarle County, Virginia, in 1821. He received his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1847. He practiced law briefly in Tennessee before heading to the California gold fields in 1850. After a few months he moved north to Oregon, becoming a packer and trader in Jacksonville in 1852. In 1857 he returned to the practice of law, opening an office in Jacksonville. He married Anna Campbell in 1861. They had three children: Fannie, Annie, and Benjamin Franklin Jr. In 1885 they moved to Portland, and B.F. began to divide his time between Portland and Washington, D.C., where he prosecuted Indian war claims before Congress. Also in 1885 he purchased the Oregon Sentinel newspaper, which he published until his death in 1897.
Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) was created on March 2, 1970, by the merger of four primary railroads: Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. (CB&Q); Northern Pacific Railway Co. (NP); Great Northern Railway Co. (GN); and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway Co. (SP&S).

George W. Wood was a Columbia River bar pilot who lived in Astoria. He was born in 1844. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1863 and discharged in 1865. He came to Astoria in 1867 with the United States Geodetic Survey. He died in 1915.
Lewis R. Fields (1856-1924) came to Portland, Oregon, in 1875 and began working for the Southern Pacific Railroad, ultimately becoming general superintendent of the system's lines in Oregon. He retired in 1914.
William Sherman Burgoyne was born on October 24, 1901 in Stevensville, Montana, to James Henry and Lola Helena Burgoyne. He was a descendant of the British general John Burgoyne, who had been defeated at the Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolution. William S. Burgoyne attended several institutions of higher education, including the Kimball School of Theology at Willamette University, and became a Methodist minister.
During his career as minister, which lasted until his retirement in 1957, Reverend Burgoyne preached in a number of Oregon towns including Hood River, McFarland, LaGrande, Turner, Cresswell, Sheridan, Lakewood, and Marshfield, as well as in Portland, Oregon, and Spokane, Washington. In 1934, he took a trip to the Holy Land, and for several years afterwards gave lectures at various Oregon churches about his experiences and observations from his travels.
In 1944, while Burgoyne was minister at the Asbury Methodist Church in Hood River, Oregon, the local chapter of the American Legion removed the names of 16 Japanese Americans from local memorial listing local citizens serving in the Armed Forces, claiming that they were dual citizens of Japan and the United States, and therefore suspect and unwelcome. Burgoyne publicly criticized the move, and he and his wife Doris gained national attention for their unyielding stance against bigotry and discrimination. Although his speaking out earned the enmity of locals and led to a decline in his church’s membership, in 1947 the Council Against Intolerance in America honored Burgoyne with the Thomas Jefferson Prize.
In addition to his preaching and social activism, Burgoyne joined the Grand Lodge of Oregon Freemasons in 1941, and was involved with the Masons for the rest of his life. He was elected Master of the Hood River Lodge in 1944.
Burgoyne married Doris Caple in 1920, with whom he had one daughter, Ruth. He died while on vacation in Yuma, Arizona, in 1964.

The Social Hygiene Society of Portland, Oregon was established in 1911, at the urging of the Young Men's Christian Association, to limit the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and to combat "social vices" such as prostitution, gambling, and childhood immorality. The organization, which was renamed the Oregon Social Hygiene Society in 1913, promoted physical fitness, especially among young people, and exposed medical quackery. It also helped to organize local promotion committees in cities and towns around Oregon. The group focused on educational activities such as lectures, classes, and presentations to school groups, as well as publications, exhibits, government lobbying, and assistance with law enforcement. Committees included: public education, school cooperation, publication, social hygiene, exhibits, social evil, legislation, and quackery. Much of the funding for the organization came from a trust fund established by Dr. E. C. Brown. Its operations were later assumed by the University of Oregon.
Dr. Fred B. Messing was executive secretary of the Oregon Social Hygiene Society from 1929 to 1941. He was born in North Tonawanda, New York, around 1876, and he held a Ph.D. in physical education. Much of his early career was spent working with the YMCA, lecturing on health and sex education to schools, civic organizations, and churches. From 1919 to 1922, he and his wife, Frances, lived in Poland, where Messing directed physical education for the Polish government. After living in Portland for most of his later life, he moved to Chehalis, Washington, where he died in 1960.

Joseph L. Miller (1910- ), a native of Chicago, trained as a medical doctor. He moved to Oregon in 1940 with his wife, Amy, and he opened a medical practice in Portland, Or. In 1948, the family bought 94 acres near the Bull Run Reserve, in the vicinity of Marmot, Clackamas County, Oregon. There they built a small cabin, mostly for summer camping, and in 1975 established a permanent home on three acres. They donated the remaining 91 acres to the Portland Audubon Society in 1977.
In 1971, Miller discovered that the United States Forest Service (USFS) had, since 1958, allowed commercial logging in the watershed in spite of a 1904 Trespass Act and planned to open a 30,000-acre area for recreational purposes. Such strong opposition was expressed at a public meeting, which Miller attended, that the USFS and the Portland Water Bureau withdrew the plan. Miller then began a systematic effort to collect and disseminate information on the Bull Run Reserve to focus public attention on the need for watershed protection. In 1974, he organized the Bull Run Citizens' Advisory Committee, which evolved into the Bull Run Interest Group (BRIG) by 1975. BRIG was active at varying levels until about 1993. Miller was most concerned about the secrecy and lack of public information and input that he believed characterized the activities of the USFS and Portland Water Bureau, which managed the Bull Run Watershed.
In 1975, Miller and two co-plaintiffs initiated a class-action lawsuit against the USFS for allowing public access and logging in violation of the Trespass Act and won their case. However, in 1977 Congress nullified the act, and new legislation, introduced by Rep. Robert Duncan and Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, specified that the Bull Run Reserve could be managed by the Forest Service according to prevailing multiple-use principles. Use of the watershed need not be confined to water production, though that use should be primary.
Miller's crusade to restore the protections of the Trespass Act continued after 1977, and, with the public scrutiny that he inspired, serious degradation of the watershed diminished. His efforts included further litigation and stays to stop what he considered to be dubious timber sales after “blowdowns.”
D. P. Thompson Company handled the investments and properties of the estate of David Preston Thompson (1834-1901), a businessman and mayor of Portland, Oregon.
The Lewis & Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair was an international event celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expedition. It was held in Portland, Oregon, from June 1 to October 15, 1905, and was designed to promote trade between the Pacific Northwest and Asia, to promote the wealth of Oregon through its forestry, industry and agriculture, and to promote the arts of the region.
Plans for a Portland exposition were considered as early as 1895, but it was not until 1900 that a provisional commitee of Portland businessmen began to seriously develop the idea. In December of that year the Oregon Historical Society and Oregonian editor Harvey Scott proposed holding the fair in 1905 as the centennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Besides Scott, the early leaders of the effort were banker and former U.S. senator Henry W. Corbett, who became the exposition corporation's first president, and J. M. Long of the Portland Board of Trade. Incorporation papers were filed in October of 1901 and journalist Henry E. Reed was hired to promote the enterprise throughout the U.S. and abroad. In November of 1901, $300,000 of stock was issued and quickly purchased. The involvement of the state of Oregon was coordinated by the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission with Jefferson Myers as chairman. By September of 1902 a site for the fair had been chosen — the Guild's Lake area northwest of downtown Portland. Work began in the early months of 1903. Later that year Harvey Scott assumed the presidency of the corporation after the death of Henry Corbett. A long campaign to gain U.S. Government support succeeded finally in April of 1904 with President Roosevelt's signing of an appropration bill.
The original layout of the exposition grounds was developed by John Olmsted, son of Central Park's planner Frederick Law Olmsted. The work of construction was overseen by Oskar Huber, Superintendent of Works, and architectural decisions were made by Portland architect Ion Lewis. Using as a model the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the main buildings of the Portland fair were situated on a ridge overlooking Guild's Lake and the Willamette River, with massive exhibition halls fronting a central "sunken garden" which led down the hill to a stepped esplanade and a bandstand at the water's edge. A street of amusement concessions called The Trail led to the long Bridge of Nations which connected the shore to the U.S. Government Island containing a massive double-towered pavilion. Notable among the other exposition buildings were the American Inn — a vast hotel for visitors situated at lakeside — and the Forestry Building — a huge log cabin made from gigantic tree trunks, which survived until destroyed by fire in the 1960s.
Although Portland's exposition was one of many world's fairs that took place around the same time, its managers learned much from the efforts of other cities, most notably St. Louis's Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. The Portland fair was promoted at St. Louis by Colonel Henry E. Dosch, who headed the Oregon section and served later as Director of Exhibits of the Lewis & Clark fair. Many of Portland's exhibits and amusements came directly from St. Louis.
Among the the thousands of exhibits, the most popular was that of Japan, situated in the Oriental Exhibit Palace. The amusements of The Trail were not as well-attended as hoped, this due in part to efforts at a Sunday closure. Aside from trained elks, baby incubators, aerial artists, and other acts, the most elaborate of the shows was Bolossy Kiralfy's Carnival of Venice — an extravagnza involving hundreds of dancers on a 400-foot stage. Also held at the fair were a number of national and international conferences and congresses, among them a women's suffrage congress attended by Susan B. Anthony, an historical conference, and a national educational conference.
The administration of the exposition was handled with great effeciency. Heading the corporation was the President (orignally the Director-General), H. W. Goode. Henry E. Reed was the corporations' Secretary and also the Exposition's Director of Exploitation. Other officers were Director of Exhibits Henry E. Dosch; John A. Wakefield, Director of Concessions and Admissions; Ion Lewis, Director of Architecture; Frank Vincent Du Mond, Chief of Fine Arts; J. F. Batchelder, Superintendent of Mines and Metallurgy; and Oskar Huber, Director of Works.
The exposition was a great success on many levels. Attendance figures were 1,558,000 paid admissions and 966,000 free passes, well above projections. The corporation made a net profit of $84,461 and was one of the few U.S. expositions to end with a positive balance. More importantly, the fair succeeded in promoting Oregon in general and Portland in particular. It is likely that the exposition contributed substantially to Portland's great economic and population boom from 1905 to 1912.

Filmed on a large construction site, this reel demonstrates the use of a large chute for delivering concrete several stories below street level. Mixers pour concrete directly into some of the chutes which appear to be about two stories long. Other trucks pour their loads into hoppers which lift the concrete up to the beginning of the chute. All of the chutes are delivering concrete to a rebar-covered floor area.
The film begins with concrete being poured into a portable mixer truck at Swigert, Hart & Yett's main plant. Gravel is delivered, and dumped into a pit from where a conveyor belt takes it up to the hopper to be added to the mixture. The scene moves to a road-paving site where several children watch the crew pouring and smoothing the cement. Mr. Yett explains the procedure to Mr. Morse and Mr. Fleming. Hoses sprinkle water on the curing concrete after it has been leveled and tamped using a long board. The group next moves to an alley in a residential area where there is little extra space between the houses to demonstrate how well the mixer trucks work in tight areas. The men stand on boards suspended over the street to smooth the concrete as there is no room to use their usual long-handled rollers. The film ends with Mr. Buck inspecting a newly paved road.

There is also a scene of men using chewing tobacco.
The film begins with a steam-powered pile driver working in the midst of a large construction site. Part of the site is a lumber storage yard for the building of forms. After the pilings are all in place, reinforcing steel rods are laid in a mesh over them. There are many scenes of the concrete being poured by wheelbarrows on various levels of the construction, and men adjusting equipment throughout the site. By the end of the film the grain silos are more than one story high. In the final scenes, a man sits atop the chute pouring cement from the hopper into the wheelbarrows to operate the control gate.
The film opens with a close look at the retaining walls on the 10th Avenue ramp to the Broadway Bridge. The next section shows concrete being poured between the ties on railway tracks, and steel reinforcement being wired together. There are several views of timber falsework, followed by digging using dragline and shovels. The end of the film returns to the Broadway Bridge site.

He became an expert at taking shots of people, and his photography of children is particularly striking. The collection includes prints, negatives, slides, and lantern slides. Amos Burg appears in many photographs throughout the collection.

He may not have had a camera until he shipped on the SS
Katia in September 1918, so voyages before that time are documented by postcards and other photomechanical prints and a teenager's purple prose. Most of Burg's photographs in this album document his voyage aboard the Katia on the Northern Circle route to Japan and on to other Asian ports, then through the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal to Marseilles, France. The 2.5-inch by 3.5-inch prints are fading, but they give a hint of the photographic strengths and skills Burg would develop, particularly in photographing people.

Included at the end of the collection is a series of reproductions of the Collins drawings, including negatives, for reference use.

Boychuk donated his photographic collection to the Oregon Historical Society about six months before his death in 1967. The collection represents the images he had retained until that time, and it provides a good sample of the kinds of photographic work he did during the course of his career. The images date from circa 1915 through the 1960s, but the bulk of the collection is from the 1920s through the 1940s.
Group 1 of this collection contains biographical material on Walter Boychuk and his wife, Anna, that was collected while this collection was being processed. Group 2 consists of the copy prints made from Boychuk’s original negatives; this representative sampling of his work was printed courtesy of a conservation grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust and contains photographs taken by Boychuk of various locations in Oregon and other states, portraits, ships and transportation, and other subjects, as well as his work for the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1930-1951 and the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1940. Group 3 is a collection of signed, mounted prints of architectural images, which Boychuk made for the Pictorial Archives of Early American Architecture at the Library of Congress in 1930, and includes some produced for the Historic American Buildings Survey as well; these are annotated with his negative numbers. Group 4 consists of a printed booklet of photomechanical reproductions of Boychuk's photographs, entitled "Pictorial Oregon." Group 5 consists of an oversized album, titled “Pacific Northwest by Boychuk,” which provides a retrospective of images Boychuk made throughout his career, most identified in his handwriting and annotated with his negative numbers.
The group includes a folder of background material on the Boychuks and their studio collected in the course of processing the collection. It also includes photographs of Walter and Anna Boychuk and personal greeting cards they created using his photographs.
The prints made at the Oregon Historical Society from Walter Boychuk’s original negatives represent the full range of his photographic work: architectural, portrait, landscape, and commercial. The Oregon Historical Society made prints from Boychuk’s original negatives circa 1970, and these were placed in the Photograph Subject Files in the Research Library. Around 1998, the Meyer Memorial Trust funded a negative survey and preservation printing of the collection. Prints from both of these projects are included in Group 1.

Images document Joseph L. Miller's crusade to protect the Bull Run Reserve and watershed from logging and recreation damage and to expand public awareness of the threat to its famed pristine water through formation of the Bull Run Interest Group (BRIG) and lawsuits he initiated against the U.S. Forest Service. Bull Run is the main source of water for Portland, Or., and other smaller communities in the area. Photographs showing the impact of logging on the Bull Run Watershed make up the bulk of the collection. Primary formats represented are black-and-white and color photographic prints, ranging from snapshot size to 8x10 (some with negatives), black-and-white and color aerial photographs, and 35 mm color slides. Some prints are attached to two posters, and the collection also includes two color postcards and related papers.
Miller made some of the photographs himself and obtained the remainder from other photographers and sources, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Forest Service. Many of the black-and-white and color images were used to illustrate publications produced by BRIG and by Miller personally, and two groups are marked as exhibits in class action lawsuits that Miller and others brought against the U.S. Forest Service.

The records of the exposition cover all aspects of the enterprise, from its inception to its final demolition. The bulk of the materials cover the years 1904 and 1905 and relate to the logistics of organizing exhibits and concessions, hiring workers, planning the fair grounds, constructing the buildings, and operating the Exposition on a day-to-day basis.
Because of the broad scope of the Exposition, the collection provides a valuable documentation of all manner of commercial, industrial, agricultural, and entertainment enterprises taking place the years 1904-1905. Especially well documented are Oregon's own enterprises. A comprehensive list of award recipients can be found in the series "Division of Exhibits," subseries "Awards."
Extensive correspondence with bands, orchestras, and other musical organizations is noteworthy, as are letters from all manner of entertainers. A file of letters and photographs from the prize fighter John L. Sullivan is of particular interest. Another significant group of materials are the employment inquiries from hundreds of people seeking positions with the fair company, including a large percentage of women. The records of the Oregon Education Exhibits contain a large number of bound books of student writing, drawings, and photographs.
Although most officers of the Exposition are represented, a large percentage of the correspondence comes from the offices of the President, Henry W. Goode; the Secretary and Director of Exploitation, Henry E. Reed; the Director of Exhibits, Henry E. Dosch; and the Director of Concessions and Admissions, John Wakefield. In some cases files of correspondence between two particular officers can be found under each of the officers' departments. Most files contain both incoming letters and carbon copies of outgoing letters.
Although written records of construction are included — such as specifications for some buildings — very few blueprints or scale drawings are present. A large collection of blueprints and scale drawings of the exposition is held by the Oregon State Archives in Salem. Visual documentation is provided by a series of illustrated works in the series "Publications," however the bulk of the photographic record is housed in the photograph collection of the Oregon Historical Society in the Kiser Collection (Org. Lot 140).

The film shows the stockpiles of gravel and sand, the bags of dry cement along the side of the project, and the mixing machine which produced each load of concrete.
Filmed on a large construction site, this reel demonstrates the use of a large chute for delivering concrete several stories below street level. Mixers pour concrete directly into some of the chutes which appear to be about two stories long. Other trucks pour their loads into hoppers which lift the concrete up to the beginning of the chute. All of the chutes are delivering concrete to a rebar-covered floor area.
The film begins with concrete being poured into a portable mixer truck at Swigert, Hart & Yett's main plant. Gravel is delivered, and dumped into a pit from where a conveyor belt takes it up to the hopper to be added to the mixture. The scene moves to a road-paving site where several children watch the crew pouring and smoothing the cement. Mr. Yett explains the procedure to Mr. Morse and Mr. Fleming. Hoses sprinkle water on the curing concrete after it has been leveled and tamped using a long board. The group next moves to an alley in a residential area where there is little extra space between the houses to demonstrate how well the mixer trucks work in tight areas. The men stand on boards suspended over the street to smooth the concrete as there is no room to use their usual long-handled rollers. The film ends with Mr. Buck inspecting a newly paved road.
Appearing: Clay S. Morse (Multnomah County commissioner), Porter W. Yett (Manager, Swigert, Hart & Yett, Inc.), Angus Fleming (chief Portland city street inspector), George Buck (Multnomah County road master).

The film shows the construction of a ramp to the Broadway Bridge, emphasizing the retaining walls and the closely spaced reinforcing steel that the concrete must surround. There are also scenes (repeated in other films) that show the Portland railyards, men wiring reinforcing steel rods together into a framework, the use of timber falsework, excavating with dragline and shovels, and a elevator used to raise concrete from the mixer truck to the hopper for filling wheelbarrows. There is also a scene of men using chewing tobacco.
The film begins with a steam-powered pile driver working in the midst of a large construction site. Part of the site is a lumber storage yard for the building of forms. After the pilings are all in place, reinforcing steel rods are laid in a mesh over them. There are many scenes of the concrete being poured by wheelbarrows on various levels of the construction, and men adjusting equipment throughout the site. By the end of the film the grain silos are more than one story high. In the final scenes, a man sits atop the chute pouring cement from the hopper into the wheelbarrows to operate the control gate.
The film opens with a close look at the retaining walls on the 10th Avenue ramp to the Broadway Bridge. The next section shows concrete being poured between the ties on railway tracks, and steel reinforcement being wired together. There are several views of timber falsework, followed by digging using dragline and shovels. The end of the film returns to the Broadway Bridge site.
The film shows two paving projects. The first widens East Broadway (now NE Broadway) by several feet on each edge of the street. One side of the street is nearly finished when this footage was taken. Workmen are pouring and filling the other side. Traffic moves down the middle of the road, on the old street bed, and on the side streets. The second project is the paving of Omaha Avenue (now N. Omaha Ave.). One side of the street has been finished, and work continues on the other half. The project is inspected by several men, including Charles Swigert, part owner of Perfect Mix Cement.

The Ivan Collins papers, 1903-1971, document research, publication and exhibition activities pertaining to Collins' studies, construction and models of horse-drawn vehicles. The collection concentrates on the period from about 1940 to 1971. Much of the collection preserves correspondence between Collins and the other wagon research experts in the United States. Numerous newspaper and magazine clippings reflect Collins' obsession with his topic. Of particular historical interest is both the scale plans of his wagons, which hold specific construction details that are now difficult to find, and the journals, notes and sketches which document how Collins located examples to work from and how he learned to construct historically accurate models.
Included at the end of the collection is a series of reproductions of the Collins drawings, including negatives, for reference use.
Drawings of wagons, many taken in the field by Collins, arranged by wagon type.

Boychuk donated his photographic collection to the Oregon Historical Society about six months before his death in 1967. The collection represents the images he had retained until that time, and it provides a good sample of the kinds of photographic work he did during the course of his career. The images date from circa 1915 through the 1960s, but the bulk of the collection is from the 1920s through the 1940s.
Group 1 of this collection contains biographical material on Walter Boychuk and his wife, Anna, that was collected while this collection was being processed. Group 2 consists of the copy prints made from Boychuk’s original negatives; this representative sampling of his work was printed courtesy of a conservation grant from the Meyer Memorial Trust and contains photographs taken by Boychuk of various locations in Oregon and other states, portraits, ships and transportation, and other subjects, as well as his work for the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1930-1951 and the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1940. Group 3 is a collection of signed, mounted prints of architectural images, which Boychuk made for the Pictorial Archives of Early American Architecture at the Library of Congress in 1930, and includes some produced for the Historic American Buildings Survey as well; these are annotated with his negative numbers. Group 4 consists of a printed booklet of photomechanical reproductions of Boychuk's photographs, entitled "Pictorial Oregon." Group 5 consists of an oversized album, titled “Pacific Northwest by Boychuk,” which provides a retrospective of images Boychuk made throughout his career, most identified in his handwriting and annotated with his negative numbers.
The group includes a folder of background material on the Boychuks and their studio collected in the course of processing the collection. It also includes photographs of Walter and Anna Boychuk and personal greeting cards they created using his photographs.
The prints made at the Oregon Historical Society from Walter Boychuk’s original negatives represent the full range of his photographic work: architectural, portrait, landscape, and commercial. The Oregon Historical Society made prints from Boychuk’s original negatives circa 1970, and these were placed in the Photograph Subject Files in the Research Library. Around 1998, the Meyer Memorial Trust funded a negative survey and preservation printing of the collection. Prints from both of these projects are included in Group 1.

Images document Joseph L. Miller's crusade to protect the Bull Run Reserve and watershed from logging and recreation damage and to expand public awareness of the threat to its famed pristine water through formation of the Bull Run Interest Group (BRIG) and lawsuits he initiated against the U.S. Forest Service. Bull Run is the main source of water for Portland, Or., and other smaller communities in the area. Photographs showing the impact of logging on the Bull Run Watershed make up the bulk of the collection. Primary formats represented are black-and-white and color photographic prints, ranging from snapshot size to 8x10 (some with negatives), black-and-white and color aerial photographs, and 35 mm color slides. Some prints are attached to two posters, and the collection also includes two color postcards and related papers.
Miller made some of the photographs himself and obtained the remainder from other photographers and sources, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Forest Service. Many of the black-and-white and color images were used to illustrate publications produced by BRIG and by Miller personally, and two groups are marked as exhibits in class action lawsuits that Miller and others brought against the U.S. Forest Service.
Includes black-and-white and color photographic prints.

The file is open for anyone to add information or views; for anyone to help seek and index new material; for anyone to study.” The primary version of the file remains available in the Multnomah County Central Library (Portland, Or.) Government Documents Room (2004).

The records of the exposition cover all aspects of the enterprise, from its inception to its final demolition. The bulk of the materials cover the years 1904 and 1905 and relate to the logistics of organizing exhibits and concessions, hiring workers, planning the fair grounds, constructing the buildings, and operating the Exposition on a day-to-day basis.
Because of the broad scope of the Exposition, the collection provides a valuable documentation of all manner of commercial, industrial, agricultural, and entertainment enterprises taking place the years 1904-1905. Especially well documented are Oregon's own enterprises. A comprehensive list of award recipients can be found in the series "Division of Exhibits," subseries "Awards."
Extensive correspondence with bands, orchestras, and other musical organizations is noteworthy, as are letters from all manner of entertainers. A file of letters and photographs from the prize fighter John L. Sullivan is of particular interest. Another significant group of materials are the employment inquiries from hundreds of people seeking positions with the fair company, including a large percentage of women. The records of the Oregon Education Exhibits contain a large number of bound books of student writing, drawings, and photographs.
Although most officers of the Exposition are represented, a large percentage of the correspondence comes from the offices of the President, Henry W. Goode; the Secretary and Director of Exploitation, Henry E. Reed; the Director of Exhibits, Henry E. Dosch; and the Director of Concessions and Admissions, John Wakefield. In some cases files of correspondence between two particular officers can be found under each of the officers' departments. Most files contain both incoming letters and carbon copies of outgoing letters.
Although written records of construction are included — such as specifications for some buildings — very few blueprints or scale drawings are present. A large collection of blueprints and scale drawings of the exposition is held by the Oregon State Archives in Salem. Visual documentation is provided by a series of illustrated works in the series "Publications," however the bulk of the photographic record is housed in the photograph collection of the Oregon Historical Society in the Kiser Collection (Org. Lot 140).
Includes committee minute books and materials related to stock and stockholders.
