      <p>Clippings, speeches, press releases, biographical information, and occasional copies of letters and memoranda by and about Bank Presidents Eugene Meyer, John J. McCloy, George D. Woods, Robert S. McNamara, A.W. Clausen, and Barber C. Conable, Jr. Pre-presidential material, primarily speeches, is included for McNamara, Clausen, and Conable, and post-presidential material is included on McNamara.
<lb/>
<lb/>Material on McNamara makes up the bulk of this collection. Clippings and speeches that were maintained in McNamara's office as a reference set during his Presidency were brought to the Library, probably by Blanche Moore, one of McNamara's assistants, who went to work for the Joint Library after McNamara retired. These items from McNamara's office formed the basis of the Joint Library collection; consequently, the materials on McNamara are far more complete than those on any of the other presidents.
<lb/>
<lb/>The series is accompanied by an index to items within the series, arranged by President. A section of the index refersto items on Eugene Black, which are not present in the collection.</p>
