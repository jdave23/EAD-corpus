<p>Management of World Bank records was originally undertaken according to a central filing system adopted in 1946. It included records originating from all parts of the Bank, with the exception of the records of the offices of the President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Personnel and Legal departments. The records were filed in four sections: operational files by region and country; general files on all topics not specific to a region or country; membership, bond, and finance files; and official documents. From this early period, it is the "Operational Files" which are included in this fonds.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1972, separate Regional Information Service Centers (RISCs) for the new Regional Vice Presidencies were established under the general control of the Central Files Unit. As responsibility for operations in sub-Saharan Africa was divided into separate Regional Vice Presidencies (RVPs) at this time, a RISC for each RVP was established; the East Africa Region RISC was opened in January 1973 and the West Africa Region RISC was opened in January 1974. When the two African RVPs combined in 1987, so did the two African RISCs, forming a single Africa Regional Information Service Center. Within these RISCs the records were maintained in the same basic order as they had been during the 1946-1971 period; that is, the regional general files were handled as one body of records followed by files maintained on each country.
<lb/>
<lb/>It was the responsibility of the Region and its units to regularly transfer official country and regional operational records to their RISC. In practice, however, regional front offices and the various RVP units did not always do this and would instead maintain their records on their own. By the late 1980s it became apparent that gaps in the Records Centers' holdings existed. In part to rectify this situation, the Regional units began, in 1992, to send records directly to the Archives rather than to the appropriate filing center. The "official" records of the regional operations were still required to be transferred to information centers until 1998 when all RISCS were terminated.
<lb/>
<lb/>When the RISCs were discontinued in 1998, all records-keeping responsibilities were turned over to the regional offices. According to the Bank's Administrative Manual Statement 10.11: Management of Records, "Individual units maintain custody of their active records until such time that they are either transferred to the Archives or destroyed in accordance with approved records retention and disposition schedules. The WBG Archives has custody and control over access to records over20 years old." In practice, this means that records are often transferred to the Archives at a point before they reach 20 years of age and are therefore still technically the property of the originating department even though physically they are in the care of the Archives. While the records are still less than 20 years old the originating department is able to request and use the records they have transferred to the Archives.
<lb/>
<lb/>Some of the records in the "operational records" and "Regional operational records" series were subject to archival processing in the early 1990s that resulted in new series classifications being created and ascribed. Initially, the country files from the period 1946-1971 were intellectually arranged in alphabetical order by name of country and a new series was created for each country. After the termination of the RISCs in 1998, the Archives added the 1972-1998 country files maintained in the RISCs to the files of each country from the period 1946-1971. Those records that had been transferred directly to the archives rather than to the RISCs (as described above) were not included in this exercise.</p>

<p>Records in this fonds were transferred to the World Bank Group Archives either directly from the responsible sector unit, or by the Records Management Section responsible for the Bank's Central Files. In the case of the former, approved records retention and disposition schedules were used. Prior to the initiation of direct transfer of records to the Archives in the 1990s, the sector forwarded their records to the Bank's centralized filing unit. Following the closure of the semi-centralized Non-Regional Information Centers (NRIC) in July 1987, the centralized records were kept at the Bank's record center until they were accessioned into the custody of the Archives in 1994.</p>

<p>Most records were transferred directly to the Archives by the Human Development Network, Education Team (HDNED) and previous units between 1992 and 2014, in accordance with approved records retention schedules. Other records were maintained in the Non-Regional Information Center (NRIC) that centrally managed records created by sector departments, until its closure in 1987; these centralized files were accessioned into the Archives' holdings in 1994. Elizabeth King chronological files (1987 - 1992) were brought with her when she transferred to a new position in the Poverty and Human Resources Division (PRDPH) in 1993. In 1994, these files were sent to the Archives by PRDPH with other unit records.</p>

<custodhist encodinganalog="3.2.3">
<p>Most records were transferred to the Archives by the Education and Employment Division (PHREE) and other responsible units in multiple transfers between 1992 and 2011, in accordance with approved records retention schedules. Other records were originally sent by the sector to the Bank's semi-centralized Non-Regional Information Center (NRIC); these were transferred from the NRIC to the Archives in 1994.</p>

<p>Most of the pre-1990 World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) records were initially created and maintained by the conference secretariat based at the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) headquarters in New York City. These records were transferred to the custody of the Education and Employment Division, Population and Human Resources Department (PHREE) once the division took responsibility for follow-up matters after the inaugural WCEFA conference in 1990. Records were then sent to the Bank Archives in 1992. Other records in this series were transferred by the responsible units of the education sector to the Archives in 2001 and 2007 according to approved records retention schedules.</p>

<lb/>
<lb/>It was the responsibility of the Region and its units to regularly transfer their records to their RISC. In practice, however, RVPs, Country Departments, and Technical Departments did not always do this. Records were often maintained by the unit (and thus not filed according to the RISC's classification scheme) and later were transferred directly to the World Bank Group Archives rather than to the appropriate filing center. This practice of transferring directly to the World Bank Group Archives only began after 1991.
<lb/>
<lb/>The RISCs were discontinued in 1998 and all records-keeping responsibilities were turned over to the regional offices. According to the Bank's [Administrative Manual Statement 10.11: Management of Records](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/09/18054966/management-records), "Individual units maintain custody of their active records until such time that they are either transferred to the Archives or destroyed in accordance with approved records retention and disposition schedules.

No action was taken on the general regional files (1946-1998) which were thus maintained separately.</p>

<p>The records in this subfonds were maintained by the Non-Regional Information Center (NRIC). The NRIC served as a centralized filing unit for the Bank, and arranged records according to Bank-wide classification schemes for the record group of administrative "central files" or "non-regional files". The NRIC served as one of multiple Information Centers for the Bank, which generally distributed the Bank's records into two main record groups: 1) general or non-regional, and 2) operational or regional. The records in this subfonds were not arranged by classification schemes or series specific to a department or division, but as a sub or sub-sub group to the larger "central files" record group. The NRIC were transferred to the custody World Bank Group Archives with the termination of NRIC in 1987.
<lb/>
<lb/>The departments described in this subfonds were assigned sub-group or series classification numbers from NRIC. The departments often supported more than one sector at a time and this is reflected by folders that contain records of more than one sector. As a result, the records of these departments have been placed in Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP/OPNSV) fonds, whom the departments reported to, rather than separated and dispersed into their respective sector fonds.</p>
