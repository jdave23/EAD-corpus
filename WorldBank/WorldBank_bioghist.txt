<p>Desmond McCarthy was born in Cork, Ireland on December 2, 1936. He received a B.E. Electrical Engineering from National University of Ireland in 1958, followed by a PhD in Electrical Engineering from New York University in 1966 and an M.S. Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1975. He subsequently spent time as a researcher at MIT prior to joining the World Bank.
<lb/>
<lb/>McCarthy joined the World Bank in June 1981. During his 18 years as a staff member and ten more as a consultant, McCarthy held various positions in the operational, policy, research, and evaluation units of the Bank.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1981 McCarthy was an Economist in the Comparative Analysis and Projections Division of the Economic Analysis and Projects Department (EPDCA). The EPD was located in the Development Policy Vice Presidency (VPD), the Bank's research arm; it was transferred, along with most VPD functions, into the new Economics Research Staff (ERS) Vice Presidency in 1982. The EPD was primarily responsible for reviewing the Regional Vice Presidency's country economic analyses and programs and developing and operating macro-economic data systems related to national accounts, debt, capital flows, and trade.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1983 McCarthy joined the Country Policy Department (CPD). CPD was located in the Bank's Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OP), although it had previously been located in the Development Policy Vice Presidency (VPD). CPD focused on country policy and strategy and was primarily responsible for improving country and economic sector work in Bank lending operations.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1985 McCarthy entered the Bank's operations complex for the first time when he joined the Latin America and the Caribbean Vice Presidency (LCN) as a Senior Economist in the River Plate and Bolivia Division (LC2PB). He soon after moved into the Argentina Division (LC2AR) where he was the country economist for Argentina. Following the Bank-wide 1987 reorganization, McCarthy remained a Senior Economist in LCN but moved into the Country Operations Division of the Country Department responsible Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama (LC2CO).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1988 McCarthy returned from the operations complex to the research arm of the Bank, called the Development Economics Vice Presidency after 1987. He would remain there until his retirement. His first position upon his return was in the newly established International Economics Department (IEC); the IEC had been created in the 1987 reorganization and had assumed some of the functions of the EPD. McCarthy was located in the International Economic Analysis and Prospects Division (IECAP) where he soon gained the title of Principal Research Economist.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1992 McCarthy moved into the new Development Policy Group (DPG) as an Economic Adviser. The DPG had previously reported to the Senior Vice President of Operations (OPNSV) in the form of the Economics Advisory Staff; it had advised the office on matters related to Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) and adjustment loans. Upon the termination of the OPNSV in 1991, it was placed in the DECVP but maintained its prior responsibilities.
<lb/>
<lb/>Between 1993 and 1999 McCarthy served as Economic Adviser first to the DECVP and then to the Development Research Group (DECRG).
<lb/>
<lb/>McCarthy retired from the Bank in 1999 but served as a consultant for the Bank in a variety of capacities over the subsequent decade. Units in which he served include: DECVP; the Office of Operations Evaluation (OED); the Operations Policy and Strategy Vice Presidency (OPS); the Health, Nutrition, and Population Team in the Human Development Network (HDNHE); and the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). McCarthy's last consultancy with the World Bank ended in 2010.</p>

<p>An American national born in 1938, John Nellis received his B.A. (1960), M.A. (1964), and Ph.D. (1968) in Political Economy from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. Prior to joining the World Bank, Nellis held teaching and research positions at a number of academic institutions, including the University of Nairobi (as a Fellow of the Institute for Development Studies), Carleton University (as professor of international affairs), and the Maxwell School at Syracuse University (as professor of Development Planning and Public Administration). He also served as the representative of the Ford Foundation in North Africa during which time he conducted research and administered aid programs.
<lb/>
<lb/>Nellis was employed by the World Bank between 1984 and 2000 during which time he dealt with a variety of development topics and sectors, including privatization, public enterprise reform, market transitioning, and governance and public-sector management issues. Upon joining the Bank in 1984, he was named Management Specialist in the Public Management Unit (PPDPS) of the Projects Policy Department (PPD). The PPDPS, then just a year old, was responsible for advising and developing strategies for improving the management of governments and government-controlled enterprises.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of a 1987 Bank-wide reorganization, the PPD was terminated and the functions and staff of the PPDPS were transferred to the newly established Public Sector Management and Private Sector Development Division (CECPS) located in the Country Economics Department (CEC) of the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC). Nellis transitioned to CECPS, as well, and was soon after named Principal Management Specialist. CECPS specifically focused on private sector development activities such as assisting in the privatization of state-enterprises, performing private sector assessments, and improving the relations between the public and private sector through regulatory reform.
<lb/>
<lb/>A Bank-wide reorganization in 1993 resulted in the termination of CECPS. Much of its staff and functional responsibility was transferred to the Private Sector Department (PSD). Nellis was one of those transferred to PSD where he was made Manager and then, in 1994, Senior Manager. PSD did not contain internal divisions until 1997. At this point Nellis was named Senior Manager of the Department's Enterprise Group (PSDEN) which focused on country enterprise reform and privatization. His final position at the Bank was director of the PSD. Nellis officially left the Bank in 2000.
<lb/>
<lb/>Following his official departure from the Bank Nellis became a Principal in the research and consulting firm International Analytics. In this capacity he returned to the Bank regularly as a consultant in various regional and sectoral units. He also consulted for: the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the British Department for International Development; the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD; the Asian Development Bank; Transparency International; the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies; the Government of Bolivia; the Government of Serbia; the Government of Tanzania; and the International Institute. He also served as a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development (CGD).</p>

<p>Orvis A. Schmidt was an economist who specialized in South American economics, with an emphasis on Brazil. He received his M.A. degree from the Department of Sociology and Economics of Tufts College in 1935 with a thesis titled "The examination of the international trade of Brazil, 1926-1934, with special reference to forces operating during boom and depression". He then enrolled as a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Chicago with a proposed thesis on the history of Brazilian monetary policy, working under Jacob Viner. Despite a nearly completed draft, he did not finish the dissertation.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1936 the United States Department of the Treasury hired Schmidt, and he was stationed in Brazil during 1937-1938. He then returned to the US and worked in the Treasury's international financial field, including six months as the acting director of the Division of Monetary Research, which became the Office of International Finance. According to an oral history interview with Schmidt, he attended some of the early inter-American financial conferences, particularly the First Meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the American Republics. During the Second World War he worked on foreign funds control and attended the Bretton Woods conference as the secretary to Commission III.
<lb/>
<lb/>Schmidt joined the World Bank in November of 1947, shortly after John J. McCloy became President. He initially served in the Loan Department as chief of its western European subdivision and then as the assistant to the loan director. In 1951 he became Assistant Director of the Western Hemisphere Department and in 1956 he became its Director. Described by William Bennett as one of the ablest people the Bank had, Schmidt became Special Adviser to the President in 1964. He died in November 1967 at the age of 55.</p>

<p>Sidney E. Chernick, a Canadian national, was employed by the World Bank from 1969 to 1990. Chernick graduated from the University of Manitoba and gained a Master's Degree from the University of Toronto and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the Bank, Chernick was employed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) in Santiago, and, for five years, by the United Nations in New York. He also taught Economics at the University of Melbourne.
<lb/>
<lb/>Chernick began his employment at the World Bank as an economist in the Central America and Caribbean Department (CAC) in 1969. He was promoted to Senior Economist in 1970.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1972 he joined the newly created Policy, Planning and Program Review Department; he would remain in the Department until its termination in 1982. (The Department had different acronyms over the years: EPR from 1972 to 1977 and PPR from 1977 to 1982. It was also referred to as PPPRD and PP&amp;PR.) The basic functions of the PPPRD were to identify development policy issues, to prepare or coordinate analysis of alternative program and policies, and to supervise the presentation of policy papers at the appropriate level of management. It provided guidelines for analysis in economic reports and country programs and reviewed country programs before their submission to the President to ensure the quality of economic analysis, consistency with Bank development objectives, and consideration of alternative strategies.
<lb/>
<lb/>The PPPRD consisted of only two divisions during its existence: the Policy Planning Division (PPRPP) and the Program Review Division (PPRPR). Chernick was named Division Chief of the Program Review Division in or around September of 1973 and reported directly to PPPRD Director, Hahbub ul Haz. (Ul Haz and the PPPRD, in turn, reported to Hollis B. Chenery, Vice President of the Office of the Vice President Development Policy [DPS].) Chernick's division was responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* Establishing guidelines for the content of Economic Reports and, in cooperation with the Programming and Budgeting Department, of Country Program Papers;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Managing the review of Economic Reports and Country Program Papers in close collaboration with the Regional Offices and the Programming and Budgeting Department with a view to evaluating alternative policy options for management;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Evaluating the annual and 5-year country economic work program of the Regional Offices;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Maintaining communication links between the DPS and the Regional Offices on issues of development strategy and Bank policy at the country or regional levels;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Analyzing selected economic development issues of Bank-wide relevance and ad hoc questions raised by management; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* Providing support for selected economic missions.
<lb/>
<lb/>In the spring of 1976, Chernick was named Senior Advisor in PPPRD and would serve in this capacity until the Bank's and PPPRD's reorganization in 1982. He would also serve as Acting Director at various times during the decade in which he was a PPPRD staff member.
<lb/>
<lb/>In February of 1982, Chernick was named Assistant Director of the newly-established Country Policy Department (CPD). The CPD replaced the PPPRD and assumed its functions and much of its staff (as well as staff from the former Development Economics Department [DED]). Chernick's main responsibilities in the CPD included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* Providing advice and support to the regions on designing assistance strategies and preparing CPPs, structural adjustment and other program lending, and carrying out policy dialogue with member countries;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Serving management through reviews of CPPs and country economic and sector work plans, through advice on lending allocation, and through work on operational policy issues;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Conducting applied research and preparing papers on such issues as trade strategies, resource mobilization, economic management, employment productivity and welfare;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Acting as a secretariat for the Operations Policy Sub-Committee of the Managing Committee.
<lb/>
<lb/>In June 1983, Chernick was named a Senior Advisor of CPD.
<lb/>
<lb/>In January of 1984, Chernick moved to the South Asia Country Programs Department (ASADR) under the title of Senior Economist. Chernick's activities involved: supporting the design and quality of economic and sector work by undertaking regional, country, and project analyses; and raising the capacity of the practitioners by providing guidance, organizing training courses and regional seminars, and participating actively in recruitment.
<lb/>
<lb/>On November 1, 1986, Chernick joined the Economic Development Institute (EDI, later the World Bank Institute [WBI]), the Bank's capacity development branch. Chernick was named the Advisor on Senior Policy Seminars in the Institute's Front Office. These seminars, beginning in the mid-1980s, offered short policy-related seminars to high-level government officials that would explore issues, alternatives, and likely implementation problems in bringing about policy improvements. Chernick remained in this position until he retired from the World Bank in 1990.</p>

<p>The operations function of the World Bank has, in one form or another, been organized by geographic region throughout the Bank's history. While the units responsible for World Bank lending and technical assistance have changed frequently in name and status since the Bank began operations in 1946, the Africa Region (AFR) has remained relatively constant. One exception is the permanent transfer of responsibility for Northern African countries (specifically, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria) from AFR to the Middle East and North Africa Region (MNA) in 1968. Thus, from 1968 to the present the Bank's Africa Region consists exclusively of sub-Saharan African countries. Another exception was the separation of AFR into Eastern and Western African regions between 1968 and 1987.
<lb/>
<lb/>1946 - 1952
<lb/>
<lb/>Of the twenty-eight original International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, also known as the World Bank) Articles of Agreement signatories, only three were African: South Africa, Ethiopia, and Egypt. While the Bank engaged with and, in a few instances, offered loans to non-member African countries over the next two decades, no other African countries joined the World Bank again until 1957 when the removal of colonial powers from the continent had begun.
<lb/>
<lb/>Upon the Bank's opening in 1946, operational lending was executed out of the Loan Department (LOD). The LOD was responsible for developing loan operation policy, receiving and investigating loan inquiries, presenting loan inquiries to Bank management forconsideration, and negotiating loans. The organizational structure of LOD fluctuated over its seven year history but was, for the majority of the time, organized geographically. The Bank's focus in these early years was on post-World War II reconstruction - particularly in Europe - and this is reflected by the initial divisional organization of the LOD. Of the seven original divisions, four dealt with Europe and two with the Western Hemisphere. One division was responsible for the two continents of Asia and Africa: the Asiatic-African Division.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1948, the seven divisions were briefly consolidated into two (the European and United Kingdom Division and the Latin American, Asiatic and African Division). Then, in November of 1948, divisions were abolished altogether, as loans were assigned to loan officers on an ad hoc basis. In 1950, LOD was again divided into three geographical areas: Latin America Division; Asia and the Middle East Division; and European Division. Noticeably, the African region was not represented at this time.
<lb/>
<lb/>Parallel to the LOD was the Economic Department (ECD) which conducted sector analysis and research work. Between 1946 and 1952, the ECD was responsible for both functional and geographic analyses, i.e. general economic studies and country specific studies. ECD supported the LOD and its loan administration and advised member countries on their economic and sector development plans. The ECD also liaised with international organizations on economic research. It alsoprovided staff forBank staff missions from the Bank's DC headquarters to countries to conduct both economic and project-focused research. Like the LOD, the organization of the ECD reflected the Bank's focus on post-war Europe. The Department initially consisted of three area divisions (with Africa located in its "Development Areas Division" alongside Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia) and an Economic Technology Division responsible for specialized sector studies. In August 1948 a new organizational structure featuring two area divisions was installed. Area Division I was responsible for Europe and Area Division II was divided into four sections of which Africa and the Middle East was one. In March 1950 another reorganization divided the Department into an advisory staff and an area staff, the latter consisting of three divisions of which Europe and Africa was one.
<lb/>
<lb/>While much of the Bank's initial attention was focused on post-war countries in Western Europe and the developing nations of South America, the Bank investigated possibilities for investment in Africa immediately upon beginning operations. The first mission to African countries occurred in March of 1950 when Vice President Robert Garner visited South Africa and Southern and Northern Rhodesia. That same month, the Bank sent a mission to Ethiopia to evaluate an application for funding. This six-week mission resulted in the first funding for an African country. Ethiopia received loans for two projects: [Loan 0031 Highway Project (01)](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P000659/highway-project-01?lang=en) included $5 million for rehabilitation and maintenance of road system and [Loan 0032 Development Bank Project](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P000658/development-bank-project-01?lang=en&amp;tab=overview) included $2 million for a new development bank. World Bank loans for South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Southern Rhodesia followed in 1951 and 1952.
<lb/>
<lb/>1952 - 1972
<lb/>
<lb/>Largely due to an expansion in operations in less developed countries, a Bank-wide reorganization took effect in September of 1952. The new operational structure endured for the next twenty years. LOD staff were combined with the country-related staff from the ECD to form three distinct geographical Area Departments: Western Hemisphere (WHM); Europe, Africa and Australasia (EAA); and Asia and Middle East (AME). These units were primarily responsible for World Bank-member country relations. Functions included: loan policy and plan development; country development program appraisal and review; preparation of proposed loans; and country economic monitoring.
<lb/>
<lb/>There was no formal divisional structure within EAA. The Department was led by A. S. G. Hoar between 1952 and 1955. Sydney Raymond Cope became Department Director in June of 1955. All three Area Departments reported to Vice President Robert Garner from 1952 to 1956. After Garner became President of the new International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1956, the Area Departments reported to J. Burke Knapp and William Iliff.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the1952 reorganization, the sector-oriented staff of the former ECD formed the Technical Operations Department (TOD) in the new Area Departments and was placed in charge of project appraisal and supervision. Specifically, the TOD was responsible for: the appraisal of proposed projects; advising Area Departments on proposed projects and assisting in negotiations; supervising approved projects and assisting borrowers in procurement efforts; and monitoring and reporting on member countries' sector economies.
<lb/>
<lb/>Bank operations in Africa continued to expand in subsequent years. In September 1953 the Bank's first General Survey Mission to an African country - Nigeria - was undertaken. In March 1955, funding for the first regional project in Africa was agreed upon. "Loan 0110 Railways and Harbours Project": http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P000620/railways-harbours-project?lang=en financed harbor improvement of multiple ports on the east coast of the continent as well as four railway lines in the region. In 1960, the position of Special Representative for Africa was announced. The position, initially held by Henry R. Labouisse but replaced soon after by Leonard Rist, was responsible for maintaining liaison with governments, keeping the Bank informed about developments in Africa and recommending approaches to be taken.
<lb/>
<lb/>As African countries began to achieve independence in the 1950s, the Bank enjoyed a dramatic increase in membership by African countries beginning in 1957. Between 1957, when there were still only two sub-Saharan members, and 1967, 32 African countries joined the World Bank. By 1962, this increase of member countries in Africa, together with the attendant increase in lending activities, necessitated the split of the EAA. Two new departments were created out of the former EAA: the Department of Operations - Europe (EUP) and the Department of Operations - Africa (AFR). Pierre L. Moussa was named department director of AFR.
<lb/>
<lb/>In the early 1960s, the Bank received requests from the governments of Nigeria and Sudan for a Bank-sponsored consortium focused on pledging amounts of aid that could be provided by donor members. The Bank and its aid-providing members recommended that a consultative group was the appropriate mechanism for coordinating external aid to each of the countries. The group would meet informally as particular needs arose and provide a forum in which members could discuss the assistance they were considering, and recipient countries could keep the other members informed about development plans, policies and projects. The Nigeria Consultative Group was formally established in April 1962 and the Sudan Consultative Group was convened on November 27, 1963.
<lb/>
<lb/>Most of the functions involved in the operation of a consultative group were already carried out by Bank department staff in its relations with countries, however they would perform these functions "more intensively or more frequently" when sponsoring groups. The operations of the groups varied according to its different circumstances but in most cases the Bank's responsibilities were, as defined in 1965: providing periodic, comprehensive reports on the country's development possibilities, problems, and performance as a basis for the consultative group's deliberations; analyzing the country's aid requirements and problematic debt commitments, and recommending types and terms of aid; assisting the recipient government to prepare or revise a development program or advise on problems in its implementation; assisting in identifying projects and other technical assistance and arranging for feasibility studies; and advising participants on which sectors and projects deserve priority for external funding. The role of the group's chairman, typically the Area or Country Director, encouraged dialogue at meetings and coordinated donor efforts to meet the country's financing needs. The department also drafted the minutes or summary of proceedings and the list of delegates of group meetings. These functions essentially remained unchanged through 1999.
<lb/>
<lb/>Resident country and regional missions were also established in Africa beginning in 1964. That year, the World Bank opened its first African Resident Mission office in Ethiopia. An office in Nairobi, Kenya followed in 1965. In 1965 a West African office in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, was opened; an East African office in Nairobi, Kenya, opened the following year. The principal function of these regional offices was to assist these new members with the identification and preparation of development projects.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1965 the World Bank implemented a major reorganization of country groupings in its regional departments. AFR was not effected with the exception that northern African countries (including Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco) were moved into the Europe and Middle East Department (EME). Note that these countries have since remained in regional units responsible for Middle East countries. In 1965 the Department of Operations - Africa was also renamed the Africa Department (AFR). Abdel G. El Emary served as Department Director from 1965 to 1968.
<lb/>
<lb/>In October 1968, due to the increased volume of lending operations anticipated over the next several years, the World Bank executed a major reorganization of its regional departments. Due to the rapid increase in African member countries in the 1960s, AFR was divided into two separate departments: Eastern Africa Department (EAF) and Western Africa Department (WAF). The functions of the two units remained unchanged from their predecessor. Each new department was composed ofseveral divisions. EAF contained three divisions upon its creation and had increased to five by 1972. WAF contained five divisions during this period. EAF was led by Abdel G. El Emary from 1968 to 1970 and Michael L. Lejeune from 1970 to 1972. The Director of WAF was Roger Chaufournier from 1968 to 1972.
<lb/>
<lb/>1972 - 1987
<lb/>
<lb/>From the time he became World Bank president in 1968, President Robert McNamara led the Bank towards an increased focus on extreme poverty and an emphasis on the agricultural, rural, and transportation sectors. The agriculture sector had always been the primary focus of investment for the Bank in Africa, but in the 1970s this investment grew significantly. The types of agriculture, rural development, and transportation projects were also altered in terms of scope and scale. Whereas in the past many projects aimed to provide local and small-scale lending, in the 1970s lending began to support regional development projects, focusing on fertilizer use, the expansion of rural road networks, and agricultural research (often through the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research [CGIAR]).
<lb/>
<lb/>McNamara's vision for the Bank was manifested in a massive, Bank-wide reorganization completed in 1972. As part of the reorganization, the geographic organization of the Regional units was again altered. The seven departments that made up the Area Departments were elevated to five Regional Vice Presidencies (RVP). The organization of Africa into two separate units was maintained in the form of the Eastern Africa Vice Presidency (EAN) and the Western Africa Vice Presidency (WAN). All RVPs reported to the new Senior Vice President, Operations (SVPOP).
<lb/>
<lb/>A more significant aspect of the reorganization, however, was the integration of the former Technical Operations Department (renamed the Projects Division [PRJ] in 1965) with the new RVPs. The period between 1952 and 1972 had been characterized by frequent reorganizations of the geographically-based area units responsible for country liaison and loan policy and negotiation. However, the division of responsibility between these units and TOD/PRJ was maintained. But in 1972, in an attempt to more effectively fuse country knowledge and sectoral skills, the reorganization removed most of the Bank's operational project work from the Projects Department to the five new Regional Vice Presidencies. Staff from the former PRJ were distributed into the Regional Vice Presidencies and were organized into sector-oriented Project Departments and were known as Central Projects Staff. Thus, rather than one Projects Department that supported projects in countries on an ad hoc basis, each RVP would maintain its own projects staff. Each RVP was, in turn, given "line authority" to analyze, decide and act on country development operations. Each RVP was responsible for planning and executing IBRD/IDA development assistance programs subject to the overall framework of Bank policies, priorities, and operating procedures. The RVPs created regional plans and budgets, ensured the effective implementation of approved plans, created country economic and sector reports, and developed and implemented loan, credit, technical assistance, and other forms of development projects. The RVPs were also responsible for maintaining sound relations with governments of assigned countries and with aid organizations and donors involved in those countries.
<lb/>
<lb/>Upon the completion of the 1972 reorganization, EAN and WAN consisted of two Country Program Departments in addition to the new Projects Department. TheCountry Program Departments were staffed by country economists and loan officers whose primary responsibilities were: conducting area reviews of Bank activities and countries' economic and political developments; formulating country lending and economic and sector work programs and implementing country programs; and reviewing loan applications, negotiating loans, and administering loans.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Projects Department provided technical assistance and advice to members and borrowers on sectoral issues, countrypriorities, and project development from identification through implementation and review. It consisted of economists, financial analysts, and sector specialists, and was specifically responsible for: creating sector policies; assisting countries with the identification and preparation of projects; appraising potential projects and assisting the Country Program Departments in loan negotiation and credit agreements; and helping borrowers manage consultants and procurement. Both EAN and WAN's Project Departments were initially divided into four sector-based divisions: Agriculture; Education; Public Utilities; and Transportation. Over the next fifteen years, new divisions were created for sectors such as energy, water, telecommunications, industry, finance, and urban.
<lb/>
<lb/>Note that not all staff and operational responsibility was transferred from the former PRJ to the RVPs. Staff in sectors too small to decentralize to the five regions continued to provide a complete "operational package" of technical services to the regions. These units, such as the Population and Nutrition sector and Urban Projects sector, were known as Central Operating Projects Departments and were located in the newly formed Vice President, Central Projects (CPSVP) which, like the RVPs, reported to the SVPOP. In addition, those former PRJ units which had their operational functions dispersed to the RVPs still maintained a core staff in the CPSVP with responsibility for policy and advisory work only.
<lb/>
<lb/>Throughout the 1970s, Bank lending to Africaincreased, particularly in the agriculture and rural development sectors, but also in the urban development and industry sectors. However, by late in the decade many in the Bank and in member countries grew increasingly frustrated due to a lack of growth in many African countries. In 1979 the Bank's African governors asked for a special report describing the challenges of the region and the Bank's proposed solutions. In response the Bank published [Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for Action](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1981/01/438047/accelerated-development-sub-saharan-africa-agenda-action) in August 1981. The report discussed factors that led to slow economic growth in Africa in the recent past, analyzed policy changes and program orientation needed to promote faster growth, and concluded with a set of recommendations to donors, including doubling aid to the continent and increased reliance on structural and sectoral adjustment lending.
<lb/>
<lb/>In order to achieve the increase in investment prescribed by the 1981 report, the Bank integrated alternative ways to raise and inject funds into the region. This involved a greater reliance on cofinancing to the point that, by the middle of the decade, more than half of Bank-financed projects in Africa included cofinancing. A Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa meeting was also convened in Paris in January 1985 where over a billion dollars was raised for the provision of fast-disbursing and untied (i.e procurement is not contingent upon the purchase of goods and services from the donor country) financing for the continent. In 1987 the Special Program of Assistance to Africa (SPA) was launched. Its objectives included: mobilizing resources and coordinating support for economic reforms in Africa; streamlining donor procedures; and monitoring adjustment programs for efficacy.
<lb/>
<lb/>Roger Chaufournier continued to serve as head of the new WAN following the 1972 reorganization and would do so until 1980. He was succeeded by A. David Knox, from1980 to 1984, and Wilfried A. Thalwitz, from 1984 to 1987. Bernard R. Bell was named the Regional Vice President of EAN in 1972. He was succeed by S. Shahid Husain, from 1974 to 1976, and Willi A. Wapenhans, from 1977 to 1984. In 1985, due to shifts in country memberships, EAN was renamed the Eastern and Southern Africa Vice Presidency (ESA). The division of African countries between WAN and the new ESA did not change. Edward V. K. Jaycox served as Vice President of ESA from 1985 until 1987.
<lb/>
<lb/>1987 - 1996
<lb/>
<lb/>While the composition of the Country Program Departments and Projects Department changed between 1972 and 1987 (most notably with a considerable increase in the number of Projects Department sector divisions), the organization and functions of the RVPs was consistent until 1987. In July of 1987, however, a Bank-wide reorganization under President Barber Conable altered the structure of the RVPs considerably. The changes were brought on by a desire to strengthen the Bank's country focus by making the Country Department the basic program and budget unit.
<lb/>
<lb/>The new Country Departments that replaced the Country Program Departments combined the macro-economic work of the former Country Program Departments and the sector work of the former Regional Projects Department. Each Country Department would consist of a Country Operations Division (COD) as well as multiple Sectoral Operations Divisions (SOD) made up of staff from the former Regional Projects Departments. The COD was composed of lead, country, and specialized economists as well as country officers and was responsible for: liaising with state governments and developing knowledge of issues in the country; preparing and supervising the country's aid strategy; and providing full responsibility for certain country-wide operations such as Structural Adjustment Loans and country economic work. SODs were responsible for overall sectoral strategy and for planning, programming and implementing development activities for the countries in their respective sectoral specialties; this would include the provision of full lending project management as well as lending and sector evaluation work.
<lb/>
<lb/>Not all staff was moved from each Region's Project Department into the Country Departments' SODs. Those remaining formed a new Regional Technical Department within each RVP. It was responsible for higher level knowledge collection, assessment, and dissemination. The Technical Department, which was organized into sector-focused divisions, was to stimulate innovation in operational work and undertake strategic thinking by providing advice, operational support, regional studies, staff training and the dissemination of materials to Bank staff, donors, and other institutions outside the Bank. The Department would continue to offer operational help in the form of task management, task support, and advice. They would also work closely with Policy, Planning and Research (PPR) staff in conducting regional studies and reviews and advising on sector policy and research priorities.
<lb/>
<lb/>A subsequent reorganization in 1993 strengthened the Country Departments' SODs through unit reorganization and a transfer of staff from the Regional Technical Departments to the SODs. The Technical Departments were greatly reduced in size and were restructured to reflect the emphasis on sectoral and thematic responsibilities of the SODs. The Technical Departments operational support function was consequently reduced.
<lb/>
<lb/>During the 1987 reorganization the number of RVPs was decreased from six to four. This involved the merger of the Eastern and Southern Africa Vice Presidency (ESA) and the Western Africa Vice Presidency (WAN) into a single Africa Vice Presidency (AFR). AFR initially contained six Country Departments and a single Technical Department. Another reorganization of the Bank's RVPs occurred in 1991 and involved the expansion of the four RVPs into six. However, AFR was not affected by the change. Edward V. K. Jaycox assumed the role of Vice President of AFR until 1996. Jean-Louis Sarbib replaced him in 1996.
<lb/>
<lb/>1996 - 2014
<lb/>
<lb/>In November 1996 the World Bank released [Taking Action to Reduce Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/11/693921/taking-action-reduce-poverty-sub-saharan-africa). The document reported on the Africa Region's Poverty Task Force. It also outlined specific actions that the Bank should take, suggesting an intensified emphasis on poverty reduction in Bank programming and lending, and the establishment of stronger partnerships for poverty reduction.
<lb/>
<lb/>Another reorganization in 1996-97 modified the changes made to the RVPs in 1987 and 1993. The RVP continued to be responsible for all aspects of country development assistance for its member countries, including: country assistance strategy; lending operations; technical assistance operations; and economic and sector work. However, the primary objective of the reorganization was to deepen the country focus and responsiveness to client needs. This was accomplished in a number of ways. The most striking changes concerned the new Country Management Units (CMUs) which replaced the former Country Departments. The CMUs were smaller than their predecessor (that is, each was responsible for a smaller number of countries) while their number correspondingly increased. The internal reorganization of AFR resulted in an increase from five Country Departments in May 1996 to sixteen CMUs in November of the same year.
<lb/>
<lb/>In addition, an increased decentralization of CMU staff and country directors from Bank headquarters in Washington to locations within client countries was undertaken. At the same time, a strengthening of authority with regard to strategy and budget was given to the country directors. The CMUs continued to be responsible for overall preparation and supervision of the country's assistance strategy, full lending project management, and evaluation of lending and sector work.
<lb/>
<lb/>During the reorganization, the former Technical Departments were changed into Sector or Technical Families. The role of the Technical Families, which consisted of sector and project economists and selected specialist staff, was to formulate knowledge on technical subjects and best practice and to suggest innovation through research and development. A Technical Families group was placed alongside a number of CMUs within each Regional Vice Presidency.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the 1996 reorganization, Edward V. K. Jaycox was replaced by two co-Vice Presidents for the Africa Region: Jean-Louis Sarbib and Callisto E. Madavo. This new arrangement effectively split the region into West Africa and Eastern and Southern Africa with one new VP responsible for each. This arrangement lasted until 2000, when Sarbib became the new Regional Vice President of Middle East and North Africa (MNA), leaving Madavo as the sole VP for AFR. Madavo was subsequently replaced by Gobind Nankani in 2004. Obiageli Ezekwesili was appointed to the position in 2007 and was replaced by Makhtar Diop in 2012.
<lb/>
<lb/>2014 - Present
<lb/>
<lb/>In order to stimulate the sharing of knowledge and best practices across the Bank, President Jim Kim introduced a Bank-wide reorganization in 2014 that removed sector staff from the Regional Vice Presidencies and placed them in one of fourteen Global Practices (GPs) or five Cross-Cutting Solution Areas (CCSAs). The GPs are responsible for each of the major thematic areas that the Bank supports through projects, such as agriculture, water, and education. Each GP functions as a vertical pillar of technical expertise and is responsible for: defining the strategic direction and the World Bank's activity in their respective sector; developing and deploying expertise globally; delivering integrated solutions to client countries; and capturing and leveraging knowledge in their respective fields. The CCSAs, on the other hand, serve as horizontal pillars providing leadership in areas such as climate change, gender, and public-private partnerships and focusing on Bank-wide strategic goals and directions.
<lb/>
<lb/>After the 2014 reorganization, the Regional Vice Presidencies exclusive function became the overall client engagement. Specifically, each RVP: sets and drives regional strategic direction; offers development solutions to clients; agrees on work program and budget with GPs and recruits expert GP staff to meet client needs; manages corporate and other stakeholder relationships; and oversees country programs. Each RVP retained multiple Country Management Unit (CMUs) responsible for one or more countries. The CMU is the primary interface with the country and is responsible for ensuring global solutions areapplied to the local context. Specifically, the CMU: identifies client challenges and opportunities; sets country strategy and manages selectivity; develops work programs and provides solutions; manages client and stakeholder relationships; and manages the country office.
<lb/>
<lb/>The number of RVPs did not change as a result of the 2014 reorganization nor did the country make-up of each RVP. Makhtar Diop served as Vice President of the Africa Region throughout the reorganization.</p>

<p>The World Bank first began lending for education projects in fiscal year 1963 with an International Development Association (IDA) credit to Tunisia. The credit financed the extension of a teacher's training college and the construction and expansion of secondary and middle schools, including a new secondary school for girls. In October of 1963, a memorandum from the President on Proposed Bank/IDA Policies in the Field of Education was issued in which the basic policy on education projects was set forth. Initially, the objectives were to promote educational planning, build infrastructure, and attract additional capital investment from other donor agencies.
<lb/>
<lb/>1963 - 1972
<lb/>
<lb/>Functional responsibility for education-related activities was first articulated in the organizational structure of the World Bank in early 1963 with the creation of the Education Division in the new Department of Technical Operations. Ricardo Diez-Hochleitner was appointed chief of the Education Division that was charged with appraisal of educational projects submitted for financing, and for assisting countries to plan their educational investments along lines which will promote their economic development. The Technical Operations Department became the Projects Department (PRJ) on January 18, 1965, and was responsible for: the identification, appraisal and supervision of projects; policy formulation and research; and advice in support of the operational activities of the area departments. The Projects Department initially had five subordinate divisions: Agriculture Division (PRJAG); Public Utilities Division (PRJPU); Industry Division (PRJIN); Transportation Division (PRJTP); and Education Division (PRJED).
<lb/>
<lb/>On November 1, 1968, the Projects Department was terminated and the subordinate divisions were upgraded to the department level. The Education Department (EDP) was one of the newly created departments along with the Departments of Agriculture (AGP), Transportation (TRP), and Public Utilities (PBP). Duncan S. Ballantine was the department's director and served until 1977. Initially, EDP had two divisions: Education Division 1 (EDP1) and Education Division 2 (EDP2). In 1970, Education Division 3 (EDP3) was created.
<lb/>
<lb/>From 1968 until a Bank-wide reorganization in 1972, the individual Projects Departments reported to the Director of Projects (DRP), and were the primary Bank units responsible for the appraisal, negotiations, and supervision of operational project work in their respective sectors. The departments were specifically responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing advice, conducting research, and monitoring developments in sector issues;
<lb/>
<lb/>* carrying out sector studies with the objective of identifying projects and determining priorities within sectors;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing policy papers outlining the basic principles and approaches of the Bank relating to project and sector work;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing guidelines and standards;
<lb/>
<lb/>* appraising proposed projects and supervising projects in execution;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting in the identification and preparation of projects;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing operational support in the negotiation and administration of loans and credits; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* cooperating with other international agencies on programs of common interest.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1971, the Bank issued the first formal statement on the priority for education lending in an [Education Sector Working Paper.](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/149071468338353096/education-sector-working-paper)
<lb/>
<lb/>1972 - 1986
<lb/>
<lb/>The Bank's massive reorganization in October 1972 attempted to more effectively fuse country knowledge with sector skills. Sectors with a sufficient number of experts and an established lending program, such as the Education Department, were largely decentralized. While maintaining a centralized core staff of department advisors, the majority of department staff were dispersed to regional project departments in newly established Regional Vice Presidencies. The remaining centralized staff made up the sector operating departments and performed advisory services for the Regions. They were responsible for improving and maintaining the quality of Bank lending and related operations through: formulating policies, methodology and guidelines; providing operational support and advice; and managing related programs of recruitment assistance, staff development and education. In the case of the decentralized sectors (Agriculture, Education, Public Utilities, Transportation and non-African Development Finance Companies), specialized personnel assigned to Central Projects Staff were loaned tothe Regions to work under the full operational control and direction of the appropriate regional Division Chief and mission leader for the duration of the assignment.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Education Department, as well as other sector operating departments, reported to the newly created Vice President, Central Projects (CPSVP). The Vice President, Central Projects, replaced the previous Director, Projects (DRP), and reported to the Senior Vice President, Operations (SVPOP).
<lb/>
<lb/>The 1974 [Sector Working Paper](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/868961468741007167/education) that focused on education was published in December 1974 and introduced a new policy direction that emphasized the urgency for increased financing to improve access of the rural and urban poor to education, making curricula relevant to rural needs, and promoting functional adult literacy.
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 1977, the Education Department was assigned a new acronym (EDC) and a Training Unit (EDCTR) was established. On July1, 1983, three other units were created: Education Research Program (EDCRS); Education Operational Policy Program (EDCOP); and Education Project Related Training Program (EDCPT).
<lb/>
<lb/>In late 1977, an External Advisory Panel of international experts in education was appointed by President McNamara to review the status of education in the developing world including the Bank's education and training lending and projects and recommend areas for future action. The panel was chaired by David E. Bell of the Ford Foundation. A report containing conclusions and recommendations was issued in 1978.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1979, the [Education Sector Policy Paper](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/366981468182955979/education-sector-policy) was released. It emphasized primary education as the foundation of educational development and called for: improved access of girls and rural children to basic education; a limitation of additional investments in secondary and higher education; enhanced instructional quality by providing cost-effective school inputs and teacher training; improving internal efficiency; mobilizing community resources and the mass media; and building local institutions.
<lb/>
<lb/>In fiscal year 1984, the sector adopted a plan to enhance Bank staff training and introduced four types of courses for sector staff centering on: introductory training for new staff; advanced training on project design and implementation; technical training; and cross-specialization, including education of non-educators.
<lb/>
<lb/>In July 1984, EDC was renamed the Education and Training Department (EDT). In February 1985, the subordinate units of EDT were given the status of divisions. This resulted in: Research Division (EDTRS); Education Policy Division (EDTEP); and Project Related Training Division (EDTPT). EDTPT was subsequently terminated on July 1, 1986, and EDTEP received a new acronym (EDTPD) on July 30, 1986.
<lb/>
<lb/>A major [policy paper on Sub-Saharan Africa](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/816101468009945118/education-in-sub-saharan-africa-policies-for-adjustment-revitalization-and-expansion) was released on January 27, 1988 titled "Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Adjustment, Revitalization and Evaluation". The policy discussion brought together twenty-five donor governments and agencies in Paris to assist in developing strategies for educational reform in Africa. The paper identified common problems in educational development, provided comparative data and analytical toolsfor developing policies and procedures, and suggested specific policy directions by governments and donors.
<lb/>
<lb/>1987 - 1996
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 1987, a Bank-wide reorganization resulted in the termination of almost all organizational units. The Vice Presidency, Sector Policy and Research (PRE), was established in May 1987, and reported to the Senior Vice President, Policy, Planning and Research (PPR). The PRE shed all responsibility for managing operational activities and focused completely on operational support, the formulation of Bank-wide sector policies, and overseeing the ex-post evaluation of Bank-wide sector work and lending. The PRE changed its acronym to PRS on January 1, 1990.
<lb/>
<lb/>At the time of its creation, the PRE had five departments reporting to it including the new Population and Human Resources Department (PHR). This Department integrated the functions of EDT and the Population, Health and Nutrition Department (PHN); it also assumed responsibility for activities related to 'strengthening the role of women in development.' The Department had four divisions: Education and Employment Division (PHREE); Population, Health and Nutrition Division (PHRHN); Women in Development (PHRWD); and Welfare and Human Resources Division (PHRWH). On July 1, 1992, a Population Policy and Advisory Service Group (PPAS) was established in the Front Office of the Department to increase attention to population work. The PHR was responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* formulating policies and strategies for human resource development and women in development, and developing new initiatives and Bank products;
<lb/>
<lb/>* conducting supporting research, including the improvement of research capabilities in developing countries, and management of external research funded through the Research Support Budget;
<lb/>
<lb/>* improving methodology and identifying best practices;
<lb/>
<lb/>* performing ex-post evaluation of the Bank's human resources sector work;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing operational support;
<lb/>
<lb/>* liaising with non-Bank organizations and professionals in the field;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing householddata on living standards; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting in the recruitment and training of staff.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1991, the priority areas of education sector lending were:
<lb/>
<lb/>* improving the effectiveness and efficiency of primary education;
<lb/>
<lb/>* increasing the access of women and girls to education;
<lb/>
<lb/>* strengthening science and technology education;
<lb/>
<lb/>* improving the efficiency and flexibility of training systems;
<lb/>
<lb/>* strengthening the contributions of higher education and sciences and technology institutions to development; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* continuing support for project-related training and the development of sectoral training capacity.
<lb/>
<lb/>On December 1, 1991, President Lewis Preston's first reorganization abolished all Senior Vice-Presidencies. The new Sector and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OSP) was created and adopted functions previously supervised by Senior Vice Presidents, including the PHR. On January 1, 1993, as part of a larger initiative to align the Bank's organization with the priority areas of its poverty reduction effort, the Sector and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OSP) was terminated. On January 1, 1993, as part of a larger initiative to align the Bank's organization with the priority areas of its poverty reduction effort, the Sector and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OSP) was terminated. All research activities were removed from the departments in the Central Vice Presidencies, including PHR, and were consolidated under the Chief Economist and Vice President for Development Economics (DECVP). The Policy Research Department (PRD) under DECVP became the principal research arm of the Bank including responsibility for education and employment sector research.
<lb/>
<lb/>OSP was replaced by three new thematic vice presidencies: Human Resources Development and Operations Policy (HRO), Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD), and Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD).
<lb/>
<lb/>During the 1993 reorganization, the PHR was terminated and its functions were split between a new Education and Social Policy Department (ESP) and a Population, Health and Nutrition Department (PHN). Both of these departments were placed in the HRO vice presidency along with an Operations Policy Department (OPR). The OPR absorbed the functions of: the former Central Operations Department (COD); the International Economic Relations Division (OPRIE); and the UN Office in New York (OPRNY) transferred from the External Relations Department (EXT).
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 1995, HRO became Human Capital Development and Operations Policy (HCO). At this time ESP was terminated; the education functions were moved into the new Human Development Department (HDD) which consisted of education as well as the previous Population, Health and Nutrition functions of PHN. The Social Policy function of ESP was moved into the new Poverty and Social Policy Department (PSP).
<lb/>
<lb/>Among the major initiatives in the early 1990s was the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA), an inter-agency initiative involving the Bank that began with a conference to focus on achieving universal basic education. The impetus for the conference was the United Nations General Assembly declaration of 1990 as International Literacy Year. WCEFA was held March 2-5, 1990, in Jomtien, Thailand and was co-hosted by the Bank. It brought together 155 governments, 33 intergovernmental bodies, and 125 nongovernmental organizations. Participants adopted the World Declaration on Education for All charter which outlined six goals designed to meet the learning needs of children, youth, and adults. A Framework for Action: Meeting Basic Learning Needs was also adopted. It outlined general priority actions for countries. At Jomtien, the Bank pledged to double its lending for education. WCEFA launched the international Education for All (EFA) program.
<lb/>
<lb/>1996 - 2014
<lb/>
<lb/>Beginning in September 1996 and into 1997, the thematic Vice Presidencies were reorganized to strike a better balance between country focus and sectoral excellence. The Human Development Network (HDN) was the first to be launched in the Bank-wide reorganization into networks to facilitate sharing of expertise and knowledge. Networks linked Bank-wide communities of staff working in the same field across organizational boundaries and with external partners. The networks formed a virtual overlay on the existing Bank organization, and were intended to link staff working in the same sectors throughout the Bank, whether the staff was located in the regions, in the Central Vice-Presidencies' Sector Departments, or other vice-presidencies.
<lb/>
<lb/>Each of the three thematic Central Vice-Presidencies was transformed into the central units, or anchors, of each network and consisted of the existing sector departments. On a Bank-wide basis, sector specialists were grouped into regional sector units or into central sector departments that worked with country departments in a matrix relationship. Staff from the central sector departments could become part of the Regional operational teams when their sectoral expertise was required.
<lb/>
<lb/>The work programs of Network staff focused on the following items.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Global knowledge - putting the best development knowledge in the hands of Bank task teams; ensuring that the knowledge base was accessible to external clients; and contributing to the growth of the knowledge base.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Enhanced skills - developing and providing content to training courses; establishing professional and technical standards for professional development.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Shared strategies - assisting regional and central units to develop a common sector agenda, and ensuring that skills are effectively deployed across the entire network. Network leadership assumed responsibility for global programs, sector strategy development and evaluation, strategic partnerships, and learning and dissemination.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Best teams and best practices - improving the Bank's flexibility and mobility by building stronger task teams and delivering higher quality products.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Institutional initiatives - providing substantial support for new Bank-wide initiatives, such as Social Development, Rural Development, Financial Sector, Anti-corruption, Human Resources, and Knowledge Partnerships.
<lb/>
<lb/>The result of the 1997 restructuring was four networks: the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (ESSD); the Finance, Private Sector Development, and Infrastructure Network (FPD); the Human Development Network (HDN); and the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PRM). Within the network, the Human Development Network Council was responsible for the overall management of HDN led by Chair, David de Ferranti (HDNVP), previously director of HDD.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of this reorganization, the HDD was broken into three teams and placed in HDN. The teams included: Education Team (HDNED); Health, Nutrition, and Population Team (HDNHE); and the Social Protection Team (HDNSP). In 2002 an HIV/AIDS Global Program Team (HDNGA) was created and added to the HDN, led by Adviser Dr. Debrework Zewdie (later director).
<lb/>
<lb/>Also, as a result of the 1997 reorganization, sector boards were established within HDN and other sectors. Sector boards replaced the existing staffing groups and sector panels, but with expanded mandates to include achieving the network priorities. Each sector department had its own board, chaired by the sector director in the network anchor. The sector board was drawn from staff within the network, and was also comprised of representatives from the regions, non-regional functional departments (Development Economics and World Bank Institute), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The board was accountable to the network council and was supported by a secretariat. The role of the board was to set the strategy for the Bank's work in the sector, endorse business plans and budget, ensure the regions and anchor perspectives were in sync, and to oversee the outreach and partnerships for the sector, with the anchor staff often doing the day-to-day management and monitoring of global trust funds.
<lb/>
<lb/>Among the Education Team's key initiatives during this period was the establishment of the Education Advisory Service (ESA) in fiscalyear 1997 to help staff leverage knowledge and information. An education management system was launched to respond to requests for Bank teams to locate consultants, learn about project experiences, improve project design, and implement projects. Clients included field mission teams, countries, and partner institutions. Also, the 1999 [Education Sector Strategy](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/406991468178765170/education-sector-strategy) paper was issued. Thestrategy focused on taking stock of global changes and progress in educational development as well as priorities and programs to help countries progress toward international education goals and improve the quality of teaching and learning.
<lb/>
<lb/>The World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal in 2000 convened partners from government, UN agencies, the Bank, NGOs, and academia to determine the direction education was to take in the new millennium, both in their own countries and around the world. Ten years after Education for All (EFA), many countries were far from reaching the established goals. The commitment to achieve EFA by the year 2015 was affirmed at the Dakar forum. Bank President James D. Wolfensohn told the forum that no country with viable and sustainable plan for achieving EFA will be unable to implement it for lack of external resources.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2002, the Bank, with its development partners, established the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) to help low-income countries achieve free, universal basic education by 2015 pursuant to the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2011, the Education Sector Strategy 2020 "Learning for All" was launched. The strategy encouraged countries to invest in early childhood education to build foundational skills and lifelong learning, and to invest in efforts shown to improve learning. The EFA-FTI was also rebranded as the Global Partnership for Education and a Global Partnership for Education Fund (GPEF) was established as a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) to support its operations. The GPE secretariat was hosted by the Bank, within HDN.
<lb/>
<lb/>2014
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 2014, a Bank-wide reorganization introduced by Bank President Jim Yong Kim restructured the Bank into fourteen Global Practices (GPs) and five Cross-Cutting Solution Areas (CCSAs). Sector staff from the Regional Vice Presidencies were removed and placed in the GPs or CCSAs. The GPs were responsible for each of the major thematic areas that the Bank supports through projects and functions as a vertical pillar of technical expertise. Responsibilities of the EDU GP include:
<lb/>
<lb/>* defining the strategic direction and the Bank's work in education with a view to supporting countries in ensuring improved education outcomes for all;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing and deploying expertise globally;
<lb/>
<lb/>* delivering integrated solutions to client countries;
<lb/>
<lb/>* capturing and leveraging knowledge in education.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Education Team (HDNED) established from the 1997 reorganization now became Education Global Practice (EDU)reporting to the Human Development Practice Group Vice Presidency (GGHVP). Claudia Costin was appointed senior director and Amit Dar, director. The senior director continued to lead the sector board. Nine Education Global Practice managers reporting to the director were responsible for the following regions divided into: Latin America and Caribbean, (HLCED); Middle East (HMNED); Europe and Central Asia (HECED); Africa 1 (HAEE1); Africa 2 (HAWE2); Africa 3 (HAWE3); South Asia (HSAED); East Asia and Pacific (HEAED), and Global Engagement and Knowledge unit (HEDGE).

<p>The Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (ESSD) was created in 1997 as part of President Wolfensohn's reorganization of the World Bank. The reorganization's objective was to strike a better balance between country focus and sectoral excellence. It was also motivated by recognition that the Bank's development programs were excessively driven by a culture of lending. The need to increase attention towards on client needs and the quality of results was addressed.
<lb/>
<lb/>To facilitate sharingof expertise and knowledge, the Bank established networks that linked Bank-wide communities of staff working in the same field across organizational boundaries and with external partners. The networks were intended to link staff working in the same sectors throughout the Bank, whether the staff member was located in the regional Vice Presidencies, sectoral departments, Independent Evaluation Group (IEG, formerly the Operations Evaluation Group [OED]), World Bank Institute (WBI), or Development Economics (DEC). The objectives and responsibilities of the networks were many: reduce fragmentation; increase information flow; set priorities; manage quality; run the information system; consolidate external partnerships; vet staff promotions; and disseminate best practices. The work programs of network staff focused on:
<lb/>
<lb/>* Global knowledge - putting the best development knowledge in the hands of Bank task teams; ensuring that the knowledge base was accessible to external clients; and contributing to the growth of the knowledge base.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Enhanced skills - developing and providing content to training courses; establishing professional and technical standards for professional development.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Shared strategies - assisting regional and central units to develop a common sector agenda, and ensuring that skills are effectively deployed across the entire network. Network leadership assumed responsibility for global programs, sector strategy development and evaluation, strategic partnerships, and learning and dissemination.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Best teams and best practices - improving the Bank's flexibility and mobility by building stronger task teams and delivering higher quality products.
<lb/>
<lb/>* Institutional initiatives - providing substantial support for new Bank-wide initiatives, such as social development, rural development, financial sector, anti-corruption, human resources, and knowledge partnerships.
<lb/>
<lb/>ESSD was one of the first of three networks to be created in 1997; the others were the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM) and the Human Development Network (HDN). Soon after, in 1997-98, the Private Sector and Infrastructure Network (PSI) was created. In 2000-01, the Operation Policy and Strategy Department became the Operations Policy and Country Services Network (OPCS). In 2003-04, the PSI became the Financial and Private Sector Development Network (FPSD). In 2007 ESSD was combined with Infrastructure to form the Sustainable Development Network (SDN).
<lb/>
<lb/>ESSD is organized in the same way as the other Bank networks. Each network is headed by a vice president and head of network. Under the vice president is a network council which that oversees the entire network. The council is composed of the top network managers from each Region and is responsible for setting the overall agenda for the network and for promoting effective deployment of skills across network units. It deliberates on issues relevant to the functions and objectives of the network - e.g., strategy; people; knowledge; quality/business process; and external partnerships.
<lb/>
<lb/>Each thematic network covers several related sectors of development. When the ESSD was created in 1997, it contained three sector departments: Environment Department (ENV); Rural Development Department (RDV); and Social Development Department (SDV). It also contained the Secretariat of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). In 2002, RDV was renamed the Agriculture and Rural Development Department (ARD). Each sector department has its own board, with representatives drawn from the Regions as well as from the network itself. The sector boards are accountable to the network council and are supported by a secretariat.</p>

<p>Activities related to the environment sector were initiated in 1970 when President McNamara announced that he had created the post of environmental adviser. James Lee was named to the post and would remain in the position until his retirement from the Bank in 1987. The Office of Environmental Affairs (OEA) was subsequently formed and placed in the Projects Advisory Staff (PAS) of the Projects Staff, Vice Presidency. The Office's name would briefly change to the Office of Environmental and Health Affairs (OEHA) in or around 1977 and then, permanently, to the Office of Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OESA) in 1983 or 1984.
<lb/>
<lb/>Throughout the 1970s the OEA was provided with few staff or resources and little influence. While the majority of the Office's resources were directed towards reviews of Bank projects, its five stated objectives were to:
<lb/>
<lb/>* ensure that development projects did not 'unduly' harm the environment and social well-being of a country;
<lb/>
<lb/>* develop increased awareness of environmental problemsassociated with the development of developing countries;
<lb/>
<lb/>* marshal the necessary resources and expertise to study the problem;
<lb/>
<lb/>* encourage research and training in that area; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* improve information and technical cooperation among countries.
<lb/>
<lb/> Bank projects related to environmental protection, rehabilitation, or enhancement began in earnest in 1974. These included projects related to water pollution, forestry, soil conservation and anti-desertification, air pollution, wildlife, range-management, and solid waste disposal. However, guidance and advice was generally provided by departments within the Vice President, Central Projects (CPSVP). The OEA maintained its function as project reviewer. Its agenda did, however, extend into areas that were not specifically covered by other sectoral departments in the CPSVP such as health, resettlement, and the rights of indigenous peoples.
<lb/>
<lb/>The OEA would also provide guidance for project planning through training and publications. In 1974 it published a handbook entitled [Environmental, Health and Human Ecological Considerations in Economic Projects](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1974/05/1561208/environmental-health-human-ecologic-considerations-economic-development-projects) and in 1975 it produced Guidelines on Environmental Dimensions of Projects. In 1980 the OEA, together with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), released the Declaration of Environmental Policies and Procedures Relating to Economic Development. In 1984, the Bank introduced a new Operational Manual Statement and, for the first time, it set out [Bank guidelines](http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1984/07/01/000009265_3960930072837/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf) on the environmental review of projects.
<lb/>
<lb/>The OEA continued to exercise a small amount of power and influence throughout the early and mid-1980s. However, during the Bank-wide reorganization that took place in 1987, the Environment Department (ENV) was created within the Vice President, Sector Policy and Research (PRE). Kenneth Piddington was named its first director in 1988. The Department was placed on the same level as other sector departments. At the time of its establishment, the Department had three divisions: the Environmental Operations and Strategy Division (ENVOS), the Economics and Policy Division (ENVEP), and the Environmental Systems and Technology Division (ENVST).
<lb/>
<lb/>The Department's role was to formulate Bank-wide policy and strategy for the full range of environmental issues affecting development that arise from the exploitation of natural resources; at the time, this also included issues related to resettlement and migration. Specifically, its stated roles and responsibilities were to:
<lb/>
<lb/>* conduct an integrated program of research, policy analysis and operational support on environmental issues, and to formulate Bank policies to account for environmental issues in all of the Bank's sectors of operation;
<lb/>
<lb/>* enhance the Bank's intellectual leadership on environmental issues;
<lb/>
<lb/>* lead the development of new initiatives for the environment, and to contribute to the development of new, environmentally sound Bank policies and products;
<lb/>
<lb/>* define the Bank's objectives, policies and products in the sub-sector of forestry;
<lb/>
<lb/>* define the Bank's objectives and to improve its methodologies and practices with regard to environmental concerns;
<lb/>
<lb/>* manage and disseminate the results of the ex post evaluation of the environmental consequences of the Bank's policies and operations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* liaise with groups, agencies and senior professional leaders actively working on environmental issues;
<lb/>
<lb/>* participate in appropriate committees, including the sector policy working group and country strategy working group;
<lb/>
<lb/>* collaborate closely with other Policy, Planning and Research (PPR) Departments in formulating environmental policies for the Bank's operations; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* help recruit and train environmental specialists.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Environment Department, like the other sector Departments in the PRE, had no operational responsibilities.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the increased focus placed on environmental impact and review, four regional environment divisions (REDs) were established. The new offices in the four regional technical departments would each oversee one or two regions and would review all projects and oversee the implementation of environmental measures included in Bank-supported projects. The divisions were given 'sign-off authority' which meant that a project could not go forward for approval until it had been cleared by the RED division chief. In addition, REDs would work to identify new advances in resource management and help with institution-building through close contact with national environmental offices.
<lb/>
<lb/>In December, 1988, the ENVEP and ENVST Divisions of the Environment Department were replaced by the Environmental Policy Research Division (ENVPR) and a Special Environmental Program (ENVSE). Then, on September 1, 1990, the ENVOS was terminated and replaced by the Environmental Programs and Assessment Division (ENVAP). This reflected a reorientation of the work program away from ad hoc operational support, necessitated by the newness of the subject and the shortage of qualified operational staff, toward provision of guidelines based on thorough reviews of the Bank's environmental work. In particular, the new Division would focus on such crosscutting issues as environmental assessment of projects and integration of environmental factors into the country economic and sector programs.
<lb/>
<lb/>On December 1, 1991, President Lewis Preston's first reorganization abolished all Senior Vice-Presidencies. The new Sector and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OSP) was created and adopted functions previously supervised by Senior Vice Presidents, including the Environment Department.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1991, the Environment Department's Global Environment Unit (ENVGC), a unit to coordinate Bank-related activities of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MLF), was created in the Department. The GEF was sponsored jointly by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the UNEP. Its purpose is to provide funds to developing countries for projects that contribute to the solution of global environmental problems. The Bank was initially assigned the chairmanship of the Facility and administered two trust funds - the Ozone Projects Trust Fund and the Global Environment Trust Fund - to be applied to several priority areas of global environmental problems, including: the reduction of CFC emissions to protect the ozone layer of the atmosphere; the reduction of greenhouse gases; improved management of tropical forests; and reducing pollution of international waters. Since July of 1991 the Bank has also served as one of four implementers of the MLF, the financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol (MP). The ENVGC acts as the Bank's Montreal Protocol Operations Team and is responsible for coordinating efforts of other Bank staff and local partners to assist countries in meetingtheir obligations under the MP.
<lb/>
<lb/>When the GEF was established in April of 1991, it initially reported to the Senior Vice President, Policy, Research and External Affairs (PRESV); a GEF Administrator's Unit (ENVGE) was assigned to the Environment Department. After the December 1, 1991, reorganization and the termination of the PRESV, the Director of the Environment Department was designated Chairman of the GEF and the ENVGC was established. On January 1, 1993, the GEF Coordination Unit was upgraded to a division while maintaining its previous acronym. In 1994 the GEF was restructured and moved out of the World Bank. However, the Bank became the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and continues to provide administrative services out of the Environment Department.
<lb/>
<lb/>Throughout, the Bank served and continues to serve as a coordinating agency for Bank-implemented GEF and MP projects. As of 2012, the World Bank's GEF coordination activities are carried out by the Environment Department's GEF Coordination Team. Its responsibilities include:
<lb/>
<lb/>* management of the Bank's GEF corporate program;
<lb/>
<lb/>* institutional relations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Bank - GEF project policies and procedures;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Outreach, knowledge management and external relations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Budget management and finance; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* Monitoring and evaluation.
<lb/>
<lb/>Effective January 1, 1993, the Department was again restructured as part of a larger, Bank-wide reorganization of sector policy and support units. The larger reorganization involved the creation of three new thematic vice presidencies tosucceed the terminated OSP: Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD); Human Resources Development and Operations Policy (HRO); and Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD). The Environment Department became one of the ESD's subordinate departments along with: the Agriculture and Natural Resources Department (AGR); the Transportation, Water and Urban Development Department (TWU); and the Secretariat of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Each sector department maintained the following functions:
<lb/>
<lb/>* prepare policies, guidelines, standards, handbooks and analytical tools relevant to the sector;
<lb/>
<lb/>* identify, codify and disseminate best practices and lessons of experience, and evaluate weaknesses;
<lb/>
<lb/>* provide advice to the Regions as needed;
<lb/>
<lb/>* monitor and track work in the sectors assigned in order to identify generic issues and identify, evaluate and influence trends and patterns;
<lb/>
<lb/>* perform surveys of experience and practice within the Bank and elsewhere, and developinnovative approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* participate in Bank-wide efforts to assess skill requirements, and to upgrade skills through recruitment, training, orientation, seminars, newsletters, etc.;
<lb/>
<lb/>* represent the Bank to external communities of interest; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintain an awareness of relevant external practices and viewpoints.
<lb/>
<lb/>Restructuring of the Environment Department included the termination of the ENVPR and ENVAP and transfer of their functions to the new Social Policy and Resettlement Division (ENVSP) and Land, Water and Natural Habitats Division (ENVLW), respectively. The new Pollution and Environmental Economics Division (ENVPE) was also established.
<lb/>
<lb/>Four years later, in 1997, the thematic Vice Presidencies were reorganized to strike a better balance between country focus and sectoral excellence. To facilitate sharing of expertise and knowledge, the Bank established networks that linked Bank-wide communities of staff working in the same field across organizational boundaries and with external partners. The networks formed a virtual overlay on the existing Bank organization, and were intended to link staff working in the same sectors throughout the Bank, whether the staff was located in the Regions, in the Central Vice-Presidencies' Sector Departments, or other Vice-Presidencies.
<lb/>
<lb/>Each of the three thematic Central Vice-Presidencies was transformed into the central units, or anchors, of each network and consisted of the existing sector departments. On a Bank-wide basis, sector specialists were grouped into regional sector units or into central sector departments which worked with country departments in a matrix relationship. Staff from the central sector departments could become part of the regional operational teams when their sectoral expertise was required. The work programs of Network staff focused on:
<lb/>
<lb/>* global knowledge - putting the best development knowledge in the hands of Bank task teams; ensuring that the knowledge base was accessible to external clients; and contributing to the growth of the knowledge base;
<lb/>
<lb/>* enhanced skills - developing and providing content to training courses; establishing professional and technical standards for professional development;
<lb/>
<lb/>* shared strategies - assisting regional and central units to develop a common sector agenda, and ensuring that skills are effectively deployed across the entire network. Network leadership assumed responsibility for global programs, sector strategy development and evaluation, strategic partnerships, and learning and dissemination;
<lb/>
<lb/>* best teams and best practices - improving the Bank's flexibility and mobility by building stronger task teams and delivering higher quality products;
<lb/>
<lb/>* institutional initiatives - providing substantial support for new Bank-wide initiatives, such as Social Development, Rural Development, Financial Sector, Anti-corruption, Human Resources, and Knowledge Partnerships.
<lb/>
<lb/>The result of the 1997 restructuring was four networks: the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (ESSD); the Finance, Private Sector Development, and Infrastructure Network (FPD); the Human Development Network (HDN); and the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PRM). The Environment Department retained its name and component parts and was situated within the ESSD.
<lb/>
<lb/>On January 1, 2007, the Energy Department was moved to the Sustainable Development Network (SDN). The SDN officially came into existence on July 1, 2006, and was operationally functional as of January 1, 2007. It was formed through the integration of ESSD and Infrastructure (INF). Along with the Environment Department, SDN includes the following units or departments: Agricultural and Rural Development Department (ARD); Concessional and Sub-National Finance (CSF); Finance, Economics and Urban Development (FEU); Sustainable Energy (SEG); Social Development (SDV); and Transport, Water, and Information and Communication Technologies (TWI).</p>

<p>The Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (FPD) was one of three Vice Presidencies created during President Lewis Preston's reorganization of January 1, 1993. Following the abolishment of all Senior Vice Presidencies on December 1, 1991, Preston initiated a larger reorganization in 1993 that aligned the Bank's organization with the priority areas of its poverty reduction effort. The result was three new thematic vice presidencies: FPD; Human Resources Development and Operations Policy (HRO); and Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD). The vice presidencies were responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing operational support to the Regions by participating in Sector Operations Division (SOD) task teams, undertaking specialized assignments for the Regions, providing ad hoc advice, distilling lessons of operational experience, disseminating best practices, and defining sector and operational policies;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting in identifying and addressing the Bank's skills mix and training needs;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing information and intellectual support to interested parties outside the Bank;
<lb/>
<lb/>* liaising with the UN and other official and private organizations; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* delivering complete products to the country directors in the 'clustered' subsectors, where the small number of expert staff can most efficiently be located in the central Vice Presidency.
<lb/>
<lb/>At the time of its establishment, the FPD Vice Presidency had three departments: the Financial Sector Development Department (FSD); the Private Sector Development Department (PSD); and the Industry and Energy Department (IEN). FSD absorbed the functions and staff of the former Financial Policy and Systems Division of the Country Economics Department (CECFP) located in the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC). The PSD absorbed the functions and staff of the former Public Sector Management and Private Sector Development Division of the Country Economics Department (CECPS), which was also previously located in DEC. IEN was transferred from the Sector and Operations PolicyVice Presidency (OPS). FPD departments were responsible for the following functions:
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing policies, guidelines, standards, handbooks and analytical tools relevant to the sector;
<lb/>
<lb/>* identifying, codifying and disseminating best practices and lessons of experience, and evaluating weaknesses;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing advice to the Regions as needed;
<lb/>
<lb/>* monitoring and tracking work in the sectors assigned in order to identify generic issues and identify, evaluate and influence trends and patterns;
<lb/>
<lb/>* performing surveys of experience and practice within the Bank and elsewhere, and developing innovative approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* participating in Bankwide efforts to assess skill requirements, and to upgrade skills through recruitment, training, orientation, seminars, newsletters, etc.;
<lb/>
<lb/>* representing the Bank to external communities of interest; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining an awareness of relevant external practices and viewpoints.
<lb/>
<lb/>Jean-Francois Rischard assumed the role as Vice President for FPD in January 1993.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the reorganization of the Bank in 1997, the FPDVP was terminated and replaced with the Finance, Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Network (FPSI). FPSI was created along with three other networks: the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM); the Human Development Network (HDN); and the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Network (ESSD). The FSD, PSD, and IEN departments of FPDVP were transferred to FPSI, joining the new Transportation, Water, and Urban Development Department (TWU).</p>

<p>Functional responsibility for financial sector development originated in the Financial Development Unit (INDFD) established in July 1983, which was located in the Industry Department (IND) of the Energy and Industry Vice Presidency (EIS). This unit was founded in the context of the 1980s debt crisis and turmoil in developing nations' financial sectors and institutions. The INDFD had the responsibility to carry out policy, research, and review work with regard to the financial sector. It additionally coordinated work with financial intermediaries in other Bank units as well as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In July 1985, INDFD was upgraded to a Division. Millard F. Long assumed the role of first Chief and later Division Chief in INDFD from 1983 to 1987.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of a Bank-wide reorganization in 1987, the IND was terminated. The staff and functions of the INDFD were transferred to the Financial Policy and Systems Division located in the Country Economics Department (CECFP) of the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC). CECFP was created in July 1987 with five other divisions, including: the Trade Policy Division (CECTP); the Debt and Macroeconomic Adjustment Division (CECDA); the Public Economics Division (CECPE); the Public Sector Management and Private Sector Development Division (CECPS); and the Special Studies Division (CECSS). CEC was responsible for providing leadership in the design and analysis of country development policies through researchpolicy work, operation advice and support, and training and liaison with outside research groups. CECFP focused specifically on financial policy and systems for financial sector lending, regulation, supervision, and restructuring. CECFP was led by Division Chief Millard Long from 1987 to 1991, and later by Andrew Len Tao Sheng in 1992.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of another reorganization that took effect in January 1993, the majority of financial sector development functions and staff from CECFP were transferred to the newFinancial Sector Development Department (FSD) located in the new Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (FPDVP). Some staff were also transferred to the Finance &amp; Private Sector Development Division (PRDFP) located in the Policy Research Department (PRD) of the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC), which served as a research oriented division, and worked closely with the FPDVP departments, including FSD. FSD was created alongside two other subordinate departments in FPDVP, including the Private Sector Development Department (PSD) and the Industry and Energy Department (IEN). FSD was assigned responsibility for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* formulating and disseminating policies and guidelines with regard to its sector;
<lb/>
<lb/>* monitoring the effectiveness of policies and approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining effective relations with Bank-external organizations and professionals in the field; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing operational support, especially in the areas of financial sector organization and regulatory frameworks, specialized finance, bank restructuring and management, and capital markets development.
<lb/>
<lb/>FSD work focused on the following themes: bank and enterprise restructuring; finance intermediation; capital markets development; and financial sector infrastructure. Millard Long served as Acting Director for FSD in 1993, and was later succeeded by Director Gary Perlin from 1994 to 1995 and by Acting Director Diana McNaughton from 1996 to 1997.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the reorganization of the Bank in 1997, the FPDVP was terminated and replaced with the Finance, Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Network (FPSI). The research division of the PRDFP was also terminated at this time. FPSI was created along with three other networks: the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM); the Human Development Network (HDN); and the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (ESSD). The FPSI consisted of four subordinate departments: the Financial Sector Department (FSD); the Private Sector Development Department (PSD); the Energy, Mining, and Telecommunications Department (EMT); and the Transportation, Water, and Urban Development Department (TWU). The responsibilities of FPSI included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing vibrant private sectors with rapid job growth by implementing the financial sector reinforcement program;
<lb/>
<lb/>* speeding up the emergence of livable, bankable, and competitive cities;
<lb/>
<lb/>* promoting the growth in energy and infrastructure provision that is environmentally sensitive;
<lb/>
<lb/>* stemming infrastructure deficit; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* sharing in the promise of the Information Age.
<lb/>
<lb/>FSD activities focused on strengthening banking, capital markets, and regulatory policy in emerging economies. In 1998, the FPSI added the financial sector oriented Special Financial Operations Unit (SFO) and the Capital Markets Development Department (CMD) to address the East Asia Financial Crisis of 1997.
<lb/>
<lb/>The FPSI was terminated, however, in January 1999 because the network became too large with multiple sector focuses; greater response was also needed for the East Asia Financial Crisis from financial sector related units. As a result, the functions of PSD, EMT, and TWU were transferred to the newly established Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Vice Presidency (PSIVP) and the FSD, CMD, and SFO functions were transferred to the financial sector oriented Financial Operations Vice Presidency (FIOVP). At its establishment, FIOVP departments included: the Financial Sector Practice Department (FSP); the Capital Markets Development Department (CMD); and the Special Financial Operations Department (SFO). The FIOVP, however, was short lived and was terminated in June 1999.
<lb/>
<lb/>The FIOVP was replaced by the Financial Sector Vice Presidency (FSEVP), which was launched in July 1999. FSEVP retained the FSD, FSP, CMD, and SFO departments of FIOVP, and added the new Banking and Financial Institutions Department (BFI). The joint IMF and World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) pilot program was also launched in 1999 as a response to the East Asia Financial Crisis, and was designed to rapidly assess and respond to financial sector crises. The FSP department assumed FSAP responsibilities, and FSEVP representatives were also responsible to sit on the joint IMF and Bank Financial Sector Liaison Committee (FSLC) to oversee implementation of FSAP missions, and review subsequent policy development and lending.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2001, the FSEVP was restructured to three departments, including: the Financial Sector Strategy and Policy Department (FSP); the Financial Sector Development Department (FSD); and the Banking and Financial Restructuring Department (BFR). FSEVP was restructured again in 2003, at which point it included: the Global Partnerships Program; the Financial Market Integrity and Money Laundering Program; the Financial Market Integrity Group (FSEFI); the FIRST Trust Fund Initiative (FSEFT); the Financial Sector Strategy and Policy Department (FSEGP); and the Financial Sector Operations and Policy Department (OPD).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2006, the FSEVP was terminated and its functions were transferred to the Financial and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (FPDVP). The FPDVP was organized jointly by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This joint effort was intended to combine the Bank's financial sector policy expertise and the IFC's rapid response advisory services to more effectively meet the growing demand for private and financial sector development services from developing countries. The FSEVP functions were combined with existing IFC private sector development oriented units, including: the Corporate Governance and Capital Markets Advisory (CCG); the Global Corporate Governance Forum (GCGF); and the Investment Climate Group (CIC). The joint IFC and MIGA Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) was also included in the new FPDVP. The transferring of FSE functions created the following new groups and advisory services: the Financial Market Integrity Group (FPDFI); the FinancialMarkets for Social Safety Net Group (FPDSN); the Financial Systems Group (FPDFS); and the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative. Around 2010, the FPDVP was restructured, and the following groups were added: the Global Indicators and Analysis Group (GIA); the Global Markets Development Group (GCM); and the Financial Inclusion Group. FPDFS, CGP, CIC, FIRST, FIAS, and CGP units were retained.</p>

<p>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) began operations in 1991 as a three-year pilot project sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Bank. The first meeting of the three agencies took place in December 1990. The Executive Directors of the World Bank adopted Resolution No. 91-5 on March 14, 1991, thereby legally establishing the Global Environment Trust Fund (GET), with initial funding of $1 billion, which was pledged by industrialized and developing countries. The first Participants meeting took place in May of 1991. A Tripartite Agreement signed by the three cosponsoring agencies on October 28, 1991, formalized the governance and operational mechanisms of the GEF.
<lb/>
<lb/>The purpose of the GEF is to assist in the protection of the global environment and to promote environmental sustainable development. Specifically, it provide[s] new and additional grants and concessional funding to cover the 'incremental' or additional costs associated with transforming a development project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits (GEF website, June 18, 2012). Countries can obtain GEF funds if they are eligible to borrow from the World Bank or receive technical assistance grants from UNDP. Investments initially took place in four areas of global interest, or focal areas: international waters; biodiversity; climate change, and, under the terms outlined in the Montreal Protocol (MP), the layer of stratospheric ozone. Later, the areas of land degradation and persistent organic pollutants would be added.
<lb/>
<lb/>Initially, the World Bank undertook the Chairmanship of the GEF; the director of the Bank's Environment Department (ENV) served as Chair. A GEF Administrator's Unit (ENVGE) was created in 1991 in the Environment Department as was the Global Environment Unit (ENVGC) which would coordinate GEF-related projects implemented by the Bank and conduct other related activities. The Bank's initial activities included: serving as Trustee and administrator of the GEF; encouraging inclusion of GEF investment areas in national environment programs of recipient countries; managing the project cycle for investment projects; and organizing GEF project identification, appraisal, and supervision processes with other agencies.
<lb/>
<lb/>At the conclusion of its pilot phase in 1994, the GEF was restructured and moved out of the World Bank system to become a permanent, separate institution. As part of this restructuring, the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and implementation of projects was enhanced and greater transparency was achieved. At this time, the GEF became the financial mechanism for both the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In partnership with the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Layer Depleting Substances, the GEF also started funding projects that enabled countries to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals. Later, the GEF was selected to serve as the financial mechanism for two more international conventions: the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001 and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 2003.
<lb/>
<lb/>The governance structure of the GEF includes: an Assembly of all participating countries which meets every three to four years and is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the GEF's general policies, the operation of the GEF, and its membership; a Council, which acts as the main governing body of the GEF and is responsible for developing, adopting, and evaluating the operational policies and programs for GEF activities; and a Secretariat, which services and reports to the governing Council and the Assembly and is functionally independent but is supported administratively by the World Bank. Among the Secretariat's major functions are:
<lb/>
<lb/>* implementing the decisions of the GEF Assembly and Council;
<lb/>
<lb/>* coordinating the formulation and overseeing the implementation of program activities pursuant to the joint work program;
<lb/>
<lb/>* ensuring the implementation of the operational policies adopted by the council through the preparation of common guidelines on the project cycle in consultation with implementing agencies; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* reviewing and reporting to the council on the adequacy of work programs made by the implementing agencies in accordance with the guidelines referred to above.
<lb/>
<lb/>Its business activities include: external/corporate relations; policy development; operations and business strategy; monitoring and evaluation; GEF Council and Assembly activities; annual reporting; communications and outreach; and administration.
<lb/>
<lb/>As of 2012, the GEF involves 182 participating countries and various international institutions, civil society organizations, and the private sector. In addition to the World Bank, UNDP, and UNEP, GEF has seven other implementing agencies responsible for creating project proposals and for managing GEF projects. The World Bank continues to serve as the GEF Trustee; as such, it mobilizes resources for the GEF Trust Fund and manages the Fund. It also seeks to mobilize resources from the private sector that are consistent with GEF objectives and national sustainable development strategies. The UNDP is responsible for technical assistance activities and capacity building and helps to identify projects and activities consistent with the purpose of the GEF and national sustainable development strategies. It is also charged with running the Small Grants Programme for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The UNEP is responsible for catalyzing the development of scientific and technical analysis and advancing environmental management in GEF-financed activities. It also manages the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), an independent advisory body that provides scientific and technical guidance to the GEF.</p>

<p>The Human Resources Development and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (HRO) was one of three Vice Presidencies created during President Lewis Preston's reorganization of January 1, 1993. Following the abolishment of all Senior Vice Presidencies on December 1, 1991, Preston initiated a larger reorganization in 1993 that aligned the Bank's organization with the priority areas of its poverty reduction effort. The result was three new thematic vice presidencies: the HRO; Finance and Private Sector Development (FPD); and Environmentally Sustainable Development (ESD).
<lb/>
<lb/>The vice presidencies were responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* Providing operational support to the Regions through participation in Sector Operations Division (SOD) task teams, undertaking specialized assignments for the Regions, providing ad hoc advice, distilling lessons of operational experience and disseminating best practices, and definition of sector and operational policies;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Assisting in identifying and addressing the Bank's skisurells mix and training needs; * Providing information and intellectual support to interested actors outside the Bank;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Liaising with the UN and other official and private organizations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Delivering complete products to the country directors in the 'clustered subsectors', where the small number of expert staff can most efficiently be located in the central Vice Presidency.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the 1993 reorganization, the former Population and Human Resources Department was terminated and its divisions were split between two newly created departments: the Population, Health and Nutrition Department (PHN) and the Education and Social Policy Department (ESP). Both of these departments were placed in the HRO Vice Presidency along with an Operations Policy Department (OPR). The OPR absorbed the functions of: the former Central Operations Department (COD); the International Economic Relations Division (OPRIE); and the UN Office in New York (OPRNY) transferred from the External Relations Department (EXT).
<lb/>
<lb/>In January 1994, President Lewis Preston created a secretariat within the HRO (HROAN) responsible for managing a program of the Bank's 50th anniversary activities.
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1 1995, HRO became Human Capital Development and Operations Policy (HCO). At this time education, health, nutrition and population functions were again combined in a single department named the Human Development Department (HDD). A Poverty and Social Policy Department (PSP) was also formed and placed in HCO.</p>

<p>Between the years 1993 and 1997, the Education and Social Policy Department (ESP), Poverty and Social Policy Department (PSP), and Poverty, Gender, and Public Sector Management Department (PGP) were responsible for the functions of a number of different social- and poverty-focused sectors, including gender and development, poverty analysis and policy, and, temporarily, education. While the departments were organized into 'teams' or 'groups', activities often overlapped.
<lb/>
<lb/>ESP was created as part of the Bank-wide 1993 reorganization. The Population and Human Resources Department (PHR) was terminated and its functions were split between two newly created departments: the Population, Health and Nutrition Department (PHN) and ESP. Both of these departments were placed in the Human Resources Development and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (HRO). ESP absorbed the functions of the following PHR divisions: Education and Employment Division (PHREE); the Women in Development Division (PHRWD); and the Poverty Analysisand Policy Division (PHRPA). ESP performed operational and analytical work in four main thematic areas:
<lb/>
<lb/>* poverty analysis and social policy;
<lb/>
<lb/>* labor markets and safety nets;
<lb/>
<lb/>* women in development; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* education and training.
<lb/>
<lb/>The ESP Department was responsible for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* formulating and disseminating policies and guidelines for its sectors;
<lb/>
<lb/>* monitoring the effectiveness of policies and approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* identifying and disseminating best practices and lessons of experience;
<lb/>
<lb/>* liaising with external organizations and professionals in the field;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assessing skills requirements and upgrading skills; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing operational support to the Regions.
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 1995, HRO became the Human Capital Development and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (HCO), and ESP was terminated. The education team of ESP was moved into the newly established Human Development Department (HDD) of HCO. The remaining teams were moved into the new Poverty and Social Policy Department (PSP). PSP contained four groups:
<lb/>
<lb/>* Gender Analysis and Policy;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Poverty and Social Assistance;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Labor Markets, Social Protection, and Public Sector Management;
<lb/>
<lb/>* Participation and Non-Governmental Organizations.
<lb/>
<lb/>On December 31, 1995, HCO was terminated, and replaced by the Human Capital Development Vice-Presidency (HCD). PSP remained in HCD.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of a Bank-wide reorganization in 1997, PSP sectors and functions were mapped into a new network-based structure. This process began in September of 1996 with a series of temporary relocations of PSP sectors. Labor Market and Social Protection activities were transferred to the Human Development Department (HDD) and then subsequently mapped into the new Human Development Network (HDN). The Participation and Non-Governmental Organizations team was transferred to the Environmental Social Policy and Resettlement Division (ENVSP) of the Environmentally Sustainable Development Vice Presidency (ESDVP). ENVSP was subsequently mapped into the Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (ESSD). In December 1996, the Human Capital Development Vice-Presidency (HCD) was terminated. The remaining PSP Groups of HCD were temporarily transferred to the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC) under the oversight of International Economic Department Director (IECDR) Masood Ahmed. While being overseen by DEC, the Gender Analysis and Policy Group, the Poverty and Social Assistance Group, and activities related to Public Sector Management temporarily became the Poverty, Gender, and Public Sector Management Department (PGP). The transition was finally completed in July 1997 when the sectors within PGP were individually mapped into the new Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM).</p>

<p>The units responsible for World Bank operations have changed frequently in name and status since the beginning of Bank operations in 1946. A summary of organizational and functional changes relevant to Bank operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean since 1946 is provided in this description. Units responsible for operations in the region include:
<lb/>
<lb/>1946-1952 Loan Department (LOD) Economic Department (ECD)
<lb/>
<lb/>1952-1965 Department of Operations - Western Hemisphere (WHM) Technical Operations Department (TOD)
<lb/>
<lb/>1965-1969 Western Hemisphere Department (WHM) Projects Department
<lb/>
<lb/>1969-1972 Central America and Caribbean Department (CAC) South American Department (SAM) Projects Department
<lb/>
<lb/>1972-1987 Latin America and the Caribbean Vice Presidency (LCN)
<lb/>
<lb/>1987-1997 Latin America and Caribbean Vice Presidency (LAC)
<lb/>
<lb/>1997-present Latin America and Caribbean Vice Presidency (LCR)
<lb/>
<lb/>1946 - 1952
<lb/>
<lb/>The operations function of the World Bank has, in one form or another, been organized according to geographic regionthroughout the history of the Bank. Upon the Bank's opening in 1946, operational lending was executed out of the Loan Department (LOD). Parallel to the LOD was the Economic Department (ECD) which conducted sector analysis and research work. Both Departments were organized along geographical lines.
<lb/>
<lb/>The LOD was responsible for developing loan operation policy, receiving and investigating loan inquiries and presenting them to Bank management for consideration, and negotiating loans. The organizational structure of LOD fluctuated over its seven year history. It initially consisted of seven divisions of which the Eastern Latin American Division and the Western Latin American Division were two. In 1948, the seven divisions were briefly consolidated into two (the European and United Kingdom Division and the Latin American, Asiatic and African Division) and then, in November of 1948, divisions were abolished altogether, as loans were assigned to loan officers on an ad hoc basis. In 1950, LOD was again divided intothree geographical areas, of which the Latin America Division was one.
<lb/>
<lb/>Beginning in 1946, the ECD was responsible for both functional and geographic analyses, i.e. general economic studies and country specific studies. Their work supported the LOD and its loan administration and advised member countries on their economic and sector development plans. The ECD also liaised with international organizations on economic research and provided staff for Bank missions. The Department initially consisted of threearea divisions (Latin America being located in its "Development Areas Division") and an Economic Technology Division responsible for specialized sector studies. In August 1948 a new organizational structure featuring two area divisions was installed. Area Division I was responsible for Europe and Area Division II was divided into four sections of which Central America and South America were two. In March 1950 another reorganization divided the Department into an advisory staff and an area staff, the latterconsisting of three divisions of which Latin America was one.
<lb/>
<lb/>The first loans to the region were to Chile: World Bank loan 0005 - [Power and Irrigation Project (P006578)](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P006578/power-irrigation-project?lang=en) and loan 0006 - [Agricultural Machinery Project to Chile (P006577)](http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P006577/agricultural-machinery-project?lang=en.) Both loans were signed on 25 March 1948 and related to hydro-electric development, forest industries, railway electrification, transportation facilities and port mechanization. These loans were also the Bank's first development loans, as the four previous loans were all to European countries and were for post-war reconstruction.
<lb/>
<lb/>In July of 1951 the first Country Office in the region was opened in Managua, Nicaragua. Offices in Panama City, Panama (October 1953), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (May 1954), Guatemala City, Guatemala (February 1955) and Bogota, Colombia (July 1955) followed.
<lb/>
<lb/>1952 - 1972
<lb/>
<lb/>A sizable reorganization that took effect in September of 1952 created an operational structure that would endure for the next twenty years. LOD staff were combined with the country-related staff from the ECD to form three distinct geographical Area Departments: Western Hemisphere (WHM); Europe, Africa and Australasia (EAA); and Asia and Middle East (AME). These units were primarily responsible for World Bank-member country relations. Functions included: loan policy and plan development; country development program appraisal andreview; preparation of proposed loans; and country economic monitoring.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of this 1952 reorganization, the sector-oriented staff of the former ECD formed the Technical Operations Department (TOD) and was placed in charge of project appraisal and supervision. Specifically, the TOD was responsible for: the appraisal of proposed projects; advising Area Departments on proposed projects and assisting in negotiations; supervising approved projects and assisting borrowers in procurement efforts; and monitoring and reporting on member countries' sector economies.
<lb/>
<lb/>A significant reorganization of regional departments' country groupings occurred in 1965. This also included a name change for the Region to the Western Hemisphere Department (WHM). A subsequent reorganization in 1969 resulted in the division of WHM into two new departments: the Central America and Caribbean Department (CAC) and the South America Department (SAM). This development was solely an organizational change, as functional responsibilities from WHM remained the same. Primary responsibility for regional lending projects remained the responsibility of the sector-oriented Project Departments, which had succeeded the TOD in 1965.
<lb/>
<lb/>Also during this period, the Bank established and chaired the first consultative group in the region. In June 1962 the Colombian government requested the Bank's participation in the formation of a consultative group that would coordinate external financial assistance for the country.
<lb/>
<lb/>Most of the functions involved in the operation of a consultative group were already carried out by Bank department staff in its relations with countries, however they would perform these functions "more intensively or more frequently" when sponsoring groups. The operations of the groups varied according to their different circumstances but in most cases the Bank's responsibilities were, as defined in 1965: providing periodic, comprehensive reports on the country's development possibilities, problems, and performance as a basis for the consultative group's deliberations; analyzing the country's aid requirements and problematic debt commitments, and recommending types and terms of aid; assisting the recipient government to prepare or revise a development program or advise on problems in its implementation; assisting in identifying projects and other technical assistance and arranging for feasibility studies; and advising participants on which sectors and projects deserve priority for external funding. The role of the group's chairman, typically the Bank's Area or Country Director, encouraged dialogue at meetings and coordinated donor efforts to meet the country's financing needs. The department also drafted the minutes or summary of proceedings and the list of delegates of group meetings. These functions essentially remained unchanged through 1999.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>1972 - 1987
<lb/>
<lb/>A more significant reorganization of the operations complex took effect in October 1972. The seven departments that made up the Area Departments were elevated to five Regional Vice Presidencies (RVP). South and Central America and the Caribbean were reunited in the Latin America and the Caribbean Vice Presidency (LCN). The RVPs reported to the new Senior Vice President, Operations (SVPOP). In order to more effectively fuse country knowledge and sectoral skills, the reorganization removed most of the Bank's operational project work from the Project Departments to the RVPs. Regional units within RVPs were given "line authority" to analyze, decide and act on country development operationswhile the remaining staff was organized into sector-oriented departments within each RVP; these were known as Central Projects Staff and constituted each Region's Project Department.
<lb/>
<lb/>Each RVP was responsible for planning and executing IBRD/IDA development assistance programs subject to the overall framework of Bank policies, priorities and operating procedures. The RVPs created regional plans and budgets, ensured the effective implementation of approved plans, created country economic and sector reports,and developed and implemented loan, credit, technical assistance, and other forms of development projects. The RVPs were also responsible for maintaining sound relations with governments of assigned countries and with aid organizations and donors involved in those countries.
<lb/>
<lb/>Upon the completion of the 1972 reorganization, the organizational structure in LCN included two Country Programs Departments (with four divisions reporting to each) and a Projects Department containing five sector divisions (Agriculture; Development Finance Companies; Education; Public Utilities; and Transportation). The Country Program Departments were staffed by country economists and loan officers whose primary responsibilities were: conducting area reviews of Bank activities and countries' economic and political developments; formulating country lending and economic and sector work programs and implementing country programs; and reviewing loan applications, negotiating loans, and administering loans. The Projects Department provided technical assistance and advice to members and borrowers on sectoral issues, priorities, and project development from identification through operation. The Projects Department, consisting of economists, financial analysts, and sector specialists, was specifically responsible for: creating sector policies; assisting countries with the identification and preparation of projects; appraising potential projects and assisting the Country Programs Departments in loan negotiation and credit agreements; and helping borrowers manage consultants and procurement.
<lb/>
<lb/>Note that not all operational responsibility was transferred from the Projects Departments to the RVPs. Staff in sectors too small to decentralize to the various regions continued to provide a complete "operational package" of technical services to the regions. These units, such as Population and Nutrition and Urban Projects, were known as Central Operating Projects Departments and were located in the newly formed Vice President, Central Projects (CPSVP) which, like the RVPs, reported to the SVPOP. In addition, those former Projects Department units which had their operational functions dispersed to the RVPs still maintained a core staff in the CPSVP with responsibility for policy and advisory work only.
<lb/>
<lb/>1987 - 1997
<lb/>
<lb/>While the make-up of the Country Programs Departments and Projects Department changed between 1972 and 1987 (most notably with a considerable increase in the number of Projects Department sector divisions), the organization and functions of the departments as well as the RVPs were consistent until 1987. In July of 1987, however, a Bank-wide reorganization under President Barber Conable altered the structures of the RVPs considerably. The changes were brought on by a desire to strengthen the Bank's country focus by making the Country Department the basic program and budget unit.
<lb/>
<lb/>The new Country Departments which replaced the Country Program Departments in the 1987 reorganization combined the macro-economic work of the former Country Programs Departments and the sector work of the former Projects Department. Each Country Department would consist of a Country Operations Division (COD) as well as multiple Sectoral Operations Divisions (SOD) made up of staff from the former Projects Departments. The COD was composed of Lead, Country and Specialized economists as well as Country Officers and was responsible for: liaising with state governments and developing knowledge of issues in the country; preparing and supervising the country's aid strategy; and providing full responsibility for certain country-wide operations such as Structural Adjustment Loans and country economic work. SODs were responsible for overall sectoral strategy and for planning, programming and implementing development activities for the countries in their respective sectoral specialties; this would include the provision of full lending project management as well as lending and sector evaluation work.
<lb/>
<lb/>Not all staff was moved from the former Project Departments into the Country Departments' SODs in the reorganization of 1987. Those remaining formed a new Technical Department within each RVP. It was responsible for higher level knowledge collection, assessment, and dissemination. The Technical Department, which was organized into sector-focused divisions, was to stimulate innovation in operational work and undertake strategic thinking by providing advice, operational support, regional studies, staff training and the dissemination of materials to Bank staff, donors, and other institutions outside the Bank. The Department would continue to offer operational help in the form of task management, task support, and advice. They would also work closely with Policy, Planning and Research (PPR) staff in conducting regional studies and reviews and advising on sector policy and research priorities.
<lb/>
<lb/>During the 1987 reorganization the number of RVPs was decreased from six to four. However, the Latin America and Caribbean Vice Presidency remained constant in its name. It did, however, change its acronymto LAC. Beginning in 1987, LAC had four Country Departments.
<lb/>
<lb/>A subsequent reorganization in 1993 strengthened the Country Departments' SODs through unit reorganization and a transfer of staff from the Regional Technical Departments to the SODs. The Technical Departments were greatly reduced in size and were restructured to reflect the emphasis on sectoral and thematic responsibilities of the SODs. The Technical Departments operational support function was consequently reduced.
<lb/>
<lb/>1997 - present
<lb/>
<lb/>A 1996-1997 reorganization modified the changes made in 1987 and 1993. The RVP continued to be responsible for all aspects of country development assistance for its member countries, including: country assistance strategy; lending operations; technical assistance operations; and economic and sector work. However, the primary objective of the reorganization was to deepen the country focus and responsiveness to client needs. This was accomplished in a number of ways. The most striking changes concerned the new CountryManagement Units (CMUs) which replaced the former Country Departments. The CMUs were smaller than their predecessor (that is, each was responsible for a smaller number of countries) while their number correspondingly increased. In the Latin American Region, the number of CMUs rose from four in 1996 to seven in 1998. In addition, there was an increasing decentralization of CMU staff and country directors from Bank headquarters in Washington to locations within client countries. Already by 2000, new CMUshad been established in Mexico City, Mexico (LCC1C), Brasilia, Brazil (LCC5C), Lima, Peru (LCC6C), and Buenos Aires, Argentina (LCC7C). At the same time, an increase in authority with regard to strategy and budget was given to the country directors. The CMUs continued to be responsible for overall preparation and supervision of the country's assistance strategy, full lending project management, and evaluation of lending and sector work.
<lb/>
<lb/>During the reorganization, the former Technical Departments were changed into Sector or Technical Families. The role of the Technical Families, which consisted of sector and project economists and selected specialist staff, was to formulate knowledge on technical subjects and best practice and to suggest innovation through research and development. A group of Technical Families was placed alongside a number of CMUs within each Regional Vice Presidency.
<lb/>
<lb/>As a result of the 1997 reorganization, the Latin America and the Caribbean Region retained its original name but again changedits acronym, this time to LCR.</p>

<p>Prior to 1983, public sector management or activities aimed specifically at reforming public sector institutions and entities within developing countries remained virtually absent from World Bank operations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the economies of many Bank member countries were increasingly perceived as being overburdened with large, wasteful, and inefficient public sector entities that hindered economic development. Public sector reform was sought to reduce wasteful spending, limit public sector growth, and create a different balance between the public and private sectors in developing countries.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1983, the Bank responded to the public sector reform demand by establishing the Public Sector Management Unit (PPDPS) located in the Projects Policy Department (PPD). PPDPS was given the responsibilities of research, operational support, and developing strategies for improving the management of governments and government-controlled enterprises. The PPDPS focused on areas of civil servicereform, and privatization of selected public services to improve balance of the public and private sectors. Arturo Israel was named Chief for PPDPS.
<lb/>
<lb/>Around 1987, the Bank established its first Regional Technical Department devoted to Public Sector Management in the Africa Regional Vice Presidency (AFR). Like other sector-oriented units in the Technical Department, the Public Sector Management Division (AFTPS) was responsible for region-and country- specific knowledge collection, assessment and dissemination through regional sector studies and planning, operational support, staff training, and the provision of advice and materials to Bank staff, clients, and donors. Through PPDPS and the Regional Technical Departments, public sector reform was addressed through the utilization of a variety of lending instruments, including: structural adjustment and credits; public enterprise reconstruction loans and credits; and freestanding technical assistance loans and credits for public sector management.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the 1987 Bank-wide reorganization, the PPD was terminated. The functions and staff of the PPDPS were transferred to the newly established Public Sector Management and Private Sector Development Division (CECPS) located in the Country Economics Department (CEC) of the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC). CECPS was created in July 1987 with five other CEC divisions, including: the Trade Policy Division (CECTP); the Debt and Macroeconomic Adjustment Division (CECDA); the Public Economics Division (CECPE); the Financial Policy and System Division (CECFP); and the Special Studies Division (CECSS). CECPS responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing intellectual leadership;
<lb/>
<lb/>* advising on Bank policy;
<lb/>
<lb/>* participating in missions to prepare and appraise projects and advise governments;
<lb/>
<lb/>* acting as a liaison with other agencies active in public sector management and private sector development;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing and implementing training courses for Bank staff; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* promoting research in the areas of public sector management and private sector development.
<lb/>
<lb/>CECPS combined private sector development and public sector management focuses to help foster a better balance of private and public sectors within member countries. Specific CECPS activities included advising on privatization of state-enterprises, performing private sector assessments, and improving the relations between the public and private sector through regulatory reform. Arturo Israel assumed the role as Division Chief for the newly established CECPS.
<lb/>
<lb/>TheLatin America debt crisis of the 1980s, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the World Bank Report Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth: A Long-Term Perspective Study:http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1989/11/439705/crisis-sustainable-growth-sub-saharan-africa-long-term-perspective-study published in 1989 prompted renewed interests in public sector management related activities in World Bank operations, and also marked a shifting point in re-defining public sector management within the World Bank. Public sector management services were in demand to stabilize rapid decentralization and for limiting growing fiscal deficits in Latin America. The fall of the Soviet Union also created an immediate demand for public sector management services to help decentralize, reduce, and modernize the large and overburdened Central and Eastern European governments of the former Soviet Union. The Sub-Saharan publication detailed the systematic failure of many governments and public sector institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa member countries. It additionally introduced the topic of "good governance" in relation to public sector management.
<lb/>
<lb/>The World Bank responded by increasing and enhancing public sector management activities and staff in the existing Public Sector Management Division in the Africa Technical Department (AFTPS) and, in 1991, establishing similar Public Sector Management Technical Advisory Divisions in the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Vice Presidency (LACVP) and the Europe and Central Asia Regional Vice Presidency (ECAVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>A governance task force was also launched in 1991 in response to the Sub-Saharan Africa publication. Two reports were subsequently published: the Governance and Development:http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1992/04/440582/governance-development report published in 1992, and the Governance: the World Bank's Experience:http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/05/698374/governance-world-banks-experience report published in 1994. The reports built on the good governance topic introduced in the Sub-Saharan Africa publication and articulated a World Bank specific governance definition: "Governance is the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development" (Governance and Development, World Bank, 1992, pgs. 1-2). Three aspects of governance were outlined:
<lb/>
<lb/>* the form of the political regime;
<lb/>
<lb/>* the process by which authority is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* the capacity of governments to design, formulate, and implement policies and discharge functions.
<lb/>
<lb/>The reports additionally broke down governance into four dimensions: public sector management; accountability; transparency and information; and legal framework for development. These reports incorporated public sector management into the broader definition of governance, and marked a change in Bank-wide policy towards public sector management.
<lb/>
<lb/>As part of the Bank-widereorganization that took effect in January 1993, CECPS was terminated, and its staff and functions were transferred to different newly created units. Most private sector development (PSD) oriented staff were transferred to the new Private Sector Department (PSD) located in the new Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (FPDVP), and other PSD research staff were transferred to the new Finance and Private Sector Development Division (PRDFD) located in the Policy and Research Department (PRD) of the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC). Public sector management oriented staff and functions were transferred to the Public Sector Management Unit located in the new Operations Policy Group (OPRPG) of the Operations and Policy Review Department (OPR). OPR was located in the new Human Resources Development and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (HRO), and was created alongside the Population, Health, and Nutrition Department (PHN) and the Education and Social Policy Department (ESP). The responsibilities of Public Sector Management Unit within OPRPG included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing leadership in dealing with pressing issues in the public sector managemnt area, particularly in the field of public expenditure management, budget reform, and civil service reform;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing advice, support, and training to operational staff, and through identification and dissemination of best practice; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing leadership in the area of governance in relation to public sector management.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Public Sector Management Unit in OPRPG was short lived, however, with the reorganization of HRO in July 1995.
<lb/>
<lb/>On July 1, 1995, HRO became the Human Capital Development and Operations Policy Vice Presidency (HCO). At this time, the Public Sector Management Unit staff and functions were transferred from OPRPG to the new Poverty and Social Policy Department (PSP) of HCO. PSP replaced the former the Education and Social Policy Department (ESP) of HRO. The Public Sector Management Unit was merged into the following PSP group: Labor Markets, Social Protection, and Public Sector Management. This group was established alongside three others, including: Gender Analysis and Policy; Poverty and Social Assistance; and Participation and Non-Governmental Organizations. Alberto de Capitani assumed the role as Manager of the Public Sector Management Unit within the Labor Markets, Social Protection, and Public Sector Management group.
<lb/>
<lb/>On December 31, 1995, HCO was terminated, and replaced by the Human Capital Development Vice-Presidency (HCD). PSP remained in HCD. Jane Armitage later replaced Alberto de Capitani as Public Sector Management Unit Manager in 1996.
<lb/>
<lb/>In the fall of 1996, events helped change the course and raise the profile of public sector management and governance activities within the World Bank. The first of these events occurred in October 1996, when President James D. Wolfensohn delivered his "Cancer of Corruption" speech at the World Bank/ IMF Annual Meeting, which outlined corruption as a major impediment to development, and called for greater action by World Bank operations to combat corruption. This speech launched the Corruption Action Plan Working Group to explore ways to improve the strategic framework for anti-corruption measures in World Bank operations. As part of this new push, the public sector reform activities of public sector management and governance units of the Bank received renewed focus and anti-corruption was subsequently linked to public sector management and governance.
<lb/>
<lb/>Around this same time, President Wolfensohn initiated a Bank-wide reorganization. As part of this reorganization, PSP sectors and functions were mapped into a new network-based structure with a series of temporary relocations. In December 1996, the Human Capital Development Vice-Presidency (HCD) was terminated. In January 1997, the Public Sector Management Unit was transferred to the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC) under the oversight of International Economic Department Director (IECDR) Masood Ahmed , along with the Gender Analysis and Policy Group and the Poverty and Social Assistance Group. The Public Sector Management Unit and these two groups were then temporarily organized into the Poverty, Gender, and Public Sector Management Department (PGP). In July 1997, PGP sectors were officially mapped into the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM).
<lb/>
<lb/>At its establishment, the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM) consisted of four departments: Economic Policy Division (PRMEP); Gender Division(PRMGE); Poverty Division (PRMPO); and Public Sector Management Division (PRMPS). The functions and staff of the former Public Sector Management Unit of PGP were mapped into PRMPS. The responsibilities of the PRMPS included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* improving the understanding and expertise of Bank staff in the area of public sector reform;
<lb/>
<lb/>* expanding opportunities and incentives for the development of knowledge and the sharing of insights and experiences both inside and outside the Bank; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* strengthening the positive impact of Bank interventions on the functioning of public sector institutions in borrowing countries.
<lb/>
<lb/>The major activities of PRMPS focused on the following areas: public sector strategy; public finance; governance and accountability mechanisms (e.g. anti-corruption, legal and judicial strategy, civil service reform); decentralization; public enterprise reform; and technical assistance. A Public Sector Board (PSB) was also established to coordinate the functions and activities to PRMPS. Cheryl Gray assumed the role of Director and PSB Chair for PRMPS in 1997.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2002, Sanjay Pradhan succeeded Cheryl Gray as PRMPS Director and PSB Chair. In 2003, PRMPS was renamed the Public Sector Governance Department, but retained its acronym.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2007, the World Bank pursued a governance and anti-corruption (GAC) strategy, which was articulated in the report Strengthening World Bank Group Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption. PRMPS played a key role in developing the new strategy.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2009, Deborah Wetzel succeeded Sanjay Prahan as Director and PSB Chair for PRMPS.</p>

<p>The Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP) has its origins in the Office of the Vice President of Burke Knapp (OVPBK), or also referred to as the Vice President of Operations. Burke Knapp's Vice Presidency was established on July 24, 1956, as one of three vice presidencies replacing the Office of the Vice President of Robert Garner (OVPRG). Knapp reported directly to the President. Knapp was assigned responsibility for the Bank's operational activities, including:
<lb/>
<lb/>* lending operations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* economic, financial and technical research and analysis;
<lb/>
<lb/>* economic survey missions and other technical assistance activities; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* liaison with other lending and aid agencies on above matters.
<lb/>
<lb/>Knapp was also designated Chairman of the Staff Loan Committee and the Area Department Head meetings. The following departments reported to Knapp: the Departments of Operations, or Area Departments - Europe, Africa and Australasia, Asia and the Middle East, and Western Hemisphere; the Department of Technical Operations (TOD); and the Economic Staff (ECS).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1965, the TOD was terminated and replaced by the new Projects Department (PRJ). PRJ continued to report to OVPBK.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1966, with the Departure of Vice President Geoffrey Wilson (OVPGW), responsibility for the Information Department (INFO) was transferred to OVPBK. In 1967, the Information Department (INFO) was transferred to the Director of Development Services (DSD), who reported directly to the Office of the President (EXC).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1968, the Projects Department (PRJ) was separated from OVPBK, and reported to Director and Vice President of Finance (VPF) Siem Aldewereld.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1972, the OVPBK was terminated. Its functions were transferred to the newly established Office of the Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP), which was also headed by J. Burke Knapp.
<lb/>
<lb/>The Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP) was established on October 1, 1972, and reported directly to the Office of the President (EXC). The SVPOP was created as part of the comprehensive 1972 Bank-wide Reorganization, which upgraded the Bank's former Area Departments to new Regional Vice Presidencies (RVPs), and transferred most of the technical staff involved in project preparation and implementation from the Projects Department (PRJ) to the newly created regional projects departments located in the new RVPs, in order to more effectively fuse sector skills with country knowledge. The SVPOP would assist the Bank President in managing the integrated projects and operations staffs. Freed from day-to-day operational tasks, Knapp would concentrate on establishing operating objectives, priorities and policies, planning, spurring innovation and improving overall quality, efficiency and effectiveness.
<lb/>
<lb/>At the date of its establishment, the following vice presidencies composing the Bank's Operations Complex reported to SVPOP: the Regional Vice Presidencies (RVPs) of the Asia Vice Presidency (ASN), the East Africa Vice Presidency (EAN), the West Africa Vice Presidency (WAN), the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa Vice Presidency (EMN), and the Latin America and the Caribbean Vice Presidency (LCN); and the newly established Vice President of Central Projects (CPSVP). The SVPOP also served as the Chairman for the Bank's Loan Committee and the Operational Vice Presidents (OVP, formerly the Area Department Heads) meetings. The SVPOP was also supported by a Front Office team consisting of a Senior Operations Adviser, and a Personal Assistant to the SVPOP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1974, the Asia Vice Presidency (ASN) was split into the South Asia Vice Presidency (ASN) and the East Asia and Pacific Vice Presidency (AEN).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1978, Ernest Stern succeeded Burke Knapp and the SVPOP was re-titled the Vice President of Operations (VPO). The functions and responsibilities remained unchanged. In 1980, the position of the VPO of the Operations Complex was again upgraded to Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1982, the CPSVP was terminated and replaced by the Operations Policy Vice Presidency (OPSVP). Some staff of CPSVP were also absorbed by the new Energy and Industry Vice Presidency (EIS). Both reported to the SVPOP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In January 1983, the Secretariat of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was subordinated under the SVPOP; accompanying the move of Warren Baum, who served as Chairman of CGIAR, from the OPSVP to the Front Office of the SVPOP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In May 1983, a new Vice President of Cofinancing (COF) was established with responsibility for all aspects of cofinancing policies and operations, and reported to theSVPOP. Later in 1983, the Office of the Management Systems and Budget (SVPMS) was added to the SVPOP Front Office to support budget formulation functions of the SVPOP and the Operations Complex.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1984, a Special Office for African Affairs was established in the Front Office of the SVPOP to coordinate and monitor a joint action program to expand technical and financial assistance to the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.
<lb/>
<lb/>In July 1984, the Operations Information Systems (SVPMI) Unit was established in theSVPOP Front Office to support and develop Management Information Systems (MIS) and database administration for the SVPOP and the Operations Complex.
<lb/>
<lb/>In the May 1987 Reorganization, the Operations Complex was fundamentally restructured, the functions of the SVPOP redefined, and the SVPOP position given a new acronym (OPNSV). The main features of the reorganization were the consolidation of the former six Regional Vice Presidencies (RVP) into four, including: the Africa Vice Presidency (AFR); the Asia Vice Presidency (ASI); the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa Vice Presidency (EMENA); and the Latin America and Caribbean Vice Presidency (LAC). The reorganization also resulted in the creation of Country Departments (CDs), which combined functions previously divided between Programs and Projects Departments, and the establishment of Regional Technical Departments (TDs) taking on some of the functions of the former OPSVP and the EIS.
<lb/>
<lb/>The newly reorganized Senior Vice President of Operations (OPNSV) served as a member of the President's senior management team and as Chief Operations Officer. The main responsibilities of the reorganized OPNSV included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* advising the President on major operational issues;
<lb/>
<lb/>* acting as the Bank's spokesman on operational matters vis-a-vis Part I and Part II counties;
<lb/>
<lb/>* overseeing the formulation and implementation of the Bank's economic and social development programs; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* ensuring the quality of the Bank's operational products and loans.
<lb/>
<lb/>With the completion of the reorganization's second phase in September 1987, the following vice -presidencies and departments, which made up the Operations Complex, reported to OPNSV: the four Regional Vice Presidents (RVPs) of the Africa Vice Presidency (AFR), the Asia Vice Presidency (ASI), the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa Vice Presidency (EMENA), and the Latin America and Caribbean Vice Presidency (LAC); the newly established Vice President of Financial Intermediation (FIS); the Vice President of Cofinancing (COF); the Central Operations Department (COD); and the Economic Advisory Staff (EAS). The OPNSV also served as Chairman for the Operations Committee (OC, formerly the Loan Committee) and the Operations Policy Committee (OPC), which were composed of members from the Bank's Operations Complex.
<lb/>
<lb/>The OPNSV was supported by a newly reorganized Front Office, or Operations Staff (OPN), which included: the Director of Operations Staff (OPN); the Special Adviser, Lending and Budget Operations; the Special Adviser, Personnel, Budget, and Information Management; the Chief Personnel Officer; and the Special Assistant to the OPNSV. The Operations Information Systems (SVPMI) Unit acronym was changed to the OPNMI, and the Office of the Management Systems and Budget (SVPMS) acronym was changed to the OPNMS.
<lb/>
<lb/>Moeen Qureshi succeeded Ernest Stern as the new Senior Vice President for Operations (OPNSV).
<lb/>
<lb/>In January 1989, the OPNMI was upgraded to a division and renamed the Operations Information Services Division (OPNIS).
<lb/>
<lb/>In June 1989,the FIS was combined with the COF and renamed the Cofinancing and Financial Intermediation Vice Presidency (CFS). This was expected to enhance the Bank's ability to deal with debt issues and improve the service to the Regions and the borrowers.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1991, following the appointment of World Bank President Lewis T. Preston, the senior management structure was heavily reorganized, and the Bank's senior vice presidencies were abolished, including OPNSV. As a result, the Economic Advisory Staff (EAS) was terminated, and its staff and functions were absorbed by the new Development Policy Group (DPG) located in the Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC); the Central Operations Department (COD) was transferred to the Vice President of Sector Policy and Research (OSPVP); and the Vice President of Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services (CFS) reported to the newly appointed Managing Director Attila Karaosmanoglu. The four RVPs reported to Office of the President (EXC) and the newly established Managing Directors, who served as a broad administrative oversight team that supported the President. The Office of the Management Systems and Budget (OPNMS) of the OPNSV Front Office was terminated, and the Operations Information Services Division (OPNIS) functions were split between the new Information Services Division (CODIS) in the Central Operations Department (COD) and the Budget Policy and Systems Division (PBDPS) in the Planning and Budgeting Department (PBD).</p>

<p>This fonds contains the records of the World Bank Group units responsible for donor-based resource mobilization functions related to cofinancing, trust funds, and International Development Agency (IDA) replenishments. The fonds does not include records related to the Bank's traditional resource mobilization efforts of acquiring IBRD financing through the world's financial markets because the function does not share a provenance with the units described. This administrative history describes the provenance of the administrative units for cofinancing, trust funds, and IDA replenishments separately. After 1996, the functions merged under one vice presidency. As a consequence, the post-1996 section focuses on all functions together.
<lb/>
<lb/>Cofinancing
<lb/>
<lb/>Cofinancing is defined as additional funding sought by borrowing member countries from external sources outside of the World Bank. Cofinancing is meant to supplement funding resources provided by the World Bank (e.g. IBRD/IDA loans, credits, and grants), which may fall short of the funding needs for projects and programs associated with a borrowing member country. Cofinancing funding is sought by the Bank and its member countries from the following external official and private sources: agencies or government departments administrating bilateral development programs; multilateral agencies such as regional development banks; export credit agencies; and commercial banks. Cofinance funding is administered through two types of financing methods: 1) parallel cofinancing, in which the Bank and cofinanciers finance different goods and services or parts of the project; and 2) joint cofinancing, in which the Bank and cofinanciers finance expenditures from a common list of goods and services in agreed proportions, which adhere to the Bank's procurement guidelines. Cofinancing activities were developed in the Bank to help mobilize additional funding for sector-oriented programs and projects, fill funding gaps, and also foster greater international coordination to respond more rapidly to global macro-economic crises.
<lb/>
<lb/>The first use of cofinancing in Bank operations was a joint cofinancing agreement drafted for the Mexico Power Sector Program in 1966. Initial Bank loans fell short of financing needs for projects under this program, so external funding sources were sought and renegotiated by members of the Bank's Loan Committee, cofinanciers, and the Government of Mexico. Similar agreements were negotiated thereafter for other programs and projects, including a parallel cofinancing agreement negotiated between the Bank, cofinanciers, and the Brazilian Government related to steel industry projects in 1971.
<lb/>
<lb/>The use of cofinancing to mobilize resources significantly increased in World Bank operations during the oil and energy crisis that began in 1973. In this period, Arab/OPEC multilateral institutions emerged as a primary contributor for providing cofinancing sources. Newly founded regional multilateral institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank also emerged as valuable multilateral cofinancing partners.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1975, the Bank's cofinancing functions were formalized with the establishment of the Senior Adviser for cofinancing in the Front Office for the Senior Vice President of Operations (SVPOP). Regional Cofinancing Coordinators (RCC) were also established in the six Regional Vice Presidencies (RVP). The Senior Adviser for Cofinancing took lead responsibility in Bank-wide overall planning, policy making, communication, coordination, and monitoring of cofinancing operations. The RCCs were given line responsibilities of identifying operations to be cofinanced and arranging cofinancing with official sources in the Regional Programs Departments (RPD). The RCCs were also responsible for arranging cofinancing with export credit and commercial banking sources for the Regional Projects Departments. Roger Hornstein served as the Senior Adviser for Cofinancing.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1981, Frank Vibert succeeded Roger Hornstein as Senior Adviserfor Cofinancing in the SVPOP Front Office.
<lb/>
<lb/>Demand for cofinancing sources grew in the late 1970s and the early 1980s with the ongoing oil crisis and emerging debt crisis. This demand strained the limited cofinancing operations in the Bank. As a result, the Vice President of Cofinancing (VPCOF) was established in May 1983. Teruyuki Ohuchi served as Vice President for VPCOF. The new VPCOF reported to the Senior Vice President, Operations (SVPOP). The VPCOF was created to strengthen and expand the Bank's cofinancing operations as a means to maintain and increase international capital flows to developing countries in times of constrained financial resources. The RPD retained line responsibilities for identifying and arranging cofinancing and also for arranging cofinancing for commercial and export credit sources. A new Regional Cofinancing Advisor was also established who would have functional control for cofinancing activities in the Region. The VPCOF was given responsibilities for:
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining top-level contacts and promotion with cofinanciers;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing new cofinancing tools; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* planning, coordinating, and monitoring the Bank's overall cofinancing program.
<lb/>
<lb/>The VPCOF included the subordinate Cofinancing Advisory Unit (VPCAU), which was staffed by cofinancing advisers with expertise in commercial banking, export credits, and official financial sources.
<lb/>
<lb/>During the establishment of VPCOF, the Japanese government emerged as the largest cofinancing contributor to the Bank by launching a number of cofinancing programs through the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), Japan's development aid agency, as well as the Export-Import Bank of Japan (UEXIM). This marked the beginning of strong Japanese leadership in the Bank's cofinancing operations, which extended from the 1980s into the early 2000s.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1983, the Bank's "B-Loan" program was launched to expand private cofinancing efforts and channel commercial bank resources to Bank operations. Shortly after, multilateral, bilateral, and export credit agency cofinancing programs were launched as part of the Japanese Grant Facility (JGF, later renamed the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development [PHRD] Fund). In 1985, the multi-country official cofinancing (bilateral and multilateral) programs, the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa (SFA) and the Consultant Trust Fund (CTF) Program, were launched.
<lb/>
<lb/>In June 1986, Teruyuki Ohuchi was succeeded by Kunihiko Inakage as Vice President for VPCOF. In the May 1987 Reorganization, the Cofinancing Vice Presidency remained structurally unchanged but new acronyms were assigned to the Office of the Vice President (COFVP) and to the Cofinancing Advisory Unit (COFAU).
<lb/>
<lb/>In June 1989, the COFVP was terminated and its functions were combined with the former Vice President of Financial Intermediation (VPFIS). This merger broadened cofinancing functions to include technical assistance in debt management and resource mobilization. The new combined VP was renamed the Vice President of Financial Intermediation and Cofinancing (CFSVP). The CFSVP reported to the Senior Vice President, Operations (OPNSV). CFSVP responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting member countries in restructuring debt;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting member countries with deregulation, public sector restructuring and privatization;
<lb/>
<lb/>* advising member countries on management of their foreign financial assets and liabilities;
<lb/>
<lb/>* procuring cofinancing arrangements from commercial and public sources;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing a Bank-wide strategy and capability for dealing with privatization requests; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing new lending products to mobilize financial resources in commercial markets.
<lb/>
<lb/>At the time of its establishment, the CFS had one subordinate unit, the Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services Department (CFS), which incorporated the financial engineering functions of the former Debt Management and Financial Advisory Department (DFS) formerly located in the Vice President of Financial Intermediation (VPFIS), as well as most of the staff of the former CofinancingVice Presidency (COFVP). CFS consisted of the following units: the Cofinancing Group (CFSCO); the Financial Advisory Services Group (CFSFA); and the Private Sector Development Group (CFSPS). The CFSVP was also supported by a Front Office consisting of advisers in the following areas: commercial finance; official sources; export credits; and banking institutions.
<lb/>
<lb/>Koji Kashiwaya assumed the role of Vice President for the new CFSVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In late 1989, the CFSPS was transferred from the Cofinancing and AdvisoryServices Department (CFS) to the Front Office of the CFSVP. In December 1990, the CFS Department was restructured, splitting the CFSCO into the new Official Cofinancing Group (CFSOC), and the new Private Cofinancing Group (CFSPC). In this same year, the Expanded Cofinancing Operation (ECO) program replaced the "B-Loan" program.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1990, the CFSVP was renamed the Vice President of Cofinancing and Advisory Services (CFSVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>In February 1992, the CFSVP underwent a comprehensive reorganization to strengthen private sector development work and streamline the process of financial resource mobilization. This entailed building up the cofinancing and financial advisory capabilities in the regional Country Departments, which were given primary responsibility for implementing private sector development programs, and a consolidation of CFSVP's subordinate units. Specific responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* mobilizing official and private equity financing to cofinance Bank supported projects;
<lb/>
<lb/>* managing and reducing the external debt of heavily indebted countries;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing programs for public enterprise divestiture;
<lb/>
<lb/>* restructuring and privatizing of specific major public enterprises; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing new approaches to attract private sector investment into major infrastructure projects.
<lb/>
<lb/>The CFSVP restructuring included the merging of CFSPC and CFSPS, as well as some of the functions of the CFSFA, to create the new Private Sector Finance and Advisory Services Group (CFSPS). The responsibilities of the former CFSOC were also redefined and the unit was renamed the Official Cofinancing and Trust Fund Management Group (CFSOC). The remaining functions of CFSFA created the new Project Finance Group (CFSPF).
<lb/>
<lb/>In April 1992, the CFSPS was further restructured, and became the Private Sector Development and Privatization Group (CFSPS).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1994, Hiroo Fukui succeeded Koji Kashiwaya as Vice President for CFSVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In March 1996, CFSVP was terminated and the subordinate CFSOC and the CFSPF staff and functions were absorbed by the new Resource Mobilization and Cofinancing Vice Presidency (RMCVP). The CFSPS staff and functions were removed from cofinancing operations and absorbed by the Private Sector Development (PSD) Department located in the Finance and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency (FPDVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>Trust Funds
<lb/>
<lb/>A trust fund is a financing arrangement set up with contributions from one or more donors and, in some cases, from the World Bank Group. The Bank establishes and administers trust funds as a complement to IDA and IBRD financing to promote development and aid effectiveness by leveraging its capacity and development knowledge. The Bank encourages trust funds that: draw on its operational role; include contributions from more than one donor; reinforce country capacity and ownership; and promote harmonization and alignment of donor aid modalities. Selectively, the Bank also provides specific administrative and financial services to the international community for trust funds that support work on issues of global importance and where the Bank may not perform an operational role. Trust funds differ to cofinancing arrangements in that trust funds are not limited to being tied to an existing Bank loan or grant for a program or project. Trust funds are also not generally initiated by the recipient member country like cofinancing. Many funds acquired through cofinancing arrangements are distributed into a Bank administered trust fund, but cofinancing arrangements serve as one example of a more restricted type of trust fund. Trust funds have a diversity of arrangements, which provides donors flexibility to target a variety of sectoral, regional, and global initiatives.
<lb/>
<lb/>The earliest use of trust funds in World Bank Group operations can be traced to 1960 when the Bank administered the multi-donor Indus Basin Development Fund to help finance the Indus Basin Project in Pakistan. In the 1970s, the Bank also served as a financing partner in multiple global programs in partnership, with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The most notable examples were, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), established in 1972, and the River Blindness (Onchocerciasis) Control Program established in 1974.
<lb/>
<lb/>Significant growth of trust fund mobilization, however, occurred in the early-1980s. At this time, the Bank lacked a formal trust fund administrator or central authority charged with implementing, coordinating, and monitoring trust fund administration, and developing trust fund related policies, guidelines, and procedures. Instead, trust fund administration responsibilities were fragmented among multiple Bank units. In this period, trust funds fell into two broad categories: 1) cofinanced trust funds; and 2) trust funds that are not tied directly to Bank loans (non-cofinanced), but augmented or diversified the sources of funding for a wide range of activities, including studies, institutional development training, and technical assistance.
<lb/>
<lb/>The first category, cofinanced trust funds, were tied to existing Bank loans or credits, and were arranged either through a joint or parallel cofinancing agreement. Joint cofinancing required an agreement between the Bank and the cofinancier on the expenditure of a common list of goods or services for a project, and abided by the procurement and disbursement procedures of the Bank. Agreed upon joint cofinanced funds were deposited into a Bank administered trust fund. With parallel cofinancing, the Bank and the cofinancier agreed to finance different services, goods, or parts of a project, but the cofinancier was not required to use the procurement and disbursement procedures of the Bank. This allowed for the cofinancier to disburse funds to colenders according to their own procedures, and not have to be part of a Bank administered trust fund. Parallel cofinancing funds were part of Bank administered trust funds, however, if the parallel cofinancing agreement was "untied" and the cofinancier chose to have the Bank administer funds on the cofinancier's behalf.
<lb/>
<lb/>The second category of trust funds were not tied directly to a Bank loan (non-cofinanced). Instead, the Bank served the role of trust fund administrator either as a fiscal agent or as the Executing Agency for trust funds financed by external donors. Such trust funds included contributions from governments, private foundations, or intergovernmental organizations. Many of these trust funds were either one-time contributions, or were subject to periodic replenishments, and were also free-standing programs with their own independent administration, executive secretariat, committee structure, and funding apparatus (e.g. CGIAR and the Global Environmental Facility [GEF]). Administering trust funds as a fiscal agent simply implied the Bank was responsible for the financial management functions of accounting and disbursement for a trust fund. The role of Executing Agency was more complex in that it included accounting and disbursement functions, but also responsibilities for hiring consultants and consulting of firms, procuring goods, organizing training activities, administering project budgets, and reviewing studies and reports prepared by consultants. The Executing Agency functions not related to financial management were generally handled by program coordinators, project officers, and advisers located in the Bank's sector departments, or country program departments and country project departments located in the Regional Vice Presidencies. An executive secretariat or independent administrative unit was also usually established to administer this type of trust fund.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1983, the newly established Vice President of Cofinancing (VPCOF) served as a focal point for the arrangement and management of cofinanced trust funds. VPCOF evolved into the central unit responsible for the management of some of the Bank's largest pooled and multi-donor technical assistance and consultant trust funds. In the early 1980s, the Japanese Government emerged as the largest cofinancier for the Bank and took a strong leadership role in leading cofinancing operations in the Bank. This included the launch of numerous grant-based trust fund programs through their donor agencies, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM). The Japanese led programs were collectively referred to as the Japanese Grant Facility (JGF).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1984, the Chief United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/Trust Funds Section (LOATF) of the Loan Department (LOA) located in Vice President of the Treasurer (TREVP) was established to administer financial management (accounting and disbursement) of the Bank's trust funds, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) financed trust funds in where the Bank served as the Executing Agent. Kah Hie Lau served as Chief for the UNDP/Trust Fund Section. The VPCOF continued to be the unit responsible for the arrangement of cofinanced trust funds, but the LOATF handled the financial management of cofinanced trust funds.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1985, the multi-donor Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa (SFA) and the multi-donor Consultant Trust Fund (CTF) Program consisting of donors from multiple Bank member countries were launched. They were also managed by VPCOF and its subordinate Cofinancing Advisory Unit (VPCAU).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1986, LOA and its subordinate LOATF were transferred to the Vice President of the Controller (CTRVP). LOATF was renamed and upgraded to the Trust Funds Division (LOATF) due to the expanding use of trust funds.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1987, the VPCOF remained structurally unchanged but new acronyms were assigned to the Office of the Vice President (COFVP) and to the Cofinancing Advisory Unit (COFAU).
<lb/>
<lb/>In the same year, the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM) was established in the Vice President of Financial Policy and Risk Management (FPRVP). The FRM focused on resource mobilization of official IDA concessional resources and IBRD capital resources, but also played a role in managing donor negotiations and relations related to trust funds that helped supplement the concessional lending of IDA operations. This was done in close collaboration with the COFVP, or other trust funds operations focused on providing concessional resources. For instance, the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa (SFA) consisted of trust funds designed specifically to supplement IDA projects and programs. The COFVP and FRM worked closely to mobilize resources for SFA, and to help foster agreements between the Bank, borrower, and donor.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1989, the COFVP and the subordinate COFAU were terminated, and replaced by the Vice President of Financial Intermediation and Cofinancing (CFSVP). Within CFSVP, the new Official Cofinancing Group (CFSOC) served as the focal point for managing the Bank's cofinanced trust funds. CFSOC served as the key unit responsible for managing the technical assistance portions of the Consultant Trust Funds (CTF) Program, and the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund, which consolidated numerousgrant-based programs of the former Japanese Grant Facility (JGF). Specific responsibilities of CFSOC included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing and maintaining institutional relations with the main donor agencies;
<lb/>
<lb/>* establishing and monitoring formal arrangements for cofinancing so that clear operational procedures and policies are in place for cofinancing with colenders;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assisting both potential cofinanciers and task managers in bringing together financing interests and funding needs; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* mobilizing grant funds for consultants to be used for the Bank's operational work, and other special purposes.
<lb/>
<lb/>John Taylor served as the Manager for CFSOC.
<lb/>
<lb/>In same year, the Bank issued Operation Manual Statement (OMS) 4.40, Trust Funds. This statement designated the role of Trust Funds Administrator (LAOTF), and assigned this role to the reorganized Loan and Trust Fund Department (LOA). This was done to expand the responsibilities of the former LOATF Chief, strengthen trust fund policies and guidelines, consolidate the fragmented trust fund administration functions, and strengthen trust funds administration Bank wide. Specific responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* implementing the policies and guidelines for administering funds;
<lb/>
<lb/>* ensuring the consistency of information given to donors on the terms and conditions on which funds are administered by the Bank;
<lb/>
<lb/>* coordinating within the Bank to ensure compliance with Bank policies and with the specific provisions of each agreement;
<lb/>
<lb/>* participating in negotiating agreements and clearing them before signature;
<lb/>
<lb/>* ensuring that disbursements are for eligible countries only;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing financial reports on each fund in accordance with the agreement;
<lb/>
<lb/>* coordinating the preparation by Task Managers of implementation reports and other reporting requirements; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* requesting the donor to replenish trust fund accounts as needed.
<lb/>
<lb/>The new Trust Funds Administrator of the Loan and Trust Fund Department (LOA) remained in the CTRVP. Kah Hie Lau was promoted to the Trust Funds Administrator.
<lb/>
<lb/>In1991, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was launched. The COFVP and the FRM served as the key units in the Bank responsible for the resource mobilization and replenishment of the GEF trust funds. In the same year, the Trust Funds Administrator was transferred to the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM) located in the Vice President of Financial Policy and Risk Management (FPRVP), and its acronym changed to FRMTF.
<lb/>
<lb/>In February 1992, the CFSVP underwent a comprehensive reorganization and the CFSOC wasrenamed the Official Cofinancing and Trust Fund Management Group (CFSOC). The newly reorganized CFSOC responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* administering the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) Fund;
<lb/>
<lb/>* administering the Consultant Trust Fund (CTF) Program;
<lb/>
<lb/>* managing institutional relationships with bilateral and multilateral cofinanciers to include proactive initiatives to increase cofinancing; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining the Bank's Cofinancing Database and CTF Management Information system.
<lb/>
<lb/>CharlesMeissner served as the new Manager for the reorganized CFSOC.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1993, the Trust Funds Administrator was removed from FRM, and transferred to the Trust Funds Administration Department (CTRTA) in the Controller Vice Presidency (CTRVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>In March 1996, CFSVP was terminated and CFSOC staff and functions as well as the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM) were absorbed by the new Resource Mobilization and Cofinancing Vice Presidency (RMCVP). CFSOC was placed in the new Cofinancing and Project Finance Department (CAP), and renamed the Official Cofinancing and Trust Funds Group (CAPOC).
<lb/>
<lb/>The Trust Funds Administrator was transferred to the new Trust Funds Division (ACTTF) in the Accounting Department (ACT) of the Controller Vice Presidency (CTRVP), and supported the new RMCVP in financial management of trust funds, and implementing policies and guidelines related to trust fund administration.
<lb/>
<lb/> IDA replenishment
<lb/>
<lb/>This section focuses on the units responsible for the following functions: leading and supporting IDA replenishments negotiations with the Bank's IDA Deputies; managing the finances of IDA's concessional lending funds; managing the allocation of IDA resources; and monitoring the implementation of IDA mandated policies within Bank operations.
<lb/>
<lb/>The International Development Agency (IDA) was established in 1960 to complement the role of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in promoting economic development by offering concessional financing to the poorer developing countries within its membership. The IDA replenished its resources through negotiations held every three years, wherein the Bank sought donations from its wealthiest Part I member countries.
<lb/>
<lb/>The first replenishment of IDA resources was held in 1962. The Bank's Board of Governors requested that the Board of Executive Director's assess financial requirements for IDA operations. Subsequently, the Financial Policy Committee of the Board was given the task of leading replenishment negotiations, and did so in a number of informal meetings with Part I member country leaders.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1965, the second replenishment was held and, much like the first replenishment, it was initiated by the Board of Governors with a request to the Board of Executive Directors. The second IDA replenishment negotiations established Part I member country representatives as the new IDA Deputies, and the formal IDA replenishment negotiations became known as the IDA Deputy Meetings. IDA replenishment negotiations included senior officials of the Bank andthe IDA Deputies.
<lb/>
<lb/>The third replenishment was held in 1968, and the process of initiating formal negotiations by a Board of Governors request to the Executive Directors was discontinued. Formal donor meetings with the IDA Deputies where arranged by Bank management after this point. The Office of the Vice President of Sir Denis Rickett (OVPDR) established on April 1, 1968 was the unit responsible for such IDA replenishment arrangements. The OVPDR was created in conjunction with the appointment of PresidentRobert McNamara, and reported directly to him. This OVPDR was established as a liaison office of the Bank with Part I countries. Specific responsibilities included leading negotiations for IDA replenishments, and providing information on the Bank's lending programs and policies. The OVPDR was not assigned any direct responsibility for department supervision.
<lb/>
<lb/>On October 4, 1974, with the resignation of Vice President Rickett, the OVPDR was terminated. The functions of OVPDR were absorbed by the Vice President of Finance (VPF) led by I.P.M. Cargill. The VPF was also responsible for managing the Bank's financial operations and advising the President on Bank financial policies, and consisted of the following subordinate units: the Treasurer's Department (TRE) and the Programming and Budgeting Department (PAB). The IDA replenishment function was supported by two Special Assistants in the VPF Front Office. The PAB Department's Financial Analysis Division (PABFA) was responsible for providing staff support to IDAreplenishment efforts of the Front Office assistants.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1977, the Financial Analysis Division (PABFA) of the PAB Department absorbed greater responsibility for supporting IDA replenishment from the former IDA Special Assistants of the VPF Front Office due to increased workload of the function, and planned retirement of one its assistants. The VPF continued to lead IDA replenishment negotiations, but was primarily supported by PABFA. Within PABFA, the IDA replenishment related functions were merged with financial policy, financial projections, and IBRD capital increase support responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of PABFA included:
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining analysis of Bank Group financial policies and activities as they affect the soundness and financial needs of the institution;
<lb/>
<lb/>* alerting management to potential financial problem conditions and proposed changes to the Bank Group's financial policies;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing staff support related to IBRD capital increases, including periodic reviews of the appropriate capital structure of the Bank and analysis of the size, timing, and distribution by country of increases in subscribed capital;
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing staff support for the periodic IDA replenishment negotiations, including analysis of the size of replenishment burden-sharing arrangements, voting rights issues, method of payment, maintenance of value, and other topics;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing periodic reviews of the Bank's lending rate, liquidity policy, and allocation of net income;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing the sections on Bank/IDA financial position and prospects for inclusion in the annual review of the five-year program as well as for the mid-year review of operations;
<lb/>
<lb/>* preparing standard long-term financial projections for the Bank and IDA;
<lb/>
<lb/>* reviewing the changes in the quality of the Bank's overall loan portfolio; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining awareness of changes in the external financial environment.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>The PABFA was led by Division Chief David Bock at the time it absorbed IDA replenishment related functions.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In July 1978, VPFI.P.M. Cargill was promoted to Senior Vice President of Finance (SVPFI) to further assist the Bank President more broadly on priority areas, and serve as Acting President and Board Chairman in the absence of the President. The position of Vice President of Finance (VPF) remained, and Cargill relinquished most of his responsibilities of overseeing the operations of the Finance Complex to the new VPF Moeen Qureshi. With this change, PABFA reported to the VPF, but still supported the SVPFI, who continued to lead IDA replenishment negotiations.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1980, SVPFI I.P.M. Cargill retired from the Bank. Moeen Qureshi was promoted soon after as the new SVPFI, and retained the responsibility of leading IDA replenishment negotiations. The position of VPF was terminated.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>At the same time, the PABFA and the Financial Studies Division (PABFS) of Programming and Budgeting Department (PAB) were transferred to the new Financial Policy and Analysis Department (FPA), which reported directly to the SVPFI. The FPA Department was assigned the following responsibilities:
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>* performing analytical work on Bank financial policies, and supporting the Senior Vice President, Finance in such key activities as IDA replenishment negotiations, IBRD capital increases and analyzing the financial impacts of new initiatives;
<lb/>
<lb/>* producing long-term financial projections and plans beyond a one-year horizon;
<lb/>
<lb/>* assessing and managing financial risks; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* providing support to Operations in areas involving financial analysis.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>The former Financial Studies Division and Programming and Budgeting Department maintained their titles in the new FPA, but their acronyms were changed to FPAFA and FPAFS, respectively. The function supporting IDA replenishment negotiations was moved to the FPAFS Division.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1983, the FPA reported to the new Vice President of Financial Policy, Planning, and Budgeting (FPBVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>During the 1987 Bank-wide reorganization, the FPA was terminated. As a result, the FPAPP and FPAMA divisions were absorbed by the new Risk Management and Financial Policy Department (FRS), and the FPAFS, which maintained responsibility for IDA replenishment negotiations, was absorbed by the new Resource Mobilization Department (FRM). Both departments reported to the new Vice President of Financial Policy and Risk Management (FPRVP), which reported to the new Senior Vice President of Finance (FINSV) Ernest Stern.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>FRM was given the responsibility of securing official funding necessary to fund the Bank's planned programs. Official funding sources sought by FRM included capital subscriptions by Bank shareholders for IBRD lending operations and IDA concessional resources for its lending to countries which were not creditworthy for IBRD borrowing. Specific responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>* maintaining a positive environment for Bank funding approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* developing a system for monitoring funding approaches;
<lb/>
<lb/>* monitoring the adequacy of the Bank's capital and taking steps to replenish it;
<lb/>
<lb/>* managing the subscription payments and the release of local currency contributions;
<lb/>
<lb/>* replenishing IDA;
<lb/>
<lb/>* managing donor contributions to IDA's contributions;
<lb/>
<lb/>* exploring new facilities that use official funding; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* analyzing the role of Bank/IDA flows in relation to aggregate aid and commercial flows.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>At its inception, the FRM had the following subordinate units: the Replenishment Policy Division (FRMRP) and the Replenishment Operations Division (FRMRO). Basil Kavalasky served as Director for FRM.
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1991, the Trust Funds Administrator Kah Hie Lau was transferred from the Loan and Trusts Funds Department (LOA) of the Vice President of Controller (CTRVP) to FRM. In 1993, the Trust Funds Administrator was removed from FRM, and transferred to the Trust Funds Administration Department (CTRTA) in the Controller Vice Presidency (CTRVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1996, the Vice President of Financial Policy and Risk Management (FPRVP) was terminated. As a result, the Risk Management and Financial Policy Department (FRS), was absorbed by the new Office of the Vice President Financial Policy and Institutional Strategy (FPIVP). The Resource Mobilization Department (FRM) was transferred to the new Resource Mobilization and Cofinancing Vice Presidency (RMCVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>
<lb/>Cofinancing, trust funds, and IDA replenishment (1996-present)
<lb/>
<lb/>In April 1996, the cofinancing, trust funds, and IDA replenishment functions were merged under the new Resource Mobilization and Cofinancing Vice Presidency (RMCVP). More specifically, the functions of the former Official Cofinancing and Trust Fund Management Group (CFSOC) and the Project Finance Group (CFSPF) of the former Vice President of Financial Intermediation and Cofinancing (CFSVP), and the functions of the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM) of the former Financial Policy and Resource Mobilization Vice Presidency (FPRVP) were absorbed by the new RMCVP. The new RMCVP was created to enable the Bank to forge a more effective partnerships with the donor community and the private sector. RMCVP focused on mobilizing funds from official and private sources to IBRD and IDA operations and services and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). Specific responsibilities included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* expanding resource mobilization efforts to achieve greater financial sustainability through donor support, official cofinancing, export credit, and trust funds;
<lb/>
<lb/>* accelerating the implementation of the guarantee Program, expand the use of guarantees, and increase the pipelines of guarantee operations; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* supporting the Bank's efforts to mainstream the trust fund activities into the Bank's processes.
<lb/>
<lb/>At its establishment, the RMCVP consisted of the following subordinate units: the Cofinancing and Project Finance Department (CAP) and the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM). CAP consisted of the Official Cofinancing and Trust Funds Group (CAPOC) and the Project Finance and Guarantees Group (CAPPF). The FRM Department consisted of the Replenishment Operations Unit (FRMRO) and the Replenishment Policy Unit (FRMRP). CAPOC served as the main unit for cofinancing related responsibilities, which consisted of promoting and monitoring official cofinancing of Bank Group operations. CAPOC was also responsible for trust fund functions including monitoring, mobilization, and administration.
<lb/>
<lb/>Hiroo Fukui served as Vice President for RMCVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>Soon after the establishment of the RMCVP, the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, a debt restructuring trust fund, was launched. RMCVP served as trustee for this fund. In 1997, the global trust fund program, Development Grant Facility (DGF), was launched. The RMCVP also served as trustee for this fund.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1998, the RMCVP was restructured. FRM remained unchanged, but CAP functions were divided into two new departments: the Trust Fund and Cofinancing Department (TFC) and the Project Finance and Guarantees Department (PFG).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 1999, PFG was removed from the RMCVP, and its functions were transferred to the Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Vice Presidency (PSIVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>The early 2000s marked a significant increase in the Bank's trust fund portfolio, primarily due to the 2002 launch of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This prompted the creation of numerous global programs and partnership trust funds to respond to the international initiatives of the MDG, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (the Global Fund) and the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), both established in 2002. The use of global programs and partnership existed prior to this period, most notably GEF and DGF, but their use rapidly expanded in the 2000s.
<lb/>
<lb/>Furthermore, due to the growth and increasing complexity of trust funds, this period also experienced a shift in the type of trust funds arrangements used for various funds. This included the growing use of the following types of trust fund arrangements: Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs); Bank Executed Trust Funds (BETF); and Recipient Executed Trust Funds (RETF). FIFs, in particular, saw significant expansion foster the arrangement of complex global programs and partnership trust funds. With the changing trust fund landscape, more traditional cofinancing arrangements experienced gradual decline as a source for external funding. Cofinancing, however, still remained a component of these trust fund arrangements, and the cofinancing function was integrated into broader trust funds operations.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2001, RMCVP was again restructured. The functions of TFC were split into two new departments: the Trust Fund Operations Department (TFO) and the Trust Fund Strategy and Donor Relations Department (TFS). FRM remained unchanged.
<lb/>
<lb/>In June 2003, the RMCVP was terminated and its functions absorbed by the new Concessional Finance and Global Partnerships Vice Presidency (CFPVP). The responsibilities of the new CFPVP included:
<lb/>
<lb/>* mobilizing and managing concessional and grant finance in the Bank;
<lb/>
<lb/>* agreeing to the policy framework with which these resources are provided by donors; and
<lb/>
<lb/>* facilitating and overseeing the robust and accountable framework of partnerships to take forward the Bank's strategic priorities.
<lb/>
<lb/>At its establishment, the CFPVP consisted of the following subordinate departments and units: the Resource Mobilization Department (FRM); the Global Programs and Partnerships (GPP); the Trust Fund Operations (TFO); the Trust Fund Strategy and Donor Relations Department (TFS); and the Multilateral Trustee Operations (MTO).
<lb/>
<lb/>Geoffrey Lamb served as Vice President of the CFPVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2004, the Finance and Risk Unit (CFPFR) and the Multilateral Trustee Innovative FinanceUnit (CFPMI) were added to CFPVP. In 2006, Phillippe Le Houerou succeeded Geoffrey Lamb as Vice President for CFPVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2008, the GPP and the TFO were merged to create the new Global Partnerships and Trust Fund Operations Department (CFPTO). CFPTO was assigned two subordinate units: the Global Partnership and Trust Fund Policy Unit (PTP) and the Program Administration and Management Unit (PAM).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2009, Axel van Trotsenburg succeeded Phillippe Le Houerou as Vice President for CFPVP. Around this time, the CFPVP was reorganized into the following subordinate units: IDA Resource Mobilization (CFPIR); the Global Partnerships and Trust Fund Operations (CFPTO); and the Multilateral Trusteeship and Innovative Financing (CFPMI).
<lb/>
<lb/>In 2012, Joachim von Amsberg succeeded Axel van Trotsenburg as Vice President for CFPVP.
<lb/>
<lb/>In July 2014, the CFPVP was terminated and replaced by the new Development Finance Vice Presidency (DFIVP).
<lb/>
<lb/>The Development Finance Vice Presidency (DFIVP) absorbed the IDA replenishment, trust fund, and cofinancing related functions of the former CFPVP. It additionally absorbed functions related to IBRD capital monitoring, planning, and management from the former Vice President of Corporate Finance and Risk Management (CFRVP). The DFIVP includes the following subordinate units: the Development Finance Resource Mobilization Department (DFiRM); the Development Partner Relations Department (DFDPR); the Trust Funds and Partnerships Department (DFPTF); and the IBRD Corporate Finance Department (DFICF). Joachim von Amsberg serves as Vice President for DFIVP.</p>
