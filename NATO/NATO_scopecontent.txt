<p>These files highlight NATO’s role and involvement in the drafting, negotiating and eventual signature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Treaty was opened for signature on 1 July 1968, and came into force on 5 March 1970. NATO, as an organization, is not a formal party to the Treaty but all its member states are signatories.<lb/><lb/>NATO also was involved with the NPT to ensure that NATO’s existing nuclear sharing arrangements were fully compatible with Articles I and II of the Treaty.<lb/><lb/>The different volumes show NATO’s deep involvement in the Treaty, and their commitment at all levels to full implementation of the articles in the Treaty. Records show heads of state, ambassadors, and working-level officers discussing and reviewing key components of the Treaty and how the articles could impact individual Allies, European integration, global and regional safeguards, and NATO.<lb/><lb/>Some of the documents originate from the various delegations, especially the United States Mission to NATO. The US Mission kept Allies apprised on the progress of the negotiations bilaterally with the USSR, and Allies discussed negotiations in Geneva in the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee, which included 4 Allies. The US maintained the principle of no consultations with the Soviets on the NPT without consultation with Allies.</p>
