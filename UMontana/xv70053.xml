      <p>John W. Blair arrived in Virginia City, Montana, in July 1864 with a
		  party of 300 who traveled to Montana in search of gold. Blair traveled from
		  Seneca, Ohio, where he was born in October 1841. His father, Thomas Blair, was
		  of Scotch-Irish ancestry. His mother, Mary Saylor, came from a prominent
		  Virginia family. John W. Blair lived on his family’s farm and was educated in
		  public schools until he left to fight in the Civil War. He was a member of the
		  49th Ohio Regiment of Minute Men. After Blair arrived in Montana he mined in
		  Virginia City for a while and spent his first winter in Utah. After that he
		  worked in the Last Chance Gulch mine near Helena, Montana, for six years. </p>
      <p>In 1872 Blair moved to Helmville, Montana, which is located in the
		  Blackfoot Valley east of Missoula, Montana. He established one of the largest
		  ranches in the state at the time about two miles from Helmville. At one point
		  Blair had 28,000 acres where he mostly raised livestock. He was well known for
		  raising fine breeds of sheep and shorthorn cattle. During this time Blair was
		  elected to Montana’s first state legislature in 1889 as a republican. Blair
		  didn’t know he was nominated and voted for himself thinking the name on the
		  ticket was another man with the same name from Anaconda. While in the
		  legislature he served on the labor committee and was elected again in 1912.
		  Blair sold his ranch in 1910 and established the bank, Blair &amp; Company, in
		  Helmville. He was also involved in the development of the near-by town of
		  Drummond, Montana, where he and his partner financed the building of the Palace
		  Hotel. He also helped to establish Drummond State Bank. Blair was a member of
		  the Montana Pioneers Society. He was known as one of the state’s wealthiest men
		  and held a tremendous amount of deeded land. </p>

      <p>This collection includes two deeds for the exchange of land in
		  Montana. The first deed, dated March 24, 1899, involves the sale of $4,007.98
		  worth of land in what was then called Deer Lodge County. The Northern Pacific
		  Railway Company deeded the land to John W. Blair. The second deed, dated
		  January 27, 1902, involves the sale of $3,000 worth of land in Powell County.
		  Mary E. Mitchell, J. Paul Mitchell, William D. Mitchell and Mary M. Scanland
		  deeded the land to Conrad Kohrs. Kohrs was called the “cattle king of Montana”
		  and owned a 30,000-acre ranch near the city of Deer Lodge. He owned a large
		  store in the 1860s at Last Chance Gulch, where Blair mined, that mostly sold
		  beef to miners. </p>
