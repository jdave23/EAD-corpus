      <p>H.W. (Harold Wave) Whicker was born in Columbia City, Indiana in 1895.
		  Whicker graduated from Indiana University before serving in World War I.
		  Whicker relocated to the Pacific Northwest after the war and attended State
		  Normal School at Cheney, which is currently known as Eastern Washington
		  University. Attending school in Cheney, Whicker met his wife Meta. H.W. and
		  Meta continued their education at State College of Washington in Pullman (now
		  Washington State University). After graduating with a Bachelor's of Arts,
		  Whicker taught English at State College before attending the University of
		  Washington as a graduate student of English, History and Government. He
		  continued in academia teaching at the University of Montana, the University of
		  Maine, and the Naval Academy. By 1936, H.W. and Meta returned to the Pacific
		  Northwest where they lived out their retirement. Whicker published one book
		  length work titled <emph render="italic">Silver Strike: The True Story of
		  Silver Mining in the Coeur d'Alenes</emph>, which is an account by William T.
		  Stoll as recorded and edited by Whicker. Whicker also published a number of
		  short stories and essays, including works in Frontier and Midland, Scribner's
		  Magazine, and the North American Review. Whicker passed away in 1955 in Oak
		  Knoll, California.</p>
