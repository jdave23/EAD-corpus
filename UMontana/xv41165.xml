      <p>Charles E. and Alicia D. Conrad had three children, Charles Davenport
		  “Charlie” (born in Ft. Benton, Montana, in 1882), Catherine “Kate” Conrad (born
		  in Fort Benton in 1885), and Alicia Conrad (born in Kalispell in 1892). </p>
      <p>Alicia Conrad first married Walter McCutcheon, an employee of the
		  Conrad family-owned Kalispell Mercantile Company, in 1914. They had one
		  daughter, Alicia Ann “Timmie,” in 1921. The marriage ended in divorce in 1924.
		  Alicia’s second marriage, in February 1928, was to George Henry Campbell of
		  Great Falls, Montana.The couple remained together until his death forty-five
		  years later.</p>
      <p> George Henry Campbell was born in 1890 to Mary L. Wardwell and
		  Charles Henry Campbell of Westminster West, Vermont. Growing up on their ranch
		  near Malta and moving into Great Falls for high school, George graduated from
		  Yale’s Sheffield School of Engineering in 1910 and joined with his father as C.
		  H. Campbell and Son, a central Montana land management firm. Volunteering in
		  1917-1918 he flew as a pursuit (fighter) pilot in the World War I Nieuport and
		  Spad biplanes of the U. S. Army Signal Corps, Army Air Corps and American
		  Expeditionary Force in France, earning charter membership in the Order of
		  Daedalians and its Montana Chapter. After the war, he returned to the
		  partnership with his father. Alicia Conrad and George Henry Campbell had one
		  son, Charles Conrad Campbell, born in 1928. In 1933 the family moved back to
		  Kalispell, Montana, where Alicia’s hereditary Conrad home was her primary
		  residence until her donation of it to the city as a National Historical Site in
		  1974, seven years prior to her death at the age of eighty-eight in 1981. George
		  Campbell died in 1973.</p>

      <p>This collection includes photocopies of letters written by Alicia
		  Conrad to George Campbell prior to their marriage in February 1928. At the time
		  of the first letter Alicia Conrad was thirty-four years old, from a
		  well-respected Montana family, and a divorcee with a school-age daughter. The
		  tone of her early letters is playful and flirtatious. In a later letter she
		  mentions the stress of her divorce and later still her concern about Campbell's
		  father's opinion of her. According to one letter, even Timmie posed a problem
		  for the couple's happiness as the child misbehaved around Campbell. Still,
		  Conrad expresses great happiness at the developing relationship.</p>
