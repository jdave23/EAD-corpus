      <p>Washington J. McCormick, a founder of Missoula, Montana, was born in
		  1835 in the town of Muncie, Indiana. He attended Asbury (Depauw) University,
		  where he received a law degree in 1856. McCormick decided to move to Utah a
		  year later. He quickly became involved in local politics, and established a
		  small law practice. McCormick moved to the capital of the Montana Territory,
		  Virginia City, in 1863. After serving in the First Territorial Legislature and
		  as the secretary of the 1866 Constitutional Convention, he moved to the
		  Missoula area to settle down and practice law.</p>
      <p>McCormick became associated with Judge Worden and "Captain"
		  Christopher Higgins, both of whom are noted for planning and building the city
		  of Missoula. Higgins and McCormick eventually became successful law partners.
		  McCormick married Higgins' sister, Kate, in 1869. Together they had seven
		  children, the most notable being W.J. McCormick, Jr., a prominent Missoula
		  attorney born in 1884.</p>
      <p>McCormick is remembered for his active life as a strong advocate for
		  the growth and development of the Missoula area. Besides the time he spent in
		  the legislature, McCormick briefly served as the superintendent of the Flathead
		  Reservation north of Missoula. His influence was also instrumental in the
		  decision to route the Northern Pacific Railroad through Missoula, which helped
		  to provide an avenue for future growth and prosperity for the city. McCormick
		  died in February 1889 due to injuries sustained in a windstorm at Fort
		  Owen.</p>

      <p>This collection contains documents that span from McCormick's early

		  legal documents from the firm of Higgins and McCormick, which was in business
		  until his death in 1889. Included in the collection are several receipts,
		  letters, and official documents pertaining to McCormick's estate, which was
		  managed by his wife Kate and son, W. J. McCormick, Jr.</p>
