      <p>Jack R. Lincke was the author of 
		<title>Jenny Was No Lady</title>. He was born in Butte, Montana, on
		October 10, 1903. Lincke began flying the JN-4D after World War I and quickly
		became hooked on aviation. He was a member of the OX-5 Club, named after the
		type of engine found in the JN-4D. Lincke worked as a journalist and as an
		aviator for the Army, Navy, and National Chinese Air Force. He also owned a
		public relations business in Pasadena, California. 
		<title>Jenny Was No Lady</title> was published in 1970, after years of
		research that Lincke began in 1927. His other published work is entitled 
		<title>Aircraft Manual for Inspection, Maintenance, and
		  Repair</title>.</p>
