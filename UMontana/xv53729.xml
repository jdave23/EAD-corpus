      <p>James H. Morley was born in Westfield, Massachusetts on May 5, 1824.
		  He attended Massachusetts Normal School and was a student of engineering with
		  Adna Anderson, a Chief Engineer with the Northern Pacific Railway. Morley's
		  first work in engineering was on the Connecticul River Railroad. He then worked
		  with the Engineer Corps of the New York and Erie Railroad, the Pacific
		  Railroad, and the Iron Mountain Railroad. He married Virginia F. Woodruff in
		  1855. </p>
      <p>In 1862 Morley left St. Louis, Missouri, and traveled up the Missouri
		  River on the steamer Spread Eagle. He arrived in Fort Benton, Montana, on June
		  20, 1862, to join the Montana gold rush. Morley, with a group of men, mined for
		  gold mostly in western Montana south of present day Missoula, ranging almost as
		  far south as Yellowstone. He arrived back in St. Louis on August 4, 1865.</p>
      <p>In 1865 Morley returned to work for the Iron Mountain Railroad, first
		  as Chief Engineer and then as Superintendent, completing extensive lines of
		  that railroad before leaving in 1883.</p>
      <p>Morley died in 1889.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>James H. Morley's daily dairy accounts from 1862-1865 begin with his
		  trip to Montana from St. Louis, Missouri, onboard a steamer up the Missouri
		  River. It continues with his group's two week journey from Fort Benton to their
		  camp and mining site on Gold Creek, between what is now Drummond and Deer
		  Lodge, Montana, with supply loaded wagons. From that point his diary entries
		  describe the day's shaft or sluice mining efforts, reports from group members
		  who had traveled to other possible mining sites, and descriptions of his own
		  travels around Hellgate Canyon and into Rock Creek, then on to Beaverhead,
		  Flint Creek, Wisdom River, the Big Hole prairie, and back up to Deer Lodge
		  Creek. By January 1863 Morley and his team had ranged as far east in Montana as
		  the Gallatin and Three Forks areas. Also in January Morley noted the results of
		  a trial of Plummer, probably the infamous Harry Plummer, one year before that
		  man was hung by vigilantes without a trial. Morley briefly describes his own
		  contact with justice as a juror in a trial of accused murderer Bill Mitchell.
		  </p>
      <p>Over the next two years Morley sometimes described the daily drudgery
		  of mining work but also mining claim disputes, planning and charting a plat map
		  for Centreville, wildlife and geological features, scouting for and staking new
		  claims, difficulties of sending and receiving mail, and the mining towns of
		  Bannack and Virginia City, Montana. His daily entries end with his return to
		  St. Louis in August, 1865.</p>
