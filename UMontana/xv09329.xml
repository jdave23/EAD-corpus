		  Minnesota Medical School in 1893 and served his internship at Cook County
		  Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota. Shortly after, he came to Missoula, Montana as
		  the assistant chief surgeon at the Northern Pacific Hospital. Spottswood became
		  chief surgeon in 1903 and served in that position until 1908. In 1903, he
		  married Lenita J. Bonner, the daughter of Montana pioneer E. L. Bonner. The
		  couple had two children, Edward and Lenita. Dr. Spottswood died May 14,
		  1951.</p>
