      <p>On November 1, 1861 twenty-four year old George Wirt enlisted in
		  Brackett's Battalion of the Minnesota Calvary. Organized on a volunteer basis,
		  the battalion traveled from Iowa to Minnesota to assist with peacekeeping
		  duties between the Native Americans and the white settlers. George Wirt's diary
		  focuses on the Indian Campaign of 1864; an intensified effort by the federal
		  government to provide protection for settlers traveling west. In June 1864 the
		  government sent a series of dispatches to tribes in the North Dakota, Montana,
		  and Idaho territories in an attempt to create a treaty promoting a peaceful
		  coexistence between Native American tribes and the incoming settlers. Those who
		  did not respond to the treaty were considered hostile. The battalion based
		  itself at Fort Sully, near present day Pierre, South Dakota. Wirt belonged to
		  Company B under the direction of captains D. Mortimer West, William Smith, and
		  John A. Reed. The troop's duties primarily consisted of conducting daily
		  scouting excursions and accompanying caravans of settlers traveling westward.
		  George Wirt served in the battalion until June 1, 1866 and eventually attained
		  the rank of sergeant. Brackett's Battalion continued its work in the west
		  through 1866.</p>

      <p> The reel of microfilm contains George Wirt's diary entries from April
		  through October of 1864. Most of the original entries are difficult to read but
		  a full handwritten transcription by Harry F. Wirt follows the original. The
		  entries chronicle Wirt's time serving with Brackett's Battalion including notes
		  on daily conditions such as the temperature, the hour when camp broke,
		  available water, available grazing for their horses, receiving orders to move
		  to a new location, and the length of the day's march. He also records events or
		  sights of interest such as meeting another troop, see "thousands of dead
		  buffalo," and confrontations between the battalion and the various Native
		  American tribes. Among the locations that George Wirt mentions, as he describes
		  the troops travels, are Fort Sully, South Dakota; Fort Rice, North Dakota; Fort
		  Benton, Montana; and Fort Ridgely, Minnesota. The collection also includes an
		  article entitled, "Minnesota in the Civil and Indian Wars, 1861-1865" prepared
		  by the Board of Commissioners of Minnesota, published by the Pioneer Press
		  Company in St. Paul, Minn. in 1890 .</p>
