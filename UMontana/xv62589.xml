      <p>The activist group Missoula Women for Peace (MWP) was formed in 1970
		  by a group of Missoula, Montana mothers and other community members concerned
		  with the escalating American military presence in Vietnam. During the Vietnam
		  War the group was extremely active, participating in peace marches, working to
		  end the draft, and writing letters to local, state and national officials to
		  protest the conflict in Vietnam. In the years following the Vietnam War, MWP
		  members continued to educate themselves and the public on a broad array of
		  peace related issues by hosting and attending lectures, reading books,
		  distributing literature and holding public meetings. The group also initiated
		  an annual bake sale on April 15th, Tax Day during the 1970s, to alert citizens
		  to the significant amount of their tax dollars used for military purposes. </p>
      <p>MWP continued to be an active voice for peace and social justice in
		  Missoula throughout the 1980s. The group became a member of Women’s
		  International League for Peace and Freedom in 1981, a relationship that proved
		  beneficial to both organizations through the exchange of information, speakers
		  and financial support. In 1985 MWP group members succeeded in placing a statue
		  of Montana’s prominent peace activist, suffragette and politician, Jeannette
		  Rankin, in the Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.
		  The 1980s also marked the beginning of the group’s Peace Consortium Dinners, a
		  monthly gathering of peace groups in the Missoula area. From these dinners and
		  similar collaborative events came the idea for a clearinghouse of peace
		  resources in Western Montana. This vision was realized when MWP members, along
		  with countless other groups and individuals, facilitated the opening of the
		  Jeanette Rankin Peace Center in 1986. </p>
      <p>The 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century have seen a slowdown
		  in MWP sponsored activities as the founding members grow older. Yet, the group
		  continues to meet on a regular basis and sponsor many of its annual events such
		  as the Tax Day Bake Sale. MWP has also vigorously protested the Persian Gulf
		  War of 1991, the Kosovo Conflict of the late 1990s, violence in Latin America
		  and many other conflicts around the world, and remains optimistic that future
		  generations will take up the fight to firmly establish world peace. </p>
      <p>Dawn Walsh, a staff member and student of the Women’s History
		  Department at the University of Montana, conducted the Missoula Women for Peace
		  Oral History Project in 2000. The project was part of Walsh’s internship with
		  the Jeannette Rankin Peace Resource Center, and was supervised by John Bertche,
		  a board member at the Peace Center, and Anya Jabour, a history professor at The
		  University of Montana. The objective of the project was to document and
		  celebrate the history of Missoula Women for Peace, as well as record the
		  personal reflections of eleven veteran group members before they grew too old
		  to participate in oral history interviews. </p>
      <p>During the course of the project Dawn Walsh recorded eleven individual
		  and one group oral history interview with MWP members. She also attended and
		  photographed MWP sponsored events such as the annual Tax Day Bake Sale and the
		  donation of peace-related children’s books to the Missoula Public Library.
		  Walsh also organized a banquet in honor of MWP members that was held at the
		  Jeanette Rankin Peace Resource Center in May of 2000. After the completion of
		  the Missoula Women for Peace Oral History Project, Walsh donated all materials
		  compiled and created during the project’s course to the K. Ross Toole Archives
		  with the hope that they will inspire and educate future generations of women
		  activists. </p>
