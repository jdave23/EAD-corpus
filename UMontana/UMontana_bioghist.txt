<p>Dorothy Floerchinger, the daughter of Ralph and Willie Mae Bracegirdle
Bruner, was born on February 22, 1901, in Scotia, Nebraska. Graduating from
Valier High School in Great Falls, Montana, in 1920, Mrs. Floerchinger began a
career of teaching in Pondera County Schools. Due to an acute teacher shortage
following World War I, the State Superintendent of Schools issued a special
permit allowing her to teach elementary school with no professional training.
She married Louis Floerchinger on November 15, 1924 and raised five children on
the family farm near Conrad, Montana.</p>
<p>Throughout her life, Mrs. Floerchinger was an avid historian. Mrs.
Floerchinger published several historical pieces on Northern Montana - from the
history of the City of Conrad to the history of Pondera County. She did
extensive research on the Conrad family of Kalispell, who founded the city of
Conrad, and was involved in the preservation of local Conrad history. She also
wrote literary pieces, publishing an anthology of poems and short stories
called
<title>Highway to Happiness</title>, a biographical tribute to a Conrad
minister and humanitarian called
<title>To Speak of Love Was Not Enough</title>, and her family history,
<title>The Bruner Bunch</title>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Floerchinger was active in many organizations, including the
Montana Library Association, the Montana Farmer's Union, and the Montana
Democratic Party. Besides an interest in history, Mrs. Floerchinger was a poet
and an artist. Mrs. Floerchinger died in Choteau, Montana, on May 8, 1996.</p>

<p>Women’s Studies is an interdisciplinary program at the University of
Montana that first began development in the early 1970s. The first step in the
development of Women’s Studies occurred in 1971 when eight faculty and
community members collaborated to present a symposium on campus entitled,
“Realities and Reaction: A Symposium on Women.” Following the symposium,
faculty members began to offer courses focusing on women’s contributions to
knowledge. Many of these courses were offered in collaboration with the Women’s
Resource Center on campus. </p>
<p>In 1975, the first proposal for establishing a women’s studies
concentration within the Liberal Arts major was presented to the faculty
senate. Although the Senate approved the proposal, the program was not funded
or implemented. The program continued to develop though the efforts of faculty
on campus. In 1984 a brochure entitled “Women in Curriculum” was published. The
brochure outlined over forty courses with an emphasis on women at the
University of Montana. In September 1990, a final proposal to create a Women’s
Studies emphasis within the department of Liberal Studies was submitted to the
Board of Regents and accepted. The emphasis was implemented in the fall of
1991. </p>
<p>Fall of 1992 marked the first year of a significantly funded program
with Professors Deborah Slicer and Bari Burke acting as co-directors. Fall of
1993 brought the authorization of a half-time director of Women’s Studies and
Dr. Julia Watson served as director from 1993-1995. Since 1996, various
directors and co-directors have developed and expanded the program. As of 2007,
the Department offers a minor in Women and Gender Studies open to students of
all majors, and a continually evolving course list.</p>

<p>The Lake County Federation of Women's Clubs, organized in 1925, worked
to promote other women's clubs in Lake County, Montana, by joining them
together as one organization, while allowing the individual clubs to grow and
prosper for themselves. The federation established committees to address such
topics as safety, special education, legislation, literature, and Special
Olympics. They played an active role in World War II issues, supporting defense
bonds, the Red Cross, and the movement to save tin, aluminum, and lard for the
war effort. The federation displayed political voice on many subjects ranging
from criminal cases to women's suffrage. The federation made a considerable
effort to unite women's clubs and operate together for the good of the

<p>Dudley C. Bass, born in 1842, and his brother William E. Bass, born
1838, were natives of Vermont, the sons of William B. Bass and Ruth (Childs)
Bass. They moved to Montana's Bitterroot Valley in 1864, where they first
concentrated on mining. They began raising hay, grain, and fruit, which they
sold in the mining camps. In 1871 the brothers started the first orchard, the
Pine Grove Fruit Farm, on their 320-acre plot of land in Stevensville, Montana.
The business prospered, propelling the brothers to expand their land holdings
to 1000 acres and increase the variety of produce they planted. They not only
distributed their produce to the surrounding areas but also shipped it to many
cities along the Atlantic Coast and even some of the lower Canadian states.
They also raised Durham cattle, Norman-Percheron horses, and choice breeds of
sheep. The Bass brothers also endeavored in a sawmill, a grist mill, and ran a
freight line between the Bitterroot and Corrine, Utah. </p>
<p>William E. Bass made his name not only as a prominent entrepreneur but
he also served four terms on the Territorial Council, including one as its
president in 1877. He also served three terms as a member of the Montana
Legislature. </p>
<p>Virginia E. Bass, William's wife, was only the second white woman to
live in Stevensville, arriving in 1864. Virginia's sister, Etta Emmett, joined
her some years later and subsequently married Dudley Bass; they had one son,
Lee Emmett. The Bass family was held in such high esteem in the Bitterroot
Valley that Bass Peak, Bass Creek, Bass Canyon, and Bass Crossing were all
named for them.</p>

<p>John Hopkins’ Professor Arthur O. Lovejoy and John Dewey formed the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in 1915 to protect the "academic freedom” of college professors nationwide. It is not clear when the Montana chapter of the AAUP was established but it likely began on the University of Montana campus in the late 1910s. The first minute book in this collection dates from 1930. The National AAUP’s concern for the wellbeing and academic freedom of professors brought the organization’s attention to UM on a number of occasions, including during the dismissal of President Craighead in 1915 and during the controversy over the discharge of Librarian Philip Keeney in 1937. They also participated in preparing and moving a collective bargaining bill through the Montana legislature in the mid-1970s.</p>

<p>The Heart Mountain Relocation Center, an internment camp for
Japanese-Americans during World War II, was set up under the relocation program
administered by the War Relocation Authority (WRA). The camp was located 12
miles west of Powell and 13 miles east of Cody in Park County, Wyoming. This
location met certain WRA criteria: it was on public land, was large enough to
accommodate the expected population, was far from any strategic areas, and
could provide internees with local work projects.</p>
<p>The Japanese-Americans interned at Heart Mountain had been relocated
from the West Coast, the area affected by President Roosevelt's executive
orders for relocation. The first internees arrived in August 1942. By 1943, the
population had reached almost 10,800, making the camp the third largest city in
Wyoming. Within the camp were schools, a hospital, a library, a volunteer fire
department, stores, and industries. Internees produced the
<title>Heart Mountain Sentinel</title> and other publications. The last
internees left the camp in November 1945.</p>

<p>Clifton R. Merritt was born in November 1919 in the Prickly Pear
Valley (now known as the Helena Valley) of Montana. He grew up on the cattle
ranch his grandfather settled in the 1890s near the Gates of the Wilderness
Mountains along the upper Missouri River. In his youth he was plagued by
illness including polio and a triple heart valve leakage at age 15. Despite
these physical ailments, Merritt was an avid hunter, fisherman, and hiker,
often enjoying these activities with his twin brother, Don. </p>
<p>Clif attended college at Carroll College in Helena, Montana taking
courses in liberal arts and sociology. After leaving Carroll, Merritt moved to
Kalispell, Montana, and worked for the Bureau of Employment Security and
Montana State Employment Service. He rose to Field Supervisor for the Bureau of
Employment Security which involved hiring, training, and supervising of over
150 employees in nine (or more) field offices. Merritt held this position from
1953-1964. </p>
<p>During his time in Kalispell, Merritt helped found the Montana
Wilderness Association in 1957. He also served in various positions for the
Montana Wildlife Federation from 1950 to 1964. With these organizations,
Merritt was a leader in getting the Montana Stream Preservation Act adopted and
halting the establishment of the Spruce Park and Glacier View dams on the
Flathead River, as well as spearheading the movement to get the 15,000 acre
Jewel Basin Hiking Area established. </p>
<p>In 1964, Clifton Merritt became director of field services for The
Wilderness Society. He began his work in Washington, DC, lobbying for the
establishment of the Wilderness Act of 1964. Believing that the wilderness
movement needed to garner the support of local citizens in order to add areas
to the National Wilderness Preservation System, Merritt established The
Wilderness Society’s Western Regional Office in Denver, Colorado, in 1966. In
the Regional Office, Merritt trained and supervised a 15-person professional
staff of natural resource specialists and field representatives stationed
throughout the West. Through the efforts of Merritt and his staff, working
closely with local groups, millions of acres were added to the National
Wilderness Preservation System. Among those added were the Scapegoat,
Absaroka-Beartooth, and River of No Return Wildernesses in Montana and the
Weminuche, Flat Tops, and Eagles Nest Wildernesses in Colorado. After an
organizational shakeup and upon hearing of the planned closing of the Regional
Office, Merritt resigned from the Wilderness Society in 1978. </p>
<p>In 1979, Merritt, Sally Ranney, and Jerry Mallet, seeing a need left
by the closing of The Wilderness Society’s Regional Office, formed The American
Wilderness Alliance (known after 1983 as American Wildlands) based in Denver,
Colorado. The organization worked with conservation groups throughout the Rocky
Mountain West to preserve public lands for wildlife habitat and recreation. The
American Wilderness Alliance was instrumental in getting the 161,000 acre
Elkhorn National Wildlife Management Area established in Montana as well as
ensuring the passage of the Colorado Wilderness Bill which gave wilderness
designation to 1.4 million acres of public lands. In addition to serving as
executive director, Merritt also edited the organization’s
<title>Wild America</title> magazine and wrote and edited its
<title>On the Wild Side</title> newsletter. </p>
<p>In 1984, Clifton Merritt returned to Montana and settled in the
Bitterroot Valley. He still maintained the executive directorship of American
Wildlands and the organization relocated to Bozeman, Montana, later that year.
In 1990, Merritt stepped back from the executive directorship and became
associate executive director. It was in 1990 that Merritt began the Corridors
of Life Program. The Program used Geographic Information Systems to map
wildlife migration corridors between roadless areas and established wilderness
areas. As of 2009, American Wildlands’ Corridors of Life Program continues to
work to restore and maintain wildlife corridors. </p>
<p>In 1998, at age 79, Clifton Merritt stepped down as associate
executive director of American Wildlands. Though no longer in a leadership role
at the organization, Merritt continued to support wilderness and environmental
initiatives as a member of the organization he had helped found. He also
continued to support local wilderness issues through membership with the
organization Friends of the Bitterroot and continued membership with the
Montana Wilderness Association and Montana Wildlife Federation. </p>
<p>Clifton Merritt had been a prolific writer all his life and his
retirement afforded him more time for this interest. He began to pen his
memoirs of the wilderness movement, which he titled
<title>Beyond the Roads</title>. He also began work on a history of his
grandfather’s settlement in the Prickly Pear Valley which he called
<title>I Remember my Grandfather</title>. Merritt died on August 12, 2008
at the age of 89. </p>

<p>Charles A. Martinson was born in Sweden around 1876 and came to
America as a small boy. He operated the Missoula Ice and Cold Storage Company
in Missoula, Montana from 1921 until his death in 1938 at the age of 62. Two
years prior to his death, Charles Martinson was severely injured after becoming
caught in machinery at the ice plant and never fully recovered. His wife Freda
E. Martinson and sons Jack and Karl helped run the company and continued its
operation after Charles’ death. Charles A. Martinson and wife Freda Martinson
also had a daughter, Jean Gies, married to Anthony Gies of Lewistown, Montana.
Freda Martinson was born in 1883 and came to Missoula in 1900, where she
resided most of her life. She was visiting Portland at the time of her death in
1958. Jack Martinson enlisted in the Air Force in 1941 and received his
commission in 1943. He was a second lieutenant and co-pilot of a B-29 when he
was killed during an air raid over Japan in 1945. Anthony Gies also served in
the war as a medical technician and was awarded a Bronze Star and an Oak Leaf
Cluster in 1945.</p>
<p>The Missoula Ice and Cold Storage Company was a retail and wholesale
ice and cold storage company from 1921-1958. They supplied ice for ice boxes
before more modern refrigerators were common in homes. Ice was cut in blocks
from ponds in the Rattlesnake area north of Missoula and stored in sheds with
sawdust during the warmer months. The company grew in technology and in 1940
they were able to quick-freeze 1,000 pounds of bread for future consumption by
the Forest Service firefighters. This was a huge success because Missoula was
experiencing a labor shortage at the time and bakers were unable to meet sudden
demands of hundreds of pounds of bread. It was impossible to store bread for
more than a day or two before it was discovered that bread kept very well
frozen and thawed in good condition. The Missoula Ice Company and the Martinson
family home were located on Front Street. </p>

<p>A.F. Graeter and Company dredged gold in Bannack, Montana, during the
late 1890s through the early 1900s. Bannack, originally part of the Idaho
Territory, began as a small mining community in 1862. In 1864 Bannack
experienced a boom in population after being named the capital of the newly
created Montana Territory. Prospectors flocked to Bannack as the area gained a
national reputation for its gold deposits. As the town grew, mining companies
moved into the area bringing large dredging machinery. These early dredges were
boat-like structures equipped with buckets attached to a pulley system. The
buckets scooped up gravel from the riverbed and deposited it into a sluice box
located on the dredge; the sluice box retained the gold-bearing sediments. This
system was the primary method for mining gold from 1895 to 1905. The A.F.
Graeter and Company began dredging for gold in the Marysville area near Bannack
on April 14, 1897. A fairly large operation, A.F. Graeter and Company, boasted
the third largest dredge in the area. The company was financed under the
Bannack Dredging Company but operated under local direction. The business
operated until 1902, then closed until F.B. Felt, a businessman from Chicago,
purchased the business in early 1906. The company was financially lucrative but
was permanently dismantled in the fall of 1906.</p>

<p>Edward Boos was born in Kentucky on April 1, 1877. His family moved to
Helena, Montana, while he was in grade school. He attended the University of
Montana in Missoula, Montana in 1896 but did not complete a degree. In that
same year Boos began working as a freelance correspondent for several
newspapers in the Missoula area. During the summer of 1897 Boos accompanied the
U.S. Army 25th Infantry Bicycle Corps on its experimental overland trip from
Fort Missoula to St. Louis, Missouri. The company traversed 1,900 miles over
difficult terrain and through taxing weather conditions in an attempt to prove
that bicycles could replace horses for troop transport and reconnaissance. Boos
submitted accounts of the expedition as they traveled. His accounts were
prepared for the
<title>Daily Missoulian</title>, but some were also published by
newspapers along the route and a few were subsequently reprinted by national
and international newspapers.</p>
<p>After the Bicycle Corps expedition Boos continued to produce
photographs for western Montana newspapers. Sometime around 1900 he purchased
his own camera and began photographing people and landscapes in the Missoula
and Flathead valleys. Boos was particularly interested in recording life among
the Kootenai, Salish and Pend'Oreille families of the Flathead Reservation as
the 20th century began. He conducted a series of photographic portrait sessions
at various sites across the reservation, mostly completed between spring and
fall of 1905. According to a 1935 newspaper story, many of these portraits were
developed at night under a canvas cover so the photographer could share the
portraits directly with his subjects. Throughout the time period Boos continued
to photograph landscapes and events in the Missoula and Flathead Lake
areas.</p>
<p>In 1906 Boos accepted an advertising manager position with the
Missoula Mercantile Company (MMS) and married Annie Hammond, cousin of MMC
co-owner Andrew Hammond. Edward Boos ended his newspaper work but continued to
periodically take photographs. Boos remained with the MMC for the next
thirty-one years. In September 1935 an "Indian Jubilee" celebration was held in
St. Ignatius, Montana. This event was the first public exhibition and print
sale of Boos' Flathead Reservation portraits. Edward H. Boos died of a heart
attack on September 26, 1937.</p>

<p>Chester Robert Huntley was born in Cardwell, Montana, on December 10,
1911. His parents, Percy "Pat" and Blanche Huntley, claimed a homestead on 960
acres of land near Saco in northern Montana. Percy Huntley was a former
railroad telegrapher and Blanche was a schoolteacher. The Huntleys built a
one-room schoolhouse on their land so Chet could stay close to home and help
work the farm. The early 1920s was a very difficult period for wheat farmers in
eastern Montana and Percy returned to a telegraphy position with the Great
Northern Railroad. The Huntleys sold their Saco homestead in 1924 and the
family moved frequently around southern Montana until 1926. In that year they
settled in Whitehall, Montana, where Chet graduated from high school in 1929.
Although he began his education at Montana State College in Bozeman with plans
to become a physician, Huntley left that school in 1932 when he won a
scholarship to study oratory at the Cornish School of Arts in Seattle. The
experience altered his career plans, and he graduated from the University of
Washington in 1934 with a degree in speech and drama.</p>
<p>During his senior year in Seattle, Huntley began working at radio
station KPCB where his duties included advertising sales, news writing, and
announcing. This job soon led to reporting positions at other radio stations:
KHO in Spokane, Washington; KGW in Portland, Oregon; and KFI in Los Angeles. In
1939 Huntley joined the staff of KNX, the CBS Radio affiliate in Los Angeles.
At KNX he began writing and producing short news commentary programs. Huntley
continued to pursue news commentary projects under various titles throughout
his broadcasting career. From 1951 to 1955 he worked for ABC Radio and
Television in Los Angeles. Early in 1955, he was hired by the NBC Pacific
Division to work as West Coast commentator and reporter for the
<title>Today</title> show. In June 1955, NBC transferred him to their New
York headquarters with the promise of a major news program.</p>
<p>His first major national assignment came in 1956 when he covered the
Republican and Democratic national conventions with David Brinkley. The pairing
drew the highest ratings among the three national networks for convention
coverage. In October NBC chose the two men to co-anchor the network's
fifteen-minute weekday evening news program. The program had an innovative
format with Huntley reporting from New York and Brinkley from Washington DC. In
1963 the
<title>Huntley-Brinkley Report</title> became one of the first
thirty-minute network news programs. During its fourteen-year tenure the
<title>Huntley-Brinkley Report</title> was one of the most professionally
recognized and highly rated news programs on television, eventually winning
seven Emmy and two Peabody awards. Both Brinkley and Huntley received numerous
individual broadcasting awards. Huntley was also involved with several other
news programs at NBC. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he edited and
narrated a series of Sunday evening news broadcasts. Variously titled
<title>Outlook</title>,
<title>NBC Kaleidoscope</title>, and
<title>Chet Huntley Reporting</title>, the program presented expanded
commentary on various news events and issues. Through most of the 1960s he also
wrote and narrated a five-minute NBC radio program of editorial commentary
titled
<title>Chet Huntley's Perspective on the News</title>, with a weekend
equivalent named
<title>Emphasis: Plain Talk</title>.</p>
<p>Throughout his career Huntley caused controversy by blurring the lines
between news reporting and political commentary. He was a vocal critic of
Senator Joseph McCarthy and entertainment industry anti-communism activists.
His commentary programs spoke out against internment of Japanese-Americans
during World War II, advocated school integration in Little Rock, Arkansas, and
critiqued the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. Huntley defended his commentary
programs by declaring that he never allowed his opinions to influence
newscasts; however, one industry critic accused him of editorializing with his
eyebrows during the
<title>Huntley-Brinkley Report</title>. Huntley precipitated other
controversies. As the owner of a Montana cattle ranch, Huntley recorded
commercials and accepted speaking engagements to promote the beef industry.
These activities generated profuse criticism from other professionals concerned
about maintaining the image of broadcasting objectivity and integrity. He
caused a rift with David Brinkley in 1967 when Huntley crossed an American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists' picket line claiming that news
anchors did not belong in the same union as "actors, singers, and dancers."</p>
<p>During the height of his NBC broadcasting career Huntley wrote a
memoir of his Montana youth. Random House published
<title>The Generous Years: Remembrances of a Frontier Boyhood</title> in
1968. He retired from NBC on July 31, 1970. For the final broadcast of the
<title>Huntley-Brinkley Report</title>, Huntley initiated the team's
signature closing with the words "Good night, David." However, Brinkley altered
form with his response "Good-bye, Chet." Before signing off Huntley addressed a
final statement to the television audience, "Be patient and have courage, there
will be better and happier news some day, if we work at it."</p>
<p>Huntley met his first wife, Ingrid Eleanor Rolin, while living in
Seattle. They were married in 1936, had two daughters, and divorced in 1959.
Huntley met his second wife, Lewis Tipton "Tippy" Stringer, in 1959. Tippy was
a weather announcer for the DC NBC affiliate. They had no children. Huntley
stayed active in retirement, broadcasting commentaries, recording commercials
for American Airlines, and contracting with the airline to sponsor a new PBS
program
<title>The American Experience</title>, a series for which Huntley
frequently narrated.</p>
<p>Big Sky, Montana, was Huntley's biggest post-retirement project, both
in terms of personal investment and financial scale. The project started as a
15,000-acre resort in the Gallatin Valley of south central Montana that
eventually became a permanent community. The primary corporation directing Big
Sky development was Chrysler Realty, a conglomeration co-funded by Chrysler
Motor Corporation, Conoco Oil, Burlington Northern Railroad, Montana Power Co.
and Northwest Airlines. The project included one of the first privately owned
ski resorts in the United States. Huntley died of cancer March 20, 1974, in
Bozeman, Montana, three days before the opening ceremonies for Big Sky.</p>

government sent a series of dispatches to tribes in the North Dakota, Montana,
and Idaho territories in an attempt to create a treaty promoting a peaceful

<p>Mining began in Montana in the 1850s, when traders for the Hudson's
Bay Company discovered gold near present-day Deer Lodge. Little came of these
early diggings but the territory continued to attract hopefuls and the first
big strike took place near Bannack in 1862. In the next two years, gold was
discovered at Virginia City and Last Chance Gulch in the heart of present day
Helena. A dozen years after the first discoveries in Helena, Thomas Cruse filed
for the claim on the Drumlummon. His discovery gave birth to the town of
Marysville and one of the first rich mines in Montana. While the wealth
produced by the Drumlummon pales in comparison with the later copper giants in
Butte, the discovery of rich gold and silver deposits provided a tremendous
boost to the Montana Territory's economy and spurred national and international
investment.</p>
<p>The claim for this vein of gold and silver ore was filed by Thomas
Cruse in 1876. He drove a tunnel into the vein over the next several years but
reportedly went only 500 feet. In 1880, Cruse convinced William and Charles
Mayger to construct a five stamp mill for processing ore from the mine. The ore
was processed for a time and then a disagreement over royalty payments led
Cruse to buy out the Mayger's interest in the mill. Word of the rich ore being
mined at the Drumlummon reached beyond the borders of the Montana Territory.
The Joint Stock Association, a London based company, organized to buy the
Drumlummon Mine from Thomas Cruse in 1882. The following year they purchased
the mine and created the Montana Mining Company, Limited. The company paid
Thomas Cruse $1.63 million for the property and allowed him to retain a
one-sixth ownership in the mine. Cruse used the profits to establish a bank in
Helena and went on to be a successful and wealthy businessman.</p>
<p>The Montana Mining Company installed George Attwood as manager of the
mine. He did a poor job and resigned after his first year when profits did not
meet expectations. He was replaced by R.T. Bayliss, a capable manager, in 1884.
The arrival of competent management coincided with a sharp rise in profits.
Bayliss was replaced for a year by Henry Bratnober before returning to manage
the mine through 1891. During this period almost 500,000 tons of ore were
removed yielding $9.2 million. A feud between the Montana Mining Company and
the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company erupted in 1889. The dispute centered
on ownership of a vein being mined by both companies. The St. Louis Company
filed suit to halt the Montana Mining Company's miners and the resulting apex
litigation lasted until 1911. The suit ultimately reached the Supreme Court of
the United States and cost nearly $400,000 in legal fees. The costs of the
suit, the court decision in favor of the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company,
and declining ore values at the Drumlummon forced the Montana Mining Company to
sell the property at sheriff's sale in 1911. The stockholders of the St. Louis
Mining and Milling Company received an impoverished mine in disrepair for all
their litigation efforts. Management of the property shifted to William Mayger,
the St. Louis Company's superintendent. After fierce corporate infighting, he
was replaced in 1913 by Harry Quinby. The new manager lasted only briefly
before he was ousted by William Mayger. For the next 20 years stockholder
squabbles and failing finances kept the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company on
the brink of collapse. During the final years there were constant shutdowns and
stockholder assessments. The mines and mills finally closed in 1933, ending one
of the richest mineral strikes in Montana history.</p>

<p>The Anaconda claim was located in 1875. In 1881 Marcus Daly discovered
the copper vein that began copper mining in Butte, Montana. The Anaconda Copper
Mining Company was organized on June 18, 1895 in Butte and it dominated the
early industrial history of Montana. In 1903 nearly three-quarters of the wage
earners in the state were either directly or indirectly working for the
company. In 1917 there was a general miners' strike, and much worker/owner
tension stirred up by the war, the I.W.W., and the fear of sabotage. Both world
wars created huge booms in production for the company. In 1945 Anaconda
embarked on a program of expansion, rehabilitation, and improvement. New
methods were introduced to increase the output of mines already in use. In
April 1955 the company's name was changed to The Anaconda Company. Production
of primary copper from company mines in 1959 totaled 980,399,000 pounds. From
1895 to 1960 the Butte mine had produced almost fifteen billion pounds of
copper. The Anaconda Company shut down its operations in Butte in 1983.</p>

Cobban, was born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland. He moved with his family to
Groveland, Massachusetts, where he met his wife, Mary Louise Hardy, whose
parents were descendents of pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower. In the
Kansas border disputes of 1852, William S. Cobban negotiated for the state of
Missouri. He fought for the North in the Civil War until he was injured and
discharged in 1864. After his injury, William S. Cobban returned to his lumber
mill in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>After working at his father’s mill and attending school in Wisconsin,
Roy Cobban headed to the West in 1880 where he homesteaded in western Montana
and helped his brother, William F. Cobban, build a mill in Butte City in 1883.
Roy Cobban was a foreman at the Montana Lumber and Produce Company until 1884,
while his brother remained superintendent of the mill until 1886, when both
sold out of the mill to devote all of their time to mining and real estate
ventures in the area. William F. Cobban was very successful in the mining
business, buying a mine with his business partner for $9,000 in 1890, and
selling it six years later for $6 million. Several districts in Butte carried
the Cobban name, reflecting Williams F. Cobban’s prominence in the city.</p>
<p>By 1886, Roy Cobban left the real estate business, sold the newspaper he
owned in Butte, and focused all of his attention on his mine 15 miles north of
the city. In December 1885, he began a correspondence with Alice Hardy of
Groveland, Massachusetts, and by September 1886 they were engaged through the

representatives from area organizations incuding the Rotary, the Missoula Chamber of
Commerce, the Missoula Public Library, the Lions Club, the University of Montana,
the Sons and Daughters of Montana Pioneers, and the Hellgate Project. The members
tasked the organization with the preservation of local landmarks and possibly
establishing a regional archive at the public library. The society's stated purpose
was "to aid in the discovery, collection and preservation of every variety of
material illustrative of the history of Montana; such as letters, diaries, journals,
memoranda, pioneer reminiscences, newspapers, account books, school and church
registers, commemorative addresses, genealogies and biographies, photographs,
pictures and paintings, aboriginal relics, material objects illustrating the life of
pioneers, maps, histories and records of the counties of western Montana and of its
cities, towns, villages and institutions." At the May 13, 1954 meeting, the chairman
appointed a committee to draft a constitution and by-laws for the society. The
organization adopted a 12 member board of directors, a one dollar fee for annual
membership, and an annual meeting to be held the second Monday of October. By 1955,

<p>Frederick William Voget, cultural anthropologist and American Indian
ethnologist, was born in Salem, Oregon, on February 12, 1913. He was one of six
children of Friedrich A. Voget, who emigrated from Germany to Oregon when he
was 19, and Fay Isham, whose grandparents were Oregon pioneers. Voget was
educated in Portland public schools, attended Reed College, and graduated from
the University of Oregon. He attended graduate school at Yale University and
received a Ph.D. in Anthropology in 1947. Fred served in the 71st Division of
the U.S. Infantry from 1942 to 1947 and was honorably discharged as a Master
Sergeant. He married Mary Kay Mee in 1942 and they had three daughters,
Antoinette, Colleen, and Jane. Mrs. Voget worked as Dr. Voget's research
assistant throughout their many years together.</p>
<p>Dr. Voget's fieldwork and doctoral dissertation subjects were the Crow
Indians of Montana. His dissertation,
<title>The Shoshoni-Crow Sun Dance</title>, was published in 1984 in the
Civilization of the American Indians Series, University of Oklahoma Press, and
is the first full-length authoritative treatment of the Crow Sun Dance. Holt
Rinehart published
<title>A History of Ethnology</title>, an earlier book, in 1975. Recent
contributions to new books include the introduction to
<title>Old Man Coyote</title> and the foreword to
<title>Yellowtail, Crow Indian Medicine Man</title>. His most recent
book,
<title>They Call Me Agnes</title>, was a finalist for the Western Writers
of America Spur Award for the best non-fiction book of 1995.
<title>They Call Me Agnes</title>, the life story of Agnes Yellowtail
Deernose, a Crow Indian woman, was written with the assistance of his wife,
Mary Kay Mee.</p>
<p>Dr. Voget was the author of many articles, notable among them "The
Osage Indians, Osage Research Report" (New York, London, 1974) and "Crow Sacred
Numerology" published in the
<title>Plains Anthropologist</title> in 1996. His articles are also
published in the 1996 Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology sponsored by Yale
University.</p>
<p>Fred Voget taught at McGill University in Montreal, the University of
Arkansas, the University of Toronto, and Southern Illinois University. He was a
visiting professor at Northwestern University and Portland State University. In
1966 he won a Canada Council Research Grant to work with the Six Nations tribes
of Eastern Canada. He was a Fulbright Scholar to Germany in 1972 and returned
there in 1979 as a visiting professor at the University of Munich. After his
retirement as Professor Emeritus from Southern Illinois University, Fred
returned to Portland where he continued to write and lecture. He was an adjunct
professor at Portland State University and was a guest lecturer at the
University of Oregon and Linfield College.</p>
<p>Since 1939 Dr. Voget devoted his life and his research to recording
and preserving the culture and way of life of the Crow as it was and is. His
contribution to the study of ethnology was intended to improve the lives of
American Indians and to promote understanding and respect for the diversity of
cultures in the world. He was an adopted member of the Crow Tribe and spent
part of every summer with them in Montana. Fred W. Voget died on 8, 1997</p>

<p>Originally discovered by prospectors in search of placer gold, the
rich sapphire-bearing ledge of Montana was located and claimed by three
Montanans in 1896. The New Mine Sapphire Syndicate, based solely on the Yogo
Sapphire District near Utica, Montana, in Judith Basin County, was incorporated
in 1898. S.S. Hobson served as vice president, and Mathew Dunn and George A.
Wells, both Great Falls residents, served respectively as president and
secretary-treasurer. Soon after the turn of the century, the corporation came
under the control of British investors and was to remain so until 1949. The
Yogo mines operated profitably until 1927, when a flash flood destroyed the
surface workings of the Syndicate's operation. After that, little was done to
exploit the remaining sapphires. In 1956, Thomas Sidwell succeeded in
purchasing the controlling interest in the Syndicate. Lack of capital hampered
his operations until 1956-1957, when the Syndicate's stock was re-issued and
some work resumed at the mine. Law suits, prior claims, poor management, and
bad luck combined to ruin the renewed operations of the corporation, and the
venture was bankrupt by 1961.</p>

<p>Charles E. and Alicia D. Conrad had three children, Charles Davenport
“Charlie” (born in Ft. Benton, Montana, in 1882), Catherine “Kate” Conrad (born
in Fort Benton in 1885), and Alicia Conrad (born in Kalispell in 1892). </p>
<p>Alicia Conrad first married Walter McCutcheon, an employee of the
Conrad family-owned Kalispell Mercantile Company, in 1914. They had one
daughter, Alicia Ann “Timmie,” in 1921. The marriage ended in divorce in 1924.
Alicia’s second marriage, in February 1928, was to George Henry Campbell of
Great Falls, Montana.The couple remained together until his death forty-five
years later.</p>
<p> George Henry Campbell was born in 1890 to Mary L. Wardwell and
Charles Henry Campbell of Westminster West, Vermont. Growing up on their ranch
near Malta and moving into Great Falls for high school, George graduated from
Yale’s Sheffield School of Engineering in 1910 and joined with his father as C.

<p>A new branch line of the Great Northern Railroad provided the impetus
for founding Rexford, Montana in 1903. The Rexford Townsite Company dealt with
the initial steps from legalities to laying out the streets and land sales.
Five men owned two-thirds of the stock in this company. Leon N. Brown, the
company secretary, became co-proprietor of Brown &amp; Fewkes (general
merchandise) in Rexford, Montana. Charles B. Kemp, a company director, owned
substantial property in nearby Libby, Montana. Allen B. Johnston, a company
director, moved to Libby, Montana, in 1892 and was active in merchandising,
real estate, politics, and mining. Walter H. Griffin, a company director, owned
an established and respected insurance and real estate company in Kalispell,
Montana. George Francis Stannard, a company director and a partner of Griffin's
since 1892, was born on the Island of Guernsey in the English Channel in 1860.
Stannard, a notably successful Montana resident, dealt in insurance real
estate, and mining as well as acquiring substantial property in the Flathead
Valley.</p>
<p>Early citizens of Rexford, Montana, could travel by railroad or water
as the town was near Kootenay Lake but Rexford was not connected to Libby,
Montana, by a road until 1924. While the road must have brought changes to
Rexford, the greatest change came in the late 1960s when the Corps of Engineers
relocated the entire town above the old townsite which was covered with water
by the reservoir created with the building of Libby Dam.</p>

<p>David Bentzin earned his Master of Science degree in Geology from the
University of Montana in 1960. Upon graduation, Bentzin moved to Casper,
Wyoming, where he worked as a geologist for petroleum companies. In 1975, the
Blackfeet Tribe of Montana brought suit against the United States alleging that
the government was deficient in its management of the tribe’s oil and gas
resources. The tribe believed that the United States government had permitted
the allotment of the Blackfeet Reservation to individual Native Americans
without reservation of the mineral estate to the Blackfeet tribe. The tribe
also alleged that the federal government had discouraged development of
Blackfeet oil and gas revenues and that the government had drained oil and gas
from tribal lands to non-tribal lands. David Bentzin was presented as an expert
witness for the Blackfeet Tribe in his capacity as a petroleum geologist.
Bentzin developed a case for the Blackfeet based on the uneven oil and gas
development of the Blackfeet portion of the Cutbank Oil field by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs relative to the development authorized by the Bureau of Land
Management on adjacent, non-tribal parcels. The Blackfeet Tribe was eventually
awarded $5 million in damages by the United States Government. </p>

<p>The First National Bank was organized in 1873 in Missoula, Montana,
under the name Missoula National Bank. The bank was not only one of the first
businesses in Missoula, but one of the first banks in Montana Territory. Bank
officers included Christopher Higgins, Francis L. Worden, and J.
P.Reinhard.</p>
<p>Within a few months of its creation, the bank survived the Panic of
1873, which forced 172 banks across the United States to liquidate. During the
last decades of the nineteenth century the Missoula bank played an important
role in the gold trade in western Montana. It acted as the middleman in
transferring the gold from the prospectors to the large financial institutions
of the east coast. All of these gold transactions enabled the Missoula bank to
obtain more currency, which was important to the growth of the Missoula and
western Montana economy. </p>
<p>In 1889, the bank became the First National Bank of Missoula. By 1976,
it changed its name to First National Montana Bank of Missoula. By 1986, it was
First Interstate Bank.</p>
<p>The Missoula Trust and Savings Bank was incorporated in 1903. Officers
were Frederick D. Whisler, President; Dr. Oel. S. Misick, Vice President; and
John W. Hicklin, Cashier. Its charter expired in 1953.</p>

<p>The Montana Interscholastic Editorial Association (MIEA), one of the oldest state high school
press associations in the United States, was founded on May 14, 1915 during the
University of Montana’s 12th Annual Interscholastic Meet. The School of Journalism’s
Dean, Arthur L. Stone, and the Montana Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, a journalism
honor society, invited high school newspaper editors to attend the meet for the
purpose of forming a state-wide press organization. The organization was active
during the 1915 and 1916 school years, but suspended its activities during World War
I. In 1923, high school journalism students, instructors, and the School of
Journalism formally founded the MIEA. By 1957 the school had begun hosting High
School Day, an annual conference for MIEA members with press-related workshops and
awards for outstanding Montana high school journalists. The MIEA was later renamed
the Montana Journalism Education Association (MJEA). As of 2015, more than 100 MJEA

<p>Clarice Mildred Stromert Cushman was born March 13, 1906 in Stratford,
Iowa, to Ida and Bernard Stromert. She graduated from high school in Wilmar,
Minnesota, in 1923 and from the State Teachers College in St. Cloud, Minnesota,
in 1925. Clarice Stomert married William Cushman on January 12, 1935. For most
of their married life Clarice Cushman lived in Missoula, Montana. She was a
charter member of the Faith Evangelical Free Church.</p>
<p>William Howard Cushman was born January 24, 1909 in Woodstock, Ohio,
to Mary Ellen and Arthur Cushman. He attended the University of Ohio, majoring
in forestry, and later attended Montana State University in Missoula, Montana
in 1939 and 1940. After he moved to Missoula, he worked for the U.S. Forest
Service. During World War II, he served with the U.S. Navy. After the war, he
worked in Liberia, Africa, for the LeTourneau Corporation for about four years.
He then rejoined his family in Missoula where he did a variety of outdoors
work. He was a member of the Faith Evangelical Free Church.</p>
<p>The Cushmans had one child, Roger, born December 10, 1938, in

<p>In December 1887, a dinner was held by Theodore Roosevelt at his home
in New York City and was attended by 10 of his friends, all hunting
enthusiasts. Among the attendees were Dr. George Bird Grinnell, then editor of
<title>Field and Stream</title> magazine, Roosevelt’s cousin, and
Roosevelt’s brother. At the dinner Theodore Roosevelt proposed that the guests
form an organization to promote sport with the rifle and work for the
preservation of the large game of North America. </p>
<p>The first formal meeting of the Boone and Crockett Club was held in
February 1888. Those present elected Theodore Roosevelt as President of the
Club. The administrative duties of the Club would fall to an Executive
Committee and Executive Officers. An editorial committee, with George Bird
Grinnell as chair, was formed to prepare publications that promoted the Club’s
conservation message.
<title>American Big-Game Hunting</title>, by George Bird Grinnell and
Theodore Roosevelt, was the first volume published by the Club and was released
in October of 1893 by Forest and Stream Publishing Company. This volume was
followed by several more game-related publications in collaboration with Forest
and Stream Publishing Company. </p>
<p>A Committee on Admissions was formed at the Club’s first meeting.
Membership was to be kept to 100 in order to keep administrative work to a
minimum so that officers could be free to use their time for the goals of the
Club. It was decided that regular membership requirements included killing “in
fair chase” one specimen of three species of the larger game mammals of North
America. Associate memberships were conferred upon men who did not meet these
requirements but were prominent members of the hunting and conservation
community. Another committee was appointed “to promote useful and proper
legislation toward the enlargement and better management of Yellowstone
National Park.” This committee, along with additional Club members, was
instrumental in the passage of the Yellowstone Park Protective Act of 1895.
</p>
<p>In 1910, a Game Preservation Committee was appointed with George Bird
Grinnell as chair. This committee lent its support to the passage of
conservation laws and policies such as the Alaska Game Law, the establishment
of Glacier and Mt. McKinley National Parks, a bill to enlarge Yellowstone
National Park, and many forest reserve and game refuge bills. The Club was able
to lend effective support to conservation efforts due to its number of notable
members, including Aldo Leopold, Gifford Pinchot, Theodore Roosevelt, Grinnell,
Charles Sheldon, John F. Lacey, Stephen Mather, Jay N. “Ding” Darling, and many
other prominent conservationists. </p>
<p>Between the years 1906 and 1922, Club member William T. Hornaday began
collecting and cataloging exceptional big game heads. This collection became
the National Collection of Heads and Horns and was displayed at the Bronx Zoo
in New York City beginning in 1922. The Club assumed ownership of the National
Collection of Heads and Horns in 1978 and the collection is currently available
for viewing at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming. </p>
<p>The National Collection of Heads and Horns and the early conservation
efforts of the Club sparked an interest in some members for big game records
keeping. In the early 1930s, the Boone and Crockett Club began to assemble data
on the maximum size attained by various species of North American big game.
Prentiss N. Gray published the Club’s first big game records book titled
<title>Records of North American Big Game</title> in conjunction with the
National Collection of Heads and Horns in 1932. A second edition followed in
1939. These editions marked the first time that North American big game records
were collected, authenticated, and published. </p>
<p>In 1947, the Club formed a Conservation Committee under the
chairmanship of Richard Borden of the National Wildlife Federation. The
Conservation Committee endorsed bills and produced policy statements for
conservation, and was instrumental in saving the Florida Key Deer from
extinction and establishing a Key Deer refuge in 1957. The Club also began
supporting big game research through small monetary grants in 1948. Through
oversight of the Conservation Committee, the Club contributed to numerous
wildlife research projects including predator-prey relationships in Alaska,
moose-wolf relationships on Isle Royale National Park, research on grizzly
bears in Yellowstone National Park, and many others. In 1972, the Conservation
Committee established an official Grant-in-Aid Subcommittee to oversee grant
proposals. The Grant-in-Aid program continues today as the William I. Spencer
Conservation Grants Program. The program is supported by endowments named for
William I. Spencer and Tim Hixon.</p>
<p> In 1947, the Club held their first annual Big Game Competition.
Supervision of the Competition was the responsibility of the Boone and Crockett
Club’s Records of North American Big Game Committee, which was established in
1935. Winners were chosen by a judges’ panel based on skull length, antler or
horn length, and basal circumference. The popularity of the competition and the
records books led the Club to consider establishing an objective scoring system
that could be used by trophy holders to measure their own specimens. In 1949,
the Club appointed a committee, chaired by longtime Club member Samuel B. Webb,
to develop the Official Scoring System for North American Big Game Trophies. In
1950, the system was adopted by the Club and soon became the standard for
measuring North American big game. With the new scoring system in place, the
Boone and Crockett Club remeasured the trophies in every category originally
published in North American Big Game and published the results in a new edition
records book in 1952. The system proved to be so effective it is still in use
today in essentially the same form. </p>
<p>Editions of
<title>Records of North American Big Game</title> were published every
six to seven years after 1952 and 1993, when it was determined that records
books would be published every six years. In addition to the original records
books, the Club has published volumes on record elk, mule deer and whitetail
deer. With collaborative oversight by Club-appointed committees and
professional staff, the Boone and Crockett Club continues to publish books
about hunting and conservation. </p>
<p>After the success of the initial Big Game Competition, the Boone and
Crockett Club continued to hold annual Competitions until 1952, when
competitions moved to every 2 years. In 1968, the Club moved the competitions
to every three years. After the 14th North American Big Game Competition, held
in 1971, the Club chose to change the name of their records program contests to
the North American Big Game Awards to deemphasize the competition aspect of
trophy hunting. </p>
<p>In 1973, the Boone and Crockett Club began collaborating with the
National Rifle Association to sponsor records keeping. The tri-annual North
American Big Game Awards Program was run from the Hunting Activities Department
of the National Rifle Association by wildlife biologist William H. Nesbitt. The
Hunting Activities Department was also responsible for processing entries into
the Awards Programs and general records keeping. The Records of North American
Big Game Committee of the Boone and Crockett Club retained responsibility for
the polices of records keeping, including fair chase requirements, boundary
identification, minimum scores, and species to include in the Awards Programs.
</p>
<p>In December 1980, the collaboration with the National Rifle
Association was dissolved and the Club assumed sole responsibility for the
North American Big Game Awards Programs. In January 1981, the Club appointed
William H. Nesbitt as Administrative Director for the Boone and Crockett Club’s
Big Game Records program to work collaboratively with the Records of North
American Big Game Committee. Currently, the administrative duties of Big Game
Records are still shared by professional staff and the Records of North
American Big Game Committee. </p>
<p>In 1985, with the help of a loan from The Nature Conservancy, the
Boone and Crockett Club purchased the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch,
located 10 miles southwest of Dupuyer, Montana on the Rocky Mountain Front,
adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness and Blackleaf Wildlife Management Area.
The Boone and Crockett Foundation was formed and charged with managing and
directing the Ranch, which the Club uses to conduct habitat research,
conservation education programs, and land management demonstrations. In 2001,
the Club completed construction of the Elmer E. Rasmuson Wildlife Conservation
Center at the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. The Center serves as a
headquarters for the Club’s Lee and Penny Anderson Conservation Education
Program, which offers education programs for people of all ages. </p>
<p>In 1986, the Boone and Crockett Club began publication of an
Associates Newsletter which contained hunting and conservation articles and was
distributed to Associate Members. This newsletter gave rise to the Club
magazine
<title>Fair Chase</title> in 1994.
<title>Fair Chase</title> continues to be published quarterly and
distributed to Associate Members of the Club. </p>
<p>In May of 1987, the Club entered into collaboration with The
University of Montana to establish and direct research programs on the Theodore
Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. Additionally, a Boone and Crockett Wildlife
professorship was established at the university. In late 1990, the Club formed
a hiring committee for the professorship and in 1992 Hal Salwasser was hired as
the first Boone and Crockett Professor of Wildlife Conservation. In addition to
the collaboration with The University of Montana, the Club currently has
affiliated programs at Texas A&amp;M, Oregon State University, and Michigan
State University. In 2009, all physical assets, including the Theodore
Roosevelt Memorial Ranch, were transferred from the Boone and Crockett
Foundation to the Boone and Crockett Club. Although the Foundation no longer
plays a role in the day-to-day management of the Ranch, the Foundation
continues to raise funds to support and endow conservation education programs.
</p>
<p>In 1992, the Boone and Crockett Club purchased the historic Old
Milwaukee Railroad Depot on the Clark Fork River in Missoula, Montana, and
relocated its headquarters there from Dumfries, Virginia. The Club continues to
support its original mission of conservation and game preservation. </p>

<p>The post-World War II demand for telephones far exceeded the Bell
System's capabilities, particularly in rural areas. Lake County, Montana,
residents were not alone in the 1940s when, sparked by growing awareness of the
importance of telephones in everything from business to family safety, they
formed the Lake County Telephone Reorganization Committee to research and
create a cooperative telephone company. S.R. Logan, secretary of the group,
wrote letters to neighbors requesting their support, to government agencies
requesting information on cooperative telephone companies and equipment
availability, and to Montana officials seeking their advice, backing, or
permission on various parts of the telephone project. Logan solicited the
support of agricultural organizations as the committee hoped to use existing
water and power installations to facilitate the installing of telephone lines.
Logan also worked to include women's organizations in the telephone campaign.
The information in this collection suggests that the committee amassed
substantial support, but no document or letter relates the final outcome. Other
sources indicate that many of the first attempts to establish telephone
cooperatives failed but later efforts succeeded in the 1950s.</p>

Apin, Ontario, Canada in 1841. He was the fourth born of seven sons and four
daughters. John Rankin was reared on his father's frontier farm, with little in
the way of formal education.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1870, John Rankin moved to Missoula, Montana, and was
on his way to being a successful Montana landowner, lumberman, and politician
when he married Olive Pickering in 1879. Together, they had six children. After
his initial success in the mill business, he became involved in contracting and
was instrumental in the construction of Missoula's first stone building, as
well as the town's first bridges. In 1891 the Rankin block was erected on East
Front Street in Missoula. Following a short illness, John Rankin died in May 3,
1904 of tick fever.</p>
<p>Jeannette Rankin, the eldest daughter of John and Olive Rankin, was
born in 1880 and achieved international recognition for her work as a pacifist,
particularly in her efforts to keep the United States out of World War II.
Jeannette Rankin was prominent suffragette and the first woman to serve in the
United States Congress. She died in 1973.</p>
<p>Wellington Rankin, John and Olive Rankin's only son, was born in
September, 1884. A front page obituary in the
<title>Missoulian</title> touted Wellington Rankin as a millionaire and
listed his accomplishments as a lawyer, politician, and rancher. He died in
June, 1966.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad, its subsidiary Northwest Improvement
Company, and various private parties owned many of the concessions and other
businesses that provided visitor services in the earliest years of Yellowstone
National Park. The Yellowstone Park Company was incorporated under Minnesota
law in the 1880s, in association with the Northern Pacific Railroad. Though the
organization of this concession has resulted in a number of associated company
names (such as Yellowstone Park Transportation Company, Yellowstone Park
Camping company, Yellowstone Park Hotel Company, Yellowstone Park Lodge and
Camps Company) they fall under the umbrella of the Yellowstone Park Company.
</p>
<p>In 1892, Harry W. Child, with partners Silas S. Huntley, L.H.
Hershfield, Aaron Hershfield, and others, established the Yellowstone National
Park Transportation Company to provide stagecoach travel in the Park. In 1901
Child, Huntley, and E.W. Back purchased the stock of the Yellowstone Park
Association to consolidate their control of the concessions. Later that year,
Huntley died, leaving Child to control both companies. Child also operated
Child &amp; Anceny with C. L. Anceny; that business dealt in real estate and
cattle ranching. In 1909 Child, his wife Adelaide D. Child, and their son
Huntley Child reorganized the Yellowstone National Park Transportation Company
into its constituent parts, the Yellowstone Park Transportation Company and the
Yellowstone Park Hotel Company.</p>
<p>Child died in 1931, and his son-in-law William M. Nichols took over
the operation of the concessions. In 1936 Nichols merged the park's
transportation, hotel, camping, and boating operations into the new Yellowstone
Park Company. World War II brought a decline in the concessions as government
services to all parks were curtailed and gas rationing curtailed tourist
travel. Close to bankruptcy during the 1940s, Nichols was financially
unprepared for the tourist boom of the early 1950s. To meet the need for
improved and expanded facilities, the government initiated "Mission 66," a
joint government and private financial of new facilities, the most ambitious of
which was the new Canyon Village, completed in 1957.</p>
<p>Yellowstone Park Company continued to operate in Yellowstone National
Park until the United States Government purchased all associated property of
the company and their lease to operate was terminated in 1980.</p>

<p>Fred Morin, founder and president of the company, was born in Benson,
Minnesota, on February 13, 1880. He worked for a time at a lumberyard in
Halleck, Minnesota, before becoming manager of the Robertson Lumber Company
yard in Crookston, Minnesota. He arrived in Missoula, Montana, in 1910 and
joined with Ed Ribardy in forming the Ribardy Lumber Company. In 1911 Morin
became sole owner and changed the name to the Morin Lumber Company in 1916. The
company operated a sawmill in upper Miller Creek, southeast of Missoula, from
the late 1920s through 1936. In 1947 the Morin Lumber Company began operating a
sawmill at Tupper Lake, near Seeley Lake, Montana, and continued production at
the site until 1956. Fred Morin sold the planing mill and lumberyard in 1961.
He died June 6, 1962.</p>

<p>Washington J. McCormick, a founder of Missoula, Montana, was born in
1835 in the town of Muncie, Indiana. He attended Asbury (Depauw) University,
where he received a law degree in 1856. McCormick decided to move to Utah a
year later. He quickly became involved in local politics, and established a
small law practice. McCormick moved to the capital of the Montana Territory,
Virginia City, in 1863. After serving in the First Territorial Legislature and
as the secretary of the 1866 Constitutional Convention, he moved to the
Missoula area to settle down and practice law.</p>
<p>McCormick became associated with Judge Worden and "Captain"
Christopher Higgins, both of whom are noted for planning and building the city
of Missoula. Higgins and McCormick eventually became successful law partners.
McCormick married Higgins' sister, Kate, in 1869. Together they had seven
children, the most notable being W.J. McCormick, Jr., a prominent Missoula
attorney born in 1884.</p>
<p>McCormick is remembered for his active life as a strong advocate for
the growth and development of the Missoula area. Besides the time he spent in
the legislature, McCormick briefly served as the superintendent of the Flathead
Reservation north of Missoula. His influence was also instrumental in the
decision to route the Northern Pacific Railroad through Missoula, which helped
to provide an avenue for future growth and prosperity for the city. McCormick
died in February 1889 due to injuries sustained in a windstorm at Fort
Owen.</p>

<p>Albert Mooney founded the Butte Tombstone Company in 1902 under the
parent company of Cory Operations. He operated the business until his death in
1965. During the early 1900s until after World War II, Cory Operations
controlled all aspects of tombstone manufacturing, from extraction of the
granite to sale of the finished product. After the war, it became more
cost-effective to buy the granite from extraction companies. Since marble
cracked in the wet and cold weather of Montana, he made tombstones out of more
durable granite. After Mooney's death, the Choquette family bought the company
and operated it until 1983, when they sold it to Glenn Johnson. Johnson bought
the company in name only, operating it under his family's company, Trevillion
Johnson Memorials, which was started by Johnson's great-grandfather, Edwin
Walker, in 1889. The Butte Tombstone Company went out of business in 1990.</p>

<p>In 1962 the Montana Phosphate Products Company, based in Garrison,
Montana, began a significant phosphate mining and milling project in the
Maxville Mining District of Granite County, Montana. In addition to the
potential profit for the company, it was hoped that the exploitation of area
phosphate deposits would boost the region’s economy. The Douglas Mine and
Concentrator located nine miles south of Drummond, Montana on Douglas Creek
were a major part of this development. Montana Phosphate Products Company began
underground mining at this location in 1962. By 1964 the mine employed
approximately 110 workers and was steadily producing phosphate rock. </p>
<p>The advent of phosphate mining in Granite County during the early
1960s perked the interest of other significant firms, particularly Cominco
American, Inc., the American branch of a large Canadian mining and smelting
corporation. Cominco had been mining in adjacent Powell County, Montana for
years, sometimes in partnership with Montana Phosphate Products Company, and
saw the expanding Douglas Operation as a natural addition to its holdings. In
1965, Cominco American, Inc. gained control of the Douglas Mine and continued
to expand operations at that location. The Douglas Concentrator began milling
phosphate rock in 1965, and Cominco started one of Montana’s few open pit
phosphate mines on their Douglas Creek site in 1967. During these years of
steady expansion, production peaked and the operation employed nearly 160 men
and women. </p>
<p>Despite promising production and heavy investment by both Montana
Phosphate Products Company and Cominco American, Inc., the operation was closed
down in 1968. In 1972, Cominco American, Inc. hired the Bechtel Corporation to
dismantle the Douglas Concentrator and send all salvageable equipment to
Greenland for use in a mine operated by Greenex, a subsidiary of Cominco.
Sections of the mine and tailings at the Douglas site have since been reclaimed
by the Montana Waste Cleanup Bureau, while other portions remain on the Montana
DEQ shortlist, and may require further reclamation. </p>

Brisbane, Australia. On August 7, 1942 the B26 bomber, the Martin Marauder,
that Haugland was traveling in ran out of fuel, forcing him and the crew to
bail out over New Guinea. Haugland was lost in the New Guinea jungle for 47
days. He wrote a book,
<title>Letter From New Guinea</title>, about his experiences in 1943. In
recognition for his heroism, General MacArthur pinned a Silver Star on Haugland
on October 1, while he was still delirious from starvation and exhaustion.
Haugland was the first civilian to receive the Silver Star. After recovering,
he continued to cover the war in the Pacific. He returned to the United States
in mid-1944 for a short stay, during which he married his long-time sweetheart,
Tesson McMahon. He and Tess had two daughters, Taya and Marcia. Towards the end

<p>The 1935 Montana legislature passed the State Electrification
Authority Act, which tied Montana into contact with the state water development
projects. In the same year, President Roosevelt formed the Rural Electric
Administration in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Missoula Electric
Cooperative, Inc., (MEC) was formed in Missoula, Montana, in 1936. It was one
of several electric co-operatives formed because the Montana Power Company, the
state's major provider, would not provide power in many rural areas because
construction costs outweighed potential profits. Members of the co-op paid a
fee, installation and consumption costs; the organization is non-profit.
Electric cooperatives played an important role in rural electrification in
Montana and many other states. Eugene Pike came to work for the co-op in 1937.
Soon after it was formed, the MEC received a loan from the Rural
Electrification Administration to build power lines from Missoula to
Frenchtown, down the Bitterroot Valley, and out to Clinton, a project known as
the "A" project. When World War II began, power line construction slowed
considerably, and the company stopped construction in 1943. Pike returned from
his shipyard job to become co-op manager in 1946.</p>
<p>There was no power supplier for Seeley Lake, Montana, at this time,
and the co-op wished to begin line construction. They were unable to get a loan
for this from the REA because the co-op purchased its power from Montana Power,
and the rates they were being charged were too high. However, the REA agreed to
lend the co-op the money for line construction if they bought their power from
another supplier at a lower rate. Bonneville Power wished to do business in
Montana, but the Montana Power Company did not welcome this competition.
Senator James Murray helped pass legislation to allow Bonneville Power to come
into Montana so that the co-op would be able to build its line to Seely Lake.
The co-op remained hooked up to Montana Power lines, but would pay Bonneville
Power for the electricity; Bonneville in turn paid Montana Power. The co-op
also explored other power sources, including the fledgling nuclear power
industry.</p>
<p>The co-op constantly clashed with the Montana Power Company over
questions of competition in the state. In the late 1960s, the MEC clashed with
Montana Power Company over territorial integrity, the question of whether the
for-profit companies could begin to serve customers in territories formerly
served only by the co-ops. The state legislature finally resolved some of these
conflicts in 1970.</p>

<p>Andrew Hammond had arrived in Montana in 1867, settled in Hell Gate in
1870, then moved to Missoula in late 1871. He became a clerk in the store for
Richard Eddy, and then a partner in the store in 1876. The business was renamed
Eddy, Hammond, and Co. In 1877, the store constructed its building at the
intersection of Front Street and Higgins Avenue, on the Mullan military road,
in Missoula. In 1881, the firm was awarded the contract to clear the right of
way and provide the lumber for the construction of the Northern Pacific
Railway. When the Northern Pacific was completed at Gold Creek, Montana, in
1883, business expanded considerably. The Montana Improvement Company, formed
in 1882, took over this portion of the Eddy, Hammond, and Company business.
After the reorganization of Eddy, Hammond and Company as the Missoula
Mercantile in 1885, Charles H. McLeod became the vice president and general
manager. </p>
<p>The Missoula Mercantile and its branches and affiliates became one of
the largest business concerns of the Pacific Northwest. By 1945 Charles H.

<p>Max Sieben Baucus (born Enke) was born on December 11, 1941 at St. Peter's Hospital in Helena, Montana,
to Stephen Enke and Jean Sheriff. His sister, Karen, was born two years later in Stanford, California. The Enkes separated and
Jean moved with Max and Karen back to Montana. Jean married John J. Baucus Jr., a former Air Force officer, in March of 1947. Max Baucus spent the
remainder of his childhood in Helena, while spending summers and weekends at the
Sieben family ranch. Baucus’ first foray into public service took the shape of his
participation in the American Legion Montana Boys State in 1958, where he was
elected Most Outstanding Citizen. This appointment led to his nomination as one of
two Montana representatives to the American Legion Boys Nation in Washington, D.C.
in 1959, where he met Senators James Murray and Mike Mansfield, and Representatives
Lee Metcalf and LeRoy H. Anderson. After graduating from high school in 1959, Baucus
attended Carleton College in Minnesota for one year. He then transferred to Stanford
University, where he graduated in 1964 with a B.A. in Economics. During his time at
Stanford, Baucus spent a year traveling internationally, a trip which was to
significantly shape his world view and spark a desire for a career in public
service. He subsequently received an L.L.B. from Stanford University Law School in
1967.</p>

<p>Baucus moved to Washington, D.C. after law school, where he spent three years working
as a lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was there that he first
met with Senator Mike Mansfield to discuss the idea of running for office. He moved
to Missoula, Montana in 1971 to practice law. He was a staff member for the Montana Constitutional Convention, first as the Executive Assistant to
Leo Graybill, Jr., President of the Constitutional Convention, and then as the
Executive Director. Baucus was elected to the Montana
House of Representatives in 1972, representing Missoula. He conducted his first Congressional campaign in 1975,
beating incumbent Dick Shoup to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Baucus served two terms in the House, from 1975-1978, and was elected to the U.S.
Senate in 1978.</p>

<p>As the longest-serving U.S. Senator from Montana, Baucus served in the Senate from
1978 to 2014, winning six consecutive elections. During that time, he served nearly
10 years as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, as well as two years as
Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He also served on the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Small Business, and the Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. Significant legislative accomplishments include
amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in 1976; tax reform efforts in the
1980s and 2000s; the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; the Transportation Equity Act
for the 21st Century (TEA-21) of 1998; the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act of
2013; securing federal recognition and support for the asbestos crisis in Libby,
Montana; and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. Baucus
was a strong advocate for rural communities throughout his tenure in both the House
and Senate, introducing and supporting legislation surrounding rural health care,
postal service, and air service. He also worked extensively on trade issues, and was
deeply involved in negotiations regarding softwood lumber imports from Canada, beef
imports from Japan, and the assignation of China’s Most Favored Nation status.
Locally, Baucus founded and facilitated the triennial Montana Economic Development
Summit from 2000 to 2013, a jobs summit which brought together Montana residents and
renowned business leaders from around the globe.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama nominated Baucus to the post of United States Ambassador to
the People’s Republic of China on January 7, 2014. Baucus’ nomination was
subsequently confirmed by the Senate on February 6, 2014, and he assumed his
ambassadorial duties on March 20, 2014. He served as Ambassador until January 20,
2017. Baucus currently resides in Montana.</p>

<p>The activist group Missoula Women for Peace (MWP) was formed in 1970
by a group of Missoula, Montana mothers and other community members concerned
with the escalating American military presence in Vietnam. During the Vietnam
War the group was extremely active, participating in peace marches, working to
end the draft, and writing letters to local, state and national officials to
protest the conflict in Vietnam. In the years following the Vietnam War, MWP
members continued to educate themselves and the public on a broad array of
peace related issues by hosting and attending lectures, reading books,
distributing literature and holding public meetings. The group also initiated
an annual bake sale on April 15th, Tax Day during the 1970s, to alert citizens
to the significant amount of their tax dollars used for military purposes. </p>
<p>MWP continued to be an active voice for peace and social justice in
Missoula throughout the 1980s. The group became a member of Women’s
International League for Peace and Freedom in 1981, a relationship that proved
beneficial to both organizations through the exchange of information, speakers
and financial support. In 1985 MWP group members succeeded in placing a statue
of Montana’s prominent peace activist, suffragette and politician, Jeannette
Rankin, in the Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.
The 1980s also marked the beginning of the group’s Peace Consortium Dinners, a
monthly gathering of peace groups in the Missoula area. From these dinners and
similar collaborative events came the idea for a clearinghouse of peace
resources in Western Montana. This vision was realized when MWP members, along
with countless other groups and individuals, facilitated the opening of the
Jeanette Rankin Peace Center in 1986. </p>
<p>The 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century have seen a slowdown
in MWP sponsored activities as the founding members grow older. Yet, the group
continues to meet on a regular basis and sponsor many of its annual events such
as the Tax Day Bake Sale. MWP has also vigorously protested the Persian Gulf
War of 1991, the Kosovo Conflict of the late 1990s, violence in Latin America
and many other conflicts around the world, and remains optimistic that future
generations will take up the fight to firmly establish world peace. </p>
<p>Dawn Walsh, a staff member and student of the Women’s History
Department at the University of Montana, conducted the Missoula Women for Peace
Oral History Project in 2000. The project was part of Walsh’s internship with
the Jeannette Rankin Peace Resource Center, and was supervised by John Bertche,
a board member at the Peace Center, and Anya Jabour, a history professor at The
University of Montana. The objective of the project was to document and
celebrate the history of Missoula Women for Peace, as well as record the
personal reflections of eleven veteran group members before they grew too old
to participate in oral history interviews. </p>
<p>During the course of the project Dawn Walsh recorded eleven individual
and one group oral history interview with MWP members. She also attended and
photographed MWP sponsored events such as the annual Tax Day Bake Sale and the
donation of peace-related children’s books to the Missoula Public Library.
Walsh also organized a banquet in honor of MWP members that was held at the
Jeanette Rankin Peace Resource Center in May of 2000. After the completion of
the Missoula Women for Peace Oral History Project, Walsh donated all materials
compiled and created during the project’s course to the K. Ross Toole Archives
with the hope that they will inspire and educate future generations of women
activists. </p>

<p>Known as Frank D. "Sandbar" Brown throughout his life in Montana,
Brown was born John Francis Deane Brown in Nelson County, Virginia on November
24, 1845. In June 1861 he enlisted in the Confederate Army and served until his
discharge in September 1862. He re-enlisted, this time in the marine service.
Capture by the Union Army ended his military career in April 1863. Brown was
paroled and transported to St. Louis where he booked passage on a steamer to
Fort Union on the upper Missouri River and then on to Fort Benton in Montana
Territory by December 1865. It was also about this time that Brown permanently
dropped "John" from his name in response to an increasing distaste for the
Union Army's marching song "John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the
ground..."</p>
<p>In Montana Territory he worked as a fur trapper, scout and a placer
miner. In 1873, A. J. Davis hired Brown, who then located the Lexington and
other mines. In 1878, Brown moved to Philipsburg and worked for mining firms in
the area. During the next forty years he managed and developed many of the
well-known placer and quartz mines in the area. He was also owner and editor of
the <emph>Philipsburg Mail</emph> and gained his nickname of "Sandbar" through
the signing of many articles with that title.</p>
<p>Brown attended all Democratic party state conventions for over 40
years. He was also a member of the Sons of the American Revolution and the
major-general commanding the northwest division of the United Confederate
Veterans for the states of Montana, the Dakotas, Idaho, Wyoming and
Washington.</p>
<p>Brown was an active member of the Society of Montana Pioneers and in
1908 was elected as its historian, an office he held, except for one year,
until his death in 1931. In 1923 he was also elected as secretary of the
organization. Within the Society, he was instrumental in determining locations
and erecting monuments marking significant historical events, including marking
the path of the Mullan Road. A son, James M. Brown, and daughter, Albertina
(Tina) Brown Parker, were active in the Sons and Daughters of Montana
Pioneers.</p>
<p>Brown married Anna Elizabeth Lentz in Helena, Montana, on December
1873. They had eight children: Frances Dean, Anna, Edward Wilhelm, Amy Frances,
Albertina Nettie, Minnie Madeline, Angus, and James A. Murray. Francis Dean,
Anna, and Angus died before the age of three. Anna Lentz Brown died on October
6, 1914.</p>
<p>During his later years, Brown was a rancher and also worked in real
estate and insurance. He died in Missoula, Montana, on January 16, 1931.</p>

<p>Carling I. Malouf was born in Fillmore, Utah, in 1916. In 1940, he
graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business and economics from the
University of Utah. As an undergraduate, Malouf worked on an archaeological dig
in central Utah, which compelled him to obtain a master’s degree in
anthropology at the University of Utah. While working on his master’s, Malouf
met his wife Arline, and the couple was married in 1941. </p>
<p>Wartime military service during WWII interrupted Malouf’s work on a
doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University. During his service, the
couple moved to various posts and stations in Utah, California, and Arizona. In
1946, Malouf was able to resume his doctoral studies at Columbia and he
graduated 2 years later. Shortly after graduation in 1948, Malouf was offered a
faculty position at The University of Montana in Missoula and he, Arline, and
their four young children returned to the west. </p>
<p>While at the University of Montana, Carling Malouf played large role
in the birth and development of the departments of Anthropology and Native
American Studies, and was chair of the department of Anthropology from
1969-1977. Malouf was an avid researcher in the fields of Archaeology,
Ethnology, and Native American Studies. His primary research interests included
Native American tribes of Montana, the Plains, and the greater Northwest,
comparative ethnology, and archaeological sites in Montana, including Fort
Owen. Malouf’s involvement in anthropology and archaeology also extended
outside of the University system. He was a supporter and a member of the board
of directors of the Montana Archaeological Society, an organization devoted to
promoting research and public involvement in archaeology in the state of
Montana. Malouf contributed many articles to the Society’s publication,
<emph>Archaeology in Montana</emph>, from the years 1959-2000. </p>
<p>Malouf was also involved in the development of the Head Start program.
In 1960, he was a member of the Montana Child Welfare Committee, a group that
made periodic reports to the White House regarding the state of education and
youth in Montana. He became a consultant in Anthropology for Project Head Start
for the Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1969, Malouf, along with 150 other
education specialists, was invited to the White House to a conference for the
development of the Head Start Program. Later, he and his wife toured
reservations in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming to provide information and ideas to
administrators for the new programs. </p>
<p>Malouf retired from the University of Montana in 1988 and was honored
that same year at the Montana Archaeological Society’s Annual Conference.
Following his retirement, Malouf continued to do research and publish articles.
Carling Malouf died in March of 2007 at the age of 90. </p>

<p>The first survey for a northern route to the Pacific was conducted by
the War Department in 1853. The Northern Pacific Railroad Company was organized
in 1864 with Josiah Perman as president. Construction began at Carlton,
Minnesota, in February 1870, with an initial operation of 125 miles. That same
year, construction began at Kalama, Washington Territory, near Portland,
Oregon, and that line was extended to New Tacoma, Washington Territory, by
1873. The company was reorganized in the wake of financial troubles in 1875.
The western and eastern lines joined at Gold Creek, Montana, in 1883. The real
completion date was 1888 when the tunnel through Stampede Pass, Washington, was
opened, replacing a switchback line over that pass. The company was reorganized
for a second time in 1896 as the Northern Pacific Railway Company. </p>
<p>The company’s lines were organized into divisions. According to the
1881 annual report, the divisions were as follows: </p>
<p>Wisconsin Division: Brainerd, Minnesota to Dulluth, Minnesota </p>
<p>Minnesota Division: Minnesota/North Dakota border to Great Lakes</p>
<p> Dakota Division: Bismarck, North Dakota to North Dakota/Minnesota
border </p>
<p>Missouri Division: Bismarck, North Dakota to Miles City, Montana </p>
<p>Yellowstone Division: Miles City, Montana to Livingston, Montana </p>
<p>Rocky Mountain Division: Livingston, Montana to Missoula, Montana</p>
<p> Clark’s Fork Division: Missoula, Montana to Montana/Idaho border</p>
<p> Pend D’Oreille Division: Montana/Idaho border to Ainsworth,
Washington </p>
<p>Cascade Division: Ainsworth, Washington to Tacoma, Washington </p>
<p> Pacific Division: Tacoma, Washington to Portland, Oregon </p>
<p>The geographic boundaries of divisions changed over time. They were
originally based on the distance an engine could go before it needed service
and fuel, a distance that became greater with changes in engine technology.</p>
<p>Under its charter, the Northern Pacific could not build branch lines
to feed into the main line. In order to meet its needs for feeder lines and

<p>Colonel James A. McGowan was born in Malone, New York,on March 5,
1852. He graduated from Wesleyan Seminary in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1868. He
then worked for three years in a lumber office and then as a railroad
contractor and mercantile manager for 11 years before settling in (Wild Horse)
Plains, Montana, in May of 1882. He was one of the founders of the city and
brought the first farming equipment into that valley where he was the first
farmer. Plains was at the time a boom town as the outfitting center for the
Coeur d'Alene mining district.</p>
<p>In 1884 he went into partnership with Neptune Lynch, on whose ranch
the city was founded. McGowan quickly assumed control of the mercantile
business partnership and expanded his influence to control the entire
community. He had great ambitions for the town. By the time of his death in
1911, McGowan controlled the general mercantile (McGowan Commercial Company) a
butcher shop, a blacksmith shop, a livery stable, a hotel, the
<title>Plains News Letter</title> (now the
<title>Plainsman</title>), the electric light and heating plant, the
Plains water company and was founder and president of The First National Bank
of Plains. He also owned the largest grain farm in the valley, upon which as
many as 25 worker were employed. A staunch Republican and great supporter of
the Progressive Movement, McGowan served as State Stock Commissioner and as
United States Commissioner. He was also an active member of the Masons.</p>
<p>McGowan married Delia Farmer, the daughter of James and Sarah Farmer.
He died in Los Angeles, where he had gone to improve his health, on April 1,
1911. His death was widely mourned across western Montana.</p>
<p>The McGowan Commercial Company sold a full variety of items for
mining, agriculture, and living. From 1902 to 1932, Clifford H. Rittenour was
employed at the store, first as manager, then as President of McGowan
Commercial Company. He attended the University of Montana in Missoula.</p>

<p>In 1977 Rexford S. Blazer and John L. Wachsmuth managed a historical
resource identification and location project study of Montana's mining camps.
They said they began the study because ghost towns in Montana were disappearing
quickly and the sites should be preserved because they tell the story of how
Montana and the West came to be. The research was conducted for the University
of Montana, Montana State University, The Montana Ghost Town Preservation
Society, and The Western Montana Ghost Town Preservation Society. Their goal
was to survey historic mining campsites throughout the state of Montana. They
determined which sites contained extant remains which could possibly be
preserved. Next they prepared bibliographies on these sites to encourage
further research.</p>

<p>John W. Blair arrived in Virginia City, Montana, in July 1864 with a
party of 300 who traveled to Montana in search of gold. Blair traveled from
Seneca, Ohio, where he was born in October 1841. His father, Thomas Blair, was
of Scotch-Irish ancestry. His mother, Mary Saylor, came from a prominent
Virginia family. John W. Blair lived on his family’s farm and was educated in
public schools until he left to fight in the Civil War. He was a member of the
49th Ohio Regiment of Minute Men. After Blair arrived in Montana he mined in
Virginia City for a while and spent his first winter in Utah. After that he
worked in the Last Chance Gulch mine near Helena, Montana, for six years. </p>
<p>In 1872 Blair moved to Helmville, Montana, which is located in the
Blackfoot Valley east of Missoula, Montana. He established one of the largest
ranches in the state at the time about two miles from Helmville. At one point
Blair had 28,000 acres where he mostly raised livestock. He was well known for
raising fine breeds of sheep and shorthorn cattle. During this time Blair was
elected to Montana’s first state legislature in 1889 as a republican. Blair
didn’t know he was nominated and voted for himself thinking the name on the
ticket was another man with the same name from Anaconda. While in the
legislature he served on the labor committee and was elected again in 1912.
Blair sold his ranch in 1910 and established the bank, Blair &amp; Company, in
Helmville. He was also involved in the development of the near-by town of
Drummond, Montana, where he and his partner financed the building of the Palace
Hotel. He also helped to establish Drummond State Bank. Blair was a member of
the Montana Pioneers Society. He was known as one of the state’s wealthiest men
and held a tremendous amount of deeded land. </p>

<p>The Missoula New Party was a progressive political organization formed
in the spring of 1993 by a group of Missoula citizens who were motivated to
move the political system in a more progressive direction by creating a third
party option to the existing two party system. As a local chapter of the
national New Party, whose headquarters were located in New York, NY, the
Missoula New Party embraced many of the national organization’s guiding
principles including electoral reform through electoral fusion. Electoral
fusion is a practice in which a candidate receives nominations from more than
one political party and can occupy multiple ballot lines. This practice
provides an alternative to the notion that third parties function as election
spoilers by taking votes away from major party candidates. </p>
<p>One of the organization’s main activities was promoting and supporting
the election campaigns of New Party members to local entities including city
councils, school boards, and county boards, as well as other local and state
level entities. During the mid-1990s multiple New Party members were
successfully elected to city council as a result of the New Party’s grassroots
campaigning efforts. Other activities included issue-based campaigns, most
significantly a Living Wage campaign, which resulted in the city council
passing of a living wage ordinance. Other issue-based campaigns included
affordable housing, occupancy standards, and smart growth management. </p>
<p>In 1997, a United States Supreme Court decision rejected the New
Party’s argument that electoral fusion was a right protected by the first
amendment, effectively allowing state legislatures to legally ban electoral
fusion as a practice. This significantly impacted the organization’s underlying
principle, and led to the eventual dissolution of local New Party chapters
around the country, including the Missoula New Party in 2001. </p>

<p>Stewart M. Brandborg was born in Lewiston, Idaho, in February of 1925.
His father, Guy M. "Brandy" Brandborg, was the assistant to the forest
supervisor on the Nez Perce National Forest. In 1935, the Brandborg family
moved to Montana where Guy Brandborg would serve as the forest supervisor for
the Bitterroot National Forest for twenty years. In 1943, Stewart Brandborg
began university studies at Montana State University in Missoula (now called
The University of Montana.) It was here that Stewart met his future wife, Anna
Vee Mather. Brandborg graduated in 1947 with a bachelor’s of science in
wildlife technologies. He and Anna Vee were married in 1949 and would later
have 5 children. </p>
<p>In the late 1940s Brandborg conducted pioneering mountain goat
research while working for the Montana Department of Fish and Game. In 1949,
while studying for his Master’s degree in Forestry at The University of Idaho,
he was a research fellow at the Idaho Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit. Upon
graduation (1951), Brandborg conducted research and management investigations
on the mountain goat, elk, and other big game species with the Idaho Department
of Fish and Game, where he worked through 1953. </p>
<p>In 1954, Brandborg and his family moved to Washington DC where he had
taken a position with the National Wildlife Federation as an assistant
conservation director. While with the Federation, Brandborg worked with local
conservation leaders on proposed dams on the Clearwater River in Idaho. He
assisted in extending the Keep America Beautiful program to a state level and
oversaw the publication and circulation of conservation literature to the
public. In 1956, while still with the National Wildlife Federation, Brandborg
was elected to the governing board of The Wilderness Society and in 1960 he was
hired by The Wilderness Society as associate executive director. After the
death of the director, Howard Zahniser, in 1964, Brandborg became the director
of The Wilderness Society. </p>
<p>While at The Wilderness Society, Brandborg faced many challenges and a
changing environmental movement. He placed a strong emphasis on working with
local groups on conservation issues and stressed the importance of grassroots
volunteers. He worked on proposing and supporting wilderness for designation
under the newly minted National Wilderness Preservation Act passed in 1964. He
also lent the support of The Wilderness Society to stopping a proposal for a
Trans-Alaskan pipeline that threatened wilderness and wildlife in Alaska
beginning in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Although the pipeline was
eventually built, the efforts of The Wilderness Society led to greater
environmental regulations on the pipeline and the eventual declaration of over
100 million acres of parks, refuges, and wild rivers in Alaska. After an
acrimonious departure from The Wilderness Society in January of 1977, Brandborg
worked as special assistant to the director of The National Park Service until
1981. Iin this position Brandborg was responsible for the development of
citizen participation programs to foster communication between The National
Park Service and local citizens. In 1982, Brandborg became the national
coordinator for The Regional Environmental Leadership Conference Series.
Brandborg developed training materials and organized regional conferences to
train new leaders in the environmental movement. He worked with The Leadership
Series until he left Washington to return to Montana in 1986. </p>
<p>Brandborg returned to Montana's Bitterroot Valley and served as
president of the Friends of the Bitterroot from 1988-1990, and with Bitterrooters for Planning. In 1998 he served on
the board of directors of Wilderness Watch. He continued to work on
environmental issues from his home in Hamilton, Montana, until his death on April 14, 2018. </p>

<p>The Metal Mine Workers' Union developed from the labor unrest in Butte, Montana in 1917. The copper mines of Butte produced a strong union presence in the city; by 1887, all of the city's mines were unionized. This "closed shop" persisted until 1914 when internal struggles destroyed the once powerful Butte Miners' Union of the Western Federation of Miners and opened the mines to corporate control.</p>
<p>In early June of 1917, a fire in the Granite Mountain and Speculator Mine shafts killed 168 miners. Several days later, miners began to walk off the job at copper mines all over the city in protest of the poor working conditions. A meeting was organized and the Metal Mine Workers' Union, an unaffiliated and independent union, formed less than two weeks after the Speculator Mine fire. The new union immediately petitioned the operating companies for recognition of their union, safer working conditions, and wage increases. By the end of June, other trade unions, including the Electricians, Boilermakers, Blacksmiths, and Metal Trades Machinists of Butte, joined the miners in their strike.</p>
<p>The companies resisted the mining union organizers' efforts and chose to work with the other trade unions, acquiescing to many of their demands in hopes of isolating the miners' union and forcing and end to the strike. By the end of July, most of the other trade unions had reached a deal and returned to work. The miners' union continued to strike through 1917, however, many miners returned to work before its official end. The Metal Mine Workers' Union officially called off the strike on December 18, 1917.</p>

<p>Disability Services for Students at the University of Montana in Missoula serves students with disabilities by ensuring that all programs are usable and accessible.
In the early 1980s, at the urging of various university departments in response to a bill in the Montana House of Representatives that requested funding for handicapped services for the Commissioner of Higher Education, the University of Montana began exploring options for providing services to its disabled students. A Task Force for Handicapped Services
was established with approval from University President Richard Bowers. The task force charged itself with creating a comprehensive list of handicapped students and the services they required as well as determining the cost of such services and possible resources for funding.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Alliance for Disability and Students at the University of Montana (ADSUM) was
founded in response to continued access problems for UM students with disabilities.
That same year, the University hired Jim Marks as its first disability student
advisor to directly oversee students with disabilities and their needs. This
position would eventually form the foundation of the Disability Services for
Students department at the University of Montana (the first standalone office in
support of students with disabilities). By 1989, Jim Marks would be the first
coordinator of Disability Services for Students. By 1990, the new office of
Disability Services for Students started publishing an official handbook to outline
the services available. As of 2015, Disability Services for Students works with individual students to provide reasonable modifications to make programs and facilities accessible.</p>

<p>Robert H. "Ty" Robinson was born on January 25, 1916 in the town of Columbia Falls, Montana. Robinson's nickname "Ty" originated from a man Robinson's father had played baseball with: Ty Cobb. Ty Robinson was raised in six different towns from a young age, including Kalispell and Whitefish. He graduated from Flathead County High School in 1933, where he played basketball. In 1935, Robinson entered the University of Montana as an undergraduate student. From 1937-1939, Robinson played on the University of Montana Men's Basketball team. In 1940, Robinson graduated from the University of Montana with a Bachelor's degree in history and political science.</p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Montana, Robinson worked for the Department of Justice, slowly working his way up the ranks. He entered the military in 1943, and served until 1946 as "commissioned on staff" and commander on the Service Force Pacific Fleet in the U.S. Navy. Upon completion of service in 1946, Robinson returned to the University of Montana, where he graduated with his Juris Doctor degree in 1948. After graduating in 1948, Robinson was admitted into practice in the same year, then entering the Missoula Mercantile work force as in-house counsel. Starting in 1950, Robinson taught in the University of Montana School of Business and Business Law for 11 years. In 1954, Robinson became a partner in the law firm, Garlington, Lohn, and Robinson, from which he retired in 1987 to become "of counsel." In 1971, Robinson was sworn in by the Montana Supreme Court to the Montana Constitutional Convention Commission.</p>
<p>Robinson was an active member of the Montana community, serving on boards and civic councils with a range of missions. Some of Robinson's contributions include serving as a past president of the Missoula Rotary Club, a member of the Missoula Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Community Medical Center Foundation, and a past president of the Western Montana Council of Boy Scouts. Robinson was active in civil affairs on the state, county, and city levels, where his focus was on education, health, and the environment. </p>
<p>Robinson married his wife, Jean E. Fritz, on November 23, 1939, and had two children, John and Laird. Ty Robinson died in Missoula March 27, 2018 at the age of 102.</p>

<p>Harold Guy Merriam was born September 6, 1883, at Westminster,
Massachusetts. He was graduated from Denver (Colorado) High School in June
1902, and entered the University of Wyoming where he majored in science and the
classics. He received his BA from Wyoming in 1905. In 1904 he was chosen to be
a member of the first group of Rhodes Scholars. He attended Lincoln College,
Oxford University, where he was enrolled in the honors school in English
language and literature. He was awarded a BA from Oxford in 1907 and an MA in
1912.</p>
<p>Merriam taught at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, from
1908 to 1910. In the fall of 1910, he enrolled at Harvard University as an
Austin Fellow. Merriam left Harvard, where he studied drama, after the fall
term to teach a Beloit College in Wisconsin, where he remained until 1913. He
then taught at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, until 1919. During World War
I, Merriam took a leave of absence from his teaching career and went with the
Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) to France, where he taught English to
French officers. After the Armistice he was transferred to London, where he
assisted American officers and enlisted men in entering British
universities.</p>
<p>The University of Montana hired him in 1919 to teach English and to
chair the English department. Merriam introduced creative writing into the
curriculum. To encourage his students to write, he began editing their works
and publishing them in a new magazine, the
<title>Frontier</title>. This later merged with the
<title>Midland</title>, published in Iowa City, IA, to form
<title>Frontier and Midland</title>. This well-respected regional
literary magazine encouraged students and writers not only from Montana, but
from throughout the Pacific Northwest. The publication featured the early
efforts of regional writers A.B. Guthrie, Dorothy M. Johnson, Helen Addison
Howard, Grace Stone Coates, and others. Publication of the journal continued
until 1939.</p>
<p>Merriam began a series of writer's conferences in Montana in the
summer of 1930. These short conferences offered creative writers the
opportunity to work with such nationally known writers as Struthers Burt, Mary
Austin, Frank Ernest Hill, and others. The conferences continued through the
summer of 1934, were suspended until 1948 and continued through the summer of
1960. Following the formation of the Montana Academy of Sciences in 1940,
Merriam formulated the idea for the Montana Institute of the Arts, which was
founded in 1948. He served as its first president and in 1957 became the editor
of the
<title>Montana Institute of the Arts Quarterly</title>, a position he
filled until 1964.</p>
<p>From 1907 to 1919, the University of Montana had no Rhodes Scholars.
Merriam became very active in the program; with his encouragement, sixteen
University of Montana students went to Oxford between 1919 and 1970. He was an
enthusiastic supporter of the program and served many years on its regional and
local committees. In 1933, in addition to his duties as chairman of the English
department, Merriam was appointed chairman of the Division of Humanities, a new
concept in University administration. He continued carrying the two assignments
until his retirement in 1954. In December 1935, Merriam was appointed state
supervisor of the Federal Writers' Project. His efforts culminated in the
publication of
<title>Montana, A State Guide Book</title> in 1939. He also took leave
from the University of Montana in 1939 to teach at the University of Oregon in
Eugene, and earned his PhD in English from Columbia University.</p>
<p>Merriam was instrumental in the recognition of the importance and
accomplishments of American and Northwest writers. Prior to his work and that
of others, literary studies in the United States were largely confined to
British authors; an individual with a college degree in English would usually
have studied no American authors. In recognition of his accomplishments, the
University of Wyoming awarded him an LLD in 1962, citing his record as "Rhodes
Scholar, professor of literature, founder and editor of magazines for new
writers in the Northwest, anthropologist of regional writing, pioneer in the
discovery of the cultural potentialities of his region." In 1963, an honorary
LLD followed from the University of Montana Missoula. In 1978, he was honored
at the 75th dinner celebration of the Rhodes Scholars in New York.</p>
<p>He married Doris W. Foote in 1915. They had two children, Alan and
Alison. Doris Merriam died in 1970, and he married Frances Dummer Logan in
1974. H. G. Merriam died in Missoula, Montana, in March 1980.</p>

<p>Between 1867 and 1876 citizens in Missoula, Montana Territory,
pleaded, protested, and petitioned for a military post. While Indian problems
usually initiated each round of concern, local newspapers editorials touted the
value of a military presence for encouraging immigration and business. In 1876,
the War Department approved a company post and appropriated funds. Construction
began in the summer of 1877 but Indian trouble delayed the work. Barracks and
non-commissioned officer's quarters were completed in February 1878, and in
mid-summer of the same year officer's quarters were finished.</p>
<p>On May 12, 1896, Fort Missoula's 2nd Lieutenant James A. Moss received
permission to organize the 25th Infantry Bicycle Corps, the first of its kind
in the country. The Corps, consisting of eight black enlisted men, practiced
riding in formation, drilling, scaling fences up to nine-feet high, fording
streams, and pedaling 40 miles a day. After a successful trek to Yellowstone
National Park, the Corps took on the challenge of riding from Missoula to St.
Louis, Missouri. That forty-one day journey in the summer of 1897 was the last
for the Bicycle Corps. By 1898 war with Spain was probable and military
priorities shifted. </p>
<p>Fort Missoula remained active for a number of years as a military
installation. It also housed the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s
and Italian, German, and Japanese internees during WWII. There were no regular
military forces at Fort Missoula after 1947.</p>
<p>Fort Missoula was formally decommissioned in April, 2001.</p>

<p>From around 1897 to the 1960s The University of Montana-Missoula teams
were represented by a live bear cub mascot. Through the years mascots had names
such as Teddy, Cocoa and Chester as well as Fessy I, II, and III, in honor of
famed football coach Doug Fessenden, and Jerry, in honor of coach Jerry
Williams. The end of the football season was also the end of each bear's career
as a mascot as it had grown beyond a manageable size. Some former mascots were
released and others transferred to zoo-type facilities.</p>
<p>Mascots during the 1970s and 1980s did not wear the university logo
and usually represented a local company or larger corporation. Those mascots
included the Hamms Beer Bear, the radio station KYLT chicken, a sandwich shop's
Piccolo Pete, the Domino's Pizza mascot, and Ronald McDonald. Sometime in the
1980s Grizzly Auto sponsored the mascot, "Grizzly Otto." Early costumed bear
mascots such as Otto were more ferocious and aggressive and less playful and
engaged with the audience.</p>
<p>After consultation with mascot experts, the current Monte costumed
bear mascot debuted in 1993 with an engaging look and a fun, energetic
personality.</p>

<p>Merrill K. Riddick was born on March 7, 1895 in Madison, Wisconsin. He
moved to eastern Montana at the age of 11. His father, Carl Riddick, served two
terms as a U.S. Congressman for the Eastern District of Montana in 1919 and
1921. At the age of 16 Merrill K. Riddick began traveling throughout the
Northwest and became interested in the emerging field of aviation. In 1917,
Riddick was a member of the first graduating class from the Army Air Force
Aeronautics School in San Diego, California. He was sent to Europe during World
War I to serve as an instructor and to fly reconnaissance.</p>
<p>After the war, Riddick was among the first airmail pilots. Riddick and
Charles A. Lindbergh barnstormed together and flew in the Harry Perkins Air
Circus. While barnstorming Riddick met and married (on the same day) his wife,
Helen May Williams, from West Virginia. They had three children. In 1928,
Riddick was an instructor at the first aviation preparatory school in
Rochester, New York, where he instructed future president Franklin D.

<p>The National Smokejumper Association (NSA) is an organization which preserves and shares
the history of aerial fire management and provides a forum for those associated with
wildland firefighting. Founded in 1992, the NSA maintains a roster of current and former smokejumpers and
actively collects the histories of individuals and organizations associated with the
development of smokejumping and aerial fire management.</p><p>In addition to furthering the legacy of smokejumping, the NSA works to support current and
former smokejumpers as well as the forests and rangelands they protect. The organization
offers support to smokejumpers and their families through a scholarship program and a "Good
Samaritan Fund," offering financial support to those in need. Additionally, the Trails
Restoration and Maintenance Projects, organized by NSA members and staffed by volunteers,
clears trails in wilderness areas using volunteer teams. Established in 1999 by Jon McBride
and Art Jukkala, the program utilizes the NSA's network of former smokejumpers to clear
trails of debris, build fences, and restore structures in national forests and parks.</p>

<p>The J. Neils Lumber Company was incorporated in 1895 at Sauk Rapids,
Minnesota. After several years of successful operation and expansion on Sauk
Rapids and Cass Lake, Minnesota, the company purchased timberlands in Flathead
and Lincoln counties, Montana, in 1906-1907. About one million dollars was
invested in timber, priced generally at $1 per thousand board feet. In 1911, J.
Neils bought the Dawson Lumber Company, with mills in Libby, Montana, and about
ten thousand acres of timberlands in surrounding areas. After Paul Neils, son
of founder Julius Neils, became general and sales manager at Libby in 1912,
earnings climbed rapidly. A division of assets in 1915 resulted in the loss of
the Libby mill, 96,666 acres of Montana timberlands, and other Montana assets.
J. Neils retained Montana timberlands at Columbia Falls, Fortine Creek, and
east of Flathead Lake as well as notes for $550,000. Paul Niels returned to
Minnesota where he stepped up those opearations and steadily increased earnings
in 1917 and 1918. In 1919, the Libby mill and tributary timber lands were
re-purchased from Shevlin Company.</p>
<p>The operations at Cass Lake and Libby prospered after World War I. By
1923, the last log had been sawn at Cass Lake. With no more timber available
for purchase there, the mill there closed. Looking westward, the company
purchased a mill at Klickitat, Washington, in 1922 and continued to increase
its Montana timber holdings. There was a major fire loss at Columbia Falls in
1929. After difficult times in the Depression, long-range planning was again
established and selective logging studies undertaken. Truck logging began at
Libby in 1935.</p>
<p>The entire outstanding stock of the Montana Light &amp; Power Company
was acquired by J. Neils in 1944. In 1955, J. Neils built a new mill at Troy,
Montana. In 1957, J. Neils Lumber Company merged with St. Regis Paper Company.
A stud mill was built at Libby in 1958, and a plywood plant began operations in
1960. In 1993, the Libby assets were sold to Stimson Lumber and Plum Creek
Timber Company. The Libby mill closed in 2002.</p>

<p>Founded in 1978, the Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities was originally called the Montana University Affiliated Program Satellite (MUAPS), and was located at the University of Montana in Missoula. MUAPS was one of 43 university-affiliated programs in the United States that focused on improving and developing services for the developmentally disabled. It was funded through the federal Administration on Developmental Disabilities. In 1990 MUAPS became known as the Montana University Affiliated Rural Institute on Disabilities, and it consolidated with the Research and Training Center on Rural Rehabilitation Services. The Research and Training Center (RTC) was established in October 1987 at the University of Montana to pursue research and training for the purpose of assisting persons with disabilities in rural communities. It was one of 35 centers in the United States funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the federal Department of Education. The consolidation broadened the program’s scope and combined a variety of services such as a new clinic operation. </p>
<p>By the early 2000s, the Institute’s name had changed to the University of Montana Rural Institute, and by 2017 it had become the University of Montana Rural Institute for Inclusive Communities.

<p>Gertrud Degenhard was born in March of 1923 in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.
The second child of six, Gertrud’s early life was colored by the social and
economic strife afflicting post-war Germany. Originally pursuing a degree in
medicine, she studied in Berlin during World War II and often had to endure
allied air raids interrupting lectures. She switched to the humanities, delving
into history, literature, philosophy, art history, and language. In 1944, she
was drafted into military service and served as a map clerk with the German
Special Forces. After the war, she completed her exams and was certified as a
high school teacher. She continued with her studies and earned her doctorate at
Goettingen University in History and Germanistics before joining her fiancée,
Klaus Lackschewitz, in the United States in 1954. </p>
<p>Gertrud and Klaus were married shortly after her arrival in the United
States. They lived on farms in both New Jersey and Virginia for a time. They
then moved to New York City where Klaus worked as a gardener and Gertrud as a
cook, while Gertrud tried to improve their position by taking classes at the
Columbia University Teacher’s College and improving her English. Klaus
continued to take gardening jobs and Gertrud eventually got a position at the
Teacher’s College Library as a clerk. She worked as a clerk for a year before
she took a job as a reference librarian with the New York Public Library.
Victim of the policies of the time, she was fired when she reached her fifth
month of her first pregnancy in 1959. She gained the director of the library’s
help in finding a grant that allowed her to continue working through the
pregnancy. She wrote a bibliography on the history of interior decoration,
which she worked on until a week before her daughter Anna’s birth and returned
to a week after the delivery. However, she did lose her reference position and
after she completed the bibliography she was out of a job. </p>
<p>Gertrud took a position with Montana State University (now the
University of Montana) in Missoula, Montana, as an assistant professor of
German in the fall of 1960. She also had a second daughter, Elizabeth, after
moving to Missoula. Lackschewitz initially only taught German language courses,
but as she worked her way from assistant to associate to full professor she
also taught literature courses. Through her teaching and interaction with
students, she noticed that many had German ancestry. As a German immigrant and
instructor of German, she was intrigued by these students’ background and began
a research project that delved into German immigration to Montana. Through her
extensive research, she devised several chapters for a book about German
immigrants in Montana based on Helena Germans, Russian Germans, Hutterites, and
German churches. However, after she retired from teaching in 1989, she never
completed the book. </p>
<p>Klaus Lackschewitz passed away on August 10, 1995. Gertrud continues
to live in Missoula, Montana. </p>

<p>Thain White was born and raised in Rollins, Montana. White spent his
early years helping his father, Ernie White, raise sheep at White's Columbia
Sheep Company. It was during these years that White acquired a strong interest
in the history and archeology of his native state. This interest resulted in
decades of Montana historical research and writings.</p>
<p>In 1949, Thain and Ernie White began the Flathead Lake Lookout Museum
in Lakeside, Montana. Located on the west shore of Flathead Lake, the museum is
dedicated to exhibitions and collections concerning regional and primitive
artifacts. Two generations of the White family maintained the museum facility
until 1972, when the O'Neil Jones family purchased the museum.</p>
<p>During his years as museum director, White undertook a number of
research projects concerning the Montana area and the Flathead Valley in
particular. He conducted a variety of excavations at battlegrounds from the
Indian Wars of the 1880s and homestead sites such as Chimney Coulee. He also
focused much of his research on railroads and stage companies existing in

<p>The Peterson Drug Company was located in Missoula, Montana, at 216
North Higgins. It was started by Gustave F. Peterson, a Swedish immigrant, who
entered into a partnership with his brother, Alexander Peterson, in 1903. By
1918, Alexander Peterson had purchased his brother's interest. For three years,
Alexander was the sole proprietor and manager. After 1922, the two brothers
owned all the stock and managed the firm together. In 1922, the Petersons had
stores at three locations: the Peterson Drug Store at 216 N. Higgins Ave., the
Garden City Drug Store at 118 N. Higgins Ave., and Peterson Drug Store No. 3.
The store located at 216 N. Higgins remained open when the other branches
closed. Several members of the Peterson family were involved in the business,
including Gustave, Sr., Gustave F., Jr., and Francis, son of Alexander
Peterson. Ownership and management of the Peterson Drug Company later fell to
Gustave Peterson, Jr. During the 1940s, ownership passed outside of the
Peterson family, although the business kept its name. Harold C. Kohlhase was
the company's last owner. By 1980 the business ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Great Falls Breweries Inc. was founded by Emil Sick in 1933
immediately after the repeal of Prohibition. It was begun with the purchase of
the interests of the Montana Brewing Company and the American Brewing Company,
two Great Falls firms dating from the 1890s that had been closed by
Prohibition. Mr. Sick continued the operation until 1949 when he sold the
property to local interests. It was again sold in 1966 to Blitz-Weinhard
Company of Portland, Oregon, which continued operations until September, 1968
when severe economic conditions forced the closure of the Great Falls plant. At
the time of its closing, the Great Falls operation was the last operating
brewery in the four state area of Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, and Wyoming</p>
