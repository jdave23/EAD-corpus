	 	<p>Marie C. Siedentopf was born on June 19, 1892 in Germany to William and Else Siedentopf. She had one younger brother, William. The family immigrated to the United States in 1906 and settled in Miles City, Montana where they owned a dairy farm.</p>
		<p>Siedentopf would attend Custer County High School and the State University of Montana (now the University of Montana) in Missoula. She graduated from the university in the spring of 1917 with degrees in German and biology. 
		After graduating, she stayed in Montana for several years but eventually worked as a librarian in Pasadena, California and Phoenix, Arizona. For a time, Siedentopf lived with her college friend, Dr. Irma Wilson, a professor of Spanish at Arizona State University.</p>
	 	<p>Marie Siedentopf died in Burlingame, California on October 4, 1981. She is buried in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

	 	<p>This album contains photographs of Marie Siedentopf as well as her friends and family. Many
				photos focus on Marie's immediate family, specifically her parents William and Else,
				her brother Bill, and Bill's wife Gertrude. There are photos of her family's dairy
				farm in Miles City, Montana and various scenes around their property. Marie's time
				at the State University of Montana (now the University of Montana) in Missoula is
				prevalent, including rush, Aber Day, and graduation. There are also photos of trips
				to Lolo, Montana and Hamilton, Montana. Irma Wilson, Marie's roommate from 1913 to
				1914 and lifelong friend, is prominent throughout the album. Photos of a family trip
				to Yellowstone National Park and another to New Mexico are also included.</p></scopecontent>
