      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Dr. William H. Harrison was a physcian for the United States Indian
		  Service. He authored a number of articles, especially in journals of
		  ophthalmology, about the problem of trachoma among Native Americans. He is listed in the
		  Missoula, Montana, city directories for 1913 and 1915 as a partner in Smith,
		  Pease and Harrison, Physicians and Surgeons. </p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <p>This collection consists of three photograph albums of images and some
		  accompanying text documenting the travels and activities of Dr. Harrison, a
		  physician for the Indian Service, and a woman (perhaps a sister). A large
		  number of images are of Native Americans on reservations, including some who were
		  suffering from trachoma. </p>
      <p>Locations depicted in the albums include: White Earth Reservation,
		  Minnesota; Lame Deer, Montana; Rosebud Reservation, South Dakota; Turtle
		  Mountain Reservation, North Dakota; Red Lake, Minnesota; Ft. Berthold, North
		  Dakota; Devils Lake Reservation, North Dakota; Crow Reservation, Montana; Pine
		  Point, Minnesota; Lead, South Dakota; and remains of Ft. C. M. Smith near
		  Hardin, Montana. Individuals named in the albums include: Chief Two Moons
		  (Northern Cheyenne), Plenty Crow (Northern Cheyenne), Spotted Wolf (Ft.
		  Berthold Reservation), Chief Little Fish (Devils Lake Reservation), Jim Bassett
		  (Chippewa), Billy Fine Day (Chippewa), Strong Left Hand (Northern Cheyenne),
		  Shell-on-the-Neck (Crow), White-Man-Runs-Him (Crow), Eugene Bird (Chippewa),
		  Miss Mabel Grimme, Mr. W. L. Baumer, and Dr. P. G. Caps.</p>

    <acqinfo encodinganalog="541">
      <p>It is unclear when or how these photograph albums came to be in the
		  Archives, although is almost certain that they arrived at the Library prior to
		  the establishment of the Archives in 1968 because early references to some of
		  the images in the album indicate they are from the "UM Museum," a precursor of
		  the Archives. </p>
    </acqinfo>
    <processinfo encodinganalog="583">
      <p>The albums likely arrived at what is now the Archives prior to 1968.
		  In 1972 some images in the albums were individually described in a card catalog
		  for the photograph collection. When an item was individually described the
		  image number assigned to it was written directly on the image in the photograph
		  album (ie. 72-757). In some cases images in these albums were identified as
		  being from Mary Elrod Ferguson, though it is clear now that Ferguson likely
		  received the albums during the time she was in charge of the UM Museum and that
		  she was in no way responsible for their creation or production. During a review
		  of unidentified photograph albums in 2009 it became apparent that these three
		  albums belonged together and they were placed in the same box and described for
		  the first time as the William Harvey Harrison photograph albums. No attempt was
		  made to remove the image numbers written on the images in the 1970s.</p>
