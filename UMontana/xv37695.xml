		<head>Historical Note</head>
		
		<p>In 1954, J.B. Speer, a retired professor and controller for the University of Montana, was
				named chairman of the Montana Institute of the Arts local history group. He used
				this position to create interest in a local historical society. Small meetings of
				local "businessmen" who were interested in supporting the new society began in early
				1954. The first large meeting of community members did not take place until April
				17th of that year. Attendees elected Harry McCann as temporary chairman and J.B.
				Speer as temporary secretary of the new organization. The new society had
				representatives from area organizations incuding the Rotary, the Missoula Chamber of
				Commerce, the Missoula Public Library, the Lions Club, the University of Montana,
				the Sons and Daughters of Montana Pioneers, and the Hellgate Project. The members
				tasked the organization with the preservation of local landmarks and possibly
				establishing a regional archive at the public library. The society's stated purpose
				was "to aid in the discovery, collection and preservation of every variety of
				material illustrative of the history of Montana; such as letters, diaries, journals,
				memoranda, pioneer reminiscences, newspapers, account books, school and church
				registers, commemorative addresses, genealogies and biographies, photographs,
				pictures and paintings, aboriginal relics, material objects illustrating the life of
				pioneers, maps, histories and records of the counties of western Montana and of its
				cities, towns, villages and institutions." At the May 13, 1954 meeting, the chairman
				appointed a committee to draft a constitution and by-laws for the society. The
				organization adopted a 12 member board of directors, a one dollar fee for annual
				membership, and an annual meeting to be held the second Monday of October. By 1955,
				a board of directors was elected and Cyrile Van Duser took J.B. Speer's position as
				secretary.</p>
	 	     <p>After 1955, there is no record of the organization and there is no
				additional information available.</p>
