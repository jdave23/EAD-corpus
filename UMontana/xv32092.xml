      <p>This collection contains a great deal of research material collected
		  by Dee Taylor during his time as a professor and chair of the Department of
		  Anthropology at the University of Montana-Missoula. Much of the research is
		  archaeological surveys, assessments, and papers on sites in and around Montana,
		  mostly from the 1970s and 1980s. Many of the items relate to his position with
		  the State Historic Preservation Office including contracts for his services and
		  projects he did for the Office. There are also articles on anthropological
		  topics and material from anthropology courses he taught including
		  bibliographies, exams, and lecture outlines. Some photographic material from
		  surveys and assessments are present, as well as field notes. He also retained
		  student papers and papers by his colleagues. There is also correspondence
		  regarding different projects and letters from individuals asking for help
		  identifying possible significant archaeological sites and some student papers and lecture notes.</p>
