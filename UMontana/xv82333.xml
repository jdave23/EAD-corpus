      <p>Gillette E. Van Buren was born George Van Buren in Wisconsin in August
		  of 1851. By 1880 he lived in Carleton, Nebraska, with his wife Mary and their
		  two children, Florence and Richard. By 1885, the couple had moved to Stanton,
		  Nebraska and had two more children, George Albert Jr. and Mary. According to
		  family members, Gillette left his children with relatives in Nebraska after
		  Mary’s untimely death in June 1885. </p>
      <p>The widower married again in 1888 in Wyoming, having changed his name
		  from George to Gillette. He and his second wife Katherine had six children:
		  Carrie, Grace, Daniel, Frederick, Gillette, and Frank. In 1890 and his family
		  settled on a tract of land near the Rattlesnake Creek north of Missoula,
		  Montana. Van Buren wrote for many local newspapers and Democratic Party
		  publications, including the Western Democrat, Montana Silverite (later the
		  Montana Fruit-Grower), and the Missoula Democrat. Family members report that
		  Van Buren served as a scout during the Indian Wars in Texas and Nebraska. He
		  penned this diary in 1898 while living in the Hellgate Township of Missoula
		  County. Van Buren committed suicide on January 18, 1903 at his cabin in the
		  Rattlesnake Valley. He was 53 years old.</p>
