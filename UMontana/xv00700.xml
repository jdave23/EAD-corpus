      <p>Robert D. Watt was born in Marion County, Indiana, in 1899. He lived
		  there until 1910, when his family moved to Missouri. In 1925, he graduated from
		  the University of Missouri and in 1928 earned a master's degree from the
		  University of Indiana. He moved to Montana soon afterward.</p>
      <p>From 1932-1936, he taught in St. Ignatius, Montana. In 1937, he
		  started teaching at Missoula County High School. He enlisted in the U.S. Army
		  in 1942 and sreved in the North African campaign in World War II. At the end of
		  the war, he returned to Missoula and resumed his teaching duties. In 1958 he
		  was elected superintendent of schools for Missoula County. At the end of his
		  four-year term, he successfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Montana
		  House of Representatives and served six consecutive terms. In 1974, he was
		  elected to the Montana State Senate, a post he filled for three two-year terms.
		  While a member of each house, he chaired the Tax Committee. He was a strong
		  advocate for replacing local property taxes with an income tax. This proposal
		  passed the House but was defeated in the Senate. He was also a strong advocate
		  for long-range planning for building and government development in Montana.</p>
      <p>Watt married Mabel Hardy Benson in 1965. Together, they were
		  responsible for establishing Common Cause in Montana. She died in 1991. He died
		  in 1994.</p>

      <p>The collection contains Watt's political and personal materials that
		  document his activities in state and local politics, tax reform, and other
		  matters. Watt's correspondence is mostly with Montana's congressional
		  delegation (particularly Mike Mansfield) and with local officials about
		  legislative matters. Campaign materials document his campaigns for the state
		  legislature. Clippings from Montana newspapers include stories about Watt and
		  others who interested him, but also includes a series of letters to the editor.
		  There is one file of research materials related to state tax reform.
		  Legislative materials include mostly bills and resolutions he introduced or
		  otherwise supported.</p>
