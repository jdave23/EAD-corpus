		<head>Historical Note</head>
		
		<p>Disability Services for Students at the University of Montana in Missoula serves students with disabilities by ensuring that all programs are usable and accessible. 
			In the early 1980s, at the urging of various university departments in response to a bill in the Montana House of Representatives that requested funding for handicapped services for the Commissioner of Higher Education, the University of Montana began exploring options for providing services to its disabled students. A Task Force for Handicapped Services
		    was established with approval from University President Richard Bowers. The task force charged itself with creating a comprehensive list of handicapped students and the services they required as well as determining the cost of such services and possible resources for funding.</p>
	 	<p>In 1988, the Alliance for Disability and Students at the University of Montana (ADSUM) was
				founded in response to continued access problems for UM students with disabilities.
				That same year, the University hired Jim Marks as its first disability student
				advisor to directly oversee students with disabilities and their needs. This
				position would eventually form the foundation of the Disability Services for
				Students department at the University of Montana (the first standalone office in
				support of students with disabilities). By 1989, Jim Marks would be the first
				coordinator of Disability Services for Students. By 1990, the new office of
				Disability Services for Students started publishing an official handbook to outline
				the services available. As of 2015, Disability Services for Students works with individual students to provide reasonable modifications to make programs and facilities accessible.</p>
