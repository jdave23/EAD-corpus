      <p>A.F. Graeter and Company dredged gold in Bannack, Montana, during the
		  late 1890s through the early 1900s. Bannack, originally part of the Idaho
		  Territory, began as a small mining community in 1862. In 1864 Bannack
		  experienced a boom in population after being named the capital of the newly
		  created Montana Territory. Prospectors flocked to Bannack as the area gained a
		  national reputation for its gold deposits. As the town grew, mining companies
		  moved into the area bringing large dredging machinery. These early dredges were
		  boat-like structures equipped with buckets attached to a pulley system. The
		  buckets scooped up gravel from the riverbed and deposited it into a sluice box
		  located on the dredge; the sluice box retained the gold-bearing sediments. This
		  system was the primary method for mining gold from 1895 to 1905. The A.F.
		  Graeter and Company began dredging for gold in the Marysville area near Bannack
		  on April 14, 1897. A fairly large operation, A.F. Graeter and Company, boasted
		  the third largest dredge in the area. The company was financed under the
		  Bannack Dredging Company but operated under local direction. The business
		  operated until 1902, then closed until F.B. Felt, a businessman from Chicago,
		  purchased the business in early 1906. The company was financially lucrative but
		  was permanently dismantled in the fall of 1906.</p>
