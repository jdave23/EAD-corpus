		<p>Harry William Fritz was born in Maryland on September 15, 1937. He was educated in Missoula,
				Montana and graduated from Missoula County High School in 1956. Fritz then attended
				Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, earning his undergraduate degree in
				chemistry. He went on to receive his Master's Degree in history from the University
				of Montana at Missoula and a Ph.D. in American history from Washington University in
				St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
  		<p>In 1967, Fritz returned to the University of Montana and Missoula to begin a career as a professor in the Department of History. He specialized in the early nationalist period of American history, military history, and the American Civil War. Dr. Fritz taught many of the large American history survey courses and served as chair of the department several times. In 1981, he took over the course on Montana history following the death of his colleague K. Ross Toole. 
  			Fritz found his niche as a western historian and authored two books on Montana history, <title type="italics">Montana: Land of Contrast</title> and <title type="italics">The Lewis and Clark Expedition</title>, as well as editing several western history anthologies.</p> 
  		<p>Fritz was elected to serve in the Montana Legislature as a state representative for two terms, from 1985 to 1989, and as a state senator for one term, from 1991 to 1995. In 2003, he won the Governor’s Humanities Award and in 2004 was chosen by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education as their Montana Professor of the Year. He retired from full-time teaching in 2007 and is currently a Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Montana.</p>
