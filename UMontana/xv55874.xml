    <bioghist>
      <p>John Minton Clifton was born in Ohio on February 4, 1883. By the early
		  1900s Clifton worked as a railroad contractor in Montana. He married Nora M.
		  Toole in 1908. (Nora Toole Clifton was the daughter of John R. Toole, a Montana
		  pioneer, who came to Montana in 1863 and was associated with Marcus Daly in his
		  Montana enterprises. Her mother was Anna Hardenbrook of another Montana pioneer
		  family. Nora was born in 1883 at Challis, Idaho. She attended Montana State
		  University in Missoula in 1902 and graduated from Oberlin College in Oberlin,
		  Ohio.). The family lived in Missoula for years before moving to Spokane,
		  Washington, where the contracting firm Clifton worked with established a
		  headquarters. The couple had three daughters, including Thula, and two
		  sons.</p>
