      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Robert (Roy) M. Cobban was born on May 13, 1859, in Chippewa Falls,
		  Wisconsin, where he learned the lumber mill trade. Robert’s father, William S.
		  Cobban, was born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland. He moved with his family to
		  Groveland, Massachusetts, where he met his wife, Mary Louise Hardy, whose
		  parents were descendents of pilgrims who came over on the Mayflower. In the
		  Kansas border disputes of 1852, William S. Cobban negotiated for the state of
		  Missouri. He fought for the North in the Civil War until he was injured and
		  discharged in 1864. After his injury, William S. Cobban returned to his lumber
		  mill in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>After working at his father’s mill and attending school in Wisconsin,
		  Roy Cobban headed to the West in 1880 where he homesteaded in western Montana
		  and helped his brother, William F. Cobban, build a mill in Butte City in 1883.
		  Roy Cobban was a foreman at the Montana Lumber and Produce Company until 1884,
		  while his brother remained superintendent of the mill until 1886, when both
		  sold out of the mill to devote all of their time to mining and real estate
		  ventures in the area. William F. Cobban was very successful in the mining
		  business, buying a mine with his business partner for $9,000 in 1890, and
		  selling it six years later for $6 million. Several districts in Butte carried
		  the Cobban name, reflecting Williams F. Cobban’s prominence in the city.</p>
      <p>By 1886, Roy Cobban left the real estate business, sold the newspaper he
		  owned in Butte, and focused all of his attention on his mine 15 miles north of
		  the city. In December 1885, he began a correspondence with Alice Hardy of
		  Groveland, Massachusetts, and by September 1886 they were engaged through the
		  mail.</p>

      <p>This collection includes transcribed letters that date from Sept. 21,
		  1856 to Dec. 13, 1914. Most of the correspondence takes place amongst Roy
		  Cobban and his family. The largest part of the collection is a group of letters
		  beginning in December 1885 detailing a developing relationship between Roy
		  Cobban and Alice Hardy. Roy Cobban wrote a series of letters to his mother that
		  served as a diary of his journey to Western Montana from Wisconsin and also
		  detailed his business ventures until 1886. There are several replies from his
		  mother. Miscellaneous letters include ones written by William S. Cobban to his
		  brother John and his brother Alexander, an unsigned letter written to an
		  unidentified wife, a letter recommending Robert Cobban for employment, and a
		  letter written in 1914 addressed to parents from Lulu.</p>
