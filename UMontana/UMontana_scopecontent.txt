<p>This series contains materials related to Chapman’s career as a
lobbyist. This includes files used for workshops that she led for several
Native American groups. Chapman’s primary work as a lobbyist was in conjunction
with the Blackfeet Indians in Montana. This series also includes materials
documenting her work with the Havasupai, a tribe based in Supai, which is
located in northwest Arizona. As a lobbyist, Chapman worked on a host of issues
including improvements with regards to Native American housing, legal systems,
education, and water infrastructure. This series is divided into three
subseries: Blackfeet Nation, Havasupai Tribe, and Workshops. </p>

<p>This series contains materials related to Chapman’s work as Senior
Instructor of Educational and Social Services with the Mountain-Plains
Education and Economic Development Program, based on Glasgow Air Force Base in
Glasgow, Montana. The program was based on a model of “family oriented career
education,” which was intended to improve vocational education for

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The collection is primarily a corporate history. The documents are
focused on the workings of two mining companies that owned and operated the
Drumlummon mine in Marysville, Montana, over five decades. The collection
contains correspondence, papers for the Drumlummon Provident and Accident
Insurance Association, financial records, governance, legal documents, and
printed materials. The collection provides insight into the challenges of
operating a mine in Montana. The majority of the collection consists of
incoming correspondence. The letters generally are business oriented and are
from suppliers of mining supplies and services that the Montana Mining Company
and the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company used. The financial records
include detailed accounting of the costs and rewards of the mine. The
governance primarily concerns stockholder struggles to control the St. Louis
Mining and Milling Company in the years after it took control of the Drumlummon
property. The bulk of legal documents relate to litigation between the Montana
Mining Company and the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company from 1890 to 1911.
The remainder of the collection relates to all aspects of the routine
functioning of an underground silver and gold mine in Montana.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The series is arranged chronologically beginning in 1881. There is
a single folder of outgoing correspondence for 1887 to 1890. The remainder of
the series is all incoming correspondence dating through 1934. The bulk of the
letters are from suppliers of mining goods and services. The letters range from
national suppliers of sophisticated mining equipment like Fraser and Chalmers
to local suppliers of hay for company stables. Many of the letters merely
solicit business from the mining companies, attempting to sell everything from
flint pebbles for ore processing to the services of a zither player. The
letters from suppliers include information on the whole range of materials
required by the two companies and the national scope of the mining business.
Many of the letters concern the costs of supplies and the difficulty of
shipping material to Marysville. The letters also relate to unpaid bills, mine
injuries, job inquiries, and the personal matters of various managers. There
are letters regarding other mining properties, price quotations, clippings from
the
<title>Engineering and Mining Journal</title>, and mining prospects
at the Drumlummon. There are several items of particular interest in this
series. The communications between the London headquarters of the Montana
Mining Company and Marysville are generally in telegraphic code for secrecy.
There are numerous code sheets to help company officials decode the messages.
<title>Slater's Telegraphic Code Book</title> in Series VII also
relates to this material. The correspondence relating to both companies also
overlaps chronologically. Letters relating to the St. Louis Mining and Milling
Company appear in the files nearly 20 years before they own the Drumlummon.
There is also a report from a Pinkerton detective investigating union activity
in Marysville and Butte. The series provides insight into the international
nature of mining in Montana. The letters also detail the logistical and
financial difficulties of running a mine.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This brief series contains material relating to the Montana Mining
Company's insurance subsidiary. The Association was limited to employees of the
Montana Mining Company. The Board of Trustees was composed of two members
elected by employees and two members appointed by the Company. The series
includes a copy of the by-laws, rules, and regulations of the Association from
1900. The remainder of the series consists of the canceled checks of the
Insurance Association dating from 1888 to 1897. These provide insight into the
costs of running the Insurance Association and include both claims paid to
workers and materials for administration.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series is broken into several categories and arranged
chronologically within each category. The categories within the series are
arranged alphabetically. The series contains materials housed in traditional
folders and a significant number of oversize materials. These are housed in
oversize boxes and map cases. The bulk of this series is comprised of assay
reports, bullion returns, and mill reports. However, there are folders for
assets and liabilities, federal reports, insurance, invoices, mine progress
reports, claim descriptions and names, payroll records, reports on other mines,
and tax assessments. The materials in the series provide a solid background for
understanding the finances of the Drumlummon mine and the two companies that
owned it. The assay reports present a fairly complete picture of the ore values
for the early years of the mine. The quantity of reports declines sharply after
1902 and is sporadic for the ensuing years. The bullion returns document the
metal bars produced after smelting. These returns are less complete than the
assay returns. They are intermittent for the entire history of the mine,
although the period around 1900 is reasonably complete. Mill reports concern
the quantity of the ore processed at each of the stamp mills that the companies
operated. They also contain information concerning the quantity of pulp and
tailings each produced and the values of the ore being processed. These reports
are very complete through the early 1890's and include a set of blueprints for
a 1913 mill. There are reports on several other mines in British Columbia, the
Lucky Girl in Tuscarora, Nevada, and the Silver Bell in Montana. The Lucky Girl
was owned by the Montana Mining Company and the reports include most financial
aspects of the operations over eight years. The payroll records and invoices
for the Drumlummon are incomplete but provide insight into the costs of running
a mine. They also include crucial information about workers and the division of
labor in the mines. The information on expenses and assets is very useful for
understanding the difficulties of financing mining. The information is
particularly detailed for the era between 1883 and 1907. There are detailed
descriptions of the costs of individual shafts, mills, and payroll. The order
books contain detailed records for all the goods required for the years from
1887 to 1897 and the orders for the Rose Densmore mine for 1890. The delivery
book contains information for goods delivered from 1889 to 1897. There are
folders containing information on tax assessments of the mines from 1888 to
1933 and the Federal Census of Mines for 1926 to 1933. There are a few
insurance documents relating to death benefits for a miner and a fire insurance
policy from 1913. There are also reports of equipment for the Marysville
Electric Light and Water Company.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains materials related to the governance of both
the Montana Mining Company and the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company. The
material is primarily focused on official company correspondence, decisions,
and records. The bulk of material is concentrated in the period from 1911 to
1933 and the control of the Drumlummon by the St. Louis Mining and Milling
Company. The information includes reports from the Board of Directors, cable
reports from the Montana Mining Company, mining reports from outside experts,
mine superintendent reports, and the letters and reports of the corporate
officers of the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company. Bondholder and
Stockholder records and letters represent the majority of the material in the
series. The divisive struggles that plagued the mine after the St. Louis Mining
and Milling Company took control of the property are clearly documented here.
The fight to raise money for mine improvements and to fend off bankruptcy can
be traced in the letters and reports. These letters and reports contain
requests for share assessments, candid evaluations of the company's financial
situation, and accusations of mismanagement from various stockholder factions.
The reports from the secretary of the Montana Company are generally quarterly
earnings statements, although there are some monthly returns and some changes
in share volume and working capital. Most of the officers' material from the
St. Louis Mining and Milling Company is also related to the financial struggles
of the company beginning in 1908. The bulk of these folders contain letters to
stockholders asking for money, assessing shares, or reporting on the desperate
financial straits of the corporation. The reports from outside mining experts
candidly assess the mineral and financial opportunities available at the
Drumlummon mine at two significant points in the mine's history. The first
round of reports is from 1882 to 1885 and was used by the Montana Mining
Company to judge the value of the property prior to their initial purchase of
the mine from Thomas Cruse. The second report is from Harry Quinby criticizing
the management of the mine by St. Louis Mining and Milling superintendent
William Mayger in 1912. The superintendents' reports span nearly the entire
life of the Drumlummon from 1885 to 1929. They provide insight into the more
routine workings of the mine and the breadth of expertise required of a mine
manager. These reports also provide a more intimate overview of the workings of
the mines than the reports of the company officers. The series is rounded out
by cable reports to the London headquarters of the Montana Mining Company from
1886 to 1901 and a number of unidentified mine reports.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains material relating to the legal affairs of
both the Montana Mining Company and the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company.
The series is arranged chronologically with materials grouped in folders
according to years. The series begins with a Marysville mining claim from 1875
which is housed in an oversize box. The bulk of the remaining material relates
to the apex litigation between the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company and the
Montana Mining Company beginning in 1890 and continuing until the settlement of
the suit in 1911. The majority of documents from the case are legal briefs but
there also legal decisions, summons, injunctions, and sheriff's deeds. The
papers provide insight into the bitter legal battle for control of the mining
ground in question. This struggle resulted in the eventual victory of the St.
Louis Mining and Milling Company and the sale of the Montana Mining Company's
property at sheriff's sale in 1911. There are also briefs and other documents
relating to litigation between the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company and a
number of suppliers and employees. The documents in the series after 1911
relate to the struggle for control of the St. Louis Mining and Milling Company.
The resulting fight to keep the Drumlummon open was waged among stock and
bondholders and in court from 1911 to the closing of the mines in the 1930's.
The remainder of the series is rounded out by attorney's bills, garnishment of
wages, leases, settlements with injured workers, and an undated brief from the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This small series contains a smattering of printed materials.
There are newspaper clippings from Helena and Butte newspapers from 1924 to
1989. The majority of the articles pertain to attempts at re-opening the
Drumlummon mine. There is a folder containing undated signs relating to safety
and worker's compensation in the mine. A copy of
<title>Slater's Telegraphic Code</title> from 1870 is included here
and is useful in deciphering some of the coded telegrams sent from Marysville
to the London headquarters of the Montana Mining Company. There are reports of
the Montana Society of Civil Engineers from 1897. These include meeting
summaries and a list of all Society members in February 1897. Finally there are
printed materials with the headings of the Montana Mining Company and the
Drumlummon Provident and Accident Insurance Association. These include unused
envelopes, stationery, labor use reporting sheets for the mine and mills, and
order forms.</p>

the State Historic Preservation Office including contracts for his services and
projects he did for the Office. There are also articles on anthropological
topics and material from anthropology courses he taught including
bibliographies, exams, and lecture outlines. Some photographic material from
surveys and assessments are present, as well as field notes. He also retained

<p>This collection contains 86 glass plate negatives. The collection was apparently left by Fred Meyer with J. L. Sherburne or at the Sherburne Mercantile in Browning, Montana, possibly in 1908-1909 (though some images have later dates written on their envelopes). Although the collection is attributed to Fred Meyer, it is evident that some of the plates are copies of other photographs, and it is probable that some images were taken by other photographers. A small number of images have identification or dates written on the original negative sleeve, including identification of the subjects as Crow or Blackfoot, but it is not known who identified the images; the donor of the collection indicates the identifications may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Images 894.001 through 894.028 are 5x7 plates. Images 894.029 through 894.045 are 8x10 negatives. Images 894.046 through 894.086 are smaller (usually 4x5) and many of these are or appear to be copies.</p>

<p>This collection is comprised of correspondence and research notes for
Robert Fletcher's work on the history of the cattle industry in Montana. The
correspondence, with various officials from the USDA, deals mainly with the
publication of his books and articles on Montana. The bulk of the collection,

Historical Society. Well-organized and thorough, Fletcher's notes cover a wide
range of issues involved with the establishment of the cattle and sheep
industry in Montana. The collection also contains copies of one of Fletcher's
original manuscripts, as well as copies of a few articles by other historians
of the High Plains.</p>

settlement of Montana by cattlemen, illegal fencing of lands, interactions with
Indian inhabitants, early transportation of cattle by steamship and train, the
depredation of cattle by wolves, biographical sketches of early cattlemen, the
establishment of Indian reservations in Montana, leasing of Indian lands to
cattlemen, movement of cattle to Montana from other areas in the West, and
detailed lists of ranchers and brands. The majority of these notes are divided
by year and complied from articles from Montana newspapers such as the
<title>Daily Yellowstone Journal</title> and the

<p>This series contains Logan's personal and professional
correspondence. It mostly includes incoming correspondence, but there are
carbon copies of Logan's outgoin letters in many cases as well. The series is
arranged chronologically. The bulk of the series focuses on Logan's
education-related activities in Montana and Illinois, including the formation
and maintenance of professional organizations and necessary exchanges with
government officials to conduct business. For instance, he wrote the Missoula
County Sheriff about illegal gambling in Arlee, Montana, that affected are
schoolchildren. There are many long letters from editorial writer Quincy Sharpe
Mills and from Carleton W. Washburne, a fellow educator and military man during
World War II; he apparently carried out a long personal correspondence with
both. There are many exchanges with politicians on both educational and other
matters, including Joseph Dixon (on Roosevelt's Bull Moose campaign) Jeannette
Rankin, Thomas J. Walsh, John M. Evans, and Mike Mansfield. He exchanged many
letters with University of Montana--Missoula and Montana State University
(Bozeman) faculty, and had a strong interest in the Louis Levine case at the
University of Montana. He also continued his contact with the president and
faculty at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The correspondence
documents his active interests in religious and patriotic education, the
cooperative movement, and democracy in schools. Post-retirement letters
document his interest in promoting a Columbia Valley Authority (to be modeled
on the Tennessee Valley Authority) that include more political correspondence;'
he was also interested in water and irrigation issues on the Flathead. Some
letters are also addressed to his wife, Frances, but the series does not
include any replies from her.</p>

<p>This collection represents a large portion of the academic research
and writing career of Fred W. Voget from his undergraduate years in the 1930s
to a few years before his death in 1997. While the bulk of his research was
focused on the Crow Tribe, the collection also includes secondary source
research on numerous other North American tribes and primary source research on
the Iroquois, Shoshoni, and Blackfeet Indians. Research specific to the Crow
Tribe includes bibliographies, annotated photocopies of papers, book chapters,
and articles, interviews spanning half of century from 1939 to 1993, and
photographs from 1939 to 1987</p>

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes notes and readings on anthropology theory and
practice, bibliographies of anthropology readings, and a small amount of
anthropology research notes. Additionally, the series has reading notes and
bibliographies on a number of Native American tribes. The arbitrary arrangement
begins with general anthropology and moves into broad Native American
topics.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes bibliographies, research notes on readings,
annotated and clean copies of materials, newspaper articles, contact
information, and interview notes. The bulk of the series is Crow Indian
research, but material such as interviews with Shoshoni tribe members have been
included to duplicate Voget's synthesis of this research in his book
<title>The Shoshoni-Crow Sun Dance</title>. While the broad order of
this series is arbitrary, Voget's original card file order has been maintained.
Cards in "to be filed" groups were filed according to established categories
and notes not on cards have been inserted into separate folders according to
those same categories or topics. Groupings of interviews have been maintained
as much as possible.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes Voget's handwritten field research notebooks
on the Shoshoni, the Iroquois, the Blackfeet, and the Crow. Many parts of the
notebooks are written in shorthand. The Iroquois and Blackfeet notebooks were
transcribed in 2003 and 2004.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes a small amount of language research notes
from secondary sources, but the bulk of the series consists of handwritten and
typed cards with a word or phrase in English and the corresponding Crow word or
phrase with pronunciation markings.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes some of Voget's undergraduate papers, working
drafts of articles and book chapters, and copies of published articles. The
drafts preceded published works and probably a planned history of the Crow
Indians that was not published at the time of processing.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes Voget's photos, slides, and some negatives
taken throughout his research. The bulk of the photos chronicle Crow activities
such as the sun dance and arrow throw, feasts, and giveaways. A smaller number
of photos are of specific individuals significant to Crow history and/or
Voget's research. Another small group of photos pertain to Native American
artifacts, the Shoshoni sun dance, and to Mohawk and other Six Nations groups.
Most of the photos are very usable with the exception of photos 25/75 through
25/89, which are out of focus. Original photo captions and photo groupings were
maintained where they existed. Otherwise, the photos in this series are
arranged in rough thematic and chronological order. The slides are grouped at
the end of this series.</p>
<p>In 2012, additional or corrected information for some photographs and context about places and events was provided by Aaron Brien, a member of the Apsaalooke Nation, in consultation with other members of the Nation. This information was added with the preface [From Aaron Brien]. When a date was corrected, the correct date was placed in the date field.</p>

<scopecontent><p>The Associated Student’s Store was started in 1922 by two students. The first store was a table by the psychology building (then the Law Building). The original stock consisted of pens, pencils, and candy. The store then grew and moved into the “Shack” behind Main Hall, where the continued to sell supplies, candy, and a small concessions area with sandwiches. With the student population continuing to grow, the Associated Student’s store soon outgrew their space and moved into the basement of the present day Fine Arts building in 1937. The store was disincorporated from the university in the early 1950s, but reincorporated when University of Montana President McFarland left office.

<p>This collection is divided into four series.</p>
<p>Series I: Correspondence (1919-1985) The bulk of the correspondence is
letters to Clarice Cushman from her husband, William Cushman, when he was away
from home in the U.S. Navy during WWII, in Liberia for four years, in the Warm
Springs mental health facility in Montana, and in the Veterans Hospital in
Sheridan, Wyoming. The letters chronicle the family’s daily lives, the
centrality of religious beliefs, marital discord, and four decades of Clarice
Cushman’s attempts to find medical and education assistance for their son,
Roger Cushman, who had severe disabilities. The correspondence also includes
letters from relatives, friends and institutions, letters received by William
Cushman, and letters received by Roger Cushman.</p>
<p>Series II: Diaries and Scrapbooks (1920-1971) includes Clarice
Cushman’s diaries, that begin a few years before her marriage to William
Cushman in 1935 and end during WWII. Her sometimes daily brief entries reveal
her daily activities, social contacts, and later interactions with her husband.
The more sporadic entries in William Cushman’s diaries describe his work and
include one lengthier examination of his feelings about his marriage and his
wife while they are apart. Clarice Cushman’s scrapbook (1920-1925) contains
photos and memorabilia of her school years beginning in high school and ending
when she is awarded a teaching certificate. The other two scrapbooks of local
music and school events may have been done as an exercise with the Cushman’s
son, Roger.</p>

bank records and some daily and weekly income and expenditure lists.</p>
<p>Series IV: Miscellaneous (1918-1974) consists of memorabilia from high

<p>James H. Morley's daily dairy accounts from 1862-1865 begin with his
trip to Montana from St. Louis, Missouri, onboard a steamer up the Missouri
River. It continues with his group's two week journey from Fort Benton to their
camp and mining site on Gold Creek, between what is now Drummond and Deer
Lodge, Montana, with supply loaded wagons. From that point his diary entries
describe the day's shaft or sluice mining efforts, reports from group members
who had traveled to other possible mining sites, and descriptions of his own
travels around Hellgate Canyon and into Rock Creek, then on to Beaverhead,
Flint Creek, Wisdom River, the Big Hole prairie, and back up to Deer Lodge
Creek. By January 1863 Morley and his team had ranged as far east in Montana as
the Gallatin and Three Forks areas. Also in January Morley noted the results of
a trial of Plummer, probably the infamous Harry Plummer, one year before that
man was hung by vigilantes without a trial. Morley briefly describes his own
contact with justice as a juror in a trial of accused murderer Bill Mitchell.
</p>
<p>Over the next two years Morley sometimes described the daily drudgery
of mining work but also mining claim disputes, planning and charting a plat map
for Centreville, wildlife and geological features, scouting for and staking new
claims, difficulties of sending and receiving mail, and the mining towns of
Bannack and Virginia City, Montana. His daily entries end with his return to
St. Louis in August, 1865.</p>

<p>John Well-Off-Man's Collection of Photographs contains 109 images of people and events on the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation. The photographs were taken during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Well-Off-Man collected these images from Paul Mitchell, an elder from Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, as part of his research into the history of the Rocky Boy Reservation. Well-Off-Man made copy negatives from Mitchell's nitrate negatives.</p>
<p>A portion of the images in this collection have brief descriptions written on them, though it is not clear by whom. Almost all the images are undated and many currently lack identification of the individuals in them. Most are of Cree and Ojibwe (Chippewa) people. While the images in the collection come from several sources, the majority were likely taken by John Gable, the son of William Gable who was the Lutheran Pastor on the Rocky Boy Reservation in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. As a graduate student at the Philadelphia Seminary in the 1930s, John Gable was also responsible for a number of film productions including "Rocky Boy Mission In Action," a 1935 film about the Lutheran Mission on the Rocky Boy Reservation. While it is unclear whether the photos in this collection are associated with Gable's documentary project, the content of the images suggest that there is a connection between the two. According to Well-Off-Man other images were taken by Florence Bruckner.</p>

materials, artifacts and memorabilia, microfilm, audiovisual material, photographs,
and electronic records produced throughout Baucus’s time in the Montana House of
Representatives, the United States House of Representatives, the Senate, and

obituaries following the death of Baucus’s stepfather, John Baucus, and
correspondence between Jean Baucus and Ruth Chambers. Chambers was the
sister of Max Baucus’s biological father, Stephen Enke, and the
correspondence took place between Jean Baucus and Chambers following
Enke’s death in 1974. The series also contains a Baucus family tree and
family recipes.</p>

<p>This series contains material relating to Max Baucus’s time in the Montana
House of Representatives. It includes press files, bills which were
sponsored or cosponsored by Baucus, voting records, and subject files.
Subject files constitute the majority of this series, and consist of
documents created and kept by Baucus and his staff during the course of
their legislative work. Materials contained within subject files include
correspondence, research materials, memos, notes, reports, and other related
items reflecting the pertinent political and legislative issues of the time.
Staffers assigned subjects according to a topical index. This index helped
to organize many administrative functions, including legislative research,
the tracking of constituent opinion, the compilation of Baucus’s legislative
achievements, and responses to constituent concerns.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains constituent correspondence sent to Max Baucus during his
time in the U.S. House of Representatives. Reflecting a variety of topical
and legislative issues of the day, these letters provide a broad overview of
Montanans’ concerns in mid- to late 1970s America. Environment and
agriculture were two primary topics of correspondence, with many letters
focusing on grazing, agricultural subsidies, proposed legislation, and
wilderness. Central to environmental issues at the time was the passage of
the Montana Wilderness Study Act (S. 393), introduced by Senator Lee
Metcalf, which became law in 1977 and was to have profound effects on
Montana’s land and its residents. Other common areas of concern included
Panama Canal negotiations, postal matters, the Equal Rights Amendment, gun
control, labor-related legislation, and the Milwaukee Railroad bankruptcy.
The majority of files are arranged alphabetically by subject, which were
assigned in accordance with an indexing system utilized in Baucus’s office
to organize, code and track constituent mail and other documents. This
series does not contain a name file.</p>

<p>Also contained within this series are form letters, mass mailings, and yellow
files. Form letters were drafted by staffers in response to issues which
generated large quantities of constituent mail—these summarized Baucus’s
position and eliminated the need to create a unique response for each
constituent. Mass mailings are mailings, often in the form of newsletters,
sent to constituents on a regular or semi-regular basis. These provided
updates on pending legislation, Baucus’s legislative and political
activities, information on upcoming events, and sometimes included
questionnaires and surveys. Yellow files consist of responses to
constituents printed on yellow carbon paper, which are arranged
alphabetically by constituent last name. This series also includes 9 reels
of microfilm, containing scans of constituent correspondence from 1976.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains legislative materials relating to Max Baucus’s time in
the U.S. House of Representatives, which present a clear view of the
legislative process from start to finish. These files outline the scope and
extent of Baucus’s legislative work throughout his first two terms in
Congress, generated and gathered by both Baucus and his staffers. Such work
included policy research and development, correspondence and collaboration
with members of Congress and other stakeholders, Committee hearings and
deliberations, gathering and collating data, and drafting and editing
legislation.</p>

<p>This subseries contains material profiling Baucus’s collaborative and
individual legislative work and viewpoints. It contains legislative
correspondence, typically consisting of correspondence between Baucus
and other members of Congress intended to generate support for or
opposition to legislation, initiatives, and issues. VIP
correspondence—correspondence with well-known or prominent figures—is
also included, as well as correspondence with the standing U.S.
President. Also included are hearing statements, prepared remarks
delivered by Baucus in Committee hearings, and voting records from the
94th and 95th Congresses.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains materials generated by Baucus’s Committee service
during his time in the House of Representatives. Baucus served on the
House Committee on Appropriations for the entirety of his two terms in
the House, and the majority of materials contained within this subseries
relate to Committee work undertaken by Baucus and his staffers relating
to investigations, hearings, legislation, nominations, and other
projects. Also included in this subseries are committee assignment
materials and files relating to the Committee for a More Active and
Effective Congress, a liberal political action committee founded by
Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries is comprised of records which outline all aspects of
legislative research, development, and implementation. File types
include, but are not limited to, memos, correspondence, reports,
publications, legal briefs, invitations, and legislative drafts. Subject
files give a clear indication of the predominant issues which directed
Baucus and his staffers’ work. Rural issues—particularly post offices
and rural health—ranked high on the list, in addition to President
Carter’s zero-based budgeting mechanism for government planning.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains scanned Dear Colleague letters, floor statements,
hearing statements, and memos. The analog versions of these documents,
along with many other types of documents produced by Baucus’s office,
were scanned by staffers and converted to digital formats for storage in
the office’s document management system, OnBase. Many OnBase files were
duplicated or scattered during the transfer process from Baucus’s office
to the University of Montana, and the majority of the files in this
subseries have subsequently been rearranged by category and renamed to
clarify their content, due to a lack of adequate original description.
Dear Colleague letters and memos files reflect only a small portion of
their analog counterparts, whereas floor and hearing statements files
represent a near-complete replication of their analog counterparts.
While it is likely that many of the files in this subseries are
reflected in the manuscript portion of this series, exact correlations
have not been fully established.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains administrative records from Max Baucus’s time in the
U.S. Senate, relating specifically to Washington, D.C. and district office
operations. Such records reveal the wide range of activities that regularly
occur in a Congressional office, particularly those related to legislative
research, scheduling, and handling the large volume of constituent mail.
They also point to the high turnover of legislative staffers and the fast
pace of legislative activity, as well as the subsequent need for detailed
training materials and a high level of communication.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains materials reflecting the administrative capacity
of a congressional office, and include a number of academy appointments,
requests for appointment to military service academies that were
ultimately successful. These files are not exhaustive; records of
academy appointees are maintained by the academies themselves. Also
contained within this subseries are a run of ‘Thank you Good Letters’,
letters sent to Max Baucus expressing appreciation for speaking
engagements, constituent assistance, support of various issues, and
other services provided. Such letters were identified and retained by
staffers for campaign and legislative record purposes. Friendly File
cards likewise record constituents willing—or potentially willing—to
assist in fundraising, canvassing, volunteering, and other supportive
efforts. Additional administrative files include mail reports, indexes
and filing keys, conference-planning materials, memos, invitations,
staff training manuals and guides, and trip files. In addition to
scheduling materials, trip files contain a myriad of documents including
memos, background information on people and places, and drafts of
prepared remarks. Of particular note in this subseries are those records
pertaining to the Montana Economic Development Summit, a recurring event
focusing on Montana jobs and the economy established by Max Baucus in
2000.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries, while similarly reflecting the administrative functions
of a Congressional office, is comprised of schedules and related
documents which outline Baucus’s daily agendas. These documents provide
great insight into the day-to-day activities of a member of Congress, as
well as the high level of planning and meticulous attention to detail
required by staffers to plan activities and maintain adherence to
scheduled activities. They include specific times, locations,
transportation information, background information on both issues and
people, and other useful contextual information.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains born-digital administrative records from Baucus’s
time in the Senate, records which were created in an electronic format.
These files act as a foil to analog administrative records, serving as
the digital footprint of administrative functions within Baucus’s
office. In addition to such day-to-day administrative material as
calendars, forms, call reports, and manuals, this subseries also
contains indexes of paper records sent to National Records Centers in
Denver, Colorado and Suitland, Maryland for preservation. Also included
are inventories of records which were created in preparation for their
shipment to the University of Montana.</p>

<p>Files from Baucus’s Senate website, www.baucus.senate.gov, have not been

the ways in which Baucus connected with his constituents, highlighting
prioritized topical issues and demographics.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Staffers regularly collected news clippings that mentioned or featured
Max Baucus, and those contained within this subseries document the
entirety of his career in the Senate. Scattered throughout are Max
Baucus Reports, short legislative updates and topical pieces that were
written by Baucus and published in various Montana newspapers between
1979 and 1984.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries consists of prepared statements released by Max Baucus
regarding legislation, current events, sponsored and cosponsored bills,
and other political and legislative issues of the day. It also contains
news headlines and summaries from Montana newspapers, which were filed
with some early office press releases. Beginning in March of 1993 press
releases were filed individually, with topics typed on individual folder
labels. While press releases are listed here by date, a list of these
topics is available upon request.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>It is possible to trace Max Baucus’s growing national exposure and
expertise on particular topics through this complete run of speeches and
public remarks given during his time in the Senate. Baucus gave speeches
to some groups on a regular basis, casting light on one of the ways in
which he maintained connections with important components of his base.
These included groups and events like the Montana Graingrowers
Association, the AFL-CIO, the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, the Wool
Growers Convention, the Montana Democratic Party Mansfield-Metcalf
Dinner, and high school and college commencements. We can also trace his
growing proficiency in Asian foreign affairs through the many speeches
relating to Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and especially China, focusing
particularly on trade, economic and human rights issues. For those
speeches which are untitled, file names describe the group(s) to which
Baucus spoke.</p>

spanning Baucus’s Senate career. Speeches and some press releases have
been renamed to clarify file content. While it is likely that the

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains constituent correspondence generated and received
throughout Max Baucus’s time in the U.S. Senate. Consisting of
correspondence generated by constituents, staffers, and Baucus himself, the
material in this series weaves a 35-year narrative of constituent concerns,
pressing topical issues, support for and opposition to legislation, and,
more broadly, the symbiotic relationship between Senator Baucus and his
constituents.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Constituent Correspondence contains correspondence between Montana
constituents and Max Baucus’s offices. Congressional offices undergo
high staff turnover, resulting in ever-evolving records management
systems and organizational schema. These evolutions are commonly
reflected in constituent correspondence management, given the large
volume of material, and are also affected by changes in technology. Such
was the case in Baucus’s Congressional offices, particularly with the
advent of in-house Senate computing technology in the mid-1980s.
Constituent correspondence organizational schemas have thus been pieced
together from office manuals, filing guides and computer code lists.
This subseries does not contain a name file.</p>

<p>Several unique categories of correspondence can be found in the first
fifteen boxes: ‘Dear Montana’, Form Letters, Mass Mailings, and Robo
Letters. There is no clear distinction between ‘Dear Montana’
correspondence and other constituent correspondence. Form Letters
consist of letters drafted by staffers in response to issues which had
generated large quantities of constituent mail, summarizing Baucus’s
position and eliminating the need to craft a unique response to each
constituent. Similarly, Mass Mailings are mailings--often in the form of
newsletters--sent to constituents on a regular or semi-regular basis.
These provided updates on pending legislation, Baucus’s legislative and
political activities, information on upcoming events, and sometimes
included questionnaires and surveys. All of these groupings are arranged
chronologically, with the exception of Robo Letters. Robo letters, which
date from 1980-1985, are letters generated by an early word-processing
machine known as the “ROBO” system. They consist of carbon copy letters
sent from Baucus to constituents, responding to inquiries and concerns.
Robo Letters from 1980 are arranged in alphabetical order by constituent
last name; letters from 1981-1985 are arranged chronologically.</p>

<p>As is evident in the folder titles, in-office methods of filing
constituent correspondence changed over the years. From 1979-1987,
correspondence is arranged by topics designated by an in-house filing
guide and computer code list. From 1987 through 1998, correspondence is
arranged by unique numerical identifiers assigned to each letter as it
was entered into the office’s Constituent Services System (CSS). These
numbers do not necessarily connote, however, exact chronological order,
and the dates assigned to these folders often correspond to the date on
which correspondence was entered into the CSS, rather than the date on
which a letter was written.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The second subseries, Petitions, contains mass mailings sent to Max
Baucus between 2010 and 2014. These petitions center on a number of
legislative and topical issues and were mailed by constituents to convey
collective grievances, opinions, and support for/opposition to
particular pieces of legislation. Petitions have been sampled to reduce
volume—original quantities and sampling data are available upon
request.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The third subseries consists of 799 individual reels of microfilm,
containing filmed images of constituent correspondence and mail reports
generated between 1979 and 1988. Please ask the archivist for a list of
individual reel contents.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries consists of electronic files related to constituent
services, including e-newsletters, mass mailings, scanned correspondence
and microfilm, and a smattering of in-office mail reports exported from
Microsoft Outlook dating from 2011-2013. While much of the scanned
correspondence does likely have analog surrogates, it is not wholly
representative of analog constituent correspondence held within the Max
S. Baucus Papers. Similarly, the microfilm files in this subseries
correspond to a portion of physical microfilm reels, but not all. This
subseries also contains data files exported from Constituent Services
Systems (CSS), large-scale databases that manage the relationship
between a member of Congress and their constituency. These systems
facilitated a variety of activities related to constituent relations,
including scheduling, correspondence and casework management, and
document management. Baucus’s offices utilized a proprietary program
called Intranet Quorum (IQ) from the mid-1990s to 2008, and VOICE from
2008 to 2014.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains material relating to Max Baucus’s legislative work in
the U.S. Senate, encompassing policy research and development, legislation
sponsorship and co-sponsorship, Senate votes, correspondence on legislative
matters, and committee work. It provides a comprehensive overview of
Baucus’s voting habits, relationships with his colleagues in Congress and
other significant stakeholders, legislative priorities, and leadership roles
in the Senate.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains the text of bills and resolutions sponsored or
cosponsored by Baucus, and do not constitute a complete run. All
sponsored and cosponsored bills can be found online at the U.S.
Congress’ website. Legislative Activities are federal compendiums of all
sponsored and cosponsored bills but include summaries of the bills
rather than the full text.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains floor statements, remarks given by Baucus on the
Senate floor. While floor statements are listed here by Congress, they
are also foldered individually by statement topic. Please ask an
archivist for an inventoried list of individual floor statement
topics.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The Congressional Profile contains material which, as the title implies,
outlines the scope and nature of Baucus’s legislative work while serving
in the Senate. It includes hearing statements, “Dear Colleague” and
other legislative correspondence, briefing books, and legislative
strategy materials. “Dear Colleague” correspondence traditionally
consists of letters sent to and from other members of Congress
requesting support for or against legislation, explaining policy
stances, or urging other legislative actions. The “Dear Colleague”
correspondence in this collection does consist primarily of such
letters, though this category also contains other, less formalized
correspondence between members of Congress, including handwritten and
signed notes and letters on official letterhead. “Dear Official/VIP” is
a Baucus office designation, applied to correspondence to and from
federal officials, ambassadors, executives, and other designated
important administrators. “Dear President” letters consist of letters
sent from Baucus, and sometimes colleagues, to the sitting president
requesting support or urging specific action on executive matters.</p>

<p>Legislative Strategy material contains files laying out legislative plans
and strategies for upcoming Congresses, legislation, or issues. Briefing
books are materials gathered by staffers to prepare Max Baucus for
various trips, public appearances, hearings, meetings, and other events.
They contain background information regarding people he would be meeting
or speaking with, pieces of legislation, companies and cities, answers
to tough questions he might encounter, and any other necessary
preparatory material.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Voting records were produced by four distinct entities: the Congressional
Research Service, the Democratic Policy Committee, various interest
groups, and Baucus’s office itself. While no one grouping contains a
complete run of Baucus’s Senate voting record, together they provide a
comprehensive overview of his voting habits and record. Whereas
materials produced by both the Congressional Research Service and the
Democratic Policy Committee provide a fairly straightforward,
quantitative record of Baucus’s Senate votes, those generated by
interest groups and Baucus staffers tend to be more interpretative.
Interest group voting records examined how Baucus voted in regards to
particular issues, and were often a good gauge of support in various
topical areas. Some voting records produced by Baucus staffers also
focused on particular issues, though they served a variety of other
purposes: tracking Baucus’s support (via votes) of particular
constituencies, bolstering campaign claims, and analyzing his overall
legislative record for future planning purposes. The most recent
document was authored in 2018 by a former staff member, Spencer Gray,
and provides a comprehensive summary of Baucus’s legislative
accomplishments.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Baucus’s service on various congressional committees and subcommittees
during his time in the Senate is the basis for the third subseries,
Committee Files. While official congressional committee records must
remain in the care of the committee itself, the congressional office
records contained within this subseries were generated during work
undertaken by Baucus and his staffers relating to committee
investigations, hearings, legislation, nominations, and other projects.
Significant within this subseries are committee records generated during
Baucus’s tenure as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, in
addition to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works records
regarding the asbestos environmental disaster in Libby, Montana. Baucus
served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance on three separate
occasions: January 3, 2001-January 20, 2001; June 6, 2001-November 22,
2002; and January 4, 2007-February 6, 2014. He also served as Chairman
of the Committee on Environment and Public Works from January 3,
1993-December 1, 1994.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Subject files consist of materials generated by Baucus and his staffers
during the course of legislative and administrative work. These records,
filed by subject, present perhaps the clearest view of legislative work
in Congress, outlining all aspects of legislative research, development
and implementation. They also illuminate the complex web of relations on
Capitol Hill, outlining the ways in which Baucus and his staff worked
together as well as with other members of Congress, Congressional
staffers, federal employees, public officials, and constituents. Given
the level of detailed description and arrangement, this subseries serves
as a useful tool with which to both trace trending topical issues of the
day and determine legislative priorities for Baucus and his staffers.
Trade, agricultural, and environmental issues are consistently
significant, as are postal services and rural health. File types
include, but are not limited to, memos, correspondence, reports,
publications, legal briefs, invitations, white papers, and legislative
drafts.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Libby files are comprised of materials pertaining to the asbestos-based
environmental disaster which came to light in Libby, Montana in the late
1990s. Max Baucus was instrumental in advocating for the rights of Libby
citizens affected by the asbestos crisis, and pushed for the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to declare a Public Health
Emergency in Libby, the first time that the agency ever did so. He also
cosponsored several pieces of legislation related to asbestos injury
compensation and environmental cleanup. This subseries includes material
related to this legislation as well as the 2005 Department of Justice
criminal proceedings against W.R. Grace and Company, W.R. Grace’s 2007
bankruptcy proceedings, asbestos litigation reform, the EPA
investigation, Libby’s Superfund designation, and asbestos-related
health programs and initiatives.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Documents generated by staffers in the course of their work as
legislative assistants, legislative correspondents, mailroom
specialists, and other legislative and administrative roles in Max
Baucus’s offices constitute the eighth subseries, Staff Files. These
materials focus primarily on particular topical subjects and
legislation, correlating with staffers’ area(s) of expertise. While most
materials were generated in the course of a singular staffer’s work,
some were created by multiple staffers as indicated by initial
inventories accompanying the files.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries consists of electronic records documenting all aspects of
legislative work conducted by Max Baucus and his staffers throughout his
time in the Senate. It contains briefing books, unofficial committee
files, floor statements, hearing statements, legislative correspondence,
memos, and a small selection of sponsored and cosponsored bills, staff
files, and subject files. Of particular note are Senate Committee on
Finance materials, as Baucus was Chairman and/or ranking member for 12
of the 35 total years he served on the Committee. These materials
consist of Finance Chairman letters, press clips, press releases, and
hearing statements. Files also include hearing statements from Baucus’s
other committee work, memos, subject files, voting record materials, and
a number of staff files. Some files and folders have been renamed to
better reflect their contents. While it is likely that many of these
files are reflected in the manuscript portion of this series, exact
correlations have not been fully established.</p>

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>These files were generated during Max Baucus’s first campaign for public
office in 1972, when he ran for a seat in the Montana House of
Representatives. They contain candidate statements and press materials,
in addition to some campaign ephemera.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries is comprised of materials from Max Baucus’s two House

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Materials from Max Baucus’s six campaigns for election to the Senate
constitute the third subseries. The groundwork for Baucus’s political
campaigns was often laid two years in advance, and involved a great
number of campaign staff, volunteers, canvassers, fundraisers, and
political consultants. Files include campaign press materials, circulars
and brochures, memos, debate preparatory materials, voter surveys and
polls, endorsements, election results, and campaign ephemera.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Materials in this subseries consist of audio and video recordings
documenting Baucus’s House and Senate campaigns. Contents include
campaign advertisements, radio spots, interviews, inauguration
activities, campaign events, and debates. A great deal of the magnetic
tape and film reels have little to no accompanying description, and
largely appear to contain short audio and video clips recorded for use
in campaign advertisements. Particularly noteworthy in this subseries
are Baucus family videos from 1955, presumably utilized for campaign
ads.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This subseries contains results from Max Baucus’s 2000 campaign
primaries, as well as campaign files from Max Baucus’s Senate run in

<p>This collection includes both bound and unbound correspondence,
construction and expense reports, financial ledgers, right-of-way descriptions
and maps, activity logs, publicity materials (including photographs and film
reels), and personnel records created by employees of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company and its subsidiary lines between the years 1870 and
1968--though materials are predominantly from the late 1880s through the early
1940s.</p>
<p>The Northern Pacific Railway Records present an extensive and detailed
resource for researching railroad corporate management structures, land
ownership histories for railroad associated properties (particularly in North
Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington state), economic impacts created by
railroad construction and repair, corporate investment into raw material
production for cheap construction supplies (particularly timber), and NPRR
marketing strategies spanning a period of dramatic social and economic change
in the American West. Correspondence records in this collection provide
significant insights into prevailing railroad management structures during the
late 19th and early 20th Centuries--when the rail industry dominated the
social, economic, and political realms of rural American life. As was common
during the time period, NPRR field operation managers were required to be
technical experts as well as administrators. The records generated and/or
compiled by the railroad's engineering staff reveal this complex balance of
designing construction projects, scheduling traffic flows, and managing
day-to-day operations. Rights-of-way documents, property maps, and construction
drawings form a uniquely valuable resource for researching individual real
estate histories and large-scale settlement patterns. The financial records in
this collection provide detailed accounts of occupations and pay schedules for
railroad personnel, the corporation's purchases of construction materials and
sundry supplies (often specific to individual stations), and freight volumes
carried from the region to national markets. The NPRR promotional department
records in this collection preserve sometimes overt and often subtle techniques
intended to both create and reinforce the railroad's preferred images of life
in the Rocky Mountain West and Pacific Northwest. These promotional materials
form a particularly interesting body of evidence for comparison and contrast
with perceptions presented by contemporary regional literatures as well as the
department's focus on highlighting agricultural abundance during periods of
drought and farm foreclosures.</p>
<p>Materials in this collection were predominantly generated or compiled
by engineering and promotions personnel. For the most part, engineering
department recording procedures are consistent; however, the materials in
sub-group 2 were generated by subsidiary and associated rail lines that reflect
widely varrying recording policies and project goals. Additionally, NPRR
engineers tended to move frequently, causing some degree of discontinuity.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This subgroup contains materials generated by employees of the
Engineering Department of the Northern Pacific Railway's primary rail lines.
Series III through XX contain records generated by the geographic divisions the
railway established for hierarchial management (largely defined by state
borders and more localized spurs). Series I and II contain records related to
constructing and managing the primary lines spanning these geographic
divisions. Materials primarily consist of records generated or compiled by NPRR
Engineering Department managers (usually identified as "chief engineer,"
"assistant engineer," or "engineer in charge") regarding property acquistions,
construction projects, repair work, station activities, line traffic,
production numbers from subsidiary operations, and general management.</p>
<p>These materials provide significant primary resources for
examining railroad corporate management structures, land ownership histories
for properties associated with the main railroad lines and spurs, regional and
localized economic impacts created by railroad construction and repair, and
cycles of railroad investment into timber harvesting as a source for cheap
construction materials. Information in this series is primarily presented
through general correspondence, bound financial ledgers, compiled tracking
reports and narrative summaries, blue print diagrams and maps, and day books
maintained by unidentified railroad staff. Throughout this subgroup the phrase
"Force Reports" in folder titles refers to reports filed by line engineers
regarding actual and projected personnel hours (work force) for construction
and repair projects.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series includes materials related to constructing and
managing the NPRR's primary rail line, with particular attention to the Montana
and Idaho legs. This series is further divided into nine subseries highlighting
some of the most intensive construction projects--such as line changes,
tunnels, and re-gradings. Construction planning correspondence, cost estimates,
material requisitions, progress summaries, work force reports, billing records,
rights-of-way documents, and design diagrams predominate the series. These
materials form an extensive record of the railroad's contributions to and
impacts upon the region over nearly 100 years. Construction records provide
detailed accounts of local and imported supplies, work force numbers and pay
schedules, large- and small-scale landscape transformations, and land ownership
patterns.</p>
<p>This series also contains a few daily logs of station activities
and line traffic, providing insights into the railroad's role within rural
communities. Additionally, the series includes several folders of collected
speeches and writings. None of the speeches in this series are attributed to an
author and they appear to be intended for delivery to local civic groups. Most
speeches are accompanied by newspaper articles and pamphlets--apparently
research sources. The speeches and writings sequence includes a few brief
histories of the Northern Pacific line and the communities along its routes.
These histories are written from the perspective of the Northern Pacific (such
that the history of a place tends to begin when the railroad arrived) and
appear to be intended as light reading for passengers on cross-country trips.
The speeches and writings sequence also includes foreign language promotional
materials--mostly Eastern European languages--promoting the agricutlural
abundance of lands along the rail line.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series includes materials related to constructing and
managing the NPRR's second main rail line. As with Series I, materials in this
series exhibit particular attention to the Montana leg of the line; however,
they also include records from the Minnesota and Washington state legs. This
series is further divided into five subseries--the largest of which details
construction projects and traffic reports for the leg between Garrison and
Missoula, Montana. Survey records, construction planning correspondence, cost
estimates, material requisitions, progress summaries, work force reports,
billing records, rights-of-way documents, and design diagrams predominate the
series. Construction records detail local and imported supplies as well as work
force numbers and pay schedules. Correspondence records provide insights into
the challenges engineers faced in designing multiple river crossings due to
narrow canyons, procedures and rationales for subcontracting work projects, and
long-term operations problems (such as derailments and mud/rock slides).</p>
<p>Subseries 2, regarding the Garrison to Missoula leg, includes a
notable sequence of correspondence, encroachment agreements, and construction
designs intended to mitigate the proximity of Northern Pacific Railroad and
Milwaukee Railroad lines through narrow stretches of the Clark Fork River
valley, particularly near Bearmouth and Clinton, Montana. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series consists entirely of bound accounting records
maintained by the Main Line Office in Helena, Montana. These records are
statewide expense summaries presented through an account balance format--as
opposed to the project-by-project budgets present in the reports compiled by
field staff.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series includes bound correspondence and financial records
generated by the Chief Engineers of the Idaho Division of the Northern Pacific.
Financial records include detailed reports regarding contruction material
costs, production numbers from the Ellisport (Idaho) lumber mill, passenger
manifests, and station activities--particularly from Wallace, Idaho. These
latter records evidence the economic prominence of Wallace in the Idaho
panhandle prior to the devasting forest fires of 1910 that burned much of the
town and transformed the region's economic patterns.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series consists of correspondence and financial records
generated by the Clarks Fork and Pend d’Oreille Division, operating in western
Montana and northern Idaho. Correspondence materials primarily describe line
repair projects and traffic summaries. Financial records primarily detail
production numbers and shipments (incoming and outgoing) for the NPRR's lumber
yard in Hope, Idaho. Processed lumber from this yard was a significant source
for the railroad's construction projects throughout the region. The absence of
records after 1910 may reflect the impact of the 1910 forest fires that heavily
impacted the region.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series consists of correspondence, financial, and personnel
records generated by the Missoula Division, operating in western Montana and
northern Idaho. Correspondence materials primarily describe line construction
and repair projects as well as traffic summaries. Construction records (both
correspondence and financial journals) detail local and imported supplies as
well as project progress reports. Personnel records in this series provide
insights into the buying habits of railroad employees who used payroll vouchers
to purchase goods from the company (stations and dining cars). In addition,
this series includes a file detailing next-of-kin information for employees at
the Drummond, Montana, station and may serve as a valuable resource for
geneological studies and local history surveys.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series consists of construction correspondence and
financial records generated by the Missouri Division of the NPRR line,

<p>This series consists of correspondence, financial, personnel,
and construction records generated by the Rocky Mountain Division of the NPRR
line. The Rocky Mountain Division spanned most of Montana and this series
includes several distinct and extensive sequences of materials documenting
construction projects, management of multiple branch lines, construction
blueprints, internal and outgoing correspondence, and station histories.
Construction records (both correspondence and financial journals) detail local
and imported supplies as well as project progress reports. Many contruction
records in this series also include blueprint details for site preparation and
design. Branch lines records include Boulder, Bozeman, Camp Creek, Couer
d'Alene, Phillipsburg, Red Bluff, and Ruby Valley. This series contains
extensive blueprints for the branch lines listed above. In addition to the
branch line sequences, this series includes extensive records regarding
redesign and repair of the Missoula to Garrison leg.</p>
<p>Internal correspondence records address construction projects,
company policies, and aquisition procedures. Outgoing correspondence records
predominantly detail rights-of-way inquiries, land acquisition negotiations,
grazing leases for railroad properties, and frieght negotiations with clients.
This sequence (organized by the community or rail line closest to the
recipient) presents extensive documentation of land ownership patterns, grazing
patterns, and agricultural production numbers. Often clients compiled several
years of production numbers into a single report to bolster their requests for
frieght rate adjustments. Station and changing yard reports provide detailed
historical and contemporary accounts of design intentions, community
contributions, renovation projects, cycles of traffic volume and spur
connections, prominent managers, colorful characters associated with the
stations, and generally how the stations fit wihin the context of the larger
community. In addition, financial and personnel records in this series lend
insights into the menus offered by station cafeterias, dining cars, and work
camp cooks.</p>

<p>This series contains both unbound material and bound volumes
from various construction projects of the Northern Pacific Railway Company as
well as some materials that could not be authoritatively identified with
existing organizational series. The series is divided into ten subseries: (1)
Ainsworth Mill (BC), (2) Anacortes Improvements (Washington), (3) Butte Quarry
(Montana), (4) Columbia River Bridge No. 1, Pasco-Kennewick, (Washington), (5)
J.W. Kendrick: Minnesota/North Dakota/Montana construction, (6) Lewistown
Outside Yards (Idaho), (7) Seattle Extension, (8) Seattle Wharf Work, (9)
Superior Ore Dock (Wisconsin), and (10) Unidentified. Materials in this series
include outgoing correspondence primarily documenting construction projects
(subcontractor and vendor agreements) and transportation passes. Financial
records in this series generally present construction estimates and actual
expenses, cash books, and activity logs.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains photographs intended as a documentary
record for railway operations--such as construction projects, railroad
facilities, engines, and work conditions--though some promotional photographs
are present as well. Photographs in this series constitute a valuable resource
documenting landscapes, towns, community events, rural life, work crews, rail
infrastructures, and weather events throughout the high plains and montane
valleys of the central and western United States--as well as spanning eighty
years of dramatic physical, economic, and social change. Materials in this
series exhibit several distinct sequences of image themes. Among these are
extensive Montana bridge, station, and change yard sequences (often identified
by location or structural number but seldom both). Billings, Bozeman, Brockway,
Circle, Glendive, Lindsay, and Missoula, Montana--and their respective outlying
areas--are among the communities most significantly documented by the images in
this series.</p>
<p>Another extensive image sequence documents the possessions,
staple crops, and vistas of Mission Valley (Montana) homestead families during
the late 1920s. The Mission Valley photographs were captured for promotional
purposes, as opposed to the construction and facility images that dominate this
series. Another promotional image sequence includes produce being carried to
market. These promotional photographs were primarily intended to convey
perceptions of abundance and help the railroad sell rail accessible farm
plots.</p>
<p>The majority of materials in this series are identified and
described individually, with reference to location and date whenever such
information could be established; however, the series also includes some
grouped photographs recovered from a separated collection. Photographs
individually identified and described during original processing were assigned
identification numbers according to the year and order in which they were
processed. During reprocessing all these photographs were assigned new
reference numbers to reflect their relationship within the larger
collection--regardless of year--though the original numbers are noted in
brackets for cross-reference. </p>
<p>Photographs in boxes 396, 397, and OS1 are not individually
processed. These materials are grouped by subject following the titles imposed
upon them after they were seperated from the original collection and before
they were donated to the K. Ross Toole Archives. The conditions and purposes
under which these materials were originally separated are unknown. </p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This subgroup contains materials generated by employees of the
branch, predecessor, and subsidiary lines associated with the Northern Pacific
Railway Company. These materials were primarily generated by Engineering
Department personnel and descriptive terminology is generally consistent with
that of Subgroup 1. This subgroup consists of 37 series--most of which are
essentially small fragments of the unit's original operations records.
Materials include property acquistion correspondence, construction project
records (correspondence, financial, and legal records), progress reports, line
traffic summaries, and personnel documents.</p>
<p>These materials provide significant primary resources for
examining railroad corporate management structures, land ownership histories
for properties associated with branch and subsidiary lines as well as regional
and localized economic impacts created by railroad construction and repair.
Information in this series is primarily presented through general
correspondence, bound financial ledgers, compiled tracking reports and
narrative summaries, blue print diagrams and maps, and day books maintained by
unidentified railroad staff. Throughout this subgroup the phrase "Force
Reports" in folder titles refers to reports filed by line engineers regarding
actual and projected personnel hours (work force) for construction and repair
projects.</p>
<p>Historical and contextual information for some of the branch,
predecessor, and related rail lines in this subgroup is very limited. Whenever
possible, the scope and notes for each series identify the geographic location
of the lines and dates for incoporation into the NPRR system.</p>

<p>This subgroup consists of film and photographs produced by the
Advertising and Publicity Department of the Northern Pacific Railroad. These
materials document the landscapes and communities along the primary railway
routes and the promotional techniques employed by the railway company to
encourage both tourism and settlement in the region. Additionally, materials in
this subgroup provide interesting primary sources for comparing and contrasting
the perceptions of life in the Rocky Mountain West and Pacfic Northwest
promoted by the railroad versus those propagated by news media, agricultural
agents, and regional authors during the first half of the 20th Century.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains films produced by the railroad promotions
department targeted for Eastern and Midwestern U.S. populations and intended to
promote rail travel as the best method for viewing the physical beauty and
cultural legacy of the Rocky Mountain West and Pacific Northwest. Many of the
films portray the region as retaining the character of the "Old West" while
incorporating the conveniences of modern life. Materials in this series provide
insights into the changes and continuities of railroad advertising techniques
spanning the 1920s through the early 1940s--particularly the employment of
American Indian greeters, staging tour events at national parks and locations
of historical interest, and the promotion of company-owned dude ranches.
Additionally, these films preserve images of Rocky Mountain and Pacific
Northwest landscapes before the industrial and housing development booms of the
post-World War II period.</p>
<p>This series contains duplicate film reels for 128(LX):7,
128(LX):13, and 128(LX):18. Reels 128(LX):1, 128(LX):2, 128(LX):7, 128(LX):10,
and 128(LX):20 are color film. Only reel 128(LX):14 has sound. Reel 128(LX):15
is a copy of the original at the Oregon Historical Society.</p>
<p>All collection VHS tapes are duplicates of film reels. For each
instance of a one-to-one relationship, tapes were assigned a common reference
number to the film reel original. These tapes correspond with film reels
128(LX):11, 128(LX):12, and 128(LX):13. One VHS tape contains transfers of
several film reels. In this one instance the VHS tape was assigned a unique
reference number, 128(LX):21.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>This series includes photographs generated by the promotions
department of the railway. These photographs appear to have been intended for
promotional literature, particularly to highlight the agricultural potential of
the high plains and river valleys along Northern Pacific Railway routes. The
majority of these photographs were captured after the first major homesteading
wave in the region (1890s through 1918) and during the disastorous cycles of
high plains droughts that resulted in farm foreclosures and homesteader
emmigration (1919 through 1933). These photographs depicting agricultural
abundance and opportunity present images in marked contrast to the tenor of
agricultural studies and regional news reports during the period.</p>
<p>In addition, the photographs in this series present images of
the towns and landscapes along the railway routes during the early stages of
industrial production in the region--when the impact of railroad access is
evidenced by transformations in agricultural and timber harvesting methods as
well as the capacity of transporting high volume goods to distant markets.
Though this series contains photographs spanning the Northern Pacific line, the
images predominantly depict the farms and rail hub towns of Montana and Idaho
during the 1920s and 1930s. Also included are some documentary images of
Northern Pacific promotional exhibits which help to reveal additional context
for how the department used the other photographs in this series.</p>

<p>This collection contains materials reflecting the diverse interests
and activities of H. G. Merriam. Collection materials are predominantly
personal and professional correspondence as well as working copies from
Merriam's writing and editing endeavors. Significant subject categories include
Merriam's service during World War I; long involvement with the Rhodes Scholars
program; teaching and administrative activities at the university in Missoula;
founding, editing, and leadership contributions to the
<title>Frontier and Midland</title> journal; and activities to help
create and guide the Montana Institute of the Arts.</p>
<p>Merriam was one of the seminal figures in fostering the literary
traditions of Montana as well as the Northern Rocky Mountain region. Materials
in this collection provide significant insights into the personal and
professional relationships among literary and performance artists, academic
leaders, politicians, and art patrons throughout the 20th Century, a period of
tremendous cultural change regarding the mass distribution of popular culture
materials and the western states' transition from cultural depository into a
nationally recognized resource for arts and literature.</p>
<p>Materials in the Rhodes Scholars series lend first-hand insights into
the infancy of the program and long-term efforts to retain a collegial approach
in selecting new participants. The University of Montana series reveals the
inner-workings of an institution transformed by the demographic, political, and
cultural changes that occurred in the United States during the 20th Century. A
particularly significant portion of this series documents activities
surrounding Merriam's dismissal from the university in 1939, one of many
academic freedom controversies that occurred around this time. The
<title>Frontier and Midland</title> is recognized as the first regularly
published literary anthology for Montana and the Northern Rocky Mountain
region. Materials in the series record Merriam's commitment to establishing and
promoting standards for folklore collection, editing, source acknowledgement,
and publication. The series includes numerous sequences of correspondence
between Merriam and many of the most influential figures in Montana and Western
literature. The Montana Institute of the Arts series documents the founding and
development of a significant grassroots arts and humanities program in the
state. The Writings and Writings of Others series provide insights into
Merriam's multi-faceted literary projects as well as his influence on
contemporaries. The Photograph series includes a wealth of materials
documenting the activities, gatherings, and publications of the Montana
Institute of the Arts and other aspects of Merriam's career.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series includes an assortment of material reflecting H.G.
Merriam's early experiences, family activities, and personal interests.
Biographical materials include a first grade report card from 1890, an early
letter of recommendation written by Merriam's high school principal, draft
resumes, testimonials, and a eulogy. Also included is an undated caricature of
H. G. Merriam that was likely produced for a yearbook section. Clippings from
various periods of Merriam's life lend insight into his professional activities
and personal interests as well as his attention to family and friends. A small
selection of financial and legal documents detail matters ranging from
Merriam's personal book holdings to his charitable gifts, from family budgets
to his first wife's final will and testament. This series also contains an
undated proposal to construct a public mall at the intersection of Higgins and
Broadway avenues in Missoula, Montana, including an architectural drawing
drafted by Merriam.</p>

acceptance to graduate study programs, and organization of various writers'
conferences. Prominent correspondents include federal elected officials, state
political leaders, university presidents, nationally and regionally renowned
authors, scientists, and significant figures in literary criticism. Among these
correspondents are U.S. Senators Joseph Dixon, Mike Mansfield, James Murray,
Thomas Walsh, and Burton Wheeler of Montana as well as university presidents C.
Valentine Boyer of the University of Oregon, Dexter Keezer of Reed College,

Dorothy Johnson, Frank Bird Linderman, John Lomax, Norman MacLean, Archibald
MacLeish, Ogden Nash, Theodore Spencer, Mildred Walker, and Robert Penn Warren
as well as scientists Albert Einstein and Edwin Hubble.</p>
<p>General correspondence after 1954 is predominantly editorial
exchanges between Merriam and budding authors. Most of these authors were
Montana citizens seeking first-time publication of articles, short stories, or
historical novels; however, these materials also include a few authors from
other western states. Merriam's extensive correspondence with Lucia Mirrielees
provides significant insight into their friendship and how Merriam helped to
nurture her career as a writer and teacher at the University of Iowa's Bread
Loaf School, Stanford University, and the University of Montana. Materials
regarding
<title>Montana, The Magazine of Western History</title> include
several extended exchanges that provide interesting insights into the
management and mission of a fledgling regional historical literature magazine.
Some of these topics include a political imbroglio surrounding Senator Richard
Neuberger's service on the Regional Board of Editors, organizational debates
regarding the role of various advisory boards in editorial decision-making, and
controversies generated by Michael Kennedy during his tenure as Editor.</p>
