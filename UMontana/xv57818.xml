      <p>Carling Malouf was born in Fillmore, Utah, in 1916. In 1940, he
		  graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business and economics from the
		  University of Utah. As an undergraduate, Malouf worked on an archaeological dig
		  in central Utah, which compelled him to obtain a master’s degree in
		  anthropology at the University of Utah. While working on his master’s, Malouf
		  met his wife Arline, and the couple was married in 1941. </p>
      <p>Wartime military service during WWII interrupted Malouf’s work on a
		  doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University. During his service, the
		  couple moved to various posts and stations in Utah, California, and Arizona. In
		  1946, Malouf was able to resume his doctoral studies at Columbia and he
		  graduated 2 years later. Shortly after graduation in 1948, Malouf was offered a
		  faculty position at The University of Montana in Missoula and he, Arline, and
		  their four young children returned to the west. </p>
      <p>While at the University of Montana, Carling Malouf played large role
		  in the development of the departments of Anthropology and Native American
		  Studies, and was chair of the department of Anthropology from 1969-1977. Malouf
		  was an avid researcher in the fields of Archaeology, Ethnology, and Native
		  American Studies. His primary research interests included Native American
		  tribes of Montana, the Plains, and the greater Northwest, comparative
		  ethnology, and archaeological sites in Montana, including Fort Owen. Malouf’s
		  involvement in anthropology and archaeology also extended outside of the
		  University system. He was a supporter and a member of the board of directors of
		  the Montana Archaeological Society, an organization devoted to promoting
		  research and public involvement in archaeology in the state of Montana. Malouf
		  contributed many articles to the Society’s publication, “Archaeology in
		  Montana”, from the years 1959-2000. Malouf was also involved in the development
		  of the Head Start program. In 1960, he was a member of the Montana Child
		  Welfare Committee, a group that made periodic reports to the White House
		  regarding the state of education and youth in Montana. He became a consultant
		  in Anthropology for Project Head Start for the Office of Economic Opportunity.
		  In 1969, Malouf, along with 150 other education specialists, was invited to the
		  White House to a conference for the development of the Head Start Program.
		  Later, he and his wife toured reservations in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming to
		  provide information and ideas to administrators for the new programs. </p>
      <p>Malouf retired from the University of Montana in 1988 and was honored
		  that same year at the Montana Archaeological Society’s Annual Conference.
		  Following his retirement, Malouf continued to do research and publish
		  articles. Carling Malouf died in March of 2007 at the age of 90. </p>

      <p>The collection contains recordings of seven oral history interviews with Carling Malouf.
		  The interviews were conducted under the direction of University of Montana
		  Professor G. G. Weix by Department of Anthropology graduate students Sharon
		  Small and Betty Matthews in 2004 at Malouf’s home. The interviews were originally recorded on Mini DV, and were then copied to VHS tape. </p>
