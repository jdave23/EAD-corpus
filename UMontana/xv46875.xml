      <p>The post-World War II demand for telephones far exceeded the Bell
		  System's capabilities, particularly in rural areas. Lake County, Montana,
		  residents were not alone in the 1940s when, sparked by growing awareness of the
		  importance of telephones in everything from business to family safety, they
		  formed the Lake County Telephone Reorganization Committee to research and
		  create a cooperative telephone company. S.R. Logan, secretary of the group,
		  wrote letters to neighbors requesting their support, to government agencies
		  requesting information on cooperative telephone companies and equipment
		  availability, and to Montana officials seeking their advice, backing, or
		  permission on various parts of the telephone project. Logan solicited the
		  support of agricultural organizations as the committee hoped to use existing
		  water and power installations to facilitate the installing of telephone lines.
		  Logan also worked to include women's organizations in the telephone campaign.
		  The information in this collection suggests that the committee amassed
		  substantial support, but no document or letter relates the final outcome. Other
		  sources indicate that many of the first attempts to establish telephone
		  cooperatives failed but later efforts succeeded in the 1950s.</p>

      <p>The first folder contains correspondence from October 2, 1947 through
		  September 10,1948, much of which was generated by S.R. Logan in his capacity as
		  secretary of the Lake County Telephone Reorganization Committee, a few letters
		  by Ray Sprague, chairman of the same group, and responses from individuals,
		  government agencies, and businesses. The second folder contains items dated
		  from January1946 to February 1948 that include legal documents, research on
		  telephone associations, minutes of meetings, and expense records. The third
		  folder contains polling or survey forms, used in March 1948 to determine the
		  level of support on specific questions such as whether or not greatly expanded
		  telephone service was needed and if telephone lines should be installed on
		  power poles. The survey forms were sent to individuals, groups, and
		  businesses.</p>
