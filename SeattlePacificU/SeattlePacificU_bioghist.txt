<p>Cascade College of Portland, Oregon, was incorporated as North Pacific Evangelistic Institute on June 19, 1918. In 1929 the name changed to Portland Bible Institute and in 1939 to Cascade College. Members of the founding Board of Trustees were Lurana Terrell, President of the Board; Alexander Beers, Vice President; Catherine L. Dickey, Secretary; Byron Morris, Treasurer; Lewis I. Hadley, Dean; and Marietta Lewis, Marion George, Marion Cook, and Robert Brymer. The first day of classes was October 1, 1918. Four students were enrolled: Marion Cook, his wife Libbie Cook, Ruth Piggot, and Pearl Boatwright. By the second year, 23 students were registered. The first teachers were Lewis Hadley and Erma Cook.</p>
<p>The Presidents of Cascade College were: Lewis I. Hadley, Founder and Dean, 1918-1922; Edward Mott, President, 1922-1933; Clarence J. Pike, 1933-1956; Edison Habegger, 1956-1960; Earl P.
