      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Abraham Hanson was an English-born American pastor and diplomat. Hanson was born in 1818
        and was educated near Bromley in South Yorkshire. He moved to the United States to become a
        pastor in the Methodist Episcopal Church, serving in parishes in Aurora, Illinois, Chicago,
        Milwaukee and Racine, Wisconsin. He left the ministry in 1851 due to poor health and
        relocated to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he became involved in local politics and was elected
        city treasurer for several terms. In May 1862, he became a U.S. Commercial Agent in Liberia.
        In 1863, he was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to become the first U.S. Commissioner
        and Consul-General to Liberia. In 1866, Hanson became ill with fever. He died on July 20,
        1866, and was buried in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.</p>
