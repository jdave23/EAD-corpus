         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Bailey Willis (1857-1949) was a geological engineer who worked for the U.S. Geological
            Survey. He was born in New York and studied at Columbia University, earning degrees in
            mechanical and civil engineering. In 1879, he began working with the Northern Pacific
            Railroad, under the direction of Raphael Pumpelly, and surveyed regions of Appalachia
            and the Northwestern U.S. He visited Mt. Rainier in 1882, and later contributed to its
            designation as a National Park. </p>
         <p>Willis began working for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884, spending the next decade
            working and researching in the Appalachian Mountains and throughout the eastern U.S. His
            publications on the region's geology garnered international attention from scientists.
            In 1903, he led an expedition funded by the Carnegie Institution to northern China, an
            area previously unexplored by geologists. He also traveled and mapped geology throughout
            South America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Later in his career he lectured at
            Johns Hopkins and Stanford, retiring from teaching in 1922. He remained an active
            explorer and geologist, however, until his death in 1949.</p>
         <p>Willis married Altona Grinnell in 1882; the couple had one child before she died in
            1896. Willis remarried in 1898 to Margaret Baker. They had three children.</p>
         <p>This historical note is drawn from Eliot Blackwelder's biographical memoir "Bailey
            Willis: 1857-1949," published by the National Academy of Sciences in 1961.</p>
