         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>The correspondence between Martha and Paul D. Simpson, an African American couple from
            Virginia, spans their time spent earning teaching degrees (1948-1952) and details not
            only their personal lives, but also discusses work, religion, race, and their education.
            The couple eventually married. The letters document daily life, their relationship, and
            their struggles in school, life and on the job market. Paul sometimes refers to Martha
            as "Booker" or "Cherie." Martha often calls Paul "Button."</p>

                  <p>The correspondence between Martha Booker and Paul Simpson begins in May of 1948
                     with a letter from Martha expressing her love for Paul and hoping she can show
                     "both of you" (presumably Paul and his son, Paul Jr.) this love soon. This
                     portion of the correspondence contains only Martha's letters to Paul and
                     details her daily life, her job search, gifts purchased for Paul Jr., her
                     experience as the only "colored person present" at Mass, and her love for
                     Paul.</p>

                  <p>This portion of the correspondence covers the entirety of 1950 and includes
                     letters from both Martha and Paul. Martha details her life at school and her
                     interest in another man should Paul choose not to want her anymore. Her letters
                     are very critical of herself, her looks, and her thoughts and feelings. Paul's
                     letters describe the student life at Virginia State College, his feelings, his
                     financial support of Martha, his coursework in physics, and his photography.
                     Their correspondence from March mentions the book "Two Flappers in Paris,"
                     which Martha describes as "the story of love-making [] put in plain every day
                     English" that had been passed around the dorm for new techniques and what she
                     has learned about their own sexual relationship from it. Paul asks to borrow it
                     so he can glean from it as well. Martha also mentions an affair Paul had with
                     Edith and her feelings about that. Paul writes about a trip to Washington for
                     the meeting of the American Physical Society and how he and his professor were
                     the "only Negroes there and there were no other persons of color present with
                     the exception of one Japanese individual." In July, Martha attends summer
                     school at the Winston-Salem Teachers College, before returning to Elizabeth
                     City in the fall. In a letter dated October 17th, Martha details a new program
                     for the colleges of North Carolina and mentions that it is meant to raise the
                     standards of all colleges, to compete scholastically with any school, "negro or
                     white." Paul responds by explaining this is due to not wanting integrated
                     colleges, so "the Negro schools must be better than they were." Martha also
                     notes a "short-lived" pregnancy in November.</p>
