      <p>Azel Hull Fish was appointed pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Nyack, NY, in 1911.
        He was also a college professor during the 1930s at Tusculum College in Tennessee. He and
        his wife, Alice Graham, had one son. In the 1930s he moved to New Jersey, where he was
        headmaster of a school. He died on March 31, 1949, in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He and his wife
        are buried in San Rafael, California. Many of his relatives were based in Carpinteria,
        California, and he lived in California for a time as a youth, and traveled there for visits
        later on in life.</p>

          <p>Lantern slides (positive transparencies) measure 3 1/4 x 4 3/4 inches and are housed in
            small slide boxes within larger boxes. Boxes 1-3 have four lantern slide boxes per
            larger box. Box 4 has six lantern slide boxes. Box 5 has one lantern slide box. There
            are some broken slides but on the whole they are in good condition. Most are in
            black-and-white but there are some hand-tinted and color transparencies.</p>
