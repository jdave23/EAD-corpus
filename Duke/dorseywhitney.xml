        Minneapolis-based business law firm whose lawyers took on the pro bono cases of Bahraini
        detainees at the Guantánamo Bay detention center. The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records span the
        years 1997-2008, with the majority of the materials created between 2004 and 2008. The
        records consist largely of legal papers, news clippings, writings and correspondence
        regarding the cases of six Bahraini detainees: Jumah Al-Dossari, Abdullah Al-Nuaimi, Isa
        Al-Murbati, Salah Al-Balooshi, Adel Hajji and Salman bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, kept under
        extra-judicial detention by the U.S. military at Camp Delta, Guantánamo Bay Naval Base,
        Cuba. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G.
        Karagheuzoff took on the cases of Bahraini detainees pro bono in 2004. The records in this
        collection document the lawyers' legal motions, public campaigns and diplomatic negotiations
        for writ of habeas corpus and the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees. Many
        of these documents are also present in electronic form. The records are arranged in four
        series: Case Files, Correspondence, Publicity, and Digital Files. Acquired as part of the
        Human Rights Archive.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Dorsey and Whitney LLP is a business law firm which was founded in 1912 in Minneapolis, MN,
        where its headquarters are still located, to provide legal counseling to the First Bank of
        Minneapolis. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and
        Christopher G. Karagheuzoff, from the New York Office of the firm took on the cases of
        Bahraini Guantánamo detainees <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph> in 2004. These lawyers
        represented the Bahraini detainees until the release and repatriation of all of them by
        2008. Sullivan, Colangelo-Bryan and Karagheuzoff did not only follow the legal cases of
        their Bahraini detainees but also got involved in public activities in order to raise
        awareness about the human rights situation and abuses at the military detention center in
        Guantánamo Naval Base. They also initiated negotiations with Bahraini diplomats and
        officials regarding the release and repatriation of their clients. The team of Dorsey &amp;
        Whitney lawyers also paid a visit to Bahrain to meet with the relatives of their
        clients.</p>
      <p>Jumah Al-Dossari is a joint citizen of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia detained in December 2001
        in Pakistan, kept under arrest by the U.S. military in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and
        transferred to Camp Delta military detention center in January 2002 and eventually released
        without facing any charges in 2007. He suffered severe psychological and physical abuse both
        in Kandahar and Guantánamo. Al-Dossari attempted suicide thirteen times and went on hunger
        strikes at least twice while under extra-judicial detention at Guantánamo. His case became
        an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo naval base and detrimental
        consequences of long term solitary confinement. Al-Dossari was represented by the Dorsey
        &amp; Whitney LLP lawyer Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and he was repatriated to Saudi Arabia in
        2007.</p>
      <p>Joshua Colangelo-Bryan is a Senior Attorney at the New York office of Dorsey &amp; Whitney
        LLP. He gained his law degree in 1999 from the University of Washington School Of Law. Prior
        to working for Dorsey, Joshua served with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, where he
        participated in the prosecution of criminal cases involving war crimes and terrorism. He
        also has participated in post-conflict humanitarian aid work in the Balkans. He practices in
        the areas of complex civil litigation, employment law, and securities fraud. He also
        represents individuals and entities before federal and state agencies. He devotes a
        substantial portion of his practice to <title type="simple" render="italic">pro bono</title>
        cases, including the representation of Guantánamo Bay detainees.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records span the years 1997-2008, with the majority of the
        materials created between 2004 and 2008. The records consist largely of legal papers, news
        clippings, writings and correspondence regarding the cases of six Bahraini detainees: Jumah
        Al-Dossari, Abdullah Al-Nuaimi, Isa Al-Murbati, Salah Al-Balooshi, Adel Hajji and Salman bin
        Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, kept under extra-judicial detention by the U.S. military at Camp Delta,
        Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. </p>
      <p>A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G.
        Karagheuzoff took on the cases of Bahraini detainees <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph>
        in 2004. The records in this collection document the lawyers' legal motions, public
        campaigns and diplomatic negotiations for writ of habeas corpus and the release and
        repatriation of the Bahraini detainees, as well the surrounding issues of the Bush
        administration's responses to terrorism, the civil rights of prisoners of war, and the use
        of interrogation and torture at U.S. installations. Many of these documents are also present
        in the form of electronic files.</p>
      <p>The records are divided into four series: Case Files, Correspondence, Publicity, and
        Digital Files. The Case Files Series (nine boxes of the thirteen in the collection)
        comprises petitions, filings, documents relating to the Combatant Status Review Tribunal
        (CRST), and a wide variety of legal records regarding the six Bahrainis' and other
        concurrent Guantánamo detainee cases. The Correspondence Series includes exchanges between
        client detainees, Department of Justice officials, Bahraini diplomats and officials, U.S.
        senators and congressmen, law scholars, and colleagues of the Dorsey &amp; Whitney team
        representing the Guantánamo detainees. The letters and writings in this series cover issues
        and problems related to the legal status of Guantánamo detainees, human rights violations at
        Camp Delta, and diplomatic efforts for the release and repatriation of the Bahraini
        detainees. The high-profile case of Jumah Al-Dossari, detained in 2001 and eventually
        released without facing any charges in 2007, is covered in depth in this series, becoming an
        emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo Naval Base and detrimental
        consequences of long term solitary confinement. Also covered in depth in the Correspondence
        Series is the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment approved by the Senate on November, 15 2005, which
        prohibits all habeas corpus claims by Guantánamo detainees and allows military tribunals to
        rely on evidence gathered by the use of torture. The Publicity Series brings together news
        articles regarding Bahraini Guantánamo detainees, commentaries addressing the legal process
        and human rights issues, and interviews with Dorsey &amp; Whitney lawyers about the
        conditions at the military base and the legal and living situation of the detainees. The
        clippings in the collection were published by major news press and online media outlets
        worldwide, and include seven folders which hold many Arabic language news clippings. Many of
        the legal team's documents are also present in the form of electronic documents which are
        organized into folders described in the Digital Files Series. Also present is a
        twelve-minute unclassified audio recording on CD-R of the CRST hearing for Al-Murbati, and
        printed images of the families of the detainees. Original electronic files and recordings
        are closed to access but use copies may be requested; please contact Research Services.</p>
      <p>The Dorsey &amp; Whitney Records are composed of materials predominantly in the English
        language. There is also a considerable amount of Arabic language items in all three series.
        These chiefly consist of affidavits, letters by detainees and their relatives, and news
        clippings. Most of the Arabic language materials have English translations, with the
        exception of the news clippings. </p>

          <p>Comprises petitions, filings, documents relating to the Combatant Status Review
            Tribunal (CRST), and a wide variety of legal records regarding the six Bahrainis' and
            Guantánamo detainees' cases such as Al-Odah and Boumediene. The series documents legal
            efforts of their lawyers for writ of habeas corpus, writ of certiorari, amelioration of
            living condition at Camp Delta, and finally for the release and repatriation of their
            clients. The series also contain documents regarding the government's efforts to
            preclude attempts to attain any rights for the detainees kept extra-judicially as enemy
            combatants by the U.S. military at Camp Delta. The series contains extensive material
            related to the workings and procedures of and trials by the Combatant Status Review
            Tribunal (CSRT), which was established by the U.S. government on July 7, 2004. Also
            comprehensively covered in this series are the legal records and other documents
            concerning the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and Military Commission Act of 2006. The
            Bahraini detainees Al-Dossari and Al-Murbati cases are especially well-documented. The
            series is composed predominantly of materials in English language, but also contains
            many Arabic documents some of which are also translated into English. Other items
            include a twelve-minute unclassified audio recording on CD-R of CRST hearing for
            Al-Murbati (Box 4) and photographic images of the families of the detainees.</p>

          <p>The Correspondence Series includes writings between the attorneys and client detainees,
            Department of Justice officials, Bahraini diplomats and officials, U.S. senators and
            congressmen, law scholars, and colleagues of the Dorsey &amp; Whitney team representing
            the Guantanamo detainees. The writings cover issues and problems related to the legal
            status of Guantánamo detainees, human rights violations at Camp Delta and diplomatic
            efforts for the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees. The high-profile
            case of Jumah Al-Dossari is covered in depth in this series; his case became an

            detainee relatives in Bahrain and court-related material attached to letters. The
            written material is largely in English; all letters written in Arabic have English
            translations but court-related Arabic materials are not translated.</p>
