      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Crystal Eastman (June 25, 1881-July 8, 1928) was an American lawyer, antimilitarist,
        feminist, socialist, and journalist. She attended Vassar College and Columbia University,
        and obtained her law degree from New York University (1907). Her first job as an attorney
        was to investigate labor conditions for the Russell Sage Foundation. Her pioneering report,
        Work Accidents and the Law (1910), led New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to appoint her
        the first woman on New York State's Commission on Employers' Liability and Causes of
        Industrial Accidents, Unemployment and Lack of Farm Labor. As a member of that commission,
        Eastman drafted the country's first workers' compensation law. During Woodrow Wilson's
        administration, Eastman became investigating attorney for the United States Commission on
        Industrial Relations. Meanwhile, Eastman also struggled to further women's rights--first
        suffrage and later equal rights--as co-author of the first Equal Rights Amendment. During
        World War I, she was a leader of the peace movement, working with Carrie Chapman Catt to
        organize the Carnegie Hall meeting that led to the founding of the Woman's Peace Party of
        New York--later renamed the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom--the oldest
        women's peace organization. Eastman became Executive Secretary of the Women's Peace Party. A
        leading advocate for civil liberties and the rights of conscientious objectors during World
        War I, she joined Norman Thomas and Roger Baldwin in founding the American Civil Liberties
        Union. </p>
      <p>In 1910 Eastman married Wallace Benedict; the marriage ended in divorce in 1915. As a
        statement of financial and personal independence, Eastman refused to accept alimony, stating
        that to accept her former husband's money would be to betray herself as both a woman and a
        feminist. In 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist Walter Fuller; the
        couple had two children, Jeffrey and Annis.</p>
