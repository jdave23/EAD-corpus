         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Dick Groat was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania on November 4, 1930. At Duke, Groat
            played basketball and baseball and accumulated numerous awards and accolades for his
            performances in both sports. In basketball, Groat was named All-American in 1951 and
            1952 and United Press International's (UPI) National Player of the Year in 1952 after
            setting an NCAA single-season scoring record with 839 points. Groat was also named the
            Southern Conference Male Athlete of the Year in 1951 and 1952, the Southern Conference
            Basketball Tournament's Most Outstanding Player in 1951 and 1952 while also earning
            all-conference baseball honors in those two seasons, and the Helms National Player of
            the year in 1952. Additionally, in May 1952, Groat's #10 basketball jersey became the
            first to be retired in Cameron Indoor Stadium and the only until 1980. </p>
         <p>Groat signed a contract with Major League Baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates shortly after
            graduating in 1952. Groat also served two years in the United States Army from 1953-1955
            and played in armed service basketball and baseball leagues. Groat went on to have a
            fourteen year career in the big leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952-1962), St.
            Louis Cardinals (1963-1965), Philadelphia Phillies (1966-1967), and the San Francisco
            Giants (1967). Groat was a member of the World Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates (1960)
            and St. Louis Cardinals (1964). He was also a five-time All-Star selection and in 1960,
            the National League's Most Valuable Player and the recipient of the Lou Gehrig Memorial
            Award. While most well-known for his Major League Baseball career, Groat was also
            selected by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the first round of the 1952 National Basketball
            Association amateur draft.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of a scrapbook and several issues of the Belvoir Castle pertaining
            to the amateur athletic career of Dick Groat with inclusive dates 1948-1955. The
            scrapbook contains clippings pertaining to Groat's career at Duke University while a
            two-sport student-athlete in baseball and basketball, although a majority of the
            material pertains to his basketball career. The clippings document athletic contests
            including baseball and basketball tournaments, the numerous awards and honors received
            by Groat while at Duke, and his social life. Issues of the Belvoir Castle, the
            newsletter of the Engineer Center of the United States Army located at Fort Belvoir,
            Virginia, contain articles pertaining to Groat's two years in several armed service
            baseball and basketball leagues while in the United States Army from 1953-1955. The
            actual creator of the collection is unknown.</p>
