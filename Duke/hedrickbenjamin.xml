        Hedrick was a white professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina, 1854-1856,
        and U.S. Patent Office official, 1861-1886. Collection consists chiefly of letters to
        Hedrick. The early correspondence is between Hedrick and Mary Ellen Thompson, his future
        wife. Other correspondence concerns life at the University of North Carolina, Hedrick's
        dismissal from the University in 1856 for his Republican and anti-slavery opinions, and his
        life in the North during the Civil War period. Many of the post-1861 papers relate to
        Hedrick's position as chemical examiner at the Patent Office. Other topics include
        Reconstruction, the economic plight of the South, and politics, including Hedrick's attempt
        to win political office in North Carolina (1868). Correspondents include Kemp P. Battle,
        Daniel R. Goodloe, Horace Greeley, Hinton Rowan Helper, David L. Swain, John Torrey, and
        Jonathan Worth.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection consists mostly of letters to Benjamin S. Hedrick, Professor of Chemistry
        at the University of North Carolina, 1854-1856, and Examiner in the Patent Office,
        Washington, D.C., from 1861 until his death in 1886. In 1856, expelled from the University
        for his opposition to slavery, he was driven from North Carolina. However, it is evident
        from his correspondence that he maintained an intense concern for the welfare of his native
        state and employed his influence in Washington for the benefit of the state during the Civil
        War and Reconstruction period.</p>
      <p>The collection consists largely of correspondence between the Hedricks and their friends
        and colleagues. Early correspondence from 1848-1854 includes family news and affairs.
        Letters of courtship between Benjamin Hedrick and Mary Ellen Thompson, dated 1851-1852
        (before their marriage), mainly detail personal news and opinions on new fashions and
        trends, such as bloomers, temperance, and women's rights. Political events are also
        mentioned, including the Railroad Jubilee of September 1851, as well as Hedrick's
        impressions of Harvard and details about his activities while travelling in the North.</p>
      <p>Letters from 1854 discuss Hedrick's decision to accept the professorship position at the
        University of North Carolina and his subsequent plans for the program there. In 1856,
        Hedrick's article opposing slavery and endorsing John Fremont and the Republicans was
        published in the <title type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Standard</title>. The
        collection includes both clippings, minute excerpts, and correspondence about his subsequent
        expulsion from the University. Also included are details about the publicity and negative
        reactions to Hedrick's views; one letter from Mary Ellen Thompson Hedrick recounts UNC
        students burning Hedrick in effigy. Letters from the Hedricks' friends and supporters
        describe their own troubles in finding work as a result of backing Hedrick, and also include
        updates on the political climate throughout the country. Hedrick's grandfather, Benjamin
        Sherwood, was a regular correspondent from Marion County, Iowa, and provided regular news
        and opinions on the conditions of the Midwest. He opposed slavery, Democratic Party, and
        immigration from Catholic countries, and favors letting the Southern states secede. His
        letters also include family history along with updates from Marion county activities. Know
        Nothings, President Buchanan's cabinet, and Kansas violence are all discussed in letters
        from 1856-1857. </p>
      <p>After Hedrick's expulsion and departure from North Carolina, incoming letters from friends
        and family offer news and updates on Chapel Hill residents, including University of North
        Carolina adminstrators and professors; schools; crops and prices; as well as family news,
        courtships, and events. Several letters mention Hinton R. Helper's book, <title
          type="simple" render="italic">The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It</title>,
        which Benjamin Hedrick helped promote in 1858. At one point, Hedrick is warned against
        travelling in North Carolina until after the presidential election, for his own safety.</p>
      <p>Following Lincoln's election in 1860, Benjamin Hedrick's letters describe the flood of
        Republicans moving to Washington, including his own relocation and pursuit of an appointment
        in the Patent Office. Included is a letter from March 1861 where he describes meeting
        President and Mrs. Lincoln. Meanwhile, letters to Hedrick from North Carolina mention
        secession fervor in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as preparations for arming white
        citizens against Black people. The North Carolina convention and its delegates are
        discussed, as are preparations for war in both the North and the South. Hedrick writes about
        the feelings in Washington, while his stepsister describes sewing uniforms for soldiers in
        New Bern, North Carolina.</p>
      <p>There is little material directly related to the Civil War, apparently due to interruption
        of mail service between North Carolina and Washington. The letters within the collection
        include mention of several battles, including Fort Sumter, Bull Run, Gettysburg, and
        Chickamauga. The homefront is also reported on, including North Carolina's conscription
        laws, the confiscation of Union-sympathizers' property, the arrival of refugees, and the
        condition of UNC's campus. Politics are another frequent topic, including the Copperheads. </p>
      <p>One interesting component of the collection is a group of letters from John A. Hedrick,
        Benjamin Hedrick's brother and Internal Revenue Collector at Beaufort, N.C. John Hedrick's
        original letters are interfiled chronologically with the collection, and also exist in
        typewritten form, filed together at the end of letters from 1863. His reports from Beaufort
        mention the health and condition of the city; the arrival of refugees after the battle for
        Plymouth in April 1864; the spread of measles and smallpox; and his thoughts on the
        Massachusetts 55th Regiment, an African American regiment stationed in North Carolina. In
        February 1865, John Hedrick writes that the presence of African American Union troops keep
        Confederate troops away, since they do not like to fight Black soldiers. His correspondence
        also mentions the death of Lincoln and Johnston's surrender to General Sherman. Post-war
        letters discuss North Carolina politics, universal suffrage, and crop-sharing by former
        slaves. He denounces W. W. Holden, the North Carolina provisional governor, and encourages
        Benjamin Hedrick to run. Later letters describe the North Carolina Constitional Convention
        and subsequent election of 1868, where both brothers ran for Congress (Benjamin for the 4th
        District, John for the 2nd District).</p>
      <p>Another notable sub-group of letters about the Civil War come from prisoners of war at
        Point Lookout, Old Capital, Camp Elmire, Fort Deleware, and Johnsons' Island prisons. The
        prisoner letters exist only in typewritten form; no originals remain with the collection. </p>
      <p>Following the surrender, correspondence transitions to discuss North Carolina's adjustment
        to Reconstruction. Benjamin Hedrick's visit to North Carolina results in a report to the
        Secretary of the Treasury that Carolina wants peace, and that hunger, crime, and speculation
        are serious problems for the population. Some letters to Hedrick complain about freedmen and
        their labor. Several correspondents discuss the poverty they face in the post-war period,
        both from their loss of property to the Confederacy and in their loss of slave labor
        following emancipation. Many write to Hedrick asking for seeds. One notable letter to
        Hedrick from February 2, 1866, comes from Milly Walker, formerly enslaved by D.L. Swain, who
        writes she is searching for her father and three children, who had been owned by Dr. Shoaf
        of Washington.</p>
      <p>Another common topic in 1865 is Hedrick's efforts in establishing Internal Revenue
        districts throughout the state, resulting in much correspondence about the various posts and
        jobs that resulted. </p>
      <p>The political letters of value are found mostly between 1865 and 1870. There is much
        discussion of the election and its various components, including candidates W.W. Holden and
        Jonathon Worth; secret political parties, including the Red Strings; the distrust towards
        the military government; and the issue of universal suffrage. The Test Oath is strongly
        criticized as impossible, and North Carolina statehood, disenfranchisement, and inclusion
        into the Union is a regular concern for correspondents, including Hedrick. Many letters
        denounce W.W. Holden as provisional governor, who is accused of electioneering among the
        state's freedmen. Hedrick is asked multiple times to promote Jonathon Worth among Northern
        newspapers. Hedrick's own political ambitions are regularly discouraged by his wife, who in
        1867 also writes that he should not accept the presidency of UNC. Several letters in 1868
        mention signs of the Ku Klux Klan. Others discuss national politics and the impeachment of
        President Johnson. </p>
      <p>Letters from late 1868 and early 1869 detail the takeover of the University of North
        Carolina by Col. C.L. Harris and the subsequent appointment of Solomon Pool as president.
        With Holden as governor, Internal Revenue business in North Carolina beomes a regular topic
        of correspondence. In May 1869, Hedrick writes of his changing interest from politics to the
        growth of industry and the activities of the Patent Office. Later letters contain reports on
        North Carolina news and events, including the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, Governor
        Holden's impeachment, the Greensboro railroad, a report on the revitalization of UNC, and
        other political news. </p>
      <p>Another significant part of the collection consists of patent papers from Hedrick's career
        in the Patent Office, including reports and other information on disputed patent cases. </p>
      <p>In addition to the patent papers, there is an extensive and varied collection of printed
        materials that is helpful in glimpsing the personal, professional, and social life of a
        civil servant in post-Civil War Washington. Besides the usual accumulation of
        advertisements, calling cards, etc., there are numerous items on the Freemasons, the Cosmos
        Club of Washington, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Art, and the
        formative years of the American Chemical Society, among others. One group of items deals
        with the litigation of the bankrupt house of Jay Cooke and Co., in which Hedrick had
        holdings. Another series of items contains commenement announcements, etc., from the various
        schools and colleges with which the Hedrick family was associated (including Georgetown
        University, New York University, the United States Naval Academy, Cooper Union, Johns
        Hopkins, Rutgers Female Institute of New York City). Other items relate to political events
        of the mid-nineteenth century, such as a group of memorial exercises for Samuel F.B. Morse,
        James A. Garfield, and Charles Darwin, as well as an invitation to the services for the
        removal of James Monroe from New York to Richmond in 1858. There are also a number of
        printed pieces relating directly to the events of the Civil War and Reconstruction era,
        including broadsides, announcements, pamphlets, and clippings. </p>
      <p>Bills and receipts cover four decades of business transactions, beginning with Hedrick's
        college days. Among the miscellaneous items are drafts of political speeches, newspaper
        articles (mostly ante-bellum), and an assortment of school papers and genealogical items.
        The bound volumes accompanying the collection are three memoradum books and one daybook.</p>
