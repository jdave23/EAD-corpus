      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The records of the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) span the years 1918
        to 2020, with the bulk of the materials from the late 20th and early 21st century. The
        materials document the activities of ICTJ in its support of peace processes and to the
        pursuit of legal reparations and reconciliation in areas of conflict involving human rights
        violations. Formats in the collection include ICTF office and administrative files, annual
        reports, single articles, legal journals, human rights organization publications, reports
        and white papers, conference proceedings, newspapers and clippings, trial transcripts,
        teaching materials, and photographs, as well as some posters and other ephemera such as
        fliers, graphics, invitations, and programs. There are many audiovisual and digital
        formats.</p>
      <p>There are four main series: Geographic Files, Reference and Reports, Program and Subject
        Files, and Administrative Files. The Geographic series contains materials from countries
        directly impacted by the work of ICTJ and its partners. It is arranged by continent and then
        by country. These materials cover virtually every major case of human rights abuse and
        violation worldwide. There are also materials on affiliated armed conflicts such as the Iraq
        War and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; violent ethnic clashes; refugee movements; refugee
        and detention camps; women's rights; and case studies of human rights abuses.</p>
      <p>The Reference and Reports series formed ICTJ's documentation library. The Program and
        Subject files contain thematically-arranged publications about ICTJ's main subject areas,
        such as transitional justice and reparations, as well as the programatic materials from ICTJ
        conferences, workshops, publications, truth commissions, and program divisions. The final
        series, administrative files, is largely comprised of the files of former ICTJ presidents
        Alex Boraine and Juan Mendez and other staff files, including Louis Bickford, director of
        multiple ICTJ units. The staff files and the institutional memory files come together to
        form the narrative of the creation and work of ICTJ since its beginnings in 2001.</p>
      <p>Each series also lists audiovisual materials and digital files. These materials are
        inserted into the series they correspond with. Formats include Betamax tapes, mini-DVs,
        DVDs, CDs, VHS tapes, and cassette tapes. The audiovisual materials include trial
        recordings, staff interviews, conference recordings, and truth commission proceedings; some
        of these were digitized by ICTJ staff. The born-digital records contain similar materials
        and also include training materials, ICTJ administrative materials, and program specific
        documents.</p>

          <p>The Geographic series, the largest in the collection, is comprised of files
            representing about 100 countries and forms the backbone of ICTJ's collection. The

            materials from various country's truth and reconciliation commissions. These materials

          <p>In addition to the hands-on work they do, ICTJ has a robust research unit captured in

            publications include annual reports from human rights NGOs as well as thematic
            publications about children and women in conflict, displacement, refugees,
            disappearances, human trafficking, judicial reform, economic issues, security and

            <p>The files of ICTJ former presidents Juan Mendez and Alex Boraine. Alex Boraine was a
              co-founder of ICTJ and served as its president from 2001-2003. Juan Mendez served as
              the president from 2004-2009. Their work within ICTJ spans topics from the founding of
              ICTJ to truth commissions to NGO partnerships to transitional justice and human rights
              issues throughout the world. Their work brought them to many conferences, symposia,
              trainings, and speaking engagements and allowed them to publish numerous writings for
              more than a decade with ICTJ. This series is comprised of name files, organization
              files, conferences and events, transitional justice and human rights issues, ICTJ
