        Corabelle Anderson, and their children, Philip (Pito) and Isabelle Holland, in Guatemala
        City from 1923-1927. Philip Holland worked for the U.S. Consul and served as the U.S. Consul
        General in Guatemala from 1924-1927. Collection consists of four photo albums with
        approximately 600 gelatin silver prints assembled and maintained by the Holland family
        during their years in Guatemala, 1923-1927. Three of the albums contain snapshots from the
        family's life in Guatemala City and travels in the country. The fourth album contains
        panoramic photographs of Guatemalan landscapes and cities by Boston photographer Henry J.
        Thayer. The collection's photographs feature the Holland family, especially their children,
        and their travels through Guatemala; street and market scenes from various towns and cities
        in Guatemala; church processions and parades; landscapes with Lake Atitlan and surrounding
        volcanoes, including Fuego and Agua; Mayan ruins, churches, palaces, and other Guatemalan
        architecture; local potters firing and selling pottery; railroads, streetcars, steamships,
        and other methods of transportation; the piers and beaches of San Jose, which apparently
        served as the port city for Guatemala; and various farms from the United Fruit Company.
        Geographic areas represented in the collection include Guatemala City, Antigua, Tecpan,
        Chichichastenango, Lake Atitlan, Solola, Escuintla, Panajachel, Quirigua, and the
        Quetzaltenango Valley.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Philip Holland was born in 1877 in Murray, Kentucky, and eventually settled in Jackson,
        Tennessee. He married Corabelle Anderson in 1904, and they had two children: Philip
        (nicknamed Pito) and Isabelle Holland.</p>
      <p>The Holland family spent much of the early 1900s living abroad, with Philip Holland, a
        lawyer, working for the U.S. Consul. He was first stationed in Puerto Plata, 1910-1911,
        which was followed by tenures in Saltillo (1911-1913) and Basel, Switzerland (1913-1923).
        The family moved to Guatemala in 1923, and Holland became U.S. Consul General in Guatemala
        from 1924-1927. After Guatemala, Holland was stationed in Liverpool from 1929-1938. The
        family returned to the United States with the outbreak of World War II.</p>
      <p>Isabelle Holland, the youngest child, was born in 1920 in Basel, and grew up with her
        family in Guatemala City and Liverpool. She graduated from Tulane in 1942, and worked in
        publishing before becoming a published author herself in her 40s. Isabelle wrote over 50
        books, mostly fiction for teenagers, including <title type="simple" render="italic">The Man
          Without a Face</title> (1972). She died in 2002.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of four photograph albums collected and assembled by the Hollands
        during their time in Guatemala, from 1923-1927. The albums include gelatin silver prints in
        a variety of sizes, ranging from 2x3 inch snapshots to 3.5x12 inch panoramas. The prints
        themselves are generally in good condition, but the binding on two of the albums needs
        repair.</p>
      <p>The photographs include a wide range of images, from scenery and landscapes of the
        Guatemala countryside, to personal photographs of the Holland family and their friends.
          <emph render="bold">Album 1</emph>, a Kodak 7x12 black album, appears to have been created
        by Corabelle Anderson, Philip Holland's wife and Pito and Isabelle's mother. The creator has
        included captions for nearly every photograph, which have been written in ink on the edge of
        the print. The majority of images in this album are snapshots, highlighting the activities
        of the family, such as their travels through Guatemala, their home and the American Legation
        building in Guatemala City, family photographs of the children (including images of Isabelle
        and Pito playing and posing for the camera), and photographs of Holland's colleagues. Some
        of the first photographs in the album are of President Harding's memorial service at the
        American Legation in Guatemala. The album also includes images of Antigua, including its
        markets, the Agua volcano, and Mayan ruins; coffee farms and fences of the United Fruit
        Company; church processions and parades in Guatemala City; the American Consulate; San Jose,
        which appears to have been the family's port when travelling to and from Guatemala; and
        photographs of the family hunting and hiking in the Guatemala countryside.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Album 2</emph>, a brown album labelled Photographs, includes very few
        captions and has no indication of who created it. It includes additional family photographs,
        but seems to contain more photographs of Guatemalan people, especially street scenes with
        Guatemalans in native dress; markets with Guatemalan women selling food or products; local
        musicians with instruments; and local children. This album also includes images of Guatemala
        City's Columbus memorial; Tecpan's palace, markets, churches, and people; and more
        photographs from San Jose, Antigua, and the Agua volcano. There are some duplicates between
        Albums 1 and 2. Of note are the various means of transportation captured in this album,
        including automobiles being pulled up a mountain by hand, streetcars in Guatemala City, and
        mules or horses for traversing rural areas.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Album 3</emph> appears to have been created by Dr. and Mrs. Anderson
        from 1923-1924. It includes ink captions on the prints, which again are snapshot-sized, as
        well as a few pages of scrapbook materials (such as cards, clippings, and tickets) in the
        album's back pages. There are very few images of the Holland family. Instead, a large
        proportion of the photographs are of travels throughout Guatemala. Scenes include Guatemala
        City, Antigua, Lake Atitlan, Panajachel, Tecpan, Escuintla, Guatemala City, Solola,
        Chichicastenango, Patulul, and Quirigua. It also includes images from San Jose's beaches and
        piers, where the couple seems to have caught a United Fruit Company pacific steamer. Along
        with landscapes, local architecture and buildings, and street scenes from throughout the
        country, this album has a few photographs highlighting United Fruit Company's farms, Mayan
        ruins, volcanoes, Guatemalans in native dress, the firing and selling of pottery, and local
        markets.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Album 4</emph> consists largely of panoramic photographs, each stamped
        on the verso or on the mount by Boston photographer Henry J. Thayer. His relationship to the
        Holland family is not clear, but the album cover is stamped <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">P.H.</title> Most of Thayer's panoramics are titled, in the negative,
        directly on the print. The images include Guatemala's West Coast, featuring railroad
        stations, Mayan ruins near Quirigua, and native huts. Other photographs are from Antigua,
        including both street scenes and skylines with the Plaza Central, Santa Carolina church, and
        the Fuego and Agua volcanoes. Guatemala City is another featured city: Thayer's panoramas
        include its Mapa en Relieve (a scale model public monument of Guatemala's geography, opened
        in 1904), city vistas and plazas, and a bullfight. Other areas of the country represented in
        the images include Tecpan, Solola, Chichicastenango, Lake Atitlan and its surrounding areas,
        the Quetzaltenango Valley and its local markets and plaza, and the Zacapa desert, among
        others. Thayer also took occasional pictures highlighting Guatemalan history, with images of
        the Quetzaltenango monument to Ticam Uman (the last king of the Quiche), the Bridge of the
        Slaves near Santa Rosa, and Indian mounds near Tecpan. This album had several inserted pages
        and images, which have been foldered separately to protect the original album. Most of the
        loose pages are additional panoramas by Thayer, but there are also some black-and-white
        6.5x8.5 undated prints taken by the U.S. Army Air Service. These images were clearly taken
        from the air, and show Guatemalan cities and villages.</p>
