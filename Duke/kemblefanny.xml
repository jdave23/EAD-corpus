        postmarked envelope from the actress and writer Fanny Kemble in London to Miss Patteson in
        Andover, 10 May, 1889. Kemble thanks Miss Patteson for sending photographs, mentioning that
        she particularly values one of Bishop Patteson. She says she is "glad Lord Coleridge thought
        Lenox (Mass.) pretty. It has always seemed to me a charming mountain village." Frances Anne
        "Fanny" Kemble was a British actress, writer, and abolitionist. She was born into a theater
        family; her acting career spanned the years 1829-1868. Kemble acted to support herself, but
        she was most passionate about writing, and was an accomplished playwright, poet, and
        diarist. She married the Pierce Mease Butler, an American who subsequently inherited his
        family' plantations. After spending time in Georgia, Kemble became an abolitionist and later
        divorced her husband. In 1863, Kemble published her anti-slavery memoir, Journal of a
        Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, which is said to have influenced the
        British against supporting the Confederacy in the Civil War. Kemble's own family was divided
        on that issue, as her elder daughter sided with her mother, while her younger daughter
        returned to Georgia with her father. Frances Butler Leigh published Ten Years on a Georgia
        Plantation Since the War (1883) as a rebuttal to her mother's memoir. Kemble's success as a
        Shakespearean actress enabled her to buy a cottage in Lenox, Massachusetts. Her
        correspondent, Miss Patteson, is the daughter of Frances Duke Patteson, a niece of the poet
        Samuel Coleridge Taylor; the Lord Coleridge mentioned in the letter is John Duke Coleridge
        (1820-1894), the 2nd Lord Chief Justice of England. Bishop Patteson refers to Miss
        Patteson's sister, John Patteson (1827-1871), who became an Anglican martyr after being
        killed doing mission work in the Solomon Islands.</abstract>
