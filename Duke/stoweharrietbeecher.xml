			<head>Biographical Note</head>


			<p>Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe (1811 June 14-1896 July 1) was an American
				abolitionist and author. Her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin(1852) was a depiction of life
				for African Americans under slavery; it reached millions as a novel and play, and
				became influential in the United States and United Kingdom. It energized
				anti-slavery forces in the American North, while provoking widespread anger in the
				South. She wrote more than 20 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and
				collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and
				her public stands on social issues of the day.</p>
