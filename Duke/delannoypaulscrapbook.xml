         <p>Collection comprises 4 scrapbook pages the Delannoy's compiled to document their lives
            during World War I. Includes a map of France with the front outlined, along with the

            are attached to one page. The final page contains an undated poster from the Paris
            Chamber of Commerce regarding war loans. Though both Paul and Jeanne are represented in
            the papers, the majority of the documents were issued to Paul. It is not clear whether
            pages were removed from a larger volume.</p>
