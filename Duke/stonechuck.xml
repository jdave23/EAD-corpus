    <abstract id="aspace_59fbc5ad2e91fc357a860d737ddf3c11" label="Abstract">Charles Sumner (Chuck) Stone was a prominent African-American journalist, with a career spanning from his early days at the New York Age (1958-1959) to his position as editor and columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News (1972-1991). Between 1965 and 1967 he was special assistant and press secretary to New York representative Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. He served as mediator between the police and suspected criminals for over 20 years, most notably in his negotiation of the Graterford Prison hostage crisis in 1981. He is the author of multiple books, from political analyses to a novel about his time with Powell and (in 2003) a children's book. He was also an educator for many years, as Professor of English at the University of Delaware from 1985-1991 and Walter Spearman Professor of Journalism at UNC-Chapel Hill from 1991 to 2005, when he retired. The collection contains clippings, correspondence, writings, scrapbooks, photographs, video, audio, research files, and printed materials pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone. The papers span the years 1931-2007 and document Stone's journalism career and writings, his political career and relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and his role as an educator.</abstract>

    <head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The <emph render="bold">Chuck Stone Papers</emph> span the years 1931 to 2007. The collection consists of clippings and other print materials, correspondence, writings, scrapbooks, photographs, a videotape, research files, and diplomas and certificates pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone. Of the subject areas documented here are Stone's career as a prominent African-American journalist, his political career and relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. (including Powell's time as head of the Congressional Committee on Education and Labor), his role as a mediator between suspects and the criminal justice system, and his involvement in civil rights struggles in the United States. Also represented, but to a much lesser extent, is his teaching career at the University of Delaware and UNC-Chapel Hill. The collection is divided into nine series, each described below. Of these, the largest by far are the <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> and the <emph render="bold">Subject Files</emph> series, which document respectively Stone's journalistic writings (especially during his time at the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>) and his research interests over the years, including racial politics in the U.S., African-Americans in the media, the criminal justice system, censorship and free speech, and standardized testing. The collection was acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African-American Documentation.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series</emph> documents Stone's time as press secretary and special assistant to Powell. It contains office and business correspondence both to and from Stone; clippings and other printed materials about Powell or the Committee on Education and Labor; office files on individual members of congress (notably Florida Democrat Sam Gibbons, partly responsible for the campaign to remove Powell from his position as head of the Committee); files related to the workings of the Committee; press releases written by Stone; and a number of papers relating to Powell's exclusion from Congress in 1967. This series should be useful both for those interested in the career of Powell, since Stone worked for him during a pivotal time in his career, and for those interested in the workings of the Committee on Education and Labor during that time.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> is made up predominantly of Stone's columns from the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title> and the <title type="simple" render="italic">NEA Viewpoint</title> (a Newspaper Enterprise Association column syndicated by United Media), as well as articles about Stone from various newspapers, and some writings by Stone appearing in other newspapers. Topics addressed by Stone in his columns include racial politics in the U.S., Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's issues and feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized testing. Researchers interested in Stone's journalism career prior to 1972 will find some earlier clippings here, but should consult the <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series </emph> for more extensive materials and clippings from that period.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> contains correspondence to and from Stone relating to business and personal matters. The majority of this series is made up of general correspondence or correspondence relating to Stone's position as editor and columnist of the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>. The remainder of the series comprises topical folders of correspondence, such as the correspondence between Stone and Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at Graterford Prison. Other such correspondence can be found in the "Criminal justice system" subsection of the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph>.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Other Writings Series</emph> houses Stone's writings not contained in the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph>, such as speeches, sermons, and television transcripts; business documents and research files pertaining to different projects on which Stone worked, such as his attempts to develop his own life or his writings on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. into a movie, or various uncompleted book projects; and a small subset of writings by others, including an autobiography of Corinne Huff on which Stone worked. It is divided into three subseries to accommodate the restriction on the collection: the <emph render="bold">Published Writings by Stone Subseries</emph>, the <emph render="bold">Unpublished Writings by Stone Subseries</emph>, and the <emph render="bold">Writings by Others Subseries</emph>. Notably absent from this series are manuscripts of Stone's books. Instead, the series contains either shorter published materials, such as publicly delivered speeches, or working documents assembled for the creation of larger works.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks Series</emph> houses the contents of four scrapbooks assembled by Stone during the 1950s and 1960s. They contain a number of clippings, programs, and some correspondence pertaining to his time at the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Age</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Washington Afro-American</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Chicago Defender</title>, and working for Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. The series is especially useful for documenting Stone's early career and his position as an outspoken African-American journalist and defender of civil rights. Researchers interested in this period in Stone's life should also consult the <emph render="bold">Clippings Series</emph> for more materials from the period in question that are not present in the scrapbooks.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">St. Louis Series</emph> is a small series housing clippings and correspondence related to Stone's brief position as ombudsman for the <title type="simple" render="italic">St. Louis Post-Disptach</title>, overseeing their coverage of the 1997 mayoral election. The series is divided into a <emph render="bold">Published Materials Subseries</emph>, which houses clippings from the Post-Dispatch and related newspapers, and an <emph render="bold">Unpublished Materials Subseries</emph>, in which can be found correspondence, business documents, and responses to several readers polls conducted by Stone.</p><p>In the <emph render="bold">Subject Files Series</emph> can be found Stone's research files on different subject areas, arranged alphabetically. The files contain primarily clippings, but also some correspondence and notes. Several subcategories that are heavily represented and should be mentioned are the files on censorship and the first amendment, on the criminal justice system, on standardized testing, and on materials relating to his time at UNC-Chapel Hill. There are also numerous files related to racial politics in the U.S., but these files are less discrete than the categories described above and are to be found throughout the series rather than under a specific subheading.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> contains a small amount of material pertaining to Stone's teaching career. The bulk of this series comes from his time at UNC-Chapel Hill, and includes syllabi, exams, assignments, student papers, and other teaching paperwork. Most heavily represented in this regard is Stone's popular class on censorship, for which there are multiple syllabi and exams from different years and semesters.</p><p>Finally, the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> collects photographs touching on all aspects of Stone's life, from press photos of Stone and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. to family portraits. Also included in this series are a videotape of a documentary about Powell, press passes and identification badges, and an election pin kept by Stone.</p><p>Unprocessed <emph render="bold">Addition 2009-0009</emph> (50 items; .2 lin. ft.; dated 1963-2005) comprises primarily photographs, but also contains a few letters, clippings, awards, and a dvd-r. The original DVD-R is closed to patron use; however, the information on the disk has been migrated to the electronic records server.</p><p>Addition 2012-0099 has been processed and included in the original collection's description as boxes 64-66. Some parts of this addition have been interfiled into existing boxes.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Those interested in Chuck Stone and his life may also wish to consult the <emph render="bold">Davis Family Papers</emph>, also housed at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, which contain materials collected by Stone's wife Louise Davis Stone pertaining to the Davis family and their activities. This collection, cataloged separately from the Chuck Stone Papers, is searchable by title in the Duke University Libraries online catalog.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

In keeping with Stone's original arrangement, some folders are categorized by topic, while others simply house general correspondence within a particular span of years.</p><p>Of particular interest in the topical folders is the correspondence relating to black political power in America (the topic, not only Stone's book of the same title) and the correspondence with Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at the State Correctional Facility at Graterford, PA from 1973-1993. Also to be found are two folders of correspondence from a number of individuals related to Stone's role as negotiator in the hostage crisis at Graterford in 1981.</p><p>The bulk of the remainder of the series is made up of two categories. One is simply general correspondence. These folders contain correspondence from such figures as Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Barry Goldwater, LeRoi Jones, Edward Kennedy, and others, along with family correspondence and business correspondence both to and from Stone from the 1960s to the 2000s. The other is correspondence specific to Stone's position as editor and columnist at the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title>, which includes internal memos and letters with other staff members, letters from readers, and business letters relevant to his position at the newspaper. Researchers should be aware that these appear to be rough categorizations on Stone's part, and that there are a few letters specific to his role at the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title> in the general correspondence folders, and some general business correspondence in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Philadelphia Daily News</title> folders.</p><p>It should also be noted that correspondence on particular topics can also be found in relevant series. For instance, correspondence with or relating to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. is to be found in that series.

and Contents note</head><p>Houses Stone's extensive files in many different subject areas, consisting primarily of clippings, but also containing notes on the topics and some minimal correspondence. The folders have been preserved as closely to their original order as possible, and Stone's titles have been retained. The exception to this is a set of subheadings that were added to four groups of folders that were physically and topically associated by Stone, and which are of particular interest. These are his files on censorship and the first amendment, on which he intended to write a book ( <title type="simple" render="italic">Free Speech and Jealous Mistresses</title>, unpublished) and taught regularly throughout the 1990s; on the criminal justice system, focused around issues of racism within that system and on Stone's activities as a mediator between the police and inmates or suspected criminals; on the politics and racial bias of standardized testing, an issue with which he became involved while working with the Education and Labor Committee under Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.; and files relating to his academic career, activities, and institutional politics at the University of North Carolina. These can be found under the subheadings <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Censorship,</title><title type="simple" render="doublequote">Criminal justice system,</title><title type="simple" render="doublequote">Standardized testing,</title> and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">UNC</title> respectively. The files on censorship are especially numerous (filling six archival boxes) and contain extensive information on censorship law, types of censorship, and individual instances of censorship. Other topics in this series include black political power in the U.S., minority journalists, women's issues and feminism, affirmative action, religion, electoral politics in the U.S., journalism, multiculturalism and political correctness, higher education, gay and lesbian issues, Philadelphia politics and politicians, and racial politics more generally. There are also significant files on such figures as Mumia Abu Jamal, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Camille Paglia, Colin Powell, and Clarence Thomas. Subject files relating specifically to Stone's duties as special assistant to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. can be found in the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series.</p></scopecontent><arrangement
