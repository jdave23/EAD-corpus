        (1923-1993) was a photojournalist, diplomat, and film maker from Atlanta, Georgia. The
        collection contains photographic materials and papers related to three photo essays
        illustrated by Davis: one on African American writer Langston Hughes; another on artists
        Hale Woodruff and Charles Alston; and one on the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private
        preparatory school for African Americans in Sedalia, N.C. Films in the collection were taken
        by Davis and include two home movies and six color and black-and-white 16mm films
        documenting people, politics, and agricultural life in Liberia during William Tubman's
        presidency in the early 1950s. Completing the collection is a photo album, "Progress in
        Liberia, Nov. 1949-Feb. 1950," containing twenty large black-and-white photographs,
        assembled to promote a partnership between the government of Liberia and the Liberia Mining
        Company. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note: Griff Davis (1923-1993)</head>
      <p>Griffith J. Davis, known as "Griff," was born in Atlanta, Georgia on April 18, 1923. He was
        introduced to photography during high school. After serving in World War II, Davis returned
        to Atlanta where his photojournalism career flourished as he worked while at Morehouse
        College for the <title render="italic">Atlanta Daily World</title>, <title render="italic"
          >Time</title>, and <title render="italic">Ebony</title>, who authorized him to do a
        photojournalism spread on his sister's high school, the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private
        boarding school in North Carolina. </p>
      <p>Griff Davis' journalistic career introduced him to many political and cultural players of
        the time, including Langston Hughes, who was one of his earliest mentors. Davis received his
        M.A. in journalism from Columbia in 1949, the only Black student in the program. As a
        journalist for the Black Star photo agency, <title render="italic">New York Times</title>,
          <title render="italic">Ebony</title>, and many other publications, Davis traveled in the
        United States, Africa, and Europe during the forties and fifties. In 1952 the Republic of
        Liberia sponsored Davis' one-man show "Liberia, 1952," at the American Museum of Natural
        History, and in the years that followed he produced three documentary films, including one
        narrated by the then-unknown actor Sidney Poitier. </p>
      <p>In 1952 Davis joined the U.S. Foreign Service, spending most of his time advancing Truman's
        Point Four program for foreign aid (later USAID), chiefly in Liberia. He also served in
        Tunisia and Nigeria, and retired in 1985. In 1993, Morehouse College awarded Davis the
        Bennie Trailblazer Award, named for his former mentor and president of Morehouse, Benjamin
        Mays, for personal and professional achievements. Griff Davis passed away in 1993 in
        Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 70.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Charles Alston (1907-1977) </head>
      <p>Charles Alston was an African American painter, sculptor, illustrator, muralist and teacher
        based in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem. He was active in the Harlem Renaissance.
        Alston was born in 1907 in Charlotte, N.C. His father had been born into slavery in 1851 in
        Pittsboro, North Carolina. After the Civil War, Alston gained an education and graduated
        from St. Augustine's College in Raleigh. Through marriage, he became close to artist Romare
        Bearden and his family. Alston designed and painted murals at the Harlem Hospital and the
        Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building. He passed away in 1977.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Langston Hughes (1902-1967)</head>
      <p>Langston Hughes (1902-1967), who claimed Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Carl Sandburg, and Walt
        Whitman as his primary influences, is particularly known for his insightful portrayals of
        Black life in America from the 1920s through the 1960s. Hughes wrote novels, short stories,
        plays, and poetry, and is also known for his engagement with the world of jazz and the
        influence it had on his writing, as in his book-length poem "Montage of a Dream Deferred"
        (Holt, 1951). His life and work were enormously important in shaping the artistic
        contributions of the 1920s Harlem Renaissance.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note: Hale Woodruff (1900-1980)</head>
      <p>Hale Aspacio Woodruff (1900-1980) was an American-born painter, draftsman, printer, and
        educator who is probably best known for his murals, especially the Amistad Mutiny Murals
        (1939) at the Savery Library at Talladega College in Alabama. Woodruff studied in France
        from 1927 to 1931, and was greatly influenced by African art and cubism. However, upon his
        return to the United States he concentrated on social issues, including scenes of Southern
        poverty and depictions of lynchings.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Griffith J. Davis Photographs and Films collection dates from 1949-1991 and comprises
        two main series: films and a photo album made in the 1950s in Liberia and documenting life
        there during part of William V. Tubman's presidency; and photographs, contact prints,
        hundreds of digitized nitrate and safety negatives, and related papers documenting three
        photo-essays, one on African American author Langston Hughes; another on artists Hale
        Woodruff and Charles Alston; and one on the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private junior and
        senior high school for African Americans in Sedalia, N.C. The digitized negatives are also
        available through the Duke Libraries Digital Collections website.</p>
      <p>Photographic materials include two sheets of photographic contact prints taken by Davis
        when he visited Methodist missionaries Mr. and Mrs. George Way Harley in Ganta, Liberia.
        Subjects include African masks and the Ganta Mission. A letter written by Davis describes
        his visit with the Harleys. </p>
      <p>Other Griff Davis images in the collection are found in an album entitled "Progress in
        Liberia, November 1949 - February 1950," containing a map of Liberia and twenty large
        black-and-white gelatin silver prints with typed captions. Subjects feature Liberian
        landscapes, construction projects, bridges, railroads, and port scenes, with some images
        featuring native Liberian workers. The album was assembled to promote the partnership with
        the Liberian government and the Liberia Mining Company; in the first image, President Tubman
        is signing a contract with mining officials. </p>
      <p>The audiovisual components include two home movies taken in Monrovia, and six color and
        black-and-white films taken in Liberia by Davis in the 1950s during William V.S. Tubman's
        presidency. Davis was asked by Tubman to document modern life in Liberia in 1952. In 1956
        and 1957 he made films while stationed in Liberia with the United States technical
        assistance mission and the Liberian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Films depict a
        wide range of subjects, activities and events, including the country's people, industry,
        leaders, and rural life. Titles include <title type="simple" render="italic">Pepper Bird
          Land</title> (1952), <title type="simple" render="italic">Liberia 1956 Presidential

            <p>This series consists chiefly of contact sheets created by Davis from his nitrate and
              safety film negatives, also found in this collection. The original negative numbers
              are marked next to each image on the contact sheet, and in a few cases, there are

          <p>The 342 original safety and nitrate cellulose film negatives in this collection were
            taken by photojournalist Griff Davis for use in three publication projects. They are
            almost all black-and-white.</p>
          <p>Almost a third of the images, 108 negatives, derive from a photo-essay in <title
              render="italic">Ebony</title> magazine on African American author and New York
            resident Langston Hughes. Another 124 images document African American student life at
            the Palmer Memorial Institute preparatory school in Sedalia, N.C., also published in
              <title render="italic">Ebony</title>. Finally, 110 images document African American
            artists and mural painters Hale Woodruff and Charles Alston at work in their studio on a
            mural for the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. There are also a dozen color
            photographs of Alston's modernist paintings and a sculpture.</p>
          <p>All of the negatives were digitally scanned for preservation purposes by library staff;
            the digital files are viewable through links in this collection guide, or through the

            <p>The founder of Palmer Memorial Institute, Charlotte Hawkins Brown (1883–1961) was
              born in Henderson, North Carolina, and raised and educated in Massachusetts. Brown
              named the Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute (PMI) in Sedalia, North Carolina,
              after her mentor and benefactor, the second woman president of Wellesley College.
              Brown raised funds to expand campus facilities and worked to strengthen PMI's artistic
              and scholarly offerings, and through her efforts, the school evolved from an
              agricultural and manual training facility to a fully accredited, nationally recognized
              African American preparatory school for junior and senior high school students. In
              1987 the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum opened on the PMI grounds as North Carolina's
              first African American state historic site. </p>

            <p>The Palmer Memorial Institute (PMI) was an African American preparatory school for
              junior and senior students, and was attended by more than 1,000 students from 1902
              until it closed in 1971. In 1946 and 1947, Griff Davis visited the school, documenting
              daily student life at PMI for a 1947 photo-essay in <title render="italic"
                >Ebony</title> magazine. A copy of this article is in the Photographs and Papers
              series.</p>
            <p>The images show students in class and enjoying extra-curricular programs and
              recreation; school administrators, including President and founder Charlotte Hawkins
              Brown; and teachers. </p>

            <p>The close friendship between Griff Davis and Harlem Renaissance author Langston
              Hughes (1902-1967) began in Davis' college days and lasted for decades. They
              collaborated on journalistic projects, and Davis often accompanied Hughes as his

            <p>Many titles for these images were transcribed from a title list in the collection
              created by Griff Davis in the 1980s. Others were transcribed from captions in the
              publication where the images appeared. Some titles and captions have been extrapolated
              by library staff from similar titled images or from image content.</p>

            <p>These photographs, on cellulose nitrate and safety film, were taken by Davis for a
              photo-essay on Langston Hughes in <title render="italic">Ebony</title> magazine, and
              document Hughes in New York City in his apartment and backstage with theater and
              musical performers, and in Atlanta, visiting with students and faculty at Atlanta
              University and Morehouse College. Some of these images also appeared in biographies
              and other publications about Langston Hughes. Positive scans of the negative images
              are available for viewing through the links with each entry.</p>

                1940s. His costume indicates he was playing the role of George in "Set my people
                free." The <title render="italic">Ebony</title> article (photocopy of first page is
                located in the Photographs and Papers series) indicates this was his current role at
                the time the article was written.</p>

            <p>Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff were 20th century African American artists. Although
              they were known for their commissioned mural works, they also created paintings,
              sculptures, and other artworks.</p>
            <p>In the late 1940s Alston and Woodruff began work on a mural project commissioned by
              Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, which asked the artists to illustrate
              African American contributions to the settling of California. Alston worked with
              Woodruff on the murals in a large studio space in New York; they used ladders to reach
              the upper parts of the canvas. The mural consists of two panels: "Exploration and
              Colonization" by Alston and "Settlement and Development" by Woodruff. The murals were
              unveiled in 1949 at the Golden State Mutual Headquarters in Los Angeles.</p>

            <p>The images in this group, in safety film negative format, were taken by
              photojournalist Griff Davis in the late 1940s to document African American artists
              Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff as they worked in their New York City studio on a
              mural project for the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. The giant mural was
              commissioned by the Los Angeles-based African American-owned company to illustrate the
              historic role of African Americans in the settling of California. These studio photos
              feature the artists at work; other people - unidentified sitters and casual visitors -
              also appear in the photographs. There are also a handful of color images of some of
              Charles Alston's modernist paintings and one sculpture.</p>
