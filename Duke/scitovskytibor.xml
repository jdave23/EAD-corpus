      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection mainly documents the later years of Scitovsky's life through his
        correspondence and writings.</p>
      <p>The Correspondence, Financial, and Personal series consists primarily of routine
        professional correspondence to Scitovsky from academic institutions, publishers, colleagues,
        and friends. Many concern publications or invitations to events. There are a number of brief
        but interesting exchanges with other economists, including Moses Abramovitz, Benjamin M.
        Friedman, Paul Samuelson, Stanley K. Sheinbaum, and Robert Solow.</p>
      <p>The Writings and Speeches series contains material on selected writings and themes that
        Scitovsky worked on in his later years and includes clippings, drafts, articles, and
        numerous notes. Major academic works represented include <title render="italic">The Joyless
          Economy</title> and articles on market economies, inflation, growth and stagnation,
        consumer satisfaction (and dissatisfaction), marketing, affluence, and violence and boredom
        as social ills. Many of his other major works and earlier research are not represented. A
        series of photographs of Scitovky's family and home serve as companions to his unpublished
        memoirs, which detail life in northern Hungary for a family of nobility, as well as
        historical events in Hungary, France, and England, particularly before and during World War
        II. The memoirs also offer a detailed narrative of Scivovsky's emigration from Hungary to
        the US in the 1940s, as well as an account of the student protests in Paris in the
        1960s.</p>
      <p>The Printed Material series contains many of Scitovsky's reprinted articles and may prove
        to be the most useful series for researchers interested in his work.</p>

              institutions, publishers, colleagues, and friends. Many concern publications or
              invitations to events. There are several brief but interesting exchanges with other
              economists, including Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard, Moses Abramovitzof Stanford,
              Stanley Sheinbaum of Stanford, Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson of MIT, Louise Keely of
              Oxford, and H. W. Arndt, a specialist in economic development in the Pacific region;
              topics range from publications, economics issues, to wartime history and political
              events in the United States and Europe. There are also several short memoirs on life
              in New York City in the 1930s, and essays on financial capitalism, written and
              collected by Sheinbaum. Only in a handful of cases are the letters from Scitovsky
              himself. Included in this series is a set of undated correspondence on boredom, one of
              his later research topics, but other than that, his writings and research topics are
              rarely referenced in the correspondence; this information is best documented in the
              printed materials. Arranged in chronological order by year.</p>

          <p>The first group of files represents Scitovsky's last work on violence and its
            connection to social boredom. Other files contain drafts, lectures, clippings, articles,
            and notes for earlier research topics: consumer and human satisfaction; the US economy
            and social conditions; market economies; the problems of affluence; growth and
            stagnation; and inflation. Another grouping contains notes, drafts, and photographs that
            contributed to his memoirs, published in part under the title "A Proud Hungarian." The
            bulk of the material represents his research dating from the 1980s-2000; earlier works
            are best represented in their final published form in the Printed Material series.
            Materials within subgroupings are arranged in original order as received.</p>

          <p>A selection of reprints of Scitovsky's articles. In the early years, his research
            focused on economic theory, international finance and monopoly and competition. He
            progressed to prices under monopoly and competition, the theory of balance of payments
            adjustment, and economic welfare. Later writings analyzed growth in an affluent society,
            the US savings rate, the welfare of nations, and the benefits of asymmetric markets. In
            the years before his death, his focus shifted to violence, and in particular, boredom as
            the cause of violence. He referred to boredom as an "overlooked disease." Arranged
            chronologically.</p>
