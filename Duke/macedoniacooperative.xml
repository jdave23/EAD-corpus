         <abstract id="aspace_322e5d981584608d4fc7da5c2d650701">Founded in 1937 in Clarkesville
            (Habersham Co.), Ga. by Morris Randolph Mitchell; took name from nearby Baptist Church;
            comprised of families and individuals who worked collectively on the dairy,
            agricultural, forestry, and woodworking projects which provided the economic
            underpinnings of the community; originally an economic cooperative, Macedonia later
            passed through two distinct phases before its demise in 1958; at end of WWII an infusion
            of former civilian public service men, including conscientious objectors who had served
            prison sentences, joined the cooperative bringing an emphasis on pacifism; last stages
            of cooperative lasted from 1953-1957 when members of group explored the possibility of
            merging with the religious community known as the Society of Brothers (Bruderhof); in
            1958 Macedonia ceased to be a separate community and property was sold at public auction
            on June 27, 1958. Collection comprises 4 flyers regarding the various wooden block sets
            made by the community for children.</abstract>
