        profile (9 leaves, bound with a clip) John Capen prepared for Lydia Mather, touching on her
        constitution, temperament, character and her social preferences. He notes that she is in
        "danger of overworking" and has a strong domestic tendency; is cautious and sensitive, but
        not demonstrative; and has a good intellect, which is balanced by prudence and practicality
        that would make her an excellent businesswoman, if her life demanded it. He adds that she is
        conservative but not a bigot, has an excellent ear for music, and avoids attracting
        attention at all costs. The back of the cover holds an advertisement for Capen's
        business.</abstract>
