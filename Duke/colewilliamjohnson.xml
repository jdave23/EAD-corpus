            Ltd., in Barbaru, Assam, India. Cole signed his letters "Johnson." Collection comprises
            weekly letters Johnson wrote to his parents in England while he served as an engineer
            for a tea estate, and provides commentary written from a late-colonial perspective.
            There is information regarding the management of the tea estate, tea manufacture, tea
            prices and trade, and the transformation of work processes and personal lives by
            mechanization, the introduction of electricity, and brick making. In addition, Johnson
            wrote about local customs, labor, wildlife, weather, religious festivals, disease
            outbreaks (esp. cholera), and Indian politics. He also wrote about various engine
            repairs he undertook; transportation; his favorite pastimes (including hunting and
            playing polo); his various horses and pets; medical and dental treatments; people he
            met; as well as his activities in the volunteer British military guard, where he
            participated in military tests, drills, and sports, and served as Farrier Sergeant. His
            final letters contained extensive commentary on England's role in World War I, as well
            as the impact of the war on Assam. Includes a few postcards, one photograph, a clipping,
            and a tea invoice. There is also one undated letter written to Johnson by a native
            missionary who requested assistance.</abstract>
