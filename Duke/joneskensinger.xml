      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Kensinger Jones Papers, 1934-2001,</emph> document Jones's primary
        career as an executive for several major advertising agencies, including Leo Burnett
        Company, Campbell-Ewald Company, D.P. Brother and Company, Wilding Advertising, and William
        R.Biggs/Gilmore Associates; and his second career as a professor of advertising at Michigan
        State University. Materials consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, notes, reports,
        scripts, and audiovisual materials that document the development of print, radio, and
        television advertising campaigns for a wide variety of clients. The history and management
        of advertising companies in Chicago and Detroit in the United States, in Australia, and in
        Singapore is also represented. Major clients documented include Chevrolet, the Florida
        Citrus Commission, General Motors Corporation, and Oldsmobile. </p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Advertising Agencies Series, </emph>the largest, includes memoranda
        and correspondence related to the executive management of each agency and Jones's role in
        organizing and directing the creative activities of the agency or advertising team.
        Materials from Jones's work at the Leo Burnett Company consist primarily of office memoranda
        and weekly progress reports for radio and television commercials for clients such as: Mars,
        Incorporated; Kellogg Company; and the Green Giant Company. In Southeast Asia, Jones served
        as Regional Creative Director for Leo Burnett offices in Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur,
        Hong Kong and Bangkok. Materials include correspondence, speeches for creative seminars, and
        scripts for two films for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. Jones worked mainly with
        clients in the automotive industry, specifically Chevrolet at the Campbell-Ewald Company and
        Oldsmobile at D.P. Brother Company (as well as at Leo Burnett). Materials about General
        Motors relate to the potential of television specials for corporate advertising to promote
        the GM "Mark of Excellence" and the corporation's responsiveness to environmental and safety
        issues in the late sixties and seventies. Closely related to the Advertising Agencies
        Series, the <emph render="bold">Correspondence and Memoranda Series </emph>consists of
        carbons of outgoing correspondence from Jones, filed in chronological order with some
        memoranda.</p>
      <p>Nearly a third of the collection pertains to Jones's tenure from 1982-1995 as Lecturer in
        the Department of Advertising, the School of Communication Arts at Michigan State
        University. The <emph render="bold">Michigan State University (MSU) Series </emph>includes
        correspondence with colleagues and students, materials from academic conferences and MSU's
        Visiting Advertising Professional program, as well as copies of <title type="simple"
          render="doublequote">Impact,</title> the alumni newsletter for the Advertising Department.
        Of particular note are materials related to China and Taiwan in 1988 and 1990. The <emph
          render="bold">Course Materials Subseries </emph>details his advanced courses in creative
        advertising. In order to create a realistic, professional experience for the students, Jones
        assigned group projects that required students to create advertising campaigns or marketing
        strategies for national or state clients, local businesses, and university departments,
        including Archway Cookies, Oldsmobile, McDonalds, American Tourister, the Muskegon County
        Museum, and several MSU facilities and departments. The projects were presented to the class
        and evaluated not only by the client and Professor Jones, but also by the other
        students.</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Jones considered himself primarily to be a writer, and the <emph
          render="bold">Writings and Speeches Series </emph>reflects Jones's lifelong writing
        efforts. The series includes a wide variety of professional, personal, and unpublished
        writing: advertising presentations, speeches, articles, advertising seminars, scripts for
        radio programs and plays, poetry, an unpublished novel, and an autobiography. The <emph
          render="bold">Speeches Subseries </emph>and <emph render="bold">Published Articles
          Subseries </emph>document his creativity in advertising and his contributions to the
        industry as well as to local schools and organizations. Material in the <emph render="bold"
          >Personal Series</emph> demonstrates his activities with professional and civic
        organizations; in addition this series contains personal correspondence and materials about
        the life and career of Leo Burnett.</p>
      <p>Much of Jones's creative work in advertising was produced for the broadcast media,
        especially the early days of television advertising in the 1950s and 1960s. The <emph
          render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series </emph>includes film and sound materials that
        document television advertising and Jones's creative contributions to the professional
        education of his advertising colleagues. Because several of his most successful films about
        advertising or creativity originated as speeches with slides, these materials are
        particularly rich in conjunction with related materials in the <emph render="bold">Writings
          and Speeches Series.</emph>

          <p>Arranged in subseries for each agency where Jones worked; subseries appear
            chronologically by the date that Jones first worked at each agency. This series consists
            primarily of office memoranda, correspondence, scripts for advertising presentations to
            clients, scripts for television or radio commercials, newspaper and magazine articles,
            and a few photographs. An Information Folder found in the inventory drawer at the Rare
            Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library contains additional biographical data
            and a description of Jones's positions with each agency. See individual subseries for
            more specific arrangement notes.</p>

            <p>Arranged alphabetically by major subject categories that correspond to Jones's work
              as Creative Director and Executive Vice-President. Major accounts include Chevrolet,
              General Motors, Florida Citrus Commission, and other new business prospects. Many of
              the files pertain to the operation and reorganization of the Creative Department as
              well as the management of the agency, when Jones served on the Executive Committee.
              Several Chevrolet film commercials won awards at notable advertising competitions. The
              papers also reflect Jones's focus on professional development -- coordinating seminars
              within the agency, writing articles, and presenting workshops with state, regional,
              and national advertising organizations. One effort resulted in the <title
                type="simple" render="doublequote">Creativity</title> film, later renamed the <title
                type="simple" render="doublequote">Horse and the Fiddle.</title> Another, <title
                type="simple" render="doublequote">Whatever Happened to Mrs. Momiyama,</title>
              related the role of advertising in a free economy and the resurgence of the Japanese
              economy after WWII. Both a filmstrip and a film version were distributed by the
              American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) to high schools and colleges. See

              consulting work and includes correspondence, memos, brochures, and scripts for several
              projects. Of particular note are the Ford Marketing Institute seminars on advertising
              and marketing presented to car dealers, often at the annual National Automotive
              Dealers Association meetings. Included are the transcripts of interviews with several
              successful car dealers, which were used in the 1980 seminars. See also the <emph
                render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series </emph>for film versions of the
              seminars.</p>

            <p>Arranged chronologically by academic quarter and by course, the <emph render="bold"
                >Course Materials Subseries</emph> pertains primarily to two advanced courses:
              Advertising 417-"Advanced Creative Strategy and Execution" and Advertising
              441-"TV-Radio Advertising." For most courses, Jones taught over fifty students,
              divided into two sections. Other courses include: Advertising 317-"Creative Strategy
              and Execution" and after 1989-1990, Advertising 492-"Advanced Copywriting." For each
              course, a "Course Materials" folder typically includes a syllabus, a midterm and final
              exam, and for the later years, a coursepak of readings. </p>
            <p>Subsequent course folders pertain to student projects and are titled with the name
              and location of the particular advertising client or product assigned for the course.
              Materials typically include: 1) background information on the client or product; 2)
              student reports often with creative illustrations and sample advertising; 3)
              evaluations of the group presentations by the client, by Jones, and by the other
              students; and 4) peer evaluations of individual contributions to the group. During
              some courses, students produced video or audio tapes. On occasion, selected student
              projects were presented at state or regional competitions. (A folder at the beginning
              of this subseries contains chronological and alphabetical listings of the student
              project assignments.)</p>
