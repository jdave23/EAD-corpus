      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>James David Barber was born in 1930 in Charleston, W. Va. and went on to receive his B.A.
        and M.A. from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. from Yale University. After teaching
        at Yale for several years, he joined the faculty of Duke's Political Science Department as
        Chair in 1972. Barber was well known as a presidential scholar and published numerous books
        including <title type="simple" render="italic">The Presidential Character: Predicting
          Performance in the White House</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Pulse of
          Politics: Electing Presidents in the Media Age</title>, <title type="simple"
          render="italic">Politics by Humans: Research on American Leadership</title> and <title
          type="simple" render="italic">The Book of Democracy</title>. He served as chair of Amnesty
        International U.S.A. during the mid-1980s. He remained a community activist in Durham after
        his retirement from Duke in 1995, helping to raise money for various causes. He died in 2004
        at the age of 74.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>Entitled "My Life," the scrapbook contains nine sections: My Main Vita, My Books,
        Professors Blessing Me, My Early Life, My Teaching, My Work to Help Duke University, My
        Coming Forth for Politics, Some Things I Have Done for Humans, and Pictures. It reflects
        Professor Barber's work as an educator, author and activist. A substantial portion of the
        scrapbook contains letters from Barber's former students at Duke. In these letters, the
        students evaluated Barber's courses in political science. Also included are typescripts of
        Barber's "What Duke Can Be" and "Duke's Constitution," letters to Barber upon his retirement
        from Duke and family pictures. </p>
      <p>This scrapbook is a xerox copy made by James David Barber in 1996 (includes color scans).
        The original remains with his family.</p>
