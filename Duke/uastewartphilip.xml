      <abstract id="aspace_d83459b4a7e264d2dc91b2eb108f28ed">Philip Stewart is a professor emeritus
        of Romance Studies at Duke University. Stewart served on the Subcommittee on Library
        Relations, which was convened by Duke's Academic Council in September 1981 as part of a
        faculty initiative to study the potential impact of locating the Richard Nixon Presidential
        Library on the university campus. Materials in this collection primarily relate to the
        research of the Library Subcommittee, and include correspondence from Duke President Terry
        Sanford, who initiated the Nixon Library proposal in August 1981; correspondence from Duke
        faculty and trustees; press clippings; Academic Council meeting minutes; and the Library
        Subcommittee's report to the Academic Council. The collection also contains research and
        reports from the Academic Council's Subcommittee on Governance, another group formed in the
        wake of the Nixon Library proposal.</abstract>

      <p>In early August 1981, Duke University President Terry Sanford told Duke faculty that he had
        opened negotiations to house the Presidential Library of Richard Nixon – a Duke Law School
        alumnus – on the Duke campus. In response, Duke's Academic Council, which represented
        faculty interests, formed two major committees to discuss how the decision was made and to
        propose the direction of future negotiations regarding the Nixon Library: the Subcommittee
        on Governance and the Subcommittee on Library Relations.</p>
      <p>Philip Stewart, then a professor in the Department of Romance Studies, served on the
        Academic Council's Subcommittee on Library Relations, charged on September 17, 1981, to
        answer the question: "Can a Nixon Presidential Library be developed at Duke that does not
        compromise the integrity of Duke University?" The subcommittee examined several areas of
        Duke's intersection with the proposed library, including use of land, the library's
        potential scholarly value, and whether the library would have a museum component. The
        Library Subcommittee submitted its report to the Academic Council on October 21, 1981, with
        recommendations on conditions to be met in order for negotiations to proceed.</p>
      <p>Philip Stewart was born May 21, 1940. He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1967,
        and came to teach at Duke in 1972. Stewart's books include <title>Imitation and Illusion in
          the French Memoir-Novel, 1700-1750</title> (1969), <title>Engraven Desire: Eros, Image,
          and Text in the French Eighteenth Century</title> (1992), and <title>Editer Rousseau:
          Enjeux d'un Corpus, 1750-2012</title> (2012). He has also produced and edited a number of
        translations and critical editions in the field of French literature. Stewart is a former
        president of the American Association of Teachers of French and was selected for membership
        in the Ordre des Palmes Académiques, a French society that honors educators in French
        language and culture. As of August 2016, he is Benjamin E. Powell Professor Emeritus of
        Romance Studies at Duke University.</p>
