      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection documents John Ridlon's medical career and consists of medical case files,
        casebooks, articles and papers, correspondence, photographic materials, diplomas and
        ephemera, and medical illustrations relating to Ridlon's research and writings on
        orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include tubercular infection
        of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal arthritis), and limb or
        joint injuries. There are hundreds of medical illustrations in the form of photographs
        mounted on card stock, photographic prints of early X-rays, and printed illustrations on
        loose sheets that show patients, symptoms or deformities, and treatments such as surgery,
        braces and casts; many of them were used by Ridlon in his published works.</p>
      <p>Among the bound volumes are six casebooks (1889-1892); four letterbooks (1873-1903); an
        autograph manuscript, "Some comments on the principles and practice of Hugh Owen Thomas"
        (undated); a scrapbook of figures and illustrations (undated); three volumes composed of
        reprint clippings and manuscript notes (undated); and a bound volume of 88 reprints
        (1888-1923). There are also many diplomas and certificates received by Ridlon from various
        educational institutions.</p>
      <p>Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E.
        Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, H. Cushing. In addition
        to discussing medical cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with
        two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the
        Country Home for Convalescent Children.</p>
      <p>Accompanying the professional papers is a set of 118 black-and-white photographs taken
        during Ridlon's service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. The
        photos were taken by several photographers at a medico-military training camp in
        Plattsburgh, N.Y., around 1916. Ridlon reported on these experiences at a medical conference
        in 1917 and used a set of 67 glass lantern slides to illustrate the lecture, 49 of which
        survive in the collection; a reprint of this paper is also available in the collection. </p>
      <p>In the same series there is a set of 30 glass plate negatives and still image nitrate film
        negatives (restricted); these materials are closed to use but contain duplicate or similar
        images found in the print photographs. Finally, there are several portraits of Ridlon,
        chiefly photographs taken in his office and examination room, taken in 1911. A glass plate
        negative with a bust portrait of Ridlon rounds out the photographic series.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains several folders of ephemera, early professional diplomas and
        certificates, letters of recommendation for Ridlon's Chicago appointment in 1892, and his
        obituary.</p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.</p>

          <p>Folders of case summaries maintained by Dr. Ridlon, most of them dating from 1900 to
            1915. At least half are pediatric cases. Cases include Pott's disease (tuberculosis of

            the joints, other joint diseases and injuries, and congenital deformities. </p>
          <p>Case summaries are typically one to two pages long, and include patient names, ages,

            other documents such as referral letters and records of tests such as urinalyses are

          <p>Contains 118 black-and-white photographs of the first medical military training camp at
            Plattsburgh, N.Y., circa 1916. Camp scenes include cook stations, mules and wagons, a
            water truck, machine gun pits, headquarters tents, officers and privates, and scenes
            from drills and reviews of infantry and cavalry. Several photographs show Ridlon during
            litter drills. Most of the prints are captioned, with some names present on the backs. </p>
          <p>Accompanying the photo prints is a set of 49 lantern slides bearing black-and-white
            positive images of scenes from the Plattsburgh medical camp, most if not all of which
            are duplicated in the photographic prints in this same series. The original slide set
            numbered 67 slides. Accompanying the slides is a lecture script presented by John Ridlon
            at a conference in 1917, describing the camp and the American preparedness for war with
            respect to military medicine. The lecture text is a photocopy from reprint #82 in the
            volume <title render="italic">Collected Papers of Dr. John Ridlon</title>, also found in
            this collection). </p>
          <p>Also in this series are 30 glass plate negatives which, like the lantern slides,
            contain duplicate images found in the photographs folders.</p>
          <p>A set of nitrate negatives originally in the collection was digitized and then
            deaccessioned in 2023. Those images are only available in digital format. </p>
          <p>The series is rounded out by three postcards from the camp at Plattsburgh; a glass
            plate negative bearing a bust portrait of Ridlon; three photographic studio portraits of
            Ridlon; two photographs of him seated at a desk in his office, and two of him in his
            examination room, one of which is a duplicate. A wall calendar seen in one image shows
            1911 as the probable year the clinic photographs were taken. </p>

            <p>These lantern slides contain positive images of a military-medical training camp in
              Plattsburgh, N.Y., where Ridlon spent some time probably in 1916. The accompanying
              lecture text indicates there were originally 67 lantern slides; 49 survived and are in
              this series. About half were created for Ridlon by the Victor Animatograph Corporation
              of Davenport, Iowa (founded in 1910). </p>
            <p>Duplicate images for most or all of these slides can be found in the photographs
              series. Slides measure 3 1/4 x 4 1/2 inches and are in excellent condition.</p>
