        ethnologist, and enslaver with a medical practice in Mobile, Alabama. Collection consists of
        two letters and one note, written by Nott from Mobile. The 1839 letter speaks of payment for
        services and financial difficulties; the 1855 letter comments favorably on a work by Arthur
        de Gobineau on the theory of racial differences, published in French in the U.S. in 1855,
        which upheld the superiority of the "Aryan race" and thus promoted slavery as a just and
        moral system. Nott mentions in the 1855 letter that he had hired a "young friend" to help
        with the translation of Gobineau's work into English, which was published in 1856 in a much
        shortened and edited form. The undated note asks about the suitability of evening attire.

      <p>Josiah Clark Nott (1804-1873), born in South Carolina, was a surgeon, ethnologist, and
        specialist in infectious disease vectors; his first practice was established in Mobile,
        Alabama in 1833. He was an enslaver and was a well-known instigator of racist theories of
        white supremacy; together with Henry Hotze, he translated Arthur de Gobineau's book, "An
        Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races," from French into English.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection contains two letters and a note written by physician and ethnologist Josiah
        Clark Nott. The first letter was written from Alabama on October 13, 1839 to a George Poe,
        Jr. in Summerville; in it, Nott comments on payment for services and asks for a financial
        favor, reporting that his office has been "burnt out." The second letter, October 11, 1855,
        reports favorably on a book by Arthur de Gobineau on the inequalities between races
        (published by Lippincott in 1855), a work that advanced the notion of the superiority of the
        Aryan race and thus claimed that slavery was a moral and just system. Nott comments that he
        has hired a "young friend of mine" to translate the French work into English (it was
        published in 1856), and that it is a "bold, original, and altother a thinking book." The
        undated note inquires about appropriate attire for an evening engagement.</p>
      <p>The two letters were removed from a book by Josia Clark Nott and George R. Gliddon: <title

        Grambo &amp; Co., 1854. This book has been cataloged separately as part of the holdings of
