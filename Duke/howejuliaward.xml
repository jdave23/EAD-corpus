      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection comprises a letter (dated 1909 September 22) from Julia Ward Howe to Magister
        H.R. Sanborn of Concord, Massachusetts. The letter was written from Green Peace, Bedford,
        New York (Howe's son's house). The main topic of the letter is Howe's unnamed poem which she
        will read at the upcoming Hudson-Fulton celebration on the evening of the 27th. The
        Hudson-Fulton Celebration was held in New York and New Jersey from September 25 to October
        9, 1909. The purpose was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson’s discovery of
        the Hudson River and the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton’s first use of the paddle
        steamer on the Hudson in 1807. Howe also mentions the books she has been reading. Included
        with the letter is an additional envelope addressed to J.L. Sanborn of Bradford,
        Massachusetts. It appears to have contained Howe's letter and been sent a few days
        later.</p>
