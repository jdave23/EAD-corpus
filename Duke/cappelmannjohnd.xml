            Co.), S.C. Represented the county for two terms in the state's general assembly; member
            of the Confederate Army's German Artillery; and member of the Charleston City Council
            under T.T. Hyde. Also, officer in the National German American Alliance and active in
            the United Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the South. Married Julia Pieper
            in 1882. Collection primarily comprises printed material related to John D. Cappelmann's
            numerous activities. Includes advertisements, church bulletins, invitations, tickets,
            and programs for balls, orations, literary society meetings, concerts, dances,
            baccalaureate exercises, recitals, and bicycle races. In addition, there are notices for
            events and general orders concerning the German Artillery, as well as information on
            other Confederate memorial events. There are also drafts of legislation for the General
            Assembly; copies of Charleston City Council minutes, local election campaign materials,
            bank organizing documents, as well as annual reports and other records regarding the
            Carolina Mutual Insurance Company, Parker Cotton Mills Company, and the Georgia State
            Building &amp; Loan Association of Savannah. Charleston organizations represented
            include the Star Gospel Mission, and The Knights of Pythias; other organizations
            represented include the YMCA and the German University League. Topics of interest
            include the peace movement during World War I; the anti-German and anti-German American
            sentiment of the period; Lutheranism in the early twentieth-century South, especially
            regarding the Sunday School movement. The collection contains only a few personal
            letters written to Cappelmann; the majority of letters to him contain solicitations for
            monetary support, mostly to benefit various local and national Lutheran entities. A few
            items reference Cappelmann's children, John D., F. William, E. Henry, and Gertrude.
            Contains several items published in German, as well as a folder of biographical
            information. Several items postdate Cappelmann's death, and their immediate connection
            to the collection is unclear.</abstract>
