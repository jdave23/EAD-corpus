      <p>F. Vester was probably Frederick Vester, who was a member of the American Colony in
        Jerusalem, a religious community founded by American emigrÃ© Christians Horatio Gates
        Spafford (1828-1888) and Anna T. Spafford, and perpetuated by their daughter, Bertha
        Spafford Vester, and others. Frederick Vester helped form the Photo department in the
        Colony.</p>
