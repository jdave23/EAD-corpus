Anna Letitia Barbauld was an English woman of letters who had great professional success at a time when women writers were still something of an anomaly. She is remembered for her poetry, children's literature, essays, criticism, and editorial works. She was rediscovered when feminist literary critics examined her place in British literary history.

Both poems were aimed at a juvenile audience. It is likely that their common interests and close proximity led them to develop a friendship. Although this was written towards the end of Barbauld's life, it is evidence that they still had at least an epistolary relationship in 1823.
Bates Worldwide advertising agency (Bates) was established in 1940 by former executives of the Benton & Bowles agency. It grew to become one of the largest agencies in the U.S. until its demise in 2003. Bates began as a simple proprietorship, but as the company grew its organizational structure took on different forms: a partnership, then a corporation before becoming a publicly traded transnational entity, and finally becoming a subsidiary in a global holding company. From the 1970s on, Bates' growth and international expansion was fueled by a long series of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that continued until the company was itself acquired, first by the Saatchi & Saatchi and later by the WPP Group. Materials in the collection relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities, including Ted Bates & Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates, and Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and Draft) and parent organizations (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi & Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the late 20th century. The Bates Worldwide, Inc. Records spans the years 1934-2003 and includes correspondence, corporate policy manuals, photographs, publications, graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic records and videocassettes that document the activities of this major global advertising agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates built its early reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for promoting pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common household goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising policies developed around a philosophy Bates called the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an imperative to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason for consumers to use any given product or service. As the company grew into a global business, USP evolved into more complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients included Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation, Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the combined U.S. Armed Services, M&M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing Company, Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on the company's founder, Ted Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and the chief architect of the USP concept.

Autograph manuscript letter with postmarked envelope from the actress and writer Fanny Kemble in London to Miss Patteson in Andover, 10 May, 1889. Kemble thanks Miss Patteson for sending photographs, mentioning that she particularly values one of Bishop Patteson. She says she is "glad Lord Coleridge thought Lenox (Mass.) pretty. It has always seemed to me a charming mountain village." Frances Anne "Fanny" Kemble was a British actress, writer, and abolitionist. She was born into a theater family; her acting career spanned the years 1829-1868. Kemble acted to support herself, but she was most passionate about writing, and was an accomplished playwright, poet, and diarist. She married the Pierce Mease Butler, an American who subsequently inherited his family' plantations. After spending time in Georgia, Kemble became an abolitionist and later divorced her husband. In 1863, Kemble published her anti-slavery memoir, Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, which is said to have influenced the British against supporting the Confederacy in the Civil War. Kemble's own family was divided on that issue, as her elder daughter sided with her mother, while her younger daughter returned to Georgia with her father. Frances Butler Leigh published Ten Years on a Georgia Plantation Since the War (1883) as a rebuttal to her mother's memoir. Kemble's success as a Shakespearean actress enabled her to buy a cottage in Lenox, Massachusetts. Her correspondent, Miss Patteson, is the daughter of Frances Duke Patteson, a niece of the poet Samuel Coleridge Taylor; the Lord Coleridge mentioned in the letter is John Duke Coleridge (1820-1894), the 2nd Lord Chief Justice of England. Bishop Patteson refers to Miss Patteson's sister, John Patteson (1827-1871), who became an Anglican martyr after being killed doing mission work in the Solomon Islands.

Americans for Immigrant Justice (formerly Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC)) is a not-for-profit legal assistance organization dedicated to protecting and promoting the basic human rights of immigrants of all nationalities.
Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC) was founded in 1996 because of pending restrictions and funding cuts to Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funded agencies, which prevented many organizations in the state of Florida from serving the immigrant population. Sweeping changes in immigration law and welfare reform also increased the demand for services from FIAC. In 2011 After 15 years of helping immigrants obtain legal status, successfully litigating their unjust treatment and pressing for constructive immigration laws and policy, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC) became Americans for Immigrant Justice (AI Justice for short and Americanos Por Justicia Inmigrante in Spanish) to better reflect the national focus and depth of their work.

Susan B. Anthony was born February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. She was brought up in a Quaker family with long activist traditions. Early in her life she developed a sense of justice and moral zeal. After teaching for fifteen years, she became active in temperance. Because she was a woman, she was not allowed to speak at temperance rallies. This experience, and her acquaintance with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, led her to join the women's rights movement in 1852. Soon after, she dedicated her life to woman suffrage. Ignoring opposition and abuse, Anthony traveled, lectured, and canvassed across the nation for the vote. She also campaigned for the abolition of slavery, the right for women to own their own property and retain their earnings, and she advocated for women's labor organizations. In 1900, Anthony persuaded the University of Rochester to admit women. Anthony, who never married, was aggressive and compassionate by nature. She had a keen mind and a great ability to inspire. She remained active until her death on March 13, 1906.
The American Ophthalmological Society was founded in 1864 and is currently based in San Francisco, California.
Anne Baker received her B.A. in Social Welfare from S.I.U. Edwardsville in 1975. She went on to work at the Planned Parenthood of St. Louis from 1975-1976. Baker received her M.A. in Counseling Psychology from Lindenwood College. In 1995, she published Abortion and Options Counseling: A Comprehensive Reference. Baker worked as a counselor and later the Director of Counseling at the Hope Clinic for Women in Granite City, Illinois from 1976-2012.
The collection also contains significant records of the Hope Clinic in Granite City, Illinois. The Hope Clinic was founded in 1974 with Dr. Hector Zevallos as the medical director. The clinic was bombed and subsequently rebuilt in 1982. Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife Rosalie Jean Zevallos were kidnapped by an anti-abortion terrorist group called the Army of God. They were released eight days later. The Hope Clinic remains in operation today, although the counseling wing of the clinic was disbanded in 2012 due to budget cuts.
English businessman and schoolmaster.
U.S. consul official and newspaper editor and publisher.
Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825) was an English writer, teacher, and editor who published poetry, works for children, literary criticism, and essays. She was a successful writer at a time when women professional writers were an anomaly. Her first book of poems (1773) established her literary reputation in England, and her later essays were compared to Samuel Johnson. Along with her husband, Barbauld ran the boy's school Palgrave Academy for 11 years, during which time she established herself as a writer of children's pedagogical texts, as well as poetry for children. She is credited with establishing children's literature as a legitimate genre, and her editorial works, particularly The British Novelists series, helped establish the British literary canon. Barbauld was an abolitionist and was also against the Napoleonic Wars, two subjects she addressed in her political writing. Both her poetry and her political essays were occasionally subject to harsh contemporary criticism, which eventually caused her to retreat from the public eye. She lived in Stoke Newington from 1802 until her death in 1825. Barbauld's literary legacy was largely forgotten until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the late 20th century, which helped resurrect her place in history.
William Allen (1770-1843) was an English Quaker abolitionist, scientist, educator, and philanthropist who was active in various social reform movements of early 19th century England. He was trained as a chemist, and his pharmaceutical company, Allen & Hanburys, grew into one of the UK's largest drug companies. One year after this poem was written, he founded the Newington Academy for Girls, a progressive school in Stoke Newington. Although Barbauld was near the end of her life at the time of this writing, is it evidence that she and Allen maintained at least an epistolatory friendship based on their common interests.

Raymond C. Battalio (1938-2004) and John B. Van Huyck (1956-2014) were both white American academic economists who spent their entire careers at Texas A&M University (TAMU; 1969-2004 and 1984-2014, respectively).
Battalio earned a BS in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1966 and a MS and PhD from Purdue University in 1968 and 1970, respectively, where he was supervised by Robert Basmann. He was one of the 12 founders of the Economic Science Association (ESA) in 1986 and served as its third president from 1988-1989, and he and Van Huyck founded the Economic Research Laboratory in 1997. He was married to Nancy Battalio, had three sons (Robert, Joe, and Eric Battalio), and was a US Navy veteran.
Van Huyck was the Rex B. Grey Professor of Economics at TAMU. He earned a BA in economics from the University of Virginia in 1979 and an MA and PhD from Brown University in 1982 and 1986, respectively, where he was supervised by Herschel Grossman. He was also active in the ESA and served as a board member. He was married to Patsy Johnson, had three sons (Carl Phillips, Don Ashfield, and Bjorn Bennett Van Huyck), and was a Cub Scout den leader.
Battalio began designing experiments in the 1970s to test consumer demand theory in token economies with John Kagel, and he also studied individual choice behavior in pigeons, rats, and humans; this work had broad appeal and was widely published in economics and psychology journals.
Van Huyck's early work was on sovereign debt and macroeconomics with Herschel Grossman, and it led him to develop an interest in coordination failures and studying these specifically through experiments with Battalio.
They are primarily known for their lab work on the problem of multiple equilibria in game theory. Along with Richard Biel, they carried out a series of experiments on coordination that began with the minimum-effort coordination game in 1990. Among their other experiments were ones on the emergence of conventions, chaotic dynamics, decentralized allocation, and average opinion and peasant-dictator games.

Outdoor advertising executive with Southern Outdoor Markets and Associates of the Bell Company firms, based in Atlanta, Ga. Graduate, University of Missouri School of Journalism; Account Executive, Institute of Outdoor Advertising 1960; Executive Sales Manager, Outdoor Advertising Inc. 1964; founder and President, Southern Outdoor Markets 1965, renamed Associates of the Bell Company (ABC) 1974; awarded Ray Vahue Award/Marketing Award of Merit by OAAA 1985; ABC acquired by Bill Wilkins 1987, renamed Wilkins Media Company 1999.
1830 Born Liverpool, England
1848 Began photographic career working for his brother-in-law's daguerreotype studio in Philadelphia
1872 Served as photographer for the Wheeler Survey, West of the 100th Meridian
1910 Died in Philadelphia, Pa.
In 1872, William Bell, a photographer from Philadelphia, found employment on a survey team established by the Army and formally titled: "U.S. Geographical and Geological Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, under the command of Lieutenant George M. Wheeler." Bell had been hired by Wheeler to replace Timothy O'Sullivan, another expeditionary photographer, who participated in the Wheeler survey of 1871 and returned in 1873.
Perhaps because William Bell participated in only one expedition, a limited amount of biographical information has been recorded for him, and that information is often vague. William Bell has most often been confused with another photographer Dr. William A. Bell (1841-1920) who served on the Palmer Expedition of 1867 for which William Jackson Palmer surveyed a route through the southwest for the Kansas Pacific Railroad.
William Bell may have fought in the US-Mexican War and for the Union in the Civil War.
Some sources have also indicated that William Bell was appointed chief photographer of the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., where he may have made photographs of soldiers wounded in the Civil War.
The Beloved Community Center, located in Greensboro, N.C.,. is an organization dedicated to social activism and uplift in the Greensboro area. Founded by three reverends in 1991, the center's mission of social justice is based on Dr. Martin Luther King's vision of a "beloved community."
Bryant Bennett was a merchant and planter residing in Williamston, North Carolina (in Martin County).
Mainly comprised of German and Eastern European immigrants as well as Russian-Jewish cigarette rollers, the Durham Hebrew Congregation organized in 1887 and rented a hall on Main Street. James B. Duke had formed a contract with Ukrainian immigrant Moses Gladstein to bring over a hundred workers from New York to roll cigarettes in Duke's tobacco factories. Duke automated the factory in 1884 and dismissed the Jewish workers. Most returned north, but several, including Gladstein, chose to remain and opened stores in Durham. As the population continued to slowly grow, the congregation formally chartered in 1892 and hired a rabbi. In 1905 they purchased a small, wood-framed church on Liberty Street, which became Durham's first synagogue. By 1910 the Jewish population in the area had reached approximately 305.
After the First World War, the congregation built a large, cathedral-style synagogue downtown at the intersection of Holloway and Queen Streets. Upon its dedication in 1921, they took the name Beth El Congregation. The congregation remained Orthodox throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1948 hired a rabbi who was a member of the conservative movement. Despite significant internal tensions, the congregation shed its dominant orthodoxy by the mid 1950s. The congregation broke ground on a new, contemporary "American" synagogue on Watts and Markham Streets in 1957; the old structure became the Bethel Baptist Church with a primarily African American congregation. Durham took over and demolished the building in the late 1960s for urban renewal. The location is now the northwest corner of WTVD, the local ABC news affiliate for Durham.
By its centennial year, 1987, the congregation was known as Beth El Synagogue, and had not only successfully created a strategy to accommodate both its modern leanings and orthodox heritage but also helped create other Jewish congregations such as Judea Reform. Beth El had also embraced women as ritual and lay leaders in the 1970s, and the creation of the adjacent Freedman Center in 1987 allowed the congregation to further expand its community service and social action programs. Today, as part of a Jewish population of approximately 8,000 in the Durham-Chapel Hill community, Beth El defines itself as "a vibrant, dynamic community led by a volunteer board, enriched with the teachings of many dedicated community members."

Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher, emigrated to the United States from England in 1832, with his wife Hannah (Lane), eight children, and a governess. Their youngest child was born in New York City; they moved to Newark, N.J., then to Cincinnati, Ohio. Of the nine children, three are represented in this collection, Anna Blackwell, the poet, translator, and journalist; Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910), the pioneering physician; and Henry B. Blackwell (1825-1909), an editor, journalist, and businessman. Also represented is his wife, suffragist Lucy Stone, and their daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell. In addition, there are materials from Lucy's niece, Emma Stone Lawrence, who eventually married George Washington Blackwell, another of the nine children of Samuel and Hannah Blackwell. There are items from their daughter, Anna M. Blackwell, who went on to marry Charles Belden, librarian of the Massachusetts State Library, in 1908, as well as from Helen Thomas Blackwell, who married Anna‚Äôs brother, Howard.

F√©lix Bonfils (1831-1885) was a French-born photographer who migrated to Beirut, Lebanon around 1867, where he opened a studio named "Maison Bonfils" together with his wife, Lydie Bonfils (1837-1918), who was also a photographer. They changed the name to Bonfils et Cie in 1878. Studio assistants included the Bonfils's son Adrien (1860-1929), who in 1878 took over the photographic work while his parents ran the studios, and the Syrian brothers Georges and Louis Saboungi.
The studio produced photographic views of Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Greece, totaling an estimated 15,000 single prints; they were also sold as stereographic views and in albums. They became much sought after by tourists and publishers, and in the wake of this success, other Bonfils studios opened in Alexandria, Cairo, and in Al√©s, France, where F√©lix Bonfils died in 1885. His son Adrien and wife Lydie continued to operate the studios; Adrien quit the business sometime around 1900, but Lydie continued to manage it until World War I forced her to flee Beirut in 1916, taking many of the Bonfils plates and prints with her.

After graduating from Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles with a BFA in Advertising Design, Boston and his brother Brad Boston, formed their own ad and design agency Boston & Boston Design in 1967. In 1969, Boston started working for the ad agency Botsford Ketchum. During his eight years with Botsford Ketchum, Boston worked with clients such as Pentel, Motorola, and Yamaha. Simultaneously he started Archie Boston Graphic Design, an advertising and design agency. In 1977, Boston received his Master's Degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Southern California and was hired as a lecturer in the Department of Art at California State University Long Beach (CSULB) where he was a member of the Design department which included the Visual Communication Design Program. He chaired the graphic design program for 12 of his 32 years before retiring in 2009. He was the first African-American elected president of the Los Angeles Art Directors Club, where he served two terms. Boston published two memoirs -- Fly in the Buttermilk: Memoirs of an African American in Advertising Design & Design Education (2001) and Lil' Colored Rascals in the Sunshine City (2009). He has also produced two historical documentaries, 20 Outstanding Los Angeles Designers and The Black Pioneers of the Sunshine City.

Herbert Clarence Bradshaw (1908-1976) was born on 7 November 1908 in Rice, Virginia. He graduated with a BA from Hampden-Sydney College in 1930, an MA in classical languages from the University of Virginia in 1933, and a LittD degree from Hampden-Sydney in 1967.
For twenty years, he taught and served as a principal in Virginia, and he later taught journalism at North Carolina State University. He became a full-time journalist circa 1949 as Sunday Feature Editor of the Durham Morning Herald and was Editorial Page Leader from 1964 until retiring in December 1973. After, he served as Contributing Editor of the Winston-Salem Journal and as a member of the Durham Redevelopment Commission. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Human Betterment League of NC, which promoted eugenics, and was President at the time of his death.
Bradshaw was killed on 22 December 1976 while helping his wife (Mildred Elizabeth Cunningham) wash dishes in their Durham home. James Willie Grace, a Durham native and convicted felon who was likely dealing with untreated schizophrenia, carried out a series of random shootings around Durham from December 10-22 (one other man was killed). He was arrested on 28 December and later convicted on three charges of felonious assault with intent to kill.
Bradshaw is the author of The History of Prince Edward County, Virginia (1955), History of Hampden-Sydney College, vol. I (1976), History of Farmville, VA (1948), Toward the Dawn: History of the First Quarter-Century of the NC State Association for the Blind, 1934-1960 (1961), and fifty articles from 1935-1976 on the histories of the Baptist Church, the Lions organization, and organizations for the blind in NC, and historical pieces on such topics as Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and historic houses.
The minister who authored these sermons was undoubtedly a member of the Methodist Church South, and from church appointment records he is almost certainly John Luke Bray. According to Bray's obituary in the Virginia Conference Annual (1938), he was born in 1871 in Gloucester County, Virginia to John and Sarah Luke Bray, and entered the Methodist ministry in the Virginia Conference at the age of 18. He was at Randolph-Macon College for an unspecified period but did not graduate. At some point he was reportedly Superintendent of the Masonic Orphanage in Richmond. He married Pauline Clements of Gloucester, Virginia early in his career. In 1901 he left for the West, and seems to have been minister of the Methodist Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma (then Indian territory) in 1906. He returned to Virginia in 1907; a year later Taylor University in Indiana had conferred on him the Divinity Degree. Going by the sermons that survive in this collection, by 1911 he was preaching in Virginia. His first appointment may have been in Lambert's Point, Virginia (near Norfolk). He then was appointed to various large congregations in Richmond and the Norfolk area, then migrated to smaller churches in Southern Virginia. He died in 1938, perhaps in Crewe, Virginia, a small community where he held his last appointment, and is buried in Richmond.
Lydia L. Brennan ran a photographic business, the Elite Studio in Butte, Montana, until December 1896, when she sold the business to J. W. Nelson. Brennan married John N. Kirk, a Butte lawyer.
Earl Ivan Brown, civil engineer, was born at County Line, Georgia, on 13 October 1874 and graduated 6th in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1898. As a member of the Corps of Engineers, Brown served in both the Philippines and Cuba during and after the Spanish-American War. He participated in the Philippine Insurrection and the Moro Expedition before traveling to the Caribbean for the Cuban Pacification in 1906. During World War I, Brown was the 92nd Division Engineer in the American Expeditionary Forces. Throughout his career Brown developed river and harbor improvements in the United States. He worked principally on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and on the Ohio River. Brown also worked on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and finished his career in 1938 as the Division Engineer of the South Atlantic Division.
Colonel Earl I. Brown died on 25 June 1963 in Durham, North Carolina at age 88. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Brown was the son of William F. and Emily Absilla (Hagen) Brown. He was married to Annie Thompson who died in 1953, and then to Marylily Fisher. His nephew, Earl Ivan Brown, II, was a professor of Civil Engineering at Duke University from 1960 to 1982.
Frank Clyde Brown (1870-1943) served as a Professor of English at Trinity College, Duke University, from 1909 until his death. A native of Virginia, he received his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1908. While at Duke University he served in many capacities, including chairman of his department, University Marshal, and Comptroller of the University during its initial construction. These aspects of his life are chronicled in his papers held by the Duke University Archives.
This collection of materials, however, is concerned with activities to which he devoted equal time and energy, the organization of the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913 and his personal effort to gather and record the nuances and culture of "folk" of North Carolina and its near neighbors, which occupied him from 1912 until his death. Under the impetus of a 1912 mailing from John A. Lomax, then President of the American Folklore Society, Brown as well as other faculty members and other citizens in North Carolina, became interested in folklore and organized the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913, with Brown as secretary-treasurer. As secretary-treasurer of this organization from its inception until his death, he provided the organizational impetus behind the Society.
Through his course in folklore at Duke, he also sent class after class out to gather the folklore of their locales, both during their studies and afterward. And virtually every summer he could be found in the most remote parts of the state, with notebook and recorder -- first a dictaphone employing cylinders, and later a machine employing aluminum discs provided for his use by the University. The result, by 1943, was a vast collection of field notes, hundreds of musical scores, thousands of audio recordings, and numerous magazine articles, student theses, books, lists, and other items related to this study. The majority of the material originated in North Carolina, with the rest from 20 other states and Canada, and came from the efforts of 650 other contributors besides Brown himself.
Although Brown promised the Society on an almost yearly basis to publish at least part of this collection to which its members were contributing, he never took more than a few tentative steps toward doing so. Thus, at Brown's death in 1943, Newman Ivey White, also a Professor of English at Duke University, close colleague of Brown's, and charged by Brown with continuing the work, inherited the dual confusion of the folklore collection, which was piled in Brown's attic office at home, and the conflicting claims of ownership of the collection of Mrs. Brown, the North Carolina Folklore Society, and Duke University. When it became apparent that all were amenable to seeing the collection in print, White assumed the post of general editor, which passed to Paull Franklin Baum, also a Professor of English and Director of the Duke Press, after White's death in 1948.
Leslie Brown was born in 1954 in New York City and was raised in Albany, N.Y. She was a Professor of History at Williams College, Williamstown, MA (2008-2016). She also taught History and African and African-American Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, MO (1999-2008), and History and Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Missouri--St. Louis (1997-1999). She served as Co-Coordinator for "Behind the Veil: Documenting African American Life in the Jim Crow South," Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University (1990-1995). Her first book, Upbuilding Black Durham: Gender, Class, and Black Community Development in the Jim Crow South, won the Organization of American Historians' Frederick Jackson Turner Award. She and Anne Valk, her life partner, co-authored Living with Jim Crow: African American Women and Memories of the Jim Crow South in 2010 which won the Oral History Association's Biennial Book Award. Brown died from leukemia in 2016.
Born in Union, Maine, John Emory Bryant (1836-1900) was an abolitionist, teacher, Union officer with the 8th Maine Volunteers, agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, newspaper editor and publisher, lawyer, and Republican politician in Georgia. During the American Civil War Bryant served in the Department of the South, in the Sea Island of Georgia and South Carolina. There he worked with General Rufus Saxton and commanded African-American troops, leading raids to free slaves from nearby plantations. In 1864 Bryant married Emma Frances Spaulding (1844-1901), who was born in Buckfield, Maine. They had two children together, a son who died in infancy and a daughter Alice. After the war, Bryant returned to Georgia and was heavily involved in Georgian Republican politics, serving as a congressman for one term and as state party chairman from 1876-1880. Bryant was involved in many organizations including the Georgia Equal Rights Association, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Southern Advance Association, and the Sons of Temperance.
William Anderson Pledger (1852-1904) was an editor of the Atlanta Blade newspaper, teacher, prominent Black Republican politician in Georgia, and friend of John Emory Bryant. In 1880 Pledger was elected chairman of the Republican state committee in Georgia, the first Black man to serve in that office. Pledger helped organize the Afro-American League (which later became the Afro-American Council) in 1890 in Chicago and served as vice president in 1898.

Materials in this collection largely deal with the years 1991-1996 as the U.S. coped with large numbers of Haitian and Cuban rafters who were held in Guant√°namo Bay refugee camps. Beginning in 1991, the U.S. naval base was designated as a receiving point for Haitian migrants who had been intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard in the Caribbean Sea. Guant√°namo Bay was outfitted with semi-permanent camps for the refugees while they waited for a decision from U.S. Immigration on whether they would be returned to Haiti or allowed to enter the United States. This program was expanded in 1994, when Cuban president Fidel Castro retired his Frontier Guards, resulting in a wave of Cuban rafters who were also intercepted by the Coast Guard and brought to Guanta√°namo Bay. Between 1994 and 1996 about 50,000 people lived in the Guant√°namo Bay camps. Cuban refugees in the camps were granted admission to the United States in 1995-1996, while most Haitian refugees were eventually returned to Haiti.

King Charles II of England (1630-1685) did not have any official heirs. He did, though, have many children by a number of mistresses. Historians believe the number of children is somewhere between 10 and fifteen. The use of 'armes' or titles of nobility and the privileges that came with it was one way the King acknowledged that these were his children. The most children attributed to a relationship is that between King Charles and Barbara n√©e Villiers (1641‚Äì1709), the Duchess of Cleveland, five, all of whom are named in this collection.

Produced mostly by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio of China, documentary films and newsreels were two of the major mass media and communication channels in China from the 1950s through 1970s. They covered all aspects of social activities, though the emphasis was on developments and achievements in the building of a socialist country. In order to reach even broader public audiences, government agents produced and printed the transcripts and shot lists for the films and sent them to cities and rural areas. Few of these printed materials have survived due to the poor quality of the paper upon which they were printed. The material in this collection was found in a cinema company office in Henan province, China.

Dr. Jane Clarke-Owen was born in 1854 in Warsaw, Indiana, where her mother, Dr. Marie Parks Furlong, practiced medicine. She married Thaddeus L. "Tom" Clarke in 1875 and had two daughters with him, Laura (b. 1877) and Therese (b. 1878). After divorcing her husband in 1884, she enrolled at Women's Medical College in Chicago. She studied there from 1885 to 1889. She lived apart from her daughters for much of her schooling and early career. After 1890, Clarke-Owen practiced medicine in Boston and elsewhere on the east coast. In order to support herself and her daughters, she also took on various odd jobs, including writing, working for Charles Hughes's presidential campaign, and operating a convalescent home. She was married briefly for a second time to a railroad worker named Ole Owen. She died in 1917.
Laura Clarke, Dr. Clarke-Owen's oldest daughter, lived on and off with her mother while she worked as a book canvasser, department store products demonstrator, and shop assistant in Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C.

Consumer Reports is a product testing and consumer advocacy nonprofit organization based in Yonkers, N.Y., founded in 1936. The National Association of Consumers was a consumer advocacy and lobbying organization founded in 1946 and active until around 1957-1958.
The National Association of Consumers (NAC) formed in 1946 as a private-sector initiative to continue the consumer advocacy work of the Office of Price Administration's Consumers Advisory Committee when the government agency was disbanded after World War II. Helen Hall, vice chairperson of the Consumer Advisory Committee and director of the Henry Street Settlement, was named president of the NAC. Membership in the organization consisted of both individuals and local chapters, made up of existing consumer organizations as well as newly formed organizations. Originally headquartered in Washington, D.C., the NAC moved to the Henry Street Settlement in New York and later to Amherst, Mass. The NAC was a registered lobbyist that advocated for a wide range of issues, including food standards, product labeling, rent control, milk prices as well as for the creation of Cabinet-level consumer protection agencies. The NAC's status as a lobby eventually restricted its ability to secure private-sector funding and its viability declined through the 1950s. In 1955 the NAC reorganized as an educational corporation and pursued a merger with the Council on Consumer Information, which never materialized. Dr. William Haller, an economist at Dickinson College, took on the role of executive secretary in 1955, but NAC operations stalled and the organization was effectively inactive around 1957.

Biographical Note: Griff Davis (1923-1993)
Griffith J. Davis, known as "Griff," was born in Atlanta, Georgia on April 18, 1923. He was introduced to photography during high school. After serving in World War II, Davis returned to Atlanta where his photojournalism career flourished as he worked while at Morehouse College for the Atlanta Daily World, Time, and Ebony, who authorized him to do a photojournalism spread on his sister's high school, the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private boarding school in North Carolina.
Griff Davis' journalistic career introduced him to many political and cultural players of the time, including Langston Hughes, who was one of his earliest mentors. Davis received his M.A. in journalism from Columbia in 1949, the only Black student in the program. As a journalist for the Black Star photo agency, New York Times, Ebony, and many other publications, Davis traveled in the United States, Africa, and Europe during the forties and fifties. In 1952 the Republic of Liberia sponsored Davis' one-man show "Liberia, 1952," at the American Museum of Natural History, and in the years that followed he produced three documentary films, including one narrated by the then-unknown actor Sidney Poitier.
In 1952 Davis joined the U.S. Foreign Service, spending most of his time advancing Truman's Point Four program for foreign aid (later USAID), chiefly in Liberia. He also served in Tunisia and Nigeria, and retired in 1985. In 1993, Morehouse College awarded Davis the Bennie Trailblazer Award, named for his former mentor and president of Morehouse, Benjamin Mays, for personal and professional achievements. Griff Davis passed away in 1993 in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 70.

The founder of Palmer Memorial Institute, Charlotte Hawkins Brown (1883‚Äì1961) was born in Henderson, North Carolina, and raised and educated in Massachusetts. Brown named the Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute (PMI) in Sedalia, North Carolina, after her mentor and benefactor, the second woman president of Wellesley College. Brown raised funds to expand campus facilities and worked to strengthen PMI's artistic and scholarly offerings, and through her efforts, the school evolved from an agricultural and manual training facility to a fully accredited, nationally recognized African American preparatory school for junior and senior high school students. In 1987 the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum opened on the PMI grounds as North Carolina's first African American state historic site.

The close friendship between Griff Davis and Harlem Renaissance author Langston Hughes (1902-1967) began in Davis' college days and lasted for decades. They collaborated on journalistic projects, and Davis often accompanied Hughes as his official photographer.
Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff were 20th century African American artists. Although they were known for their commissioned mural works, they also created paintings, sculptures, and other artworks.
In the late 1940s Alston and Woodruff began work on a mural project commissioned by Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, which asked the artists to illustrate African American contributions to the settling of California. Alston worked with Woodruff on the murals in a large studio space in New York; they used ladders to reach the upper parts of the canvas. The mural consists of two panels: "Exploration and Colonization" by Alston and "Settlement and Development" by Woodruff. The murals were unveiled in 1949 at the Golden State Mutual Headquarters in Los Angeles.

The Decentralization Conference-Seminars are funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and administered through the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The CEME, Conferences on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics, was created to form several series of standing national seminars on various topics. Both the General Equilibrium and Decentralization conference series were formed out of the mathematical economics side of the organization. The Decentralization Conference was first coordinated by Roy Radner. The conference is traditionally held once a year, but occasionally more often. The first Decentralization Conference was held at UC Berkeley in 1971.
The term decentralization refers to the starting point of many of the problems addressed in the series: the necessary information starts in a decentralized state. Much of the conference series has focused on questions of design and of various systems for production and allocation of goods, services, and information. These range from understanding voting systems to markets to the organization of the internal lines of communication and assignment of tasks within a firm. Topics covered at past conferences include: mechanism and market design, recourse allocation, matching, team theory, contracting, organization of the firm, communication, computation, and processing of information. Currently, the Decentralization conference series includes the design of any institutions, contracts, organizations, or relationships in which information and/or incentives play a role.

The Democratic Digest was the small-format magazine of the Democratic National Committee, with its offices based in Washington, D.C. The monthly issues chiefly consisted of editorial columns, election news, political cartoons and satire, and many reprinted articles and opinion pieces from pro-Democratic U.S. newspapers. Its predecessor, also titled the Democratic Digest, was published by the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee from 1933-1953. The Democratic Digest was continued in 1961 as The Democrat.
The chief editor during the time represented by this collection was Clayton Fritchey (1904-2001), a journalist who was also assistant to the Secretary of Defense and assistant to President Trumann; he also had close relations with Adlai Stevenson in various capacities. The managing editor was Samuel C. Brightman (1911-1992), noted Washington correspondent and Democratic Party public relations manager. Serving as senior editor was Philip Stern (1926-1992), also director of research for the Democratic National Committee (1953-1956); and deputy assistant to the Secretary of State for Public Affairs (1961-1962). The Democratic Digest's cover artist was Leo Hershfield, noted illustrator and courtroom artist; many pieces of his original artwork are in the Art and Layout Series.
The Dismal Swamp Land Company was founded by George Washington, Thomas Walker, William Nelson, Thomas Nelson, Robert Burwell, John Robinson, Fielding Lewis, Anthony Bacon, John Lyme, Samuel Gist, Robert Tucker, and William Waters. The number of shareholders grew as original owners divested their interests and family inherited stakes. The Company operated between 1763-1879 and was originally interested in agricultural pursuits (including rice cultivation), but the sale of cypress shingles and staves proved more profitable. The company went under as a result of post-Civil War economic conditions and concurrent decrease in the shingle trade.
Dorsey and Whitney LLP is a business law firm which was founded in 1912 in Minneapolis, MN, where its headquarters are still located, to provide legal counseling to the First Bank of Minneapolis. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G. Karagheuzoff, from the New York Office of the firm took on the cases of Bahraini Guant√°namo detainees pro bono in 2004. These lawyers represented the Bahraini detainees until the release and repatriation of all of them by 2008. Sullivan, Colangelo-Bryan and Karagheuzoff did not only follow the legal cases of their Bahraini detainees but also got involved in public activities in order to raise awareness about the human rights situation and abuses at the military detention center in Guant√°namo Naval Base. They also initiated negotiations with Bahraini diplomats and officials regarding the release and repatriation of their clients. The team of Dorsey & Whitney lawyers also paid a visit to Bahrain to meet with the relatives of their clients.
Jumah Al-Dossari is a joint citizen of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia detained in December 2001 in Pakistan, kept under arrest by the U.S. military in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and transferred to Camp Delta military detention center in January 2002 and eventually released without facing any charges in 2007. He suffered severe psychological and physical abuse both in Kandahar and Guant√°namo. Al-Dossari attempted suicide thirteen times and went on hunger strikes at least twice while under extra-judicial detention at Guant√°namo. His case became an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guant√°namo naval base and detrimental consequences of long term solitary confinement. Al-Dossari was represented by the Dorsey & Whitney LLP lawyer Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and he was repatriated to Saudi Arabia in 2007.
Joshua Colangelo-Bryan is a Senior Attorney at the New York office of Dorsey & Whitney LLP. He gained his law degree in 1999 from the University of Washington School Of Law. Prior to working for Dorsey, Joshua served with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, where he participated in the prosecution of criminal cases involving war crimes and terrorism. He also has participated in post-conflict humanitarian aid work in the Balkans. He practices in the areas of complex civil litigation, employment law, and securities fraud. He also represents individuals and entities before federal and state agencies. He devotes a substantial portion of his practice to pro bono cases, including the representation of Guant√°namo Bay detainees.

Crystal Eastman (June 25, 1881-July 8, 1928) was an American lawyer, antimilitarist, feminist, socialist, and journalist. She attended Vassar College and Columbia University, and obtained her law degree from New York University (1907). Her first job as an attorney was to investigate labor conditions for the Russell Sage Foundation. Her pioneering report, Work Accidents and the Law (1910), led New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to appoint her the first woman on New York State's Commission on Employers' Liability and Causes of Industrial Accidents, Unemployment and Lack of Farm Labor. As a member of that commission, Eastman drafted the country's first workers' compensation law. During Woodrow Wilson's administration, Eastman became investigating attorney for the United States Commission on Industrial Relations. Meanwhile, Eastman also struggled to further women's rights--first suffrage and later equal rights--as co-author of the first Equal Rights Amendment. During World War I, she was a leader of the peace movement, working with Carrie Chapman Catt to organize the Carnegie Hall meeting that led to the founding of the Woman's Peace Party of New York--later renamed the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom--the oldest women's peace organization. Eastman became Executive Secretary of the Women's Peace Party. A leading advocate for civil liberties and the rights of conscientious objectors during World War I, she joined Norman Thomas and Roger Baldwin in founding the American Civil Liberties Union.
In 1910 Eastman married Wallace Benedict; the marriage ended in divorce in 1915. As a statement of financial and personal independence, Eastman refused to accept alimony, stating that to accept her former husband's money would be to betray herself as both a woman and a feminist. In 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist Walter Fuller; the couple had two children, Jeffrey and Annis.

Eclipse Enterprises, also known as Eclipse Comics, was an independent American comic book publisher during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1978, it published the first graphic novel intended for specialty comic stores; it also was one of the first companies to offer royalties and creator ownership of rights. It was also one of the early comic book publishers to produce trading cards.
Eclipse Enterprises was founded by brothers Jan and Dean Mullaney in 1977; it eventually settled and operated in Sonoma County, California. Due to the controversial products it distributed (which led to several lawsuits), as well as a devastating flood in 1986, Eclipse suffered ongoing financial hardships and eventually ceased operations in 1994. The owners filed for bankruptcy in 1995.
The wholesale firm of Effinger & Aiken (partners Charles H. Effinger and George B. Aiken), located in Baltimore, Maryland, supplied consumer goods to hundreds of hardware, grocery, drug, and general goods stores in cities and rural towns in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida during the early 1900s. Several traveling salesmen represented the firm; and goods such as cutlery, crockery, glassware, wooden items, hardware, tools, rope, saddles, guns and ammunition, fishing and hunting equipment, wagon wheels and axels, farm equipment, and building materials generally were shipped by railroad freight.
The firm's beginning and ending dates of operation are unclear. However, the R.L. Polk & Co's Baltimore City Directory for 1899 lists Effinger as a partner in Ramsey & Effinger, a firm specializing in china, glassware, and house furnishing goods; and the Federal Reporter, Volume 184 indicates that on February 9, 1909, the partnership of Effinger & Aiken and each partner individually were adjudicated bankrupts.

Wade, he was active in the Clergy Consultation on Abortion, an abortion referral network, and he wrote a number of sermons and columns on gay rights, drawing on the experience of having a lesbian sister.

Margaret Fishback Antolini was an advertising copywriter and author of light verse and prose. She was known for her wry, cynical attitudes towards domesticity, and her marriage to Alberto Gastone Antolini in 1935 prompted headlines such as Sneerer at Love Engaged to Wed (The New York American, 17 April 1935). The couple had one son, Tony. Fishback lived in several New York City neighborhoods, settling in Murray Hill in 1941, where she would remain until at least 1976. She spent most summers in Thomaston, Maine.
Fishback contributed light verse and prose to a number of national publications, including Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, Harper's Bazaar, Look, Mademoiselle, New York Times, Reader's Digest, Saturday Evening Post, and Woman's Day. She authored several compilations of light verse, an etiquette book called Safe Conduct: When to Behave--and Why, and two children's books. Common themes in Fishback's work include New York City, womanhood, marriage, and career. Fishback also frequently based her writings on stories and advertisements in newspapers. She published primarily under her maiden name, but also occasionally under her married name and the pseudonyms Marne and Marnie.
Fishback was described in a 1932 New York newspaper article as the highest-paid advertising woman in the world.

The Farm Security Administration Project
The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created in 1937 under the Department of Agriculture, as part of the U.S. Federal government "New Deal" recovery programs following the Great Depression. Its main purpose was to minister to the needs of and improve the dire situation of impoverished rural people across the U.S.
In support of this effort, the FSA hired noted photographers and oral history interviewers to promote FSA programs and to document economic and social conditions and natural landscapes of the U.S. and its territories, as well as to illustrate the still-present vitality of the United States in the aftermath of the Depression. Led by economist/photographer Roy Stryker, the project ran until 1942, when the FSA was dissolved and subsumed under the Office of War Information (OWI). Many of the photographers hired for the FSA continued their work under the OWI.
Between 1937 and 1946, FSA/OWI photographers created over 175,000 black-and-white images, and only about 1600 color images using Kodachrome chromogenic film, at that time a relatively new technology. Among the FSA photographers were Jack Delano, Russell Lee, and Marion Post Wolcott, whose color images form this collection.
[Adapted from the Library of Congress FSA/OWI Color Photographs Collection website, accessed March 2019.]
Born in the Ukraine in 1914, Delano came to the United States in 1923 when he was five. After graduating from Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1937, Delano worked as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and the Office of War Information (OWI). He was also a well-known music composer. He moved to Puerto Rico in 1946 and lived there until his death in 1997.
Russell Lee (1903-1990) was born in Illinois. A journalist and photographer, he was best known for his photographic work for the Farm Security Administration from 1936 to 1943. He died in Austin, Texas, where he had taught photography at the University of Texas.

Alberta Bassett (Stith Jones Gillingham was the daughter of Dr. Nicholas Long Bolling Stith, who graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1829 and who lived in Halifax County and then in Raleigh. He had at least two other children, Anna Guion and Fred H. Stith. Dr. Stith and his brother, A.B. Stith, bought 1000 shares of stock in the Ward gold mine in 1854, one of the largest mines in the Cid mining district of Davidson County, N.C. Mrs. Gillingham inherited at least part of the properties which she came to hold in the Cid mining district. It appears from the papers that her mining interests included gold, silver, copper, sulphur, and zinc. One of the mines she came to own was the Ward mine. Her first marriage in 1881 was to J. Howard Jones, also a mine owner, who died in 1884. She also became involved with a lawyer from Charlotte, William H. Bailey. She married her second husband, Captain H.R. Gillingham, in 1905. By then, Alberta and her brother and sister had become estranged, and a long legal battle ensued during the late 19th and early 20th centuries over the ownership of the mines.

James Hamilton (1763-1829) was likely born in Scotland, and emigrated to the United States in 1784. He established a business in Charleston, South Carolina, as a shipping merchant associated with Edward Mortimer & Co. of Charleston, David McCredie of Charleston and Savannah, and Henry Bethune & Co. of London. In 1800 he established a cotton plantation on St. Simons Island, Ga., with about 300 slaves, and later jointly owned (with John Couper) a second plantation property, a rice plantation with 450 slaves, Hopeton, on the Altamaha River near Darien, Georgia. He also acquired two substantial town homes, No.13 Broad Street in Charleston, and No. 260 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. His wife was Nancy Isabella Steedman (1780-c.1818) of London. They had two children, Agnes Rebecca, and George (b.1806).
At his death in April 1829 in Philadelphia, Hamilton owned four coastal Georgia plantations, and a total of 662 slaves, and was a very rich man. He devised his entire estate in trust to his grandchildren, of whom only one, Isabella Hamilton Corbin (b.1827), was alive in 1829. The other two legatees were Elizabeth T. Corbin (b.1831), and Richard Washington Corbin (1837-1922). Each heir was to receive a full one-third share upon reaching the age of 21 years. After his death the executors invested heavily in 5% bonds of the State of Pennsylvania, and during and after the Civil War in U.S. Treasury bonds. After the 1827 marriage of Agnes Rebecca Hamilton to Francis Porteus Corbin (1801-1876), a lawyer from Virginia, the Corbins lived in France. The other child, George, never married and later lived in Liverpool. Collateral relations included his wife's niece Isabella Bethune (1804), his wife's cousin Margaret (Mrs. Daniel) Kennedy (1805), his nephew Robert Wilson and grand-nephew James Hamilton Wilson, both of Liverpool, and his niece Janet Wilson of Philadelphia and Scotland.
In 1848, after two decades of the administration of Hamilton's estate, principally the Georgia slave plantations and the Pennsylvania state bonds and other financial investments, the estate was valuated at over $1 million, including 764 slaves.
As directed, from 1848-1858 the estate was successively divided among the three heirs, with Francis P. Corbin as trustee for the shares of Isabella H. (1848) and Elizabeth T. (1852), and with annuities funded principally by Pennsylvania and U.S. bonds exempted from the estate division, continuing to Agnes Corbin and George Hamilton through at least 1867.

Muriel W. Henderson was born on June 20, 1920 in Tacoma, Washington, and died on June 9, 2009 in Chapel Hill, NC. Her family and friends knew her as Ki. She lived a full and active life with a wonderful will to experience as much as possible. She spent 22 years as a missionary in Angola with her husband Larry, leaving there in 1969 when the colonial war for independence made it hard to continue the work. She and Larry moved to New Jersey where he worked for the mission board in New York and she worked in social services. She loved working with African students at the Africa-America Institute. Ki and Larry finished their careers in Florida, first in Leisure City and then at Sun City Center. From 1985 to 1991 they lived in Portugal, where they had first gone in 1947 to learn Portuguese for their work in Angola. Ki helped Larry research in Portuguese archives for his book on the church in Angola. While there, they reconnected with many old friends from Angola. In 1991 they moved to Durham, NC and became active in the life of Pilgrim United Church of Christ. Ki was a life-long letter writer and corresponded with friends and colleagues all over the world.

In May 1865 President Andrew Johnson appointed him provisional governor of North Carolina, serving until December 1865. In 1868 he ran and won as the Republican candidate for governor. In an effort to combat the Ku Klux Klan, Holden suspended habeas corpus and imposed martial law on Alamance and Caswell counties. He was impeached in 1870 by the Democratic state legislature on eight charges related to the rough treatment of North Carolina citizens due to his efforts to combat the Ku Klux Klan. He was convicted of six of the eight charges and removed from office in 1871. Following his removal from office, Holden moved to Washington, D.C. and resumed a career in journalism. In 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him postmaster, a position he held in Raleigh until 1881.
Holden was married twice: first to Ann Augusta Young, who died in 1852 and with whom he had four children. He married Louisa Virginia Harrison, a widow with four children of her own, in 1854. He died in Raleigh in 1892.
Holden was sued by a rival newspaperman, Josiah Turner, in 1885, following Turner's arrest by Holden during his term as governor. The suit continued into the 1890s, despite Holden's being incapacitated by poor health. His wife, Louisa Virginia Holden, acted in his place and the suit was continued against her after Holden's death in 1892. Turner lost the suit in 1894.

Edward Jenner, (born May 17, 1749, Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England‚Äîdied January 26, 1823, Berkeley), was an English surgeon and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine, the world's first vaccine.
Jenner was a country youth, the son of a clergyman. Because Edward was only five when his father died, he was brought up by an older brother, who was also a clergyman. Edward acquired a love of nature that remained with him all his life. He attended grammar school and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to a nearby surgeon. In the following eight years Jenner acquired a sound knowledge of medical and surgical practice. On completing his apprenticeship at the age of 21, he went to London and became the house pupil of John Hunter, who was on the staff of St. George‚Äôs Hospital and was one of the most prominent surgeons in London. Even more important, however, he was an anatomist, biologist, and experimentalist of the first rank; not only did he collect biological specimens, but he also concerned himself with problems of physiology and function.
In addition to his training and experience in biology, Jenner made progress in clinical surgery. After studying in London from 1770 to 1773, he returned to country practice in Berkeley and enjoyed substantial success. In addition to practicing medicine, he joined two medical groups for the promotion of medical knowledge and wrote occasional medical papers. He played the violin in a musical club, wrote light verse, and, as a naturalist, made many observations, particularly on the nesting habits of the cuckoo and on bird migration.
Smallpox was widespread in the 18th century, and occasional outbreaks of special intensity resulted in a very high death rate. Jenner had been impressed by the fact that a person who had suffered an attack of cowpox‚Äîa relatively harmless disease that could be contracted from cattle‚Äîcould not take the smallpox‚Äîi.e., could not become infected whether by accidental or intentional exposure to smallpox. Pondering this phenomenon, Jenner concluded that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection. In May 1796 Jenner found a young dairymaid, Sarah Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand. On May 14, using matter from Sarah‚Äôs lesions, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, who had never had smallpox. Phipps became slightly ill over the course of the next 9 days but was well on the 10th. On July 1 Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with smallpox matter. No disease developed; protection was complete. In 1798 Jenner, having added further cases, published privately a slender book entitled An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae.
Early reactions to the Inquiry from the medical community and the general public were mixed. Members of the medical community, especially those with investments in the practice of variolation, tried to discredit Jenner‚Äôs discovery or stake their own claim to it. Jenner had especially acrimonious feuds with two London physicians, Dr. George Pearson and Dr. William Woodville. Pearson even gave evidence against Jenner‚Äôs 1802 petition to the House of Commons for recognition of his work on vaccination.
Despite some people‚Äôs doubts about the safety and efficacy of Jenner‚Äôs smallpox vaccine, there was great demand for cowpox samples to conduct vaccinations in England and abroad. Jenner and other practitioners in England sent dried cowpox specimens sandwiched between glass to Europe and the United States.

Through public programming and exhibits, the JHFNC aspires to educate and showcase the richness of Jewish Life as well as promote a familiarity with the culture and lifestyle of Jews to the general public.
In 2014, the JHFNC transferred their historical collections to the Rubenstein Library, including the oral history recordings and transcripts. Originally from Garland, North Carolina, Jefferson D. Johnson, Jr., attended Garland High School and Trinity Park School in Durham before enrolling in Trinity College in 1919. He served as a private in World War I before returning to college and graduating with a B.A. in 1923. Johnson was an active member of Trinity's Sigma Chi fraternity and also played semi-professional baseball. After teaching for a year, he returned to Trinity and earned a law degree in 1926. In 1935, he married Frances Faison. The couple eventually had three children.
Johnson became the Town Attorney for Clinton, N.C., and served from 1928-1941. He also successfully ran for State Senator of the 9th District in 1937 and 1941. In 1941, he was appointed Special Superior Court Judge, where he served until 1945. He managed the successful U.S. Senate campaign of J. Melville Broughton in 1948, as well as the unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Franklin P. Graham in 1950. The 1950 campaign was extremely controversial, with Graham's opponent, Willis Smith, using racist language and personal attacks on Graham to gather the support of white voters afraid of desegregation.
In that same year, 1950, Johnson was elected Associate Justice of the State Supreme Court. He served until forced to retire from illness in 1959. He died shortly afterward in 1960.

The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the largest and oldest enduring advertising agencies in the United States. The Diamond Information Center (DIC) operates as the public relations division of the diamond marketing group at J. Walter Thompson on behalf of De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd.
Beginning in 1919 the New York Office of the J. Walter Thompson Company began to systematically retain the advertisements it had created. The Statistical and Information Department, renamed the Information and Records Department in the 1920s, arranged the advertisements in scrapbooks. Initially, most of the advertisements preserved were tear sheets, the actual advertisements clipped from newspapers and magazines. By the 1930s, however, the department retained the final printers' proofs for magazine advertisements. The scrapbooks therefore began to be called proof books.
In the 1950s the responsibility for creating proof books fell to individual account groups. In addition to the account group proof books, a file clerk under the supervision of the Traffic Department maintained proofs. When no longer of current use, the file clerk transferred the proofs to a storeroom or records center. Throughout these years, individuals who helped create campaigns or who managed an account sometimes would maintain personal proof books.
In 1977 the New York Office established a Creative Library. Its responsibilities included the preservation on microfilm of all print advertisements, which was done for most of the 1980s. Imprints are located in the JWT Microfilm Collection; the originals were apparently destroyed after microfilming. The Creative Library has made an effort to create files of work from all major U.S. offices, so work from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., is better represented in the collection from the late 1970s and after. Where known, the office that created the advertisements is noted in the container list. In addition, JWT subsidiaries such as Brouillard Communications or Lord Geller Federico and Einstein (LGFE) are noted where their work has been identified.

The Great Kanto earthquake struck the Japanese island of Honshu at 11:58 a.m. on September 1, 1923. With a magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale, the earthquake leveled Tokyo and the surrounding areas of Yokohama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizouka. Along with the destruction of buildings and land, the earthquake resulted in widespread fires, as many people had been cooking their lunch around the time that the earthquake struck. A simultaneous typhoon in Northern Japan led to high winds that caused firestorms in cities across the region.
Estimated casualties from the earthquake and the resulting fires range from 100,000 to 150,000 people. About 2 million people were left homeless. Over the next several years, Tokyo was rebuilt with stricter safety standards, and more parks were added to offer open spaces as refuges. In 1960, the Japanese government declared September 1 to be Disaster Prevention Day.

While a resident of Chatham County, Kaufman developed an interest in land development projects that included caveats for environmental protection. An extension of this interest led to involvment with, among otehr regional and national environmental organizations, the Conservation Council of North Carolina (CCNC), an organization that Kaufman eventually chaired. Kaufman also served on several local and state boards of realtors, the North Carolina Land Stewardship Council, and Conservation Fund, North Carolina. At this time, Kaufman also travelled extensively in Latin America. During his travels Kaufman promoted indigenous writers, particularly Guatemalan writer Victor Dinoicio Montejo.
In the mid-1990s Kaufman began consulting work for the World Bank and the International City/County Management Association in nations of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, including Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Kazakhstan, the final Soviet Republic to declare independence. This work encompassed a broad scope of work including advising local residents on land and housing reform, teaching property valuation, investigating the effectiveness of aid projects, economic surveys, and some work training local journalists. In 2001 Kaufman relocated to western Oregon where he began a career in arbitration and mediation.
Frances Anne "Fanny" Kemble was a British actress, writer, and abolitionist. She was born into a theater family; her acting career spanned the years 1829-1868. Kemble acted to support herself, but she was most passionate about writing, and was an accomplished playwright, poet, and diarist. She married Pierce Mease Butler, an American who subsequently inherited his family's plantations. After spending time in Georgia, Kemble became an abolitionist and later divorced her husband. In 1863, Kemble published her anti-slavery memoir, Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, which is said to have influenced the British against supporting the Confederacy in the Civil War. Kemble's own family was divided on that issue, as her elder daughter sided with her mother, while her younger daughter returned to Georgia with her father. Frances Butler Leigh published Ten Years on a Georgia Plantation Since the War (1883) as a rebuttal to her mother's memoir. Kemble's success as a Shakespearean actress enabled her to buy a cottage in Lenox, Mass. Her correspondent, Miss Patteson, is the daughter of Frances Duke Patteson, a niece of the poet Samuel Coleridge Taylor; the Lord Coleridge mentioned in the letter is John Duke Coleridge (1820-1894), the 2nd Lord Chief Justice of England. Bishop Patteson refers to Miss Patteson's sister, John Patteson (1827-1871), who became an Anglican martyr after being killed doing mission work in the Solomon Islands.
Born in Hungary, Andr√© Kert√©sz (1894-1985) was known for his mastery of composition with light, his experimental photography, and for his street photography and portraiture. After living in Paris for a decade and developing his style as a photographer and photojournalist, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1936, where he continued his work. After World War II, Kert√©sz became a naturalized U.S. citizen, returning in subsequent years to France and other places around the world to take photographs.
After practicing as a photojournalist in Europe and in the United States for a good part of his career, in the early 1960s he pulled away from this type of work for good, and enjoyed a period of growing and widespread acknowledgment of the quality of his work. He died in 1985 in New York City.

Born on July 28, 1908 in Brooklyn, New York, Morris Margolin spent most of his life in the New York metropolitan area. He graduated from New York University (NYU) in 1926 and taught accounting at Far Rockaway High School in Queens, New York from 1933 to 1940.

He was also a charter member and former president of the Jamaica, Queens, chapter of B'nai B'rith, a global Jewish community service organization.
In 1936, Morris married Dorothy Safran. Dorothy was born to Polish parents in Budapest, Hungary, on July 28, 1911. Her family emigrated to the United States in 1913 and settled in New York City.

While on his travels in and out of uniform, he recorded a wealth of observations concerning the events, people, and environments in each area. Marshall supplemented his observations with accounts of his own participation in politics and economic endeavors, as well as commentary on national figures and events. His experiences in the Midwest and the South are complemented by letters from his sister who had remained in North Bridgewater.

John Moore McCalla was a lawyer, Democratic politician, brigadier general of Kentucky militia, and second auditor of the United States. He was the son of Dr. Andrew J. and Martha (More) McCalla. John McCalla married Maria Frances Hogg and had three sons, Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr.; Andrew J. McCalla; and Thomas McCalla. Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr. married Helen Varnum Hill and they had a daughter names Isabel Hill McCalla. Isabel married Edmond Lee Goldsborough and had three children: Edmond Lee, John McCalla, and Helen Louisa.
McCalla attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. He joined the Lexington Light Artillery Co. in 1812 and found himself part of the Fifth Regiment of Kentucky Volunteer Militia. The Kentucky troops were sent to the relief of besieged Frenchtown on River Raisin, Michigan, where they underwent massacre and imprisonment when General James Winchester surrendered on Jan. 22, 1813.
After his military career, McCalla Sr. became interested in many different areas. He had political ambitions along with studying law. He became the U.S. Marshal of Kentucky, and on March 31, 1845 was appointed second auditor of the U. S. Treasury under James Polk's administration. His term lasted until 1849, at which time he focused on his law practice. McCalla was an ardent Democrat and was welcomed to the American Party in 1854. He was a political opponent of Henry Clay and a supporter of Andrew Jackson. Following the war he supported Andrew Johnson.

John B. McFerrin was a professor of finance at the University of Florida, as well as a past president of the Southern Economic Association. His Ph.D. was from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with his dissertation on Caldwell and Company. McFerrin's book, Caldwell and Company: A Southern Financial Empire, was first published in 1939 and updated in 1969.
Caldwell and Company was founded in Nashville in 1917 by Rogers C. Caldwell. Originally a municipal bonds distributor, the company grew rapidly--first selling real estate bonds and industrial securities, and later acquiring ownership and interests in banks (including the Bank of Tennessee), newspapers, and other ventures, including Nashville's professional baseball team. By 1929, it was the largest investment banking house in the south.
All was not well with the company's finances, however. Rogers Caldwell charged his personal expenses to the company, securities were substituted unethically, and the business had inadequate cash reserves to legally cover its investments. Caldwell and Company also became involved in state politics, financially backing Colonel Luke Lea and his interests. (Lea was also from Nashville, a former United States Senator, and a newspaper publisher.) Lea's influence with the state government, including Governor Henry Horton, led to significant deposits of Tennessee money into Caldwell banks, bypassing competitive bidding for state-funded projects. In September 1930, bank examiners discovered the low cash reserves, and on November 7 the Bank of Tennessee was declared insolvent. The collapse of Caldwell and Company immediately followed, including runs on other company-owned banks across the South. On November 14, 1930, the company went into receivership.
John Sidney (1913-1999) and Doris (1918-1998) McGee were appointed on April 11th, 1945 by the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention to Nigeria, where they served eight consecutive terms. Their primary role was that of "missionary advisors," or "field evangelism" for church development. They served at the Baptist College of Iwo from 1945-1948, and then at the Baptist Mission in Igede-Ekiti (Western Nigeria) and Ikogosi from 1949-1977. In 1956, they helped establish the sixth Baptist high school in Nigeria: the Ekiti Baptist High School, in Igede. In 1957, they were made "Chief Gbaiyegun of Igede," by the Onigede and Chiefs of Igede-Ekiti. In 1961, they were made paramount chief by the Ewi of Ado, on behalf of the Ekiti Baptist Association. In 1977, they were made "Chief Akorewolu of Ikogosi" by Loja and Chiefs of Ikogosi-Ekiti. The couple retired in 1978 after thirty-three years of missionary service.
John Sidney and Doris had two sons, John David (b. 1943) and Sidney (b. 1948). The McGees' children stayed with them in Nigeria until John David returned to the US for high school in 1958, where he stayed with a foster family. Much of the correspondence between family members takes place when the McGee children are in the United States to finish their education.

Robert P. Mosteller (b. 1948) is the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was born in North Carolina and earned graduate degrees from both Yale and Harvard before working for the Washington, D.C. Public Defender Service as Director of Training and Chief of the Trial Division. Mosteller taught at Duke Law School from 1983 to 2008. He is particularly interested the death penalty, and served as co-reported for the Death Penalty Initiative of the Constitution Project and as president of the North Carolina Center for Death Penalty Litigation.
Mosteller was also an attorney for John Wesley Oliver, a former death row inmate whose case file represents the content in this collection.
In May 1979, John Wesley Oliver and co-defendant George Moore, Jr., were convicted of murdering Allen Watts and Dayton Hodge in an armed robbery of a gas station in Robeson County, North Carolina. Oliver was sentenced to death for both murders, while Moore was sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge. On appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed the defendants' convictions, but vacated the death sentences and remanded the cases for re-sentencing.
In January 1982, Oliver was re-sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge, and both defendants were sentenced to death for the murder of Allen Watts. The case was appealed, and the death penalty for Watts' murder was overturned, but Oliver's second death sentence for the murder of Dayton Hodge was affirmed.
In April 1994, following a hearing on Oliver's Motion for Appropriate Relief, the court vacated Oliver's death sentence when the Superior Court judge found that the prosecution had withheld from the defense important information that would have cast doubt on eyewitnesses' identification of Oliver as the person responsible for the death of Dayton Hodge. The judge ordered a new sentencing hearing regarding Hodge's murder. In a 2009 article, Mosteller writes that "a combination of processes resulted in the exclusion of all African Americans in a jurisdiction where approximately one-fourth of the population was African American from a jury that in 1982 recommended death sentences for two African American defendants [Oliver and Moore] charged with the murder of two white men... The death sentence was vacated on the basis of a violation of the defendant's due process rights under Brady v. Maryland" (Kotch and Mosteller: "The Racial Justice Act and the Long Struggle with Race and the Death Penalty in North Carolina").
The cases came before the court in November 2001 for re-sentencing, and the State of North Carolina elected not to seek the death penalty. Oliver was sentenced to life imprisonment for both murders, while Moore was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Dayton Hodge.
The Munford and Ellis families were connected through the marriage of George Wythe Munford and Elizabeth Throwgood Ellis in 1838. The earliest papers from the Munford family center around William Munford (1775-1825) of the first generation, George Wythe Munford (1803-1882) of the second generation, and the children of George Wythe Munford, notably Thomas Taylor Munford (1831-1918), Sallie Radford (Munford) Talbott (1841-1930), Lucy Munford and Fannie Ellis Munford. Papers of the Ellis family begin with those of Charles Ellis, Sr. (1772-1840), Richmond merchant; his wife, Margaret (Nimmo) Ellis (1790-1877); and his brother, Powhatan Ellis (1790-1863), jurist, U.S. senator, and diplomat. Later materials include letters from Thomas Harding Ellis (1814-1898), son of Charles and Margaret Ellis, as well as some materials from their other children and grandchildren.

The National Coalition for Haitian Rights (NCHR) was founded to advocate on behalf of Haitian citizens, immigrants, and refugees, both in the United States and regionally.
In December 1981, major civil rights organizations joined with Haitian community groups and advocates to March on Washington to protest President Reagan's new policy of interdiction at sea of Haitian refugees and indefinite detention of Haitian asylum-seekers. The march was organized under the banner of an umbrella organization called the Committee for the Defense of Haitian Refugees (CODEHR). A few months later in February 1982, these organizations decide to transform CODEHR into the National Emergency Coalition for Haitian Refugees, appoint an executive director, form a board and raise operational funds from member organizations. In addition to Haitian advocacy organizations (the Haitian Refugee Center, Haitian Fathers, Haitian Centers Council) it included major civil rights groups (NAACP, National Urban League, Southern Christian Leadership Conference), and major denominations (the US Catholic Conference of Bishops, the Episcopal Church, the National Council of Churches, Church World Service, and Lutheran Refugee Service) and human rights groups (Americas Watch, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), in all about 44 organizations. Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua and Bayard Rustin as Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, provided leadership. Susan Buchanan was the first Executive Director. Another key leader was Ira Gollobin who founded the National Lawyers Guild, headed the National Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, and litigated several key immigration and refugee cases.
Around August/September 1982, the organization eliminated "Emergency" from its title and became the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. Around this time, Michael S. Hooper (research director for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights) becomes the new Executive Director. Jocelyn "Juny" McCalla succeeded him in 1988.
By 1994, after President Clinton's historic decision to deploy 20,000 troops to Haiti to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to elected office, NCHR had expanded its scope of work from refugee rights to civil and international human rights, taking advantage of a paradigm shift in US-Haiti relations that put the US more on the side of democracy in Haiti. To reflect this the organization changed its name to the National Coalition for Haitian Rights in 1995.
From 1995 until 2006, when the organization shut down, NCHR focused on two key goals. First, it worked to equip Haiti with its own professional human rights group, by grooming the field office, which it had established in Port-au-Prince in 1992 to become an independent national group with field offices throughout Haiti. Second, NCHR set its sights on strengthening the capacity of Haitians to exercise greater political power and influence over US policy towards Haitian communities and Haiti. In 2004, NCHR-Haiti became the National Network for the Defense of Human Rights.
During its twenty-four years of operation, NCHR tackled a wide variety of issues faced by Haitians in Haiti and the US and the Caribbean. These included US immigration policy, treatment of Haitian immigrants (including such categories as "boat people", migrant workers, and refugees), documenting conditions at US detention centers such as Guantanamo and Krome, HIV/AIDS in the Haitian community, human rights abuses and accountability in Haiti under the Duvalier regime and post-Duvalier governments, police corruption and abuse both in Haiti and in New York City, and electoral and judicial reform in Haiti.

Special Note On Immigration and Legalization in the NCHR records
Immigration and legalization are a common thread throughout NCHR's existence and in its historical records.
In June 1982 Judge Eugene Spellman ruled against the Reagan Administration's broad Haitian detention order, freeing the 3,500 Haitian held in detention centers throughout the country. Spellman addressed the Administration's concern that, once released, Haitian asylum-seekers would just disappear into the ether by giving NCHR the responsibility to a) report to the court on a regular basis whether the Immigration courts complied with the ruling (hearings could not proceed if the Haitian asylum-seekers did not have legal representation) and b) secure legal assistance nationwide for the Haitian asylum-seekers. NCHR was uniquely situated to do so, because its membership consisted of voluntary agencies (USCC, LIRS, CWS, etc.) that agreed to resettle the released asylum-seekers. Accordingly, NCHR worked with these groups as well as law firms and legal groups (ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, etc.) to coordinate legal representation efforts, train pro bono lawyers in the art of Haitian asylum issues and representation, and communicate with immigration courts around the country on hearings. Spellman's 1982 ruling was crucial to NCHR's evolution and led to NCHR eliminating "emergency" from its name.
The aforementioned programs and activities lasted until 1986. In that year, Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). The legislation had four provisions, one of which was called Cuban-Haitian Adjustment (CHA), which was in fact more Haitian than Cuban. This was a far-reaching provision that was adopted primarily thanks to NCHR. CHA granted Haitian asylum-seekers in the USA since before January 1, 1982 permanent residence (green cards) and made the status retroactive to January 1, 1982. In other words, any Haitian who qualified for this provision could obtain a green card in 1987, and immediately fulfill the 5-year residency requirement that made him or her eligible for US citizenship through naturalization. An estimated 40,000 Haitian refugees benefited from the legislation. At this point NCHR switched to training lawyers and advocates on the law's provisions and successful representation.
While these laws and reforms were being enacted in the US, Haitians kept fleeing the despotic regimes that succeeded the Duvaliers. Thus NCHR's investigating and reporting on human rights conditions, educating the US Congress and the Administration in order to influence policymaking and lawmaking continued apace. In 1988, NCHR extended human rights monitoring to the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, and initiated a monthly bulletin, Haiti Insight. The human rights reporting was key to providing substantive support to Haitian asylum claims. Over time, the bulletin became required reading for US asylum adjudicators. In 1992, the Haitian military took power through a coup d'√©tat and exiled President Aristide. Shortly afterwards, thousands of Haitians took to the high seas and were intercepted by the US Coast Guard and warehoused in the US naval military base at Guantanamo, Cuba (GTMO). Once again, NCHR was at the forefront of advocating for Haitian asylum-seekers. The official records of the litigation undertaken on behalf of the Haitian refugees will not direct the public's attention to NCHR's key role in this effort, but it was substantial. For strategic and practical reasons, the groups involved in the litigation chose a member organization -- the Haitian Centers Council ‚Äì as the lead organization because it was headquartered in Brooklyn where NCHR and the Yale Law School filed suit on behalf of the Haitians held in GTMO. By 1994, NCHR had secured the release of about 11,000 Haitian refugees and the right for them to seek asylum on U.S. soil. About 3 years later, NCHR secured legislation granting them and thousands of others (an estimated 50,000) legal permanent residence (green cards). NCHR challenged the U.S. Interdiction-at-sea policy all the way to the Supreme Court, which unfortunately decided that the President had quasi-absolute powers outside of U.S. borders.
It is important to note that for purposes of immigration enforcement, the U.S. border steadily receded from 12 miles to 3 miles (under Reagan), from 3 miles to sure footing on land (under Clinton), whereas a slot machine or a detainee in GTMO is not in US territory unless in the 12-mile limit. Note also that Customs and Border Patrol has a 100-mile wide authority to patrol on each side of the border, i.e. for purposes of immigration enforcement. All of New York City (its 8 million + residents) is within the border.
In short, NCHR's legalization and immigration efforts, activities, and programs may have shifted focus and administrative and programmatic location over the years, but they always were part of NCHR's DNA. [source: Jocelyn "Juny" McCalla]

The Center for Documentary Studies, an interdisciplinary educational organization affiliated with Duke University, is dedicated to advancing documentary work that combines experience and creativity with education and community life. Founded in 1989, CDS connects the arts and humanities to fieldwork, drawing upon photography, filmmaking, oral history, folklore and writing as catalysts for education and change.
The North Carolina Self-Portrait project (NCSP) was directed by Alex Harris at the Center For Documentary Studies, Duke University. The NCSP project was modeled after a similar project conducted by the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. The objective of these projects was to photograph the family pictures of African Americans, and to record on audio tape the family member's descriptions of the photographs.
Nathan Carter Newbold was the Director of the Division of Negro Education for the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction from 1913-1950. Born in 1871 in Pasquotank County, N.C., Newbold lived and worked in North Carolina most of his life. He attended Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1895 and went on to work in education at schools across North Carolina first as a teacher, principal, and superintendent, and then as the Director of the Division of Negro Education in Raleigh during segregation and Jim Crow. He was a founding member of the North Carolina Commission for Interracial Cooperation and served as director of the Division of Cooperation in Education and Race Relations.
Nathan Carter Newbold married Mabel Wooten in 1900. Wooten was born in La Grange, North Carolina in 1875 and died in 1903. She attended the State Normal and Industrial School in North Carolina (which later became the University of North Carolina at Greensboro) and graduated in 1895.
In 1905 Nathan Carter Newbold married Eugenia Bradsher, who was born in 1875 in Person County. Eugenia Bradsher was a classmate of Mabel Wooten at the State Normal and Industrial School in North Carolina (UNCG) and also graduated in 1895. She died in 1960.
William Newbold was Nathan Carter Newbold's grandfather. He was the Sheriff in Pasquotank in the 1850s and died in 1864.
General hospital founded in 1771 in New York, N.Y. The New York Ladies' Southern Relief Association was founded by Mrs. Algernon Sydney Sullivan in New York City in December, 1866.

The organization collected funds, food, and clothing, and distributed them via southern clergy.
Frederick B. Nightingale (F.B.) was born in 1885 and died in the 1950s. He worked in sales for General Electric until the 1940s, when he founded his own lighting company, Kim Lighting, and became a local celebrity in 1928 when he erected the giant "Star of Palawoo" above his Pasadena property in the Altadena hills in California.
The Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) compiled and held the materials that became this collection of poster designs (formerly known as the Outdoor Advertising Sketch Library), but the card file and volumes in this collection most likely originated within the outdoor advertising companies represented, such as General Outdoor Advertising Co. and Foster and Kleiser. OAAA is the primary professional and trade association representing the outdoor advertising industry and was founded to promote outdoor advertising interests in the United States. OAAA members own and operate billboards, street furniture, transit, or other outdoor advertising displays. Members also include service providers to the industry, users of the outdoor medium, and others supporting its goals.

Parker Pillsbury (September 22, 1809 ‚Äì July 7, 1898) was an American minister, lecturer, newspaper editor, and advocate for abolition and women's rights. He was born in Hamilton, Massachusetts, the son of Oliver Pillsbury, a blacksmith and farmer, and Anna (Smith) Pillsbury. He was a descendant of William Pillsbury who came to Massachusetts circa 1640. Parker‚Äôs parents moved to Henniker, New Hampshire in 1814. He was educated in the district school and worked on farms in New Hampshire and as a wagoner in Massachusetts. From 1835 to 1838, he studied at the Gilmanton Theological Seminary, and then for a year at the more conservative Andover Theological Seminary. By the time Pillsbury left Andover he was a devout Abolitionist. He briefly held a parish position at the Congregational Church at Loudon, New Hampshire, however his Congregational license to preach was revoked in 1840 because of his use of the pulpit to denounce slavery. Though he held no regular pastorate, he continued to preach for free religious societies in Toledo, Ohio, Battle Creek, Michigan, Rochester, New York and elsewhere. On January 1, 1840, he married fellow abolitionist Sarah H. Sargent of Concord, New Hampshire.
Pillsbury was an abolitionist of the Garrisonian type, and from 1840 until the emancipation of the slaves was lecture agent for the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and American anti-slavery societies. An admirer of John Brown, he spoke at a demonstration meeting in Rochester, New York following Brown‚Äôs execution. In 1840 and again in 1845-46 he edited the Herald of Freedom, at Concord, New Hampshire, and from January to May 1866 the National Anti-Slavery Standard, in New York City. After the Civil War he was active in efforts to procure the right of suffrage for African Americans believing that the right to vote was necessary for their protection. He was also interested in temperance, political reform, international peace, and women‚Äôs rights.
Pillsbury was one of the earliest and most devoted advocates women's rights in the nineteenth century. He severed his connection with the Standard when its managers showed themselves more favorable toward extending the right to vote to African Americans than to women. He was a long time vice-president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage Association and helped draft the constitution of the American Equal Rights Association. From 1868 to 1870, he was joint editor with Elizabeth Cady Stanton of the Revolution, a radical weekly. In addition to contributions to these newspapers, he wrote the Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles (1883), a history of the abolition movement in New England.

The family moved to Johnston County after the Civil War. Pou began practicing the legal profession in Raleigh, and soon joined the practice of his relative by marriage Josiah Bailey, and later with his son, James H. Pou, Jr.
In the period of Reconstruction politics Pou emerged as an active, articulate Democrat and served three terms in the General Assembly: in 1885 as a representative and in 1888 and 1892 as a senator. Although he was urged to pursue a career in politics, he chose to devote his time to his law practice.
In 1889, Pou was married to Annie Walker. They had two children, James H. Pou, Jr., and Edith Walker Pou, who married Josiah Bailey, whose papers are also available in the Rubenstein Library.
James H. Pou died in Raleigh, N.C. in 1935 and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

R.C. Maxwell Company of Trenton, N.J., was one of the earliest enduring outdoor advertising companies. Founded in 1894 by Robert Chester Maxwell (1873-1954), the business followed burgeoning industry trends, beginning with a variety of outdoor advertising signage along New Jersey and New York roadways as well as at tourist destinations like Atlantic City, N.J., and New York's Times Square. With the commercial development of the incandescent bulb after World War I, the company began creating electric advertising signs in 1919. Maxwell saw great potential in these spectacular signs and established the Electric Sign Manufacturing Plant in Atlantic City, N.J. in the 1920s. This subsidiary created such giant ads as a 50-foot Colgate thermometer that was placed atop a building on the Atlantic City Boardwalk in 1922. The billboards and spectaculars themselves served as a form of advertising for the company, which displayed slogans such as Maxwell Did It and Maxwell Hits alongside its client's signs. R.C. Maxwell owned numerous billboards in Atlantic City, N.J., and a large number of pictures in this collection are located on the Atlantic City boardwalk.
Haim Reingold (1910-2003) was born in Poland, raised in Tel Aviv, and came to the United States in 1930, where he taught mathematics for almost 70 years.

Ron (Ronald E.) Reis began taking photographs as a child with an Argus A2. He shot sports photography in junior high school with an Argus C-3 and an Ansco Reflex. He continued photographing sports, acquiring cameras, and developing his darkroom skills throughout high school. When he moved to Philadelphia in 1953 to attend the University of Pennsylvania, Reis turned his 35mm Leica from the sports fields to the streets.
Influenced by the work of Helen Levitt, Louis Stettner, and Cartier-Bresson, Reis became a passionate street photographer, honing his ability to compose and capture photographs on the fly. This decisive quality is reflected in his contacts sheets filled with single exposures. Reis primarily photographed in New York, Connecticut and Europe during the 1960s. The collection captures the look and feel of the 1960s, especially in the cities of New York City and London.
Reis's photographic work has been exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum, Dartmouth College, the A.T. Gallery in New Haven Connecticut, the New Britain Museum of American Art, the E. Leitz Gallery in New York, and the Image Gallery in New York. In addition, several of his prints were exhibited, as the only amateur photographer, in a Christmas show at the Witkin Gallery in New York City as well as in a one-man show at Parents Magazine Gallery in New York City. His work has been published in Camera 35, Leica Magazine, Popular Photography, and U.S. Camera. Permanent collections of his images reside at Duke University's Rubenstein Library, in the Worcester Art Museum (Worcester, Massachusetts), the Museum of American Art in New Britain, Connecticut, and the British Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.

Sauer, Farrell, & Co. was a cigar manufacturing company located in Suffield, Connecticut, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Suffield was the site of the country's first cigar factory, which opened in 1810 after its owners hired a Cuban to teach its workers how to roll tobacco. The town became home to numerous factories that used local crops and sold a variety of cigars throughout the eastern United States. Not much is known about Sauer, Farrell, & Co. in particular, but its involvement in cigar manufacturing and selling appear to reflect the general activities of Suffield cigar factories during this time.
Heppenheimer & Maurer was a lithography company that created box labels for cigar manufacturers to paste on the inside lid of a box of cigars.

He later partnered with Louis Maurer, another well-regarded artist, to create Heppenheimer & Maurer in 1872. Maurer was one of the few cigar label lithographers who regularly signed his work. The company was one of dozens of lithography companies from this period whose art reflected everyday life in the United States.

At approximately the same time she became active in the women's liberation movement, Shulman began her literary career, publishing articles in both feminist and mainstream periodicals, and publishing a number of children's books and non-fiction books about Emma Goldman. She and Martin Shulman drafted a Marriage Agreement which was published in the feminist journal Up From Under in 1970. The Agreement was re-printed with accompanying articles in Redbook (in 1971) and then in Life (1972). Due to these re-printings, the Agreement received much press and raised much controversy. It was attacked by, among others, Norman Mailer and Russell Baker. Also in 1972, Shulman published her first major (and semi-autobiographical) novel, Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen.Memoirs became a national best seller, raised much debate about the growing feminist movement and the situation of women in U.S. society, and launched Shulman's writing career on a national level.
Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Shulman continued to work as a feminist activist, to write essays and short stories for a wide variety of journals and newspapers, to teach and present speeches and conference papers, and to publish novels and memoirs. She divorced Martin Shulman in 1985 and married former Cleveland Heights High School classmate Scott York in 1989. Her two most recently published books are Drinking the Rain (1995), an account of her solitary, non-technological life on a Maine island, and A Good Enough Daughter (1999), a memoir focusing on her relationships with her late parents. She received an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Case Western Reserve University in 2001.

Author and medical doctor Cuthbert O. Simpkins (b. 1947) wrote the first biography of jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane (1926-1967), titled Coltrane: A Biography (Perth Amboy, NJ: Herndon House Publishers, 1975). Coltrane was born in Hamlet, N.C., and his family moved to High Point in 1927, where he lived until 1943. Beginning in the mid-1940s, he regularly performed on tenor saxophone as a sideman, including stints in bands led by Jimmy Heath, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. By the early 1960s, Coltrane was leading his own ensembles, including an influential quartet with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones. As a saxophonist, he brought renewed attention to the soprano saxophone in the 1960s, and as a composer and an improviser, Coltrane contributed to a number of harmonic and melodic innovations in jazz.

Florence Moss Smith was born in 1911. While she was an undergraduate student at Duke University from 1928 to 1932, her parents, Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Moss, lived in Mobile, Ala. As an undergraduate at Duke, she was active in the Y.W.C.A., took part in the Woman's Athletic Association, and belonged to the White Duchy.
Receiving her undergraduate degree in 1932, she returned to Duke periodically to pursue graduate studies. She worked at the Duke University Press from 1937 to 1938 and on Oct. 1, 1938, was appointed general personnel worker and counselor-at-large in the Woman's College at Duke University. The Woman's College Student Handbook indicates that by 1939 she held the position of Director of Religious Activities. She held this position until 1941 when she married Frank Ferrell Smith, also a Duke alumnus, who was with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service at that time. From the time her husband joined the U.S. Navy in 1942 until his discharge in 1945, Smith stayed with her parents who still resided in Mobile, Ala. During the war she was the primary person responsible for rearing their two sons, Frank Jr., born in 1942, and Howard, born in 1944.
After World War II, the Smith family settled in Alabama. By 1959, they were living in Loxley, Ala., and a third son James (Jim) had been born.
Three generations of Florence Moss Smith's family are represented in the collection, which ends in 1973. At that time, her son Jim had just competed law school at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, and Howard, having completed a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1971, was just getting out of the U.S. Army. By 1973, both of them had married. Frank Smith, Jr. died in March of 1960. When Ms. Smith gave the collection to the Rubenstein Library, she was living in Elberta, Ala.

Peter Storey (b. 1938) was schooled in Cape Town, South Africa, spent some time in the South African Navy, and then trained for the Methodist ministry at Rhodes University. Storey pastored churches in Cape Town, and later served as a chaplain to Robben Island prison, where he ministered to Nelson Mandela. After two years in Australia, Storey returned to District Six, a coloured community in Cape Town whose people faced forced removal under apartheid law. Storey was prominent in the fight against these removals, at the same time launching a number of ministries, including The Carpenter's House, Cape Town's first non-racial community center, and founded Dimension, the national newspaper of the Methodist Church, which took an uncompromising anti-apartheid stance under his nine-year editorship.
He was appointed to Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church in 1976, the year of the Soweto uprising, and immediately questioned the all-white nature of the congregation. The following years saw the loss of some 200 white members, but also the creation of the first fully integrated Methodist church in the land. The Central Methodist Mission--as it became known--was a center of protest action against apartheid, often being surrounded and sometimes invaded by government Security Forces.
During this period Storey became Vice President of the South African Council of Churches (SACC) and was elected President of this body in 1981. In this position, he and Bishop Desmond Tutu, who was then General Secretary, steered the SACC through its most controversial and embattled era of anti-apartheid action. This included facing the notorious Eloff Commission of Inquiry into the SACC. His testimony to the Commission has been published under the title Here We Stand.
In 1984 Storey was elected President of the Methodist Church and co-lead an ecumenical delegation to the United Nations and Europe to urge international pressure against the South African Government's forced removal policy. He then became Bishop of the Central District, including Johannesburg and Soweto. He also headed up the Journey to the New Land transformation process, which has redesigned the Methodist Church for its mission in the new South Africa.
Committed to peacemaking, he co-chaired the Wits-Vaal Peace Secretariat, responsible for keeping the peace in the Johannesburg region in the run-up to the first democratic elections and became Patron of the Methodist Order of Peacemakers, which focused on non-violence. He was first chairperson of the Gunfree South Africa movement, and he was a member of President Mandela's Selection Committee for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
Storey has received honorary Doctor of Divinity and Doctor of Law degrees. His international ministry has included frequent preaching and lecturing journeys to the United States, Europe, and Australia, and he has addressed many conferences related to the situation in South Africa, the truth and reconciliation process, and world peace.

Her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin(1852) was a depiction of life for African Americans under slavery; it reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and United Kingdom. It energized anti-slavery forces in the American North, while provoking widespread anger in the South. She wrote more than 20 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stands on social issues of the day.

„Åô„Åî„Çç„Åè, or sugoroku, are Japanese games similar to "snakes and ladders". These types of games typically involve numbered squares, which players navigate from bottom to top using dice, and where there may be "ladders" allowing a climb ahead or "snakes" causing a fall behind. Sugoroku may vary in structure and game play, and often include instructions on how to play. In the Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa periods (1890s-1940s and later), sugoroku games were sometimes included as inserts in newspapers and children's magazines.

Walter Lee Sutton
Walter Lee Sutton was born in 1863 in Wilkes County, Georgia. In 1886, he married Harriet (Hattie) Louise Wynn, also from Wilkes County, and they had ten children, two of whom died at an early age.
Sutton attended school in Danburg, Ga., and in the early 1880s went to business college in Atlanta. Before he ran his own business he worked in the general merchandising business Sutton and Anderson, which was run by his father and uncle, and delivered the Atlanta Constitution to families in the area. From about 1888 to 1907, he was a partner with his brother-in-law, Thomas V. Heard, in the general merchandising business, Heard and Sutton, in Danburg. When this firm was dissolved about 1907, Sutton maintained the firm which continued as a general merchandising business under the name W. L. Sutton Company. Sutton was also a planter, cotton merchant, director of the National Banks of Wilkes, and a director of Pope Manufacturing Company of Washington, Ga.
In addition, Sutton was a member of the Danburg Baptist Church, where he served on the Board of Deacons and as Superintendent of the Sunday school. He donated land for the consolidated school built in Danburg in the early 1920s, served as a trustee of the school, and chairman of the Board of Education of Wilkes County. He was active in the Democratic Party, member of the Woodmen of the World, and the Wilkes County Farmers Club. Sutton died in 1947.

Augustin Louis Taveau (1828-1886), was a planter and author born and raised in South Carolina. He was the son of Louis Augustin Thomas Taveau (1790-ca. 1857), planter; and his wife, Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball Taveau (d. 1847). He attended school at Mt. Zion Academy, Winnsboro, South Carolina starting in 1838. From 1848 until 1854 Taveau lived usually in or near Charleston studying law while also developing an interest in poetry. During this time he took a two year trip to Europe largely financed through his father's estate. In 1855 Taveau had a book of his poems, "The Magic Word and Other Poems" (Boston, 1855), published under the pseudonym of Alton.
Late in 1861 Taveau settled on a farm near Abbeville, South Carolina, but soon afterwards joined the Confederate Army. His career in the army continued until 1865. Immediately after the war, papers containing letters and copies of letters were published in the New York Tribune by Taveau under the title of A Voice from South Carolina. In the letters he stated that former Southern leaders could not be trusted and condemning them for having allowed conscription. After searching for a place to live after leaving the army, Taveau and his family finally settled in 1866 on a farm near Chaptico in St. Mary's County, Maryland. From 1866 until his death he continued to write poems and other literary works, worked to get patents for several inventions and oversaw work on his farm.
Walter J. Taylor was born on September 4, 1934, and was educated as a mechanic in the San Francisco area. He was convicted several times for burglary, robbery, and other crimes, and was sent to San Quentin prison in 1968 following a string of burglaries in Berkeley, California. While in prison he attended classes, read and wrote about African Americans' struggle for justice and civil rights, and served on the San Quentin Inmate Advisory Council. He was later transferred to Folsom Prison. Many of his letters from jail mention his campaigns for prisoner rights, including a right to privacy in prisoner correspondence and his protesting of the censorship of Black newspapers for prisoners.
While in prison, Taylor maintained an active correspondence with his family and friends. This was supplemented through prolific correspondence to pen pals that he met through Sisters of Motivation, an organization that he founded to enable communication between women and black male prisoners. Although the Sisters of Motivation literature claimed that it was not a dating service, Taylor's correspondence reveals that he had relationships with several women that he appears to have met through the organization.
Although he was up for parole several times previously, Taylor was eventually granted parole in 1973. He remained in the Oakland area as a counselor for Thresholds, a community advocacy group targeted at juvenile delinquents. He also served as a collections agent for KDIA Radio, and opened his own record store, Oldies But Goodies. Taylor remained an activist for prisoner rights, running at one point for the Oakland Community Action Agency's administrative board. He also founded the Community Concern for Prisoners organization to help African American men in prison. Throughout his life, Taylor appears to have been actively writing articles, essays, poems, and songs, and this activity continued as well.
In October 1978, Taylor was arrested and held for four days as a suspect in the Stinky Rapist case. The Stinky Rapist was a serial rapist in Berkeley and Oakland, California, who police believe raped at least 62 women, beginning in 1973 and lasting for five years. The rapist was deemed stinky because many of the women reported him having a foul smell. None of the victims were able to see their attacker, making it impossible to identify him. Taylor was suspected due to his being in the vicinity in several of the cases, as well as his reported sexual fetishes, his peculiar behavior, and his known contact with some of the victims, two of whom were members of the Sisters of Motivation. The evidence being circumstantial, however, led police to release him without charging him. Taylor subsequently reported severe repercussions for his business and his job. The rapes stopped shortly afterward, and the statute of limitations ran out in 1981.
Not much is known about Taylor's life following the Stinky Rapist suspicions. He is believed to have died in 2007.

Dorothea Lynde Dix (1802-1887) was an American author, teacher, and reformer who advocated for improving treatment and facilities for mental health care. She also served as a superintendent for nurses during the American Civil War.
Dix was originally from Hampden, Maine and attended school in Boston, Mass. She became interested in mental healthcare while living abroad in Europe, and returned to the United States to tour American facilities. She publicly advocated for the cause, lobbying healthcare officers and politicians, and raising funds through state allocations and private contributions to improve hospitals and medical treatment of mental health patients throughout the country. Her work led to the establishment of state asylums in North Carolina, New Jersey, and Illinois.
During the American Civil War, Dix was designated as Superintendent of Army Nurses for the Union Army. She sought formal training and opportunities for women in nursing, and over the course of the war appointed over 3000 nurses. She later fundraised for a national monument for deceased soldiers, now standing at Fort Monroe, Virginia.
Dix had recurring health problems throughout her life, and spent later years as a resident of the New Jersey State Hospital in Trenton.

Triangle Community Works! is an organization that seeks to serve as a framework, a resource, and a partner to meet the emerging needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other communities in the Greater Triangle area of North Carolina. It was formed in 1994 and consists of a coalition of groups, including ASPYN (A Safer Place Youth Network), The Gay and Lesbian Helpline, P-FLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and RRNGLE (Raleigh Religious Network for Gay and Lesbian Equality).
The Gay and Lesbian Helpline, which joined TCW! in 1996, began operating in 1991 as the first hotline for the gay and lesbian community in the Raleigh area. It offers peer counseling, education, information, and referrals for callers about anything from gay-friendly bars to AIDS education.
ASPYN, another component of TCW!, serves as a community safe haven for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and allied youth, ages 13-18.
More information about Triangle Community Works!, including their various programs and current activities, can be found on their website, http://www.tcworks.org/.

The TCAS Academic Advising Center, formerly the TCAS Pre-Major Advising Center, located on East Campus provides academic advising resources to students before they declare a major. All freshmen are assigned an advisor upon matriculation and meet with this advisor until they declare their major, which must be done by the end of their fourth semester at Duke. The Academic Advising Center publishes a monthly newsletter and assists students with course selection, course dropping/adding, finding tutors, and major declaration among other things.
From http://www.duke.edu/aiesec/
The Duke University chapter of AIESEC was founded around 1966. AIESEC is an international, non-political, non-profit, student-run, independent, educational foundation. It is comprised of students and recent graduates of institutions of higher education who are interested in professional careers in economics and management. AIESEC provides companies with highly qualified, cost-effective temporary workers from many countries. These students and recent graduates provide insight into foreign markets and bring an international perspective to management. Internationally, AIESEC arranges the details to place more than 6,000 business graduates each year. In the United States, AIESEC provides traineeships with companies such as IBM, AT&T, Arthur Andersen, and General Electric.
The Duke University chapter was responsible for locating companies in North Carolina interested in sponsoring an international student for a short traineeship exchange, and for hosting foreign students. The Duke University chapter also worked with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill chapter to provide orientation, entertainment, and guidance for students who came to the Raleigh-Durham, N.C. area on an AIESEC traineeship exchange. The Duke University chapter organized the exchange of many students during the late 1960s; the majority of students traveled to work in western European offices.
As of 2003, AIESEC is active at Duke University.
Alpha Kappa Psi was the first professional business fraternity in the United States. The fraternity was founded October 5, 1904 at New York University and is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Alpha Kappa Psi's objectives are to further the individual welfare of its members, foster scientific research in the fields of commerce, accounts, and finance, to educate the public, and to promote courses leading to degrees in business administration.
The Beta Eta chapter at Duke University was chartered on December 7, 1929 in the School of Business Administration. There were 20 original members. Carroll Cunnin was the first president. Semi-monthly meetings were held on campus in the Union Ballroom. They included discussions of current topics in business and featured local businesspeople as speakers. Members of the fraternity also visited industrial organizations, assisted professors with business-related presentations, and corresponded with large organizations on business questions. The fraternity dissolved sometime after 1963.
The Duke Alumni Association's travel program arranges trips for alumni and a Duke faculty host to a wide variety of locations. Trips and destinations have included a South American Amazon cruise, a cruise through the Panama Canal, Morocco, Greece, Italy, Spain, England, and others.
The Duke Amandla Chorus is Duke University's first African chorus, and performs traditional music from various countries in Africa in the respective languages. The chorus shares stories about the culture and people and incorporates dancing and African instruments. "Amandla" is a Zulu and Xhosa word that means "power," and the Chorus uses music as an avenue to teach the Duke and Durham community about the multiplicity of African culture, history, and values.
The following brief history appears on the Lambda Nu website: http://www.duke.edu/apo/
Lambda Nu Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was founded at Duke University in 1955 by Thomas R. Neese. Encouraged by area Boy Scout representative Bill Roth, Neese recruited Robert M. Graper and Joseph Griffin, fellow brothers of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity. Together, they organized the first pledge class with assistance from Rho Chapter of UNC-Chapel Hill. Sixteen men comprised this initial group, which first met in February of 1955. Potential service projects were discussed at this meeting, and the future Brothers choose a project blazing a nature trail at the Durham Children's Museum (now the Museum of Life and Science). This first project, which preceded the chartering of Lambda Nu, has been a regular project of the Chapter ever since.
The Chapter grew in prestige during the 1960s, despite a membership which hovered around twenty men during most of this period, and a need to establish itself among larger service organizations at Duke. APO appeared successful, expanding its service program to include a diverse range of projects.
In 1974, Lambda Nu began accepting women, a full two years before the National fraternity went co-ed. The Chapter was able to do this by submitting membership lists to the National office that included only first initials and last names. Soon afterwards, however, the Chapter began to drift apart, with its last active member deactivating around 1978.
In the Spring of 1979, Duke sophomore Bob McMahan learned about APO from friends who were Brothers at the Iota Lambda Chapter at North Carolina State. McMahan spent the fall 1979 semester researching the history of Lambda Nu and recruiting interested people. By April of 1980, Lambda Nu was reborn, initiating nineteen pledges.
As Duke grew during the 1980s, so did Lambda Nu. Alpha Phi Omega celebrated the opening of the Bryan Center in 1982 helping the Duke University Union raise money to buy the baby grand piano that now sits in the Center's Schaefer Mall. By the end of the 1980s, the Chapter was annually performing thousands of hours of service for the Durham community, working for groups like the Eno River State Park, Lenox Baker Children's Hospital, Genesis Home, Duke Rescue Mission, and many local hospitals, schools and shelters. In addition, the chapter's fundraising efforts grew to a donation approaching ten thousand dollars each year to a local charity.
The Office of Ordnance Research (OOR), U.S. Army, a Class II military institution, established offices on the Duke University campus in June 1951. Marcus E. Hobbs, Chairman of the Department of Chemistry, served as acting chief scientist until Tomas J. Killian took over in a permanent capacity. Hobbs was instrumental in developing the "skeleton of the organization" which continued throughout the life of the organization with only minor adjustments. The organization was divided into four main divisions chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and physics. Scientists to fill the top slots were drawn primarily from Duke University, with others from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, North Carolina State, and Virginia Polytech.
OOR first occupied the Hanes Mansion, but after 6 years, the burgeoning Office had outgrown the available space. In December 1958, OOR moved into a new building that was built for them on the Duke campus north of the School of Engineering. The OOR entered a lease arrangement with the University for the space helping to cover the cost of construction.
On January 16, 1961 the OOR ceased to exist and was instead re-designated as the Army Research Office-Durham (AROD) under the command of the Chief, Research and Development.
The 1960s and 1970s saw a weakening in the working relationship between the military and the scientific communities. In the spring of 1975 ARO left the Duke campus and moved to the Research Triangle Park ten miles southeast of Durham.
In an effort to bring all the revenue producing branches of the Business and Finance Division under one office in the early 1960s a Business Auxiliaries department was organized. It included Administrative Data Processing, Dining Halls, Housing Management and University Stores, and later, the Computation Center. From 1976 to 1980 a Campus Services department oversaw a number of activities that had been previously administered by the Physical Plant Department. These included custodial services, grounds maintenance, studio productions, office equipment, transportation, and mail. In 1980 the Auxiliary Services Division was created to replace Business Auxiliaries and Campus Services. In 2009, it was responsible for the operations of food services, special events and conference services, transportation and parking, housekeeping, housing management, office services, and the campus stores. See the newsletter, News and Views, FY1994-1995, for a history. In earlier years, parking was managed by Public Safety (now the Duke Police Dept.), but materials from that period are housed in this collection, rather than under Public Safety.
James David Barber was born in 1930 in Charleston, W. Va. and went on to receive his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. from Yale University. After teaching at Yale for several years, he joined the faculty of Duke's Political Science Department as Chair in 1972. Barber was well known as a presidential scholar and published numerous books including The Presidential Character: Predicting Performance in the White House, The Pulse of Politics: Electing Presidents in the Media Age, Politics by Humans: Research on American Leadership and The Book of Democracy. He served as chair of Amnesty International U.S.A. during the mid-1980s. He remained a community activist in Durham after his retirement from Duke in 1995, helping to raise money for various causes. He died in 2004 at the age of 74.
The Sports Information Office provides information about Duke athletics to the media. They also facilitate press interviews with Duke athletes and coaches. For many years, the Sports Information Office has maintained records, photographs and other material about Duke athletic teams.
The Bassett Affair is a celebrated case that helped establish the concept of academic freedom in higher education in the United States and is a benchmark incident in race relations in the South. John Spencer Bassett, a Trinity College professor, published a series of articles in the South Atlantic Quarterly (1903) that praised the accomplishments of African Americans and offered views on how to improve race relations. A campaign to remove Bassett from the faculty was thwarted by a vote of support for Bassett from the University's Board of Trustees on Dec. 2, 1903.
The Sports Information Office provides information about Duke athletics to the media. They also facilitate press interviews with Duke athletes and coaches. For many years, the SI Office has maintained records, photographs and other material about Duke athletic teams.
John Saeger Bradway (1890-1985) taught law at Duke University School of Law from 1931 to 1959, where Nixon was one of his students. Bradway taught in California until his retirement in 1970. Bradway was married to Mary Henderson in 1921. He died on January 2, 1985 in Eureka, California.
Richard Milhous Nixon (1913-1994) attended the Duke University School of Law from 1934 to 1937, graduating number three in a class of twenty-six. During his three years at Duke, Nixon was active in the Duke Bar Association and was elected President in his senior year. Following school, Nixon began a political career. He was a Senator for California (1950-1953), the nation's 36th vice president (1953 to 1961), and was elected the 37th president of the United States, serving from 1969 until his resignation in 1974.
Nixon was the first U.S. president, since Andrew Johnson in 1868, to be the subject of formal impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. The impeachment process began on October 30, 1973, following a series of staff firings and resignations known as the Saturday Night Massacre prompted by the Nixon administration's attempt to cover-up its involvement with the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.
On May 9, 1974, formal hearings in the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon began, culminating July 27√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú30, 1974, when the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of justice; injury to the constitutional rights of citizens; and the abuse of power. Once Nixon was told his that both his impeachment and his conviction were inevitable he resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, before the House could vote on the articles of impeachment.
R. William Bramberg, Jr., of River Forest, IL, graduated from Duke University in 1957. While a student, Bramberg was a member of Alpha Tau Omega and Hoof'n'Horn.
The Duke Chapel Carillon Records contain the history of the Duke Chapel fifty-bell carillon which was installed in the tower in 1932 in honor of James B. Duke by George G. Allen and William Perkins, chairman and vice chairman of the Duke Endowment. It is used to play afternoon recitals, and programs on holidays and other public occasions. Duke's carillon is played manually from a keyboard located beneath the bells.
The instrument was cast in Loughborough, England by the John Taylor Bellfounders, Ltd. in 1932. The carillon was restored by the same company, now known as John Taylor and Co. in 1992. Anton Brees, who served as the first university carillonneur from 1932 to 1956, gave the inaugural recital on the Chapel carillon as part of commencement weekend in June 1932. While at Duke, Brees simultaneously played at the Bok Singing Tower at Lake Wales, Florida.
J. Samuel Hammond began playing the carillon in 1965 while a Duke undergraduate student in history. He became the Chapel Carillonneur in 1968. He later took on the position of music librarian, in 1974, making him the first music librarian at Duke. In 1986, Hammond transitioned to the role of rare book cataloger and was also designated university carillonneur by President Brodie. He retired from Duke University Libraries in 2012 and continued as university carillonneur until his retirement from the position in 2018. J. Samuel Hammond passed away in February 2021.
The Chamber Arts Society (CAS) was formed in 1945 to support classical music performances by small chamber ensembles at Duke University. Ernest Nelson, a professor of Renaissance History, led the formation of the Society with several other faculty members and was the first Director, 1945-1963. Leland Phelps, a professor in the German Department, was Director from 1963 to 1971, succeeded by Ruth Blum from 1979 to 2000. In 2000, Professor of mathematics Robert Bryant became Director and was then succeeded in 2007 by Professor of English George Gopen. Initially independent of the University, in 1985 the financial administration of the CAS was taken over by Susan Coon of the Duke Office of Cultural Affairs, later the Duke Institute of the Arts and then the Duke Performances Series. The CAS also has an Advisory Board of eight members of the University community who work with the Director of CAS and Duke Performances.
For the first 60 years of operation, the CAS held about five concerts per season, inviting well-respected artists from all over the world. Since George Gopen assumed the directorship, the CAS has held about eight concerts per season. Repeat performers have included the Beaux Arts Trio, the Julliard String Quartet, the St Lawrence Quartet, the Takacs Quartet, the Emerson String Quartet, and many others.
H. Keith H. Brodie received his M.D. in 1965 from Columbia University. He served at hospitals in New Orleans and New York City before becoming a clinical associate with the National Institute of Mental Health in 1968. In 1970, he joined the medical faculty of Stanford University. He came to Duke in 1974 as professor and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and director of Psychiatric Services at Duke University Medical Center. Dr. Brodie served as Duke's Chancellor from 1982 to 1985 and as Duke's President from 1985 to 1993.
August Kenneth Pye (1931-1994) was twice Chancellor of Duke University (1970-1971 and 1976-1982). Educated at the University of Buffalo (B.A., 1951) and Georgetown University (J.D., 1953, LL.M., 1955), Pye held the positions of professor and associate dean at the Georgetown University Law Center, 1955-1966. Pye held a number of positions at Duke. In addition to the chancellorship, he was Dean of the School of Law (1968-1970), University Counsel (1971-1974), Acting Dean of the School of Law (1973), Dean of the School of Law (1973-1977), Director of the Center for International Studies (1982-1984), and Samuel Fox Mordecai Professor of Law (1982-1987). Upon leaving Duke University, Pye held the positions of President and Professor of Law at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas (1987-1994).
President Emeritus R.L. Flowers was named Chancellor in 1949. The position was seemingly an honorary one, and there are no records of his tenure. The office was re-established in March 1969, when President Douglas M. Knight wanted an officer to assist with an increasing executive workload. The Chancellor was given responsibility for the internal operation of the University. Under the University By-Laws of May 10, 1988, the Chancellor was an executive officer with powers and duties assigned by the President. The occupants of the office have been Robert L. Flowers (1949-1951), Barnes Woodhall (1969-1970) (pro tem), A. Kenneth Pye (1970-1971), John O. Blackburn (1971-1976), A. Kenneth Pye (1976-1982), and H. Keith H. Brodie (1982-1985). With Dr. Brodie's inauguration as President, the office was left vacant until William G. Anlyan, M.D., was named Chancellor in 1988. He retired in 1990 and was not replaced.
When James B. Duke selected the site for Duke University's West Campus, in 1925, he chose to locate the Chapel on the site's highest ridge. The Chapel was the first building planned for the new campus, but the last one to be completed. Construction started in 1930, was completed in 1935, and cost nearly $2.3 million. The Chapel began to be used before its stained-glass windows and other details were finished; commencement was held in the Chapel in 1932.
Although the Chapel was inspired by other buildings, including English cathedrals and the chapels of other American universities, it is not a copy of any other specific building. The architect was Julian Abele, chief designer with the Horace Trumbauer firm, of Philadelphia. America's first black architect of renown, Abele was educated at the University of Pennsylvania and in France. In addition to Duke's original West Campus, he designed the Georgian buildings on Duke's East Campus. Abele's other designs include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Harvard's Widener Library, and mansions for James B. Duke.
Lewis Nathaniel Chase was born in 1873 in Sidney, Maine and grew up in Rochester, New York. He earned his A.B. in 1895 from Columbia University. After graduation, he studied stage dancing at Daly's Theater and with several private instructors. He spent one year in Philadelphia selling office equipment before returning to Columbia University and earning his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 1898 and 1903, respectively. He subsequently taught English at the University of Indiana, the University of Louisville, and the University of Bordeaux in France. In 1910, he made a research trip to London, where an old acquaintance suggested that Chase write a volume on Poe for the Harrap's Poetry and Life series; this inaugurated Chase's exhaustive research into Poe's life. In 1916, Chase returned to the U.S. and taught Literature at the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Rochester. He relocated to India in 1920, where he was appointed professor of English Literature at Aligarh Muslim University. Within a few years, he moved to China, where he taught at four different universities. Eventually, he returned to the U.S., teaching at the University of California, the California School of Technology, Riverside College and Union College before joining the faculty of the English Department at Duke University in 1929. Besides Edgar Allan Poe, Chase also specialized in the work of Georgia poet Thomas Holley Chivers, utilizing Duke's collection of Chivers manuscripts. Chase died in 1937.
On November 21, 1852 the State of North Carolina authorized Normal College, Duke's predecessor institution, "to grant such degrees and marks of honor as are given by colleges and universities generally." The institution first awarded A.B. degrees the following year, and thus 1853 is our "degree date." Two brothers, D. C. and Lemuel Johnson, were the recipients, and made up the first graduating class. The 2009 commencement was the one hundred and fifty seventh. The University began printing commencement numbers on the programs in 1932, when that year's was marked as the eightieth commencement. The count therefore was started with the 1853 ceremony. Union Institute and Normal College did celebrate commencement before 1853; however no degrees were awarded at those ceremonies.
Since the 1920s, various counseling services had been offered by the University in cooperation with organizations such as the "Y" and the Southern Women's Educational Alliance. The Bureau of Testing and Guidance was created in 1944 to provide educational and vocational testing services to the University and on occasion to the Durham community. The first staff members were James M. Slay, an Assistant Dean of Trinity College, assistant director Jay Ostwalt, and administrative assistant Mrs. R.E. Lee. The office offered pre-college testing of applicants, placement testing, career counseling, and aptitude testing. It underwent major reorganization in the fall of 1950.
In the 1950s, Henry Weitz became director of the Bureau, the staff was enlarged, and the program's focus was changed to emphasize counseling, with testing placed in a supporting role. In 1964, the name of the organization was changed from the Bureau of Testing and Guidance to the University Counseling Center, further accentuating the role that counseling had come to play in operations.
As its primary mission, the Counseling Center offered general psychological counseling to students, faculty, staff, and the Durham community, particularly in the areas of career planning and education, as well as personal and social development. It also provided students with information concerning jobs, graduate school, financial aid, foreign study, and employment. In 1977, the Counseling Center merged with Student Mental Health Services to form Counseling and Psychological Services, or CAPS.
The Duke-UNC Center for Research on Women (CROW) was founded in 1982 as a collaborative endeavor between Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to promote Women's Studies scholarship, research, and curriculum development in the South. With support from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, smaller grants from local foundations, and institutional backing from both Duke and UNC-CH, the Center aimed to create a network among scholars and others in the region who were interested in the new scholarship on women.
The Center's regular activities included a post-doctoral humanist-in-residence fellowship program; the publication of a working papers series: Southern Women: The Intersection of Race Class and Gender, a joint effort with the Memphis State University Center for Research on Women; the publication of a biannual newsletter, Branches, which informed scholars and other interested individuals in the region about conferences, job opportunities, grants and the new scholarship on women; and a wide range of conferences, seminars and community events.
The Center also sponsored statewide and regional conferences on topics such as Pay Equity in North Carolina, Women and Work in the South, and Dialogues Between Black and White Women. Other activities included high school and college curriculum transformation projects, including the Ford funded project, Incorporating Women of Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum; women's studies summer institutes; the 1988 annual Southeastern Women's Studies Association (SEWSA) meeting; and the 1991 Southern Association of Women Historians Conference. From 1985-1990 the Research Center was home to Signs: A Journal of Women in Culture and Society, one of the leading feminist scholarly journals in the country. The central purpose of the Center was to underline the dynamics of gender, race, and class as central themes upon which to base understanding of women's and men's experiences in the South.
The Center's Advisory Board included both Duke and UNC-CH faculty: Dorothy Browne (School of Public Health, UNC); William H. Chafe (History, Duke); Peter Filene (History, UNC); Barbara Harris (Women's Studies/History, UNC); Iris Hill (Center for Documentary Studies, Duke); Soyini Madison (Speech Communications, UNC); Micheline Malson (Inst. for Public Policy, Duke); Jean O'Barr (Women's Studies, Duke); Margaret O'Connor (English, UNC); Angela O'Rand (Sociology, Duke); Naomi Quinn (Anthropology, Duke); Janice Radway (Literature, Duke); Anne Firor Scott (History, Duke); Jacquelyn Dowd Hall (History, UNC) was the Academic Director and Christina Greene was the Project Director.
The Center's primary projects included:
Curriculum Transformation: grants from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation to work with faculty in the region to create or revise courses in the humanities and social sciences to reflect the new scholarship in women's studies with particular attention to issues of race and class. The Center's first Ford grant in 1982 provided support for the Duke and UNC-CH Women's Studies Program Directors to develop the Introduction to Women's Studies Course on each campus. In 1989-1992, Ford funded the project Incorporating Women of Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum to work with Duke and UNC-CH faculty in four target departments: History, English, Sociology and Anthropology.
Research: Ford provided funding in 1982 for 11 faculty and 28 graduate students from Duke and UNC-CH whose work addressed the Center's focus on gender, race and class.
Signs: A Journal of Women in Culture and Society: In 1985, the Center won a national competition to become the host (1985-1991) to the leading scholarly feminist journal. Many of the Center's Advisory Board members served as editors for the journal. 
Rockefeller Humanist-In-Residence Fellowship Program: From 1987-1992, the Center received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation to bring scholars to the Center for a year to work on a book-length manuscript on race, class, and gender. These funds provided support for 11 scholars (mostly junior scholars), all of whom were able to turn dissertations into books or make substantial progress on completing a second book.
What Difference Does Difference Make: The Politics of Race, Class, and Gender: Ford and Rockefeller Foundation grants provided funds for a national conference to explore the state of the current scholarship on diversity. The conference, held May 1992, brought together scholars in women's, racial, ethnic and critical legal studies to explore some of the current debates surrounding work on diversity, including the controversies over "political correctness" and multiculturalism, affirmative action and the Columbus quincentennial.
Pay Equity in North Carolina: The Center received funding from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation to promote pay equity (based on gender and race equity) in North Carolina through a statewide conference and a pay equity study/project which would serve as a model for similar efforts throughout the state. The Center completed the second phase of the project in the fall of 1992, and Orange County became the first public entity in North Carolina to conduct a pay equity study and make pay adjustments in accordance with its findings.
Visiting Lectureship Series: (funded largely through UNC-CH) brought nationally acclaimed scholars including Kate Young, Joyce Ladner, Gerda Lerner, Frances Fox Pivens, Annette Kolodny, Johnella Butler, Alison Jaggar, Rosalind Petchesky, Ethel Klein, Grace Baruch, and bell hooks to both Duke and UNC-CH for several days to conduct small seminars for faculty and graduate students and to deliver public lectures on both campuses.
Branches: published quarterly and then biannually, the Center's newsletter reached any scholars and interested persons in the Southeast with information about conferences, jobs, funding opportunities and the new scholarship on women. 
The Center also sponsored a wide-range of other grant funded projects such as Dialogues Between Black and White Women; Common Differences Between Black and White Women and hosted both the Southeastern Women's Studies Association Conference and the Second Southern Conference in Women's History.
In the 1970's, dance at Duke, under the excellent guidance of Julia Wray, was housed in a very supportive Physical Education department. The course offerings included two levels of modern dance technique, modern dance repertory, composition, improvisation, and two or three courses in dance history. Two full length concerts as well as 2 or 3 informal events were offered each year. In the late 70's, two levels of ballet technique were added to the curriculum. In the 80's, after dance was moved from Physical Education and placed within the Institute of the Arts, the program developed increased rigor in its training both in the studio and in theory courses. As the number of full time faculty grew from two to seven, the selection of courses increased dramatically.

Dick Groat was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania on November 4, 1930. At Duke, Groat played basketball and baseball and accumulated numerous awards and accolades for his performances in both sports. In basketball, Groat was named All-American in 1951 and 1952 and United Press International's (UPI) National Player of the Year in 1952 after setting an NCAA single-season scoring record with 839 points. Groat was also named the Southern Conference Male Athlete of the Year in 1951 and 1952, the Southern Conference Basketball Tournament's Most Outstanding Player in 1951 and 1952 while also earning all-conference baseball honors in those two seasons, and the Helms National Player of the year in 1952. Additionally, in May 1952, Groat's #10 basketball jersey became the first to be retired in Cameron Indoor Stadium and the only until 1980.
Groat signed a contract with Major League Baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates shortly after graduating in 1952. Groat also served two years in the United States Army from 1953-1955 and played in armed service basketball and baseball leagues. Groat went on to have a fourteen year career in the big leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952-1962), St. Louis Cardinals (1963-1965), Philadelphia Phillies (1966-1967), and the San Francisco Giants (1967). Groat was a member of the World Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates (1960) and St. Louis Cardinals (1964). He was also a five-time All-Star selection and in 1960, the National League's Most Valuable Player and the recipient of the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award. While most well-known for his Major League Baseball career, Groat was also selected by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the first round of the 1952 National Basketball Association amateur draft.
Duke Inquiries into Social Relations was a student-run organization that aimed to investigate and raise awareness of the state of social and gender relations among undergraduates.
Most of the negatives were produced by the Office of News and Communication's News Bureau in the early years of Duke University and later by University Photography (upon its establishment). The Office of News and Communication continues to work with the news media and others to highlight the activities of Duke's faculty, students and staff while University Photography documents the people and programs of Duke University, providing high-quality images for departments, special events, sports programs, the news media and others.
The Duke Chapel is the central focus of Duke University's West Campus, a Gothic-style church rising 210 feet high and completed in 1935. It is constructed with what is commonly called Duke stone, a bluestone from a quarry in Hillsborough, N.C., which is used across West Campus. The Chapel contains 77 stained glass windows and hundreds of carvings and sculptures depicting scenes from the Bible.
In 1924 James B. Duke created the Duke Endowment, funding the development of Trinity College, which renamed itself Duke University. James B. Duke was closely involved with the planning of the new campus for the university, and declared "I want the central building to be a church, a great towering church which will dominate all of the surrounding buildings." The firm of Horace Trumbauer of Philadelphia, P.A., was hired to design the new campus, and the chief designer of the Trumbauer firm was Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the architecture program at the University of Pennsylvania.
Construction on the Chapel began in 1930, with the cornerstone laid on October 22; the majority of the initial construction on West Campus had been completed already. Construction took more than two years, although the Chapel was not completely finished and formally dedicated until 1935; the building was complete enough to be used for Commencement in 1932. Designed in an English Gothic style, the building combines modern materials such as steel trusses with traditional architectural methods such as flying buttresses.
The stained glass windows were created between 1931 and 1933, and were designed and made by G. Owen Bonawit. A panel in Window 2, the Noah window, also credits designer S. Charles Jaekle and craftsman Hugh Doherty. Bonawit apparently selected the subjects depicted in the windows.
Stone carving was done by the John Donnelly Company; woodwork by Irving and Casson-A.H. Davenport, Inc.; ironwork by William H. Jackson Company; carving of the sarcophagi in the Memorial Chapel tombs by Charles Keck; and the carillon was cast by the Taylor Bell Foundry of England. It is unknown exactly who chose the subjects of the exterior and interior carvings. John Donnelly was located in New York, and is likely the one who chose the subjects of the exterior carvings, consulting with a professor from Vanderbilt University. The statues include what appear to be several mistakes: the statue meant to depict Thomas Coke, an 18th century Methodist bishop, may actually depict Thomas Coke, a 17th century English judge; the statue of Robert E. Lee originally had a belt buckle that read U.S. despite Lee being famous as a Confederate general; and other unusual choices.
The original main organ was created by the Aeolian Company, and in 1976 the Chapel received a new organ made by Dirk Flentrop, which was officially named the Benjamin N. Duke Memorial Organ but is commonly referred to as "the Flentrop." A smaller organ is located in the Memorial Chapel.
The Chapel also includes a Memorial Chapel and crypt. Entombed in the Memorial Chapel are James Buchanan Duke, Washington Duke, and Benjamin N. Duke, all of whom were removed from Maplewood Cemetery in 1935. Within the crypt can be found Duke President William P. Few, Duke President and N.C. politician Terry Sanford, and several other figures from Duke's history.
Beginning in 1994, some of the stained glass windows underwent restoration by artisan Dieter Goldkuhle. From 2015 to 2016, the ceiling and roof of the Chapel were completely restored.
In August 2017, after the white supremacist rally and counter-protests in Charlottesville, Va., of August 8, and subsequent protests in the Durham and Chapel Hill areas that included the toppling of a Confederate statue in front of Durham City Hall, the statue of Robert E. Lee was vandalized. Duke President Vincent Price ordered the removal of the statue of Lee from the entrance to the Chapel to an unknown location. In 2018, President Price announced that no new statue would be added, and the spot remains empty.
The book Duke Chapel Illuminated was published in 2001. Photographs of the stained glass windows and other Chapel images were done by Les Todd and Chris Heldreth of Duke Photography. The text was written by Minnie Glymph and the design by Lacy Chylack, both of the Duke University Medical Center.

Louis Dupree was born in Greenville, North Carolina in 1925. He attended Greenville High School until about 1943, enlisting in the armed forces before earning his diploma. He served in World War II, first as a merchant seaman, then as an officer in the 11th Airborne Division in the Philippines campaign and occupation of Japan. Dupree received the Mariner's Medal, Merchant Marine Combat Bar, Combat Infantry Badge, Purple Heart, and Bronze Star.
During 1947 to 1955, Dupree earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in Anthropology from Harvard. He began research in Central and South Asia in 1949. In the United States, Dupree taught and conducted research at Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, from 1953 to 1957. In 1957, he accepted a teaching appointment in the Anthropology Department at Pennsylvania State University. Dupree taught as a Visiting Professor at Kabul University (Afghanistan), Princeton University, and the United States Military Academy at West Point.
From 1959 to 1983, Dupree was a representative of the American Universities Field Staff (AUFS) in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He spent two years researching and writing under the AUFS program, returning to the United States every third year to lecture at the twelve universities sponsoring AUFS. Dupree was also director of several archaeological surveys and excavations in Afghanistan from 1959 to1983, sponsored by American institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History, the National Science Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. His excavation on upper Paleolithic sites at Aq Kupruk in northern Afghanistan won international acclaim.
In 1966, Dupree married Nancy Hatch in Afghanistan, whom he had met while she was writing a guidebook of the Bamiyan area of Afghanistan. The Duprees continued to intermittently live and work in Afghanistan.
While on AUFS business in Kabul, Afghanistan just prior to the 1978 Soviet Invasion, Dupree was imprisoned by Afghans and their Soviet advisors. He was interrogated at length about United States intelligence operations and his interactions with Afghans. He was ultimately released through the intervention of Afghan friends. The account of his imprisonment appears as a six-part series, Red Flag over the Hindu Kush in American University Field Staff Reports (1980).
As other nations became interested in the plight of Afghanistan, the Duprees were called upon to advise the parliaments or foreign ministries of Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, England, Austria, Pakistan, and to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. Dupree frequently corresponded with Pakistan's president, General Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq. In the United States, Dupree acted as a consultant to the State Department, United States Agency for International Development (U.S. AID), the Peace Corps, Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Company, United Nations Development Programs, UNESCO, Helsinki Watch, Amnesty International, the World Bank, and other organizations.
In 1985, after teaching for one year at West Point Military Academy and another year at Princeton University, he joined the Program in Islamic and Arabian Development Studies at Duke University as a Senior Research Associate. He held concurrent appointments at Duke University as Visiting Professor of Anthropology, Political Science, and Public Policy Studies. He also taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the departments of Anthropology and Political Science.
The Islamic and Arabian Development Studies Program operated at Duke from 1977 to 1989 under the direction of Professor Ralph Braibanti. It funded the acquisition of library materials that supported its mission, facilitating the accession to the Duke libraries of two major Middle Eastern collections: the Joseph J. Malone Collection on Arabian Affairs and the Louis and Nancy Hatch Dupree Collection on Islamic Inner Asia. The Dupree Collection consists of about 5,000 items, 200 of which are located in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Reflecting the careers and interests of their donors, the materials in the collection focus on the anthropology, art, archaeology, folklore, linguistics, and history of Afghanistan. There are also significant holdings on Islam, the Central Asian Republics, and South Asia.
A social activist, Dupree was Honorary Director and one of the founders of the Afghan Relief Committee. The beneficiaries of the Afghan Relief Committee were primarily Doctors Without Borders, Freedom Medical of Washington, D.C., Aide Medicale International, and Sainte Sud of Marseilles. Dupree was involved with the Afghanistan Action Committee at Duke University and corresponded with members of many other humanitarian assistance organizations.
Dupree and Nancy Hatch Dupree spent years researching and living in Afghanistan and planned to retire there. Together they researched and planned to write a book on Afghan refugees in Pakistan. By 1987, their collaborative work earned them a joint award, the International Rescue Committee's Bronze Medal for Service to Afghanistan Refugees. In 1988, the Duprees returned to Pakistan as Joint Fulbright Senior Scholars. Louis Dupree authored many books and over 200 articles. His articles appeared in various publications such as American Anthropologist, the Middle East Journal, the Economist, the New York Times, the Nation, Evergreen Review, and the Khyber Mail.
Some of the books authored by Dupree include: Afghanistan (1973), Physical Anthropology of Afghanistan (1970), Changing Patterns of Social Structure in Afghanistan (1970), Deh Morasi Ghundai: a Chalcolithic Site in South-Central Afghanistan (1963), and The Desert Survival Field Test (1956).
Louis Dupree died in 1989 at the age of 63. Nancy Hatch Dupree continued her work with Afghan refugees.
Born in Shelby, NC in 1870, Robert Lee Durham was a member of the Trinity College championship football team of 1891, the same year of his graduation. He received a law degree in 1892 and subsequently practiced law until 1909, taking time out to fight in the Spanish-American War. During 1909-1919, he served as dean and mathematics instructor at various institutions including Davenport College, Centenary College, and Martha Washington College. In 1919, he became president of Southern Seminary, a school for girls in Buena Vista, VA. He was the brother of Stonewall and Plato Durham, and the father of Dr. Margaret Robey, all Trinity graduates. He died in 1948 after a brief illness.
The Duke University Union, founded in 1954 as the Duke Student Union, has as its purpose promoting social, recreational, cultural, educational and spiritual activities at Duke. Membership is now open to all members of the Duke community. At present (2009), an executive group and program directors administer the Union.
ECOS (Environmentally Conscious Organization of Students) was formed at Duke University in 1969. ECOS grew to include members of the Durham, N.C. community in their efforts to educate people on environmental concerns. Other environmental groups active around the Raleigh-Durham, N.C. area in the early 1970s were: Chapel Hill ECOS, Organization for Environmental Quality (Raleigh), and the Conservation Council of North Carolina.
ECOS members were advocates of University-wide recycling, conservative population growth, and responsible consumption. At Duke University, members proposed an environmental studies program and organized a teach-in. ECOS came to be known for their recycling efforts, employing a small staff to collect newspapers, aluminum, and glass for resale to local companies.
Some of ECOS' awareness-raising activities included a Bike-a-Thon between Raleigh and Durham, protesting the development of the Eno River area, protesting construction of the New Hope Dam, and lobbying for environmentally sound work spaces. The Eno River Park project was particularly important to the Durham, N.C. region. In the early 1970s, ECOS and supporters led a campaign to save the Eno River area from commercial development. Due to ECOS' protest efforts, the city of Durham withdrew its efforts to construct a reservoir. The Eno River State Park was established in 1972.
As of 2003, ECOS is known as the Environmental Alliance and is active at Duke University.

The Sports Information Office provides information about Duke athletics to the media. They also facilitate press interviews with Duke athletes and coaches. For many years, the SI Office has maintained records, photographs and other material about Duke athletic teams.
The Friends of Duke Chapel was founded in 1974 to provide the means for interested persons to organize into an ongoing, supportive, participatory group to support the ministry and program of Duke Chapel. The Friends open membership to anyone interested in the Chapel and its program. It grew out of a predecessor group called the Full Membership Chapel Group, organized under and continuing the name of Duke University Church (Interdenominational). Full Members supported the Chapel program but membership was limited to persons affiliated with the University either as faculty or staff. As part of its mission, the Friends of Duke Chapel provide funds to aid numerous aspects of the Chapel program such as the chapel choir, organ, vestments, renovation needs, and provision of televised services. Membership benefits included weekly mailing of the Sunday bulletin, announcements and invitations to services, concerts, and music programs, as well as a Friends of Duke Chapel newsletter.
The Friends have continuously helped fund and contribute to numerous initiatives and renovations of the Chapel, including the construction of a handicapped ramp access to the Chapel, installation of the Flentrop organ, and providing televised access to the Sunday services for patients at Duke Medical Center. They also contributed to enriching the preaching and theologian-in-residence programs.
An Advisory Board governs the group. Originally a nine-person board, it was enlarged to a thirteen person board in 1981, always including the Dean of the Chapel. Past board members include William Stokes, Helen Crotwell, Jack Blackburn, Arthur Kale, William King, Ella Jean Shore, Carolyn Penny, and Mary Parkerson, who became the first Friends Director in 1980.
In 1968, the University's Board of Trustees approved the establishment of a Graduate School of Business Administration and the award of the M.B.A degree. The School opened in the fall of 1970, the last of the schools James B. Duke requested that the University include. In 1980, John Brooks Fuqua, Atlanta entrepreneur and philanthropist, endowed the school with $10 million and it was renamed in his honor. Deans have been Louis D. Volpp, 1970-1973; Danny Laughhun, 1973-1974; Tom Keller, 1974-1995; Rex Adams, 1995-2001; Douglas Breeden, 2001-2007; and Blair Sheppard, 2007-
William Trigg Gannaway was born in Wythe County, Virginia in 1826. He graduated from Emory and Henry College in Bristol, Tennessee in 1847. In the autumn of that year, he opened a high school at Floyd Court House, Virginia. He conducted this school for a few years when he was elected head of a high school at Germanton, North Carolina. He ran this school until he was appointed Professor of Latin and History at Trinity College in Randolph County, North Carolina in 1857. In the absence of Braxton Craven, Gannaway served as President of the college from 1863-1865. He remained at Trinity College until it moved to Durham in 1892, when he retired from teaching. After retiring, he kept his home and farm in Randolph County. He died in 1911.
Gilbert-Addoms Residence Hall opened in 1957 and is constructed of buff brick with limestone trim. Its name commemorates two outstanding scholars who began teaching at Duke with the founding of the Woman's College: Dr. Katherine Everett Gilbert and Dr. Ruth Margery Addoms. In 1930, the new West Campus opened and what had been the Trinity College campus (now East Campus) became the Woman's College.
Gilbert-Addoms, the largest dormitory on East Campus, is home to freshman undergraduate students. Gilbert-Addoms is located between Southgate and Blackwell Residence Halls.
William Henry Glasson (1874-1946) was a white American academic economist and administrator who was born in Troy, New York. He received a PhB from Cornell University in 1896 and a PhD from Columbia University in 1900. He was head of the Department of History and Civics at the George School (Newton, PA) from 1899-1902 and came to Trinity College after. During this tenure at Trinity and Duke University, he was instrumental in the development of the Department of Economics and the Graduate School. He was Professor of Political Economy and Social Science from 1902-1940; appointed in charge of the establishment of the retirement annuity plan for the faculty and administration; the head of the Department of Economics and Business Administration; chairman of the faculty committee on graduate instruction; and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1926-1938. He was secretary of the Phi Beta Kappa Society for the South Atlantic district; editor of the South Atlantic Quarterly from 1905-1909; and a member of the Durham Board of Education.
The Duke Graduate Liberal Studies program was founded in 1984, under director Bonnie E. Erickson. Additional previous directors include Diane Sasson and Donna Zapf. The program grants a Master of Arts in Liberal studies (MALS) and is sometimes referred to as the MALS program.
The Duke Graduate Students Union (DGSU) formed in early 2016, when graduate student workers partnered with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). These two organizations campaigned to form a majority union and petitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The election in March 2017 was inconclusive: although the tabulated votes indicated the vote would fail, enough ballots remained contested by SEIU and the University to tip the vote in either direction. SEIU, acting on behalf of DGSU, withdrew the petition to unionize from the NLRB. Since spring 2017, DGSU exists as a direct-action, direct-join union and is active on campus advocating for increased benefits for graduate student workers, as well as organizing alongside other employee labor groups at Duke University.
John R. Gregg (1916-2009) was a Biological Science Professor Emeritus at Duke University. After earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama and his PhD from Princeton University, Gregg served as a professor in the Duke University Zoology department from 1957 to his retirement in 1986. During his time at Duke, Gregg served as the acting chair of the Zoology department chair from 1958-1959 and as director of graduate studies from1968-1971. Gregg authored 33 publications during his academic career including two books, The Language of Taxonomy (1954) and Form and Strategy (1963). His work on taxonomic systems in The Language of Taxonomy led to the development of the "Gregg Paradox".
During the summer of 1967, he led the Undergraduate Institute for Theoretical Biology sponsored by NASA. During his career, Gregg collaborated closely with British biologist Joseph Henry Woodger, the developer of the influential Axiomatic Method.In addition to his scientific work, Gregg was extremely passionate about archery and donated his collection of antique bows and other artifacts to the Smithsonian Museum.
Paul M. Gross was born in 1895. He received degrees from the City College of New York (B.S., 1916) and Columbia University (M.S., 1917 and Ph.D. 1919) in physical chemistry. He arrived at Trinity College in 1919, and began his tenure as Assistant Professor of Chemistry, teaching physical, organic, and fluorine chemistry. He led the Chemistry Department as Duke University underwent the transformation from regional college to research university. Gross served Duke University as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry (1919-1920), William H. Pegram Professor of Chemistry (1920-1965), Chair of the Chemistry Department (1921-1948), Dean of the Graduate School (1947-1952), Dean of the University (1952-1958), and Vice-President in the Educational Division (1949-1960). Gross was a proponent of scientific research and its value for education and society and held many seminars for science educators in North Carolina.
Gross directed Duke University's scientific research for both the U.S. Army and Navy during wartime. Naval Research on organic fluorine gases, compounds, and batteries was carried out by the Chemistry Department under contract with the Office of Naval Research. As part of the Army Scientific Advisory Panel, Gross advised top U.S. Army researchers on scientific matters. Gross was also involved in the Frangible Bullet Project, the largest military research project at Duke University. The frangible bullet, developed in 1942, was a plastic explosive that behaved like a bullet and enabled accurate training practices. The project earned Gross the President's Medal of Merit.
While a successful scientist, Gross is perhaps best known at Duke University as an administrator. Gross' administrative career at Duke University began in 1934 when he was named Chair of the University Research Council, a position he held until 1949. The Research Council helped to guide the University as it developed into a respected research institution. He also chaired the University Committee on Long Range Planning from 1959-1960. His opinions on administrative matters, along with his Vice President of Educational Division status, led to conflicts with President A. Hollis Edens around 1960, in what came to be known as the Gross-Edens Affair. The conflict mostly concerns the debate over whether Duke University should become a regional or national university, and to what degree the institution should be known for its devotion to research or teaching. Edens resigned from his position as University President, and Gross was removed from his administrative position as a result of the conflict.
In addition to his university positions, Paul Gross also served on numerous state, regional, and national boards relating to scientific research. In the late 1940s, he was a founder of the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies (later Oak Ridge Associated Universities) and served as its President until 1949. President Harry S. Truman appointed Gross to the original National Science Foundation board in 1950, a position he held for 12 years. Gross held other administrative positions within the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the United States Health, Education, and Welfare Committee on Environmental Health, the Council of Southern Universities, the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology, Research Triangle Institute, Governor's Research Triangle Committee, and the North Carolina Atomic Energy Advisory Committee.
As an independent contractor, Gross was called upon to evaluate the composition of products including beer, cosmetics, film, and fire extinguishers. He was a sought-after speaker among his colleagues, giving many dedications, eulogies, lectures, panel discussions, testimonials, and dinner addresses during his career. When Gross retired from teaching at Duke University in 1965, the Gross Chemical Laboratory on Duke University's West Campus was named in his honor. Paul M. Gross died in 1986 at the age of 91.
Paul M. Gross was the son of Magnus and Ellen Sullivan Gross of New York. He married Gladys Cobb Peterson in 1918. They had two children: Paul M. Gross, Jr. and Beatrix Gross Ramey.
Norman Guttman was born October 17, 1920 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He married Renate Pawel on February 6, 1948. He received his B. A. degree in 1942 from the University of Minnesota and his Ph.D. from Indiana University in 1951. He came to Duke soon after earning his Ph.D. and began teaching in the Dept. of Psychology. Dr. Guttman was Director of Graduate Studies in Psychology from 1963-1964 and 1965-1967. He was also active in curricular reform at Duke. His chief interests were learning stimulus generalization, conditioning, motivation, and the history of psychology. He died in April 1984.
Charles R. Hauser was a 40 year faculty member at Duke University. He came to Duke as an instructor in Chemistry in 1929. He was appointed to full professor in 1946 and was named a James B. Duke professor of Chemistry in 1961. Hauser was born in California (b. 1900) but reared and educated in Florida receiving his B.S. and M.S. from the University of Florida in 1923 and 1925 respectively. His Ph.D. was received from the University of Iowa in 1928.
Hauser was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and was the author of more than 400 articles on original research appearing in publications such as the Journal of the American Chemical Society and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. He received numerous awards and citations such as the Certificate of Merit for his work on a government project during World War II on the synthesis of anti-malarials, the American Chemical Society's Florida Section Award as the year's (1957) "outstanding chemist of the South" the National American Chemical Society Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry (1962), the Herty Medal (1962), and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufactures Association Medal (1967). He died in 1970 at the age of 69.
Frederic Blackmar Mumford Hollyday was born in Easton Maryland in 1928. He received his B.A. from Washington and Lee University in 1948, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Duke University in 1950 and 1955, respectively. He joined the faculty of the Duke History Department in 1956, and he specialized in 19th century German history. In 1968 and 1971, he served as Director of Undergraduate Studies in the History Department. Among his major publications include the books Bismarck's Rival: A Political Biography of General and Admiral Albrecht von Stosch (1960), Bismark: Great Lives Observed (1970), and the edited volume of E. Malcolm Carroll's The Western Powers and Soviet Russia, 1917-1922. He was promoted to Professor in 1971 and served in that capacity until his death in 1982.

The Interfraternity Council at Duke University, established in 1957, is the umbrella organization for Duke University chapters of national fraternities. The Interfraternity Council primarily interacts with the Council of Presidents (presidents of campus fraternities) to promote adherence to University policies and to create leadership opportunities for fraternities to serve the campus community. The Interfraternity Council is divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches.
The Legislative Board is called the Council of Presidents and includes the presidents of all member fraternities. The Council of Presidents convenes to vote on administrative matters of the Interfraternity Council.
The Executive Council generally facilitates policy creation and assembles committees to work on special events and community service projects. Over the years, these activities have consisted of Greek Week, Shoe and Slipper Weekend, Help Week, and many outdoor concerts. The Executive Council also handles record keeping, publications, and financial accounting.
The Judicial Board enforces the Interfraternity Council Penal Code, tries cases involving infractions by member fraternities, and levies appropriate punishment. Fraternities must maintain good standing with the Council by paying dues, providing periodic financial reports, and completing service projects. Some of the issues reported to the Judicial Board are noise and alcohol violations, hazing, pledging rules, and property damage to fraternity houses.
The Interfraternity Council generally supports fraternity presence at Duke University by employing outside contractors and advisory boards. The input from these sources has helped fraternities make policy decisions about going co-ed, closing a chapter, or updating their image. Since 1954, the Interfraternity Council has published many handbooks for students including: The Greek Way (1954-2001), Rushing Relations (1969-1970), and Open Relations (1961-1969).

The James B. Duke Society recognizes those individuals who have followed the example and generosity of Duke University's founder, James B. Duke, by continuing his vision through involvement and support, and by providing cumulative gifts exceeding $100,000 to all areas of Duke University.
To acknowledge membership in the James B. Duke Society, the University commissioned Tiffany and Company to create a limited edition porcelain box inspired by the original architect's drawings of the West Campus Union and dormitory buildings. Each member of the James B. Duke Society receives one of these "special" boxes and is invited to Duke's annual gala donor recognition weekend.
At the conclusion of 2006-2007 the James B. Duke Society numbered 3156 members.
George "Jelly" Leftwich, a native of Wilmington, NC, was born in 1905. He joined Duke University in 1926 as conductor of the Duke University Club Orchestra, where he remained until 1933. Leftwich is remembered best for having written the words and music to Duke's fight song, "The Blue and White." He ultimately turned over the song's rights to the university.
During his time as conductor, Leftwich elevated both the level of musicianship and number of participants in the music department. His orchestra regularly performed and traveled, while billed as "the South's Finest College Band." Leftwich was never known to have mastered an instrument himself, but was well regarded in his capacity as conductor.
Leftwich's time prior to Duke is unclear. While he is credited in newspapers with having attended the University of North Carolina before transferring to Duke in his sophomore year, there is no official record of him as a student at the university. Certain contents of his scrapbooks indicate that he led the Wilmington, NC Seashore Hotel Orchestra in the summer season and was a member of the Carolinians Orchestra in the time leading up to his acceptance of an offer from Duke.
After his time at Duke, Leftwich changed his name to Lee Dixon and pursued a career as a musician. However, he experienced little success and ultimately left the music business during World War II. Upon his music retirement, Leftwich went into the hotel industry and eventually became the manager of the "Downtown Club" in Richmond, Virginia.
Leftwich married his former vocalist Kay Keeyer, and they had two sons. He died in 1977 in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in his hometown of Wilmington, NC.
The son of famed Methodist minister Rev. John Nelson Cole, John Nelson Cole, Jr. was born in 1895 and grew up in Rockingham, NC. He entered Trinity College in 1905 and was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity as well as the Glee Club. He was also friends with Angier B. Duke.
After graduating in 1909 with a degree in journalism, Cole went on to teach English at the Woodberry School in Orange, VA for a short time. From 1910 to 1912, he attended Columbia University's journalism program. He subsequently worked for the Baltimore Hotel, the N.Y. Edison Company, and as a reporter for the New York Evening Post. Later, he worked as advertising writer and salesman for the U.S. Printing and Lithograph Company. Eventually, he became founder and president of the Planographic Equipment Company, which manufactured printing presses and produced pictorial sections for large newspapers.
The Sigma Delta Chapter of Kappa Delta was charted at Duke University in 1912. Its charter members included Mary Gorham, Lucille Gorham, Katie Lee McKinnon, Estelle Flowers, and Catherine Thomas.
During 1915, meetings were held in the home of Mary White Cranford. The women wanted a chapter house on campus, but President Few opposed the idea. Sigma Delta continued to have monthly meetings off campus until 1916, when they were granted meeting space in the Woman's Building. In fall 1918, the women moved into a suite in Alspaugh Hall.
During the first year of their Kappa Delta affiliation, the Sigma Delta chapter attended a Halloween party, gave two rushing parties, and attended garden parties. Some other activities enjoyed by the Sigma Delta chapter were: a "Dream Ship Cruise" themed ball with fellow fraternity men, War Chest and YMCA philanthropy, slumber parties, and supporting Hungarian exchange students at Duke. Kappa Delta also participated in Greek Night and created a float for Joe College Weekend.
The Sigma Delta chapter lost its charter in 1967 but was re-chartered in 1976. From 1976 to 1981, the chapter was active on campus, but again lost its charter in 1990. The sorority was formerly governed by the Panhellenic Association at Duke University.
Born in Warsaw, Poland on July 27, 1903, Wladyslaw W. Kulski was a diplomat and educator who earned a Master of Law degree in 1925 from Warsaw Law School and a Doctor of Law in 1927 from Paris School of Law. In 1938, he married Antonina Reutt of Kislovodsk, Russia. They had no children. He was a member of the Polish diplomatic service from 1928-1945 and Minister Plenipotentiary, Polish Embassy, London from 1940-1945. Dr. Kulski served as Professor of Political Science at the University of Alabama from 1948-1951, at Syracuse University from 1951-1964, and at Duke University from 1964-1973. He authored several works, including Thus Spake Germany (1941) and The Soviet Regime (1954) and was editor of the Polish "White Book." Dr. Kulski died in Durham, NC on May 16, 1989.
Dr. Kulski began his diplomatic career as a member of the staff of the League of Nations service at the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1928-1933). In that position, he functioned as a legal and political officer, was a member of the Polish delegation to the Conference of the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments in Geneva (1932-1933), and was councilor and later Secretary of the Permanent Delegation of Poland to the League. From 1936-1940, he was head of the legal service at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1939, he was sent to London to negotiate the British-Polish Treaty of Mutual Assistance, which soon became the diplomatic basis for Britain's declaration of war on Nazi Germany. In 1940, he became Minister Plenipotentiary at the Polish Embassy in London and held that post until 1945 when he left the Polish service. He came to the U.S. in 1946 and became a naturalized citizen in 1953.
In 1964, he came to Duke University where he was named James B. Duke Professor of Political Science. He retired in 1973. During his academic career, Dr. Kulski continued to lecture to audiences in academia and government. He specialized in comparative government, in particular the Soviet government, international relations, and international law. He was awarded several foreign decorations and held both Fulbright and Guggenheim research awards.
William Thomas Laprade was born in Franklin County, Va. in 1883. As a young adult, he practiced speaking in his community's debating society and as a teacher in the Sunday School. Laprade received a bachelor's degree from Washington Christian College in Washington, D.C. (1906) and taught Latin and mathematics from 1906 to 1907. He was concurrently a teacher, graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, and minister of the Antioch Christian Church near Vienna, Va. Laprade received a doctorate in History from Johns Hopkins University in spring of 1909.
Later in 1909, Laprade joined the faculty of Trinity College (now Duke University), becoming Trinity's first teacher of British and European history. Laprade specialized in the history of 18th century Europe and occasionally preached sermons. Students testified that his most memorable and successful courses were intense seminars conducted in his home. Laprade was Chair of the History Department and Chair of the American Association of University Professors during the period after World War II during McCarthyism attacks on alleged communists in government. Laprade insisted on total freedom of inquiry for scholars.
Laprade was manager of the Trinity College bookstore (then known as the "Book Room") from 1912 to 1926. He spent time in England from 1926 to 1927, acquiring many important English books for the bookstore. The books ultimately became part of the library's collection of British materials. Laprade was the first editor of the Trinity College Press (1922-1926), director of the Duke University Press (1944-1951), and editor of the South Atlantic Quarterly (1944-1957).
Off campus, Laprade was a "Minute Man" speaker during World War I, and lectured on history and politics to secretaries enrolled in YMCA army training schools. He was also a charter member of the Durham Kiwanis Club, and rumored to have attended every meeting from 1920 to 1975. Laprade served the State of North Carolina as a member of the North Carolina Commission on Race Relations, President of the North Carolina State Literary and Historical Association, and executive board member of the North Carolina Department of Archives and History.
Laprade was a member of several professional and honorary societies, including Phi Beta Kappa and the Royal Historical Society of England. In April, 1975, Laprade was awarded an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Duke University on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the school. The North Carolina Historical Commission passed a resolution in 1975 honoring the life work of Laprade.
Laprade was an avid letter writer; his family letters reflect life in the southern United States during World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. Laprade died in June 1975 at 91 years of age.

The Society of the 9019 was the first honor society at Trinity College. In February of 1890, John Spencer Bassett founded the Society of the 9019 and became its first president. Bassett's desire to arouse the intellectual and literary interests of students and to stimulate interest in the history of the South inspired him to create the 9019. The 9019 recognized the outstanding students of the college, encouraged its members to promote scholarship on campus and in the community, and fostered a "true college spirit." The origin of the name is a representation of a) the 90 percent average required for admittance and b) the number of original members. As a precursor to Phi Beta Kappa, the 9019 provided a unique opportunity for recognition and involvement in campus activities. Notable contributions include the creation of the South Atlantic Quarterly and supporting scholarly activities among North Carolina high schools via annual declamation contests. The 9019 continued operation throughout the transformation to Duke University, but competing fraternities and World War II brought an end to the organization.
Omicron Delta Kappa was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1914 as a campus leadership honor society. It soon expanded to other colleges and the Rho Circle chapter was established at Duke University in 1926. Omicron Delta Kappa admitted juniors and seniors as well as faculty members and honorary members both alumni and non-alumni on the basis of character, scholarship, distinguished achievement, and consecration to a great purpose. The five categories of campus life that were emphasized were scholarship, athletics, social and religious activities, publications, and the arts. Election to membership was considered one of the top honors that could be conferred at Duke University. The focus of the Rho Circle chapter was service to the university and community through the cooperation of all campus leaders. The first president of the Rho Circle chapter was Marshall I. Pickens, later head of the Duke Endowment.
The Rho Circle chapter maintained a good relationship with other national officers through correspondence of well-connected faculty and administrators, such as Frank C. Brown. Omicron Delta Kappa became inactive in the late 1960s or early 1970s as a result of general student opposition to the "elitism" of special leadership distinctions. There were also disputes within the national organization about scholarship standards and the fraternity's refusal to admit women. Although correspondence continued between William J. Griffith, the longtime secretary of the Duke University chapter, and the national officers, the society has never been reactivated at Duke.
The Duke University Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life serves as a liaison between university administration, and student fraternity, sorority, and selective living groups. The office advises, serves and supports 38 nationally affiliated chapters and the general Greek community. Following restructuring under Vice President for Student Affairs Larry Moneta in 2002, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life was supervised by the Dean of Students. In 2012 the Office was moved to Campus Life under Associate Vice President Zoila Airall. The Fraternity and Sorority was then a free standing Office for four years before moving in 2016 under the University Center for Activities and Events (UCAE), an umbrella center for student clubs and organizations located in Campus Life.
The Operations and Maintenance Department, responsible for care of buildings and grounds, truly began in 1948, but several departments and groups carried out its functions prior to that date. The administration's Business Division had some responsibility for operations; the University Comptroller, Frank C. Brown, was in charge of some aspects of construction in the 1920s; and the Duke Construction Company, formed by the Duke Endowment, also held responsibility for construction. Please see the series scope and content notes for more information on the people and organizations responsible for operations and maintenance.
An ordained Methodist minister, Robert Tappan Osborn was born in 1926 in Seattle, Washington. He received his A.B. from U.C.L.A. in 1946 and his B.D. from Garrett Biblical Institute in 1950, and spent a year at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. In 1954 he was awarded the Ph.D. from Drew University and joined the faculty of the Duke University Department of Religion that same year, where he taught until his retirement in 1997. He served a term as chair of that department. His research focused on the field of contemporary theology and Christian thought and his publications include the books Freedom in Modern Theology (1967) and The Barmen Declaration as a Paradigm for a Theology of the American Church (1991).
Osborn became active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s, advocating for Christian involvement in issues of racial justice. In January 1964, he and four other Duke faculty members (Professor William Wynn of the Psychology Department, Professor Fred Herzog and Professor Harmon Smith, both of Duke Divinity School, and Professor Peter Klopfer of the Zoology Department) joined a group including students and faculty from UNC and NCCU (white and African American) for a restaurant sit-in at Watts Grill in Chapel Hill. The professors were arrested on counts of trespassing; and the ensuing, drawn-out trials in Hillsborough ultimately led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Klopfer vs. the State of North Carolina. In the final days of his term as governor, Terry Sanford (later to become president of Duke University) pardoned the professors.
The President's Advisory Committee on Resources was established by President H. Keith H. Brodie in the summer of 1989 following a recommendation of the Academic Council's Task Force on University Governance. Its predecessor was the University Committee on Resources (1988-1989). PACOR was a broad-based committee, chaired by a faculty member, which advised the President on the allocation of the University's financial, human and physical resources. Its twenty-one members consisted of five faculty, seven administrators, two students and seven ex officio non-voting members from the faculty, the administration and the student government. PACOR's chairs were Wes Magat of the Fuqua School of Business, Allen C. Kelley of the Economics Department, and Jim Cox of the Law School. John Wessels served as the staff director until 1995 when his position was eliminated. PACOR continued into President Keohane's administration but with different responsibilities and duties.
Harold T. Parker taught history at Duke University; he specialized in modern European history, European intellectual history and 19th century Europe. Parker was born near Cincinnati, Ohio on December 26, 1907. He received his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from University of Chicago in 1928 and 1934 respectively. He began teaching at Duke University in 1939 and retired in 1977, although he continued to teach after his retirement as a professor emeritus. His career at Duke was interrupted during World War II, when he served in the Pacific Theater. Parker was known for his teaching excellence according to one of his obituaries, and was awarded the Annual Distinguished Teaching Award by the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the United Methodist church in 1973. In addition to being a professor, Parker published several books including The Cult of Antiquity and the French Revolutionaries (1937) and Three Napoleonic Battles (1944). He was also a longstanding member of St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Durham, NC and published a history of the church in 1996. Harold T. Parker passed away in 2002.
The Duke Parliamentarians were founded in 1990 by four undergraduate students interested in the study and practice of parliamentary law. The founding members were Stanford M. Brown (President), Nikola R. Djuric (Secretary-Treasurer), Howard M. Mora, and Michael W. Ruiz; membership was eventually extended beyond graduation from Duke University. The group dedicated itself to the use of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised and included a lesson on parliamentary procedure at each official meeting. The Duke Parliamentarians were recognized as an offical student group by the Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU) and were primarily active from 1990-1994, publishing a Parliamentary Primer, a Handbook for Members, and other materials. In 1991 the group conferred honorary membership on Dr. Floyd Riddick, Parliamentarian-Emeritus of the United States Senate and a Duke University alum (class of 1932).

Specializing in American and modern art, Patrick also designed the ceremonial flag of Duke University. He died in April of 1971.
Addison "Add" Penfield was born in Meriden, Connecticut in 1918. He came to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in 1936. During his four years as an undergraduate he became deeply involved with sports radio broadcasting on-campus, as the play-by-play announcer for Duke Football. He also worked off-campus with numerous other radio stations throughout North Carolina. He graduated in 1940 and began his storied career as a sports broadcaster working in Georgia, South Carolina, New York, and of course North Carolina. He also worked with the U.S. Army for a number of years. During Penfield's years as a sports broadcaster, writer, and Director of Sports Information at Duke he covered football, basketball, baseball, and golf. He knew such legendary Duke figures as Wallace Wade, Eddie Cameron, and Ted Mann. In the 1980's he completed a 553 page memoir about his career in sports broadcasting.
Phi Alpha Delta began as a "law student league" formed to fight an 1897 ruling made by the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affected law students' admission to the bar association. Following the resolution of this controversy, the league wanted to create a formal association and founded the Lambda Epsilon Fraternity in 1898. In 1902, the fraternity was reorganized and renamed Phi Alpha Delta in order to extend the benefits of the organization to a wider range of the legal profession. More information about the fraternity is available on their website here: http://www.padcommunity.org/about-phi-alpha-delta
The University Archives Photograph Collection was compiled by University Archives staff from a variety of sources for use in research and teaching.
The Physical Planning Department was responsible for arranging the construction and renovation of buildings, parking lots, and other spaces on the Duke University campus. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was headed by James A. Ward, Director of Physical Planning and University Architect, who was based in the Allen Building. The contracts in this collection bear the signatures of many Duke officials, including John M. Dozier, Business Manager; and G.C. Henricksen, Assistant Treasurer. Some of the contractors used by Duke include George W. Kane, William Muirhead, and Rea Construction Company.
In 1892, Trinity College relocated to Durham from Randolph County, North Carolina. In 1924, the Duke Endowment was established to help develop the school into a university. That same year, Trinity College was renamed Duke University and major construction on the university began. This construction project consisted of expanding what is currently East Campus and building West Campus. In 1932, West Campus opened, and the Duke University Chapel was completed marking the end of the construction project. Since then, the campuses of Duke University have undergone expansions and renovations that have led to many changes to the campus over time. Joseph Gaither Pratt was born in Winston-Salem, NC on August 31, 1910 to Joseph M. and Mattis H. Pratt. He completed his academic training at Duke University: A. B. in 1931, M. A. in 1933 and Ph.D. in 1936. He married his wife Nellie in 1936, and they had four children. Pratt joined the psychology department at Duke in 1937 as an instructor and a member of the staff of parapsychology where he served for nearly 30 years. He left Duke in 1963 to join the University of Virginia School of Medicine. He died in November 1979.
James Terry Sanford was born August 20, 1917 in Laurinburg, N.C., the son of Cecil L. and Elizabeth Martin Sanford. He received the A.B. degree (1939) and the JD degree (1946) from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After serving in the military and FBI and while practicing law in Fayetteville, N.C., Sanford embarked on a political career. He served as North Carolina State Senator from 1953 to 1954 and as United States Senator from 1986 to 1992. In 1961 he was elected Governor of North Carolina and held the office through 1965.
In December 1969 Sanford was elected President of Duke University. He assumed the office in April 1970 and held the position through June 1985. His involvement at Duke continued as President Emeritus, from 1985 to 1998, and as Professor of Public Policy, from 1992 to 1998. Terry Sanford died on April 18, 1998 and is buried in the Crypt in the Chapel at Duke University.
Sanford married Margaret Rose Knight in 1942; they had two children, Elizabeth Knight and Terry, Jr.

A largely self-taught educator, Methodist minister, and author of a series of English grammars, Brantley York (1805-1891) was asked by Methodist and Quaker farmers in rural Randolph County, N.C. to help provide education for their sons and daughters. At the site of the former Brown's Schoolhouse, he organized Union Institute Academy in 1838 and met with instant success, building two new buildings within a year-and-a-half. Though gratified at his accomplishment, he worked extremely hard raising money, and he began to go blind working late at night preparing recitations in subjects he had not adequately studied. In fact, he recorded in his diary a statement saying he considered his years at Union Institute to be "truly onerous." York, however, had found his life's work at Union Institute and though completely blind by age forty-eight, he lived to be eighty-six and founded half-a-dozen schools, lectured over 8,000 times, and taught more than 15,000 pupils. He served as Principal of Union Institute from 1838 to 1842.
Duke University (Durham, N.C.) was established in 1924 and evolved from the following institutions: Brown's Schoolhouse (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1838-1839; Union Institute (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1839-1851; Normal College (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1851-1859; Trinity College (Randolph Co., N.C.) 1859-1892 and (Durham, N.C.) 1892-1924.

Since 1924, the Undergraduate Publications Board, commonly referred to as the Pub Board or UPB, has overseen the production of each of the university's recognized publications (with the exception of The Chronicle and Towerview). The Board also approves and supports emerging publications, known as Independents, runs the Blackburn Literary Festival, and administers the John Spencer Bassett Fund. Its continuing mission is to provide diverse forums in which students can engage their creative, intellectual, political and literary faculties.
Currently (2007), the UPB oversees the production of eleven publications: The Archive; Blind Spot; Carpe Noctem; The Chanticleer; Duke Blue; Erudito; Latent Image; Matter Magazine; Vertices; Passport Magazine; and Woman's Handbook. A sampling of other titles produced during the UPB's history include: Tobacco Road; Prometheus Black; Missing Link, Jabberwocky; and Teacher-Course Evaluation Book.
The Rainbow Triangle Oral History Project was originally conceived in 1996, by then-Director of Duke's Center for Lesbian, Gay & Bisexual Life (later the Center for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Life, now the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity) John Howard, who suggested the project to Ian Lekus, then a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of History and a member of the Duke University Task Force for Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Matters.
The project was envisioned as a way to document the lives of LGBT people in the Triangle region in particular and central North Carolina in general, with the additional goals of exploring the idea of community identities and formation, breaking down barriers between the University and the local community, and documenting the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Triangle.
Lekus became the Project Coordinator in 1996 and worked with a varying group of volunteers to acquire resources, conduct interviews, and ensure the preservation and access of the oral histories collected. From 1996 to late 1997, Lekus worked with others at Duke and elsewhere to develop forms and processes, conduct training workshops for interviewers, and establish how interviews would be used and preserved. Anne Valk, a visiting professor at Duke, and Patrick Toal and Parker Doig, graduate students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, were other active project leaders at this time. In February 1998, the project was officially launched during a talk by author and activist Mab Segrest on the Duke campus, but the first group of interviews were conducted in late 1998 and early 1999.
Dr. Karen Krahulik became the Director of the Center for LGBT Life in 1999 and continued support for the project. In Fall 2000, Dr. Krahulik and Ian Lekus co-taught a class called American Communities: Gender, Sexuality, and Oral History, presented by the Women's Studies Program and the History Department, and sponsored by the Center for Documentary Studies. As part of this class, students conducted oral history interviews that focused on gender and sexuality in the lives of the narrators, and several of these interviews were conducted as part of the Rainbow Triangle project. Ian Lekus taught this class again in 2004, and additional interviews from this class became part of the project.
Narrators are generally residents of the Triangle region, many of them with a connection to Duke or Durham in particular. Narrators include both LGBT people and heterosexual people who have been involved in LGBT issues in some way. Interviewers include Duke staff or volunteers for the Center for LGBT Life, Duke students, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students, and others.

The Religious Council was formed in 1956 to coordinate interdenominational religious activities affiliated with Duke University. In April of 1955, members of the Special Church Board Committee, a sub-committee of the Duke University Church, proposed to create a unified council with a widened sphere of operations. The new council would coordinate and serve as an advisory board to the various campus committees and organizations involved in religious activities. In 1956, to facilitate these goals, the Board of Duke University Church (established in 1938) and the Student Religious Council (formed in 1937) were merged to create the Religious Council. The Religious Council was a committee-based organization with community, faculty, and student representation. However, the Council emphasized student membership on the various committees. The Council also emphasized its interdenominational character, encouraging the participation of all faiths in religious activities.
After the opening of Duke's West Campus in 1930, the arrangement and administration of residential life at the University remained fairly static through the 1950s. Some fraternities had the same blocks of rooms for decades. Then, beginning with the work of the University Committee on Long-Range Planning (1958-1962), residential arrangements and administration came under close review. That process has continued. Groups involved in it have included the Undergraduate Faculty Council, its successor, the Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), and its successor, the Arts and Sciences Council, the West Campus Community Council (WCCC), the Community Council of the Woman's College (CoCoWoCo), the Residential Life Committee, the Residential Policy Committee, and successor groups.
A group of Law School students formed the bipartisan Nixon Portrait Committee to raise funds for a portrait of President Richard Nixon, a 1937 graduate of the School. The Committee was chaired by Charles S. Mill, Jr., a student in the Duke Law School. The portrait was painted by Joseph Wallace King and was presented to the Law School at the 1969 Commencement ceremony. Since that time it has been stored in the Law School and the Art Museum. In March of 1998, there were plans to loan the portrait in turn to the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Nixon Library, and the National Portrait Gallery.
The University Committee on ROTC was formed in 1970 at the request of Duke President Terry Sanford. The Committee was established to review the status of the ROTC program at Duke, and to determine whether the program should be abolished, modified, or maintained. Some students and others had complained that ROTC did not fit into the curriculum at Duke, that its coursework did not allow students to think critically, and that Duke symbolically supported the war in Vietnam through its sponsorship of ROTC.
The members of the committee were Aubrey W. Naylor, Thomas G. Wilson, David Pace, Chip Rawlings, and A. Kenneth Pye. In May of 1971, the committee recommended that the ROTC program be continued, although modified, and offered a number of recommendations. ROTC is currently still in operation at Duke University.
Formed in 1986, the South Africa Policy Implementation Committee pursued the policies formulated by the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock and agreed to by the Board of Trustees. In 1985, University President Terry Sanford created the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock. The Committee was chaired by Law School professor Walter Dellinger, III, and composed of four students, graduate and undergraduate, six faculty members, two administrators, and two Trustees.
On May 3, 1986 the Board of Trustees, at the recommendation of the Committee on Social Implications of Duke Stock, voted to sell all holdings of companies doing business in South Africa if that nation's system of apartheid was not ended by January 1, 1987.
The Board's vote in support of divestment followed more than a year of campus activism focusing on apartheid and University investments in South Africa.
The Seashore Summer School developed out of an experimental summer school for teacher training that was started in 1919 by Holland Holton of Trinity College's Department of Education. The school, located at Oriental, North Carolina, initially operated as a branch of the college's summer school; another branch of the college's summer session was located at Lake Junaluska, NC. Both braches became distinct corporations, the one in Oriental receiving its charter on February 5, 1924. William Preston Few, President of Trinity College was ex-officio the chairman of its board, and Taylor B. Attmore, Superintendent of Schools of Pamlico County, NC, its secretary, and later its director. As specified in the charter, it remained "affiliated with" Trinity and, later, Duke, and its offerings were included in the course catalogs of the college and university. The school offered courses in education, history, music, and social and physical sciences. Courses had to be approved by North Carolina's Superintendent of Public Instruction. Due probably to financial difficulties questions about its future began to come up late in 1927, and it appears to have ceased operations in 1928.
The Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies was a cooperative scholarly institute established in 1963 under the auspices of the Duke University-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Cooperative Program in the Humanities. During the summers, the institute's members presented five-week seminars in a classroom setting. The location of the institutes alternated between the campuses of Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. They were coordinated by a joint committee of faculty members from each university. These institutes drew scholars from colleges and universities throughout the United States and provided a forum for intense study and teaching. Beginning in 1968, the joint committee initiated a fund-raising effort for continuation of the institutes.
In 1972, the National Endowment for the Humanities approved an additional funding request to support the institutes for the summers of 1974-1976 based on the stipulation that by 1977 the institutes would be funded entirely by the two sponsoring campuses.
While summer institutes were held through the summer of 1979, the joint committee was not able to secure a commitment of permanent funding from either Duke or UNC-Chapel Hill. Plans for the 1980 Institute were canceled due to the lack of funding and the committee began a new search for continuing support. The Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies has not been active since 1980.
Many scholars and coordinators of the Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies were also affiliated with the Southeastern Renaissance Conference, an annual conference established cooperatively by Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1943. Renaissance studies continue at Duke University at the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, an interdisciplinary, degree-granting program.
SHARE (Student Housing for Academic and Residential Experimentation) was founded in 1970 as an academically elite experimental living group of 54 men and women. The integrated residence, then known as the Experimental College, was part of Duke's "New Curriculum". The "New Curriculum" recommendations of 1969 had suggested various changes in living arrangements for students on campus, including the elimination of freshmen dormitories and the establishment of a co-educational dormitory.
SHARE generally included students who were creative and possessed special talents or interests. SHARE applicants also had to demonstrate a clear sense of academic direction, and show interest in helping develop programs of the Experimental College within the first year. Students enrolled in Program II, an interdisciplinary study program, were given preference to live in the SHARE house.
The first director, overseeing the academic progress of residents, was English professor John Clum. Clum worked closely with the administration of Duke University to blend SHARE's social and academic components into a sustainable living environment. SHARE was first located in the Faculty Apartments (now Wilson House) on Duke University's East Campus. The apartment-type layout of the building allowed for men and women to live closely together while preserving privacy. SHARE participants lived in Wilson House until 1982, then in Alspaugh House from 1983 to 1984. In 1984, SHARE moved again to Epworth Inn, where it would remain until 1997. In 1997, SHARE was moved to Wilson House.
SHARE programming consisted of a variety of seminars, credit courses, meetings, film festivals, and lectures. Events included a "Use Your Appendages" Party, Anime Fest, Epworth Prom (Oil My Lizard), The Epworth Retreat, and "Twilight", a rave. Two of the most notable activities were SHARE hours and Pedagogo. SHARE hours gave members of the dorm an opportunity to tell others about their interest and experiences. Pedagogo was a series of events where members of the Duke University faculty were invited to Epworth to speak informally about issues in research and academics.
In 1995, SHARE became the first living group on campus to include members from all four undergraduate years. SHARE persisted as an alternative to conventional Duke residential life. When cited for low membership in 1997, SHARE was relocated from Epworth House to the third floor in Wilson House. As of 2003, SHARE is active at Duke University.
John D. "Bub" Shaw, a native of Meriden, Connecticut, was a 1932 graduate of Duke University. He played three seasons of varsity basketball and was named captain his senior year. In addition, he won honorable mention on the All-Southern College team during his last two seasons and was rated by some experts as one of the five best guards in the South. After graduating Shaw returned to Meriden where he taught U.S. history, coached the school's baseball team, and became assistant basketball coach. Shaw passed away in Meriden on January 9, 2006.
Melvin G. Shimm was born January 30, 1926 to Joseph and Sadie Shimm in New York City. He served in the Army during World War 2, then graduated from Columbia University in 1947. He then graduated from Yale Law School in 1950 before practicing law in New York City and Washington, D.C. He became a professor of law at the University of Chicago in 1952 before coming to Duke University in 1953. He was a member of the faculty of the Duke Law School until his retirement in 1996, and he served as the Associate Dean of the Law School from 1978-1983. He served as the editor of Law and Contemporary Problems, as faculty editor of the Duke Law Journal, and edited the Journal of Legal Education, as well as non-Duke publications such as the Journal of Business Law and Business Law Review. He was also the Director of the Duke Summer Institute in Transnational Law from 1986-1992. He won the Mordecai Society Award in 1960, the Duke Law School A. Kenneth Pye award in 1999, and the Duke University Award for Merit in 1996. In 2000, an endowed professorship in the Duke Law School was named for him.
Mel Shimm married Cynia Brown (Dr. Cynia B. Shimm), a psychologist who also taught Psychology for Lawyers with Mel Shimm at Duke Law School. The couple had two sons, David and Jonathan. Mel Shimm died on September 17, 2005.
Sidney D. Markman was born October 10, 1911 in New York, the son of Samuel Markman and Eva Bodie. He earned his A. B. in 1934 from Union College in Schenectady, NY and his M. A. and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1936 and 1941 respectively. From 1941-1945, he worked as Professor of Art History and Archaeology at the National University of Panama. From 1945-1947, Dr. Markman undertook independent research in Guatemala, studying the fields of Pre-Columbian art and archaeology and Hispano-American art. In 1947, Dr. Markman began teaching at Duke University as Associate Professor of Art History and Archaeology and was appointed to full professor in 1965. He retired in 1981 and is Professor Emeritus of Art History and Archaeology in 1981.
Founded in 1886, Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, is a non-profit membership society of nearly 75,000 scientists and engineers. Sigma Xi is headquartered in Research Triangle Park, N.C. and has more than 500 chapters at universities and colleges, government laboratories and industry research centers. In addition to publishing American Scientist, Sigma Xi awards grants annually to promising young researchers, holds forums on critical issues of science and society, and sponsors a variety of programs supporting honor in science and engineering, science education, science policy, and the public understanding of science.
The idea for a Duke University chapter of Sigma Xi was conceived during spring 1929, when a number of people interested in scientific research across departments began to meet on campus. They contacted Sigma Xi's national secretary regarding proper organization of a chapter and then held a general interest meeting was held in New Science Hall on Duke's East Campus in 1929. With fourteen members, the Sigma Xi Club of Duke University organized as a club and elected officers. As the petition for full membership to the national society continued, the members of the club were called on to present the history of the University and summaries of their own research. Their completed formal petition was accepted in June, 1932 and the charter granted in December 1932. Installation took place March 23, 1933. Some early members who petitioned for the charter were: Ruth Margery Addams, Lucius Aurelius Bigelow, Bert Cunningham, Wilburt Cornell Davison, Joseph Banks Rhine, and Frederick Adolphus Wolf.
The Duke University chapter of Sigma Xi holds meetings about six times per year. Initiations are held annually and feature a keynote address from a professional in the sciences. Election to Sigma Xi is arranged through a campus department representative, with members coming from all departments in social, physical, and medical sciences. New members are elected to Sigma Xi as associates or full members, depending on their research contributions. New members must have demonstrated abilities in conducting research and a potential for leadership in their field.
The Duke University chapter offers grants to students and professionals in the community. Smaller grants have been awarded to science teachers in North Carolina, while Duke University students have received awards for travel, field work, and conferences.
Edward Christian Simmons was born in Pittsburgh, PA in 1909. He received his Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1936, and subsequently taught at Ohio State, Wayne State and the University of Michigan. Simmons joined the U.S. Navy Reserves in 1943 and served as an aerial navigator in the Caribbean until 1946. He joined the Duke faculty in 1947, where he taught Economics specializing in monetary-fiscal policy. He died in 2001.
Robert Sidney Smith (1904-1969) was a white American academic economist who was born in Waterbury, Connecticut. He received a AB and AM degrees from Amherst College and a PhD from Duke University in 1932. He served as a professor of economics from 1932 until his death in 1969, and he was named the James B. Duke Professor of Economics in 1964. His research focused on Latin American economic history and the history of Hispanic economic thought.
The Dept. of Sociology at Duke was established in 1930 by Charles Abram Ellwood (1873-1946) and remains an active department to this day offering degrees to both undergraduates and graduate students. This department seeks to educate students on the scientific study of society, including patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture. At Duke the department was known as the Dept. of Sociology and Anthropology until 1972 when the two fields split into separate departments.
In early August 1981, Duke University President Terry Sanford told Duke faculty that he had opened negotiations to house the Presidential Library of Richard Nixon ‚Äì a Duke Law School alumnus ‚Äì on the Duke campus. In response, Duke's Academic Council, which represented faculty interests, formed two major committees to discuss how the decision was made and to propose the direction of future negotiations regarding the Nixon Library: the Subcommittee on Governance and the Subcommittee on Library Relations.
Philip Stewart, then a professor in the Department of Romance Studies, served on the Academic Council's Subcommittee on Library Relations, charged on September 17, 1981, to answer the question: "Can a Nixon Presidential Library be developed at Duke that does not compromise the integrity of Duke University?" The subcommittee examined several areas of Duke's intersection with the proposed library, including use of land, the library's potential scholarly value, and whether the library would have a museum component. The Library Subcommittee submitted its report to the Academic Council on October 21, 1981, with recommendations on conditions to be met in order for negotiations to proceed.
Philip Stewart was born May 21, 1940. He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1967, and came to teach at Duke in 1972. Stewart's books include Imitation and Illusion in the French Memoir-Novel, 1700-1750 (1969), Engraven Desire: Eros, Image, and Text in the French Eighteenth Century (1992), and Editer Rousseau: Enjeux d'un Corpus, 1750-2012 (2012). He has also produced and edited a number of translations and critical editions in the field of French literature. Stewart is a former president of the American Association of Teachers of French and was selected for membership in the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques, a French society that honors educators in French language and culture. As of August 2016, he is Benjamin E. Powell Professor Emeritus of Romance Studies at Duke University.
The mission of the Division of Student Affairs is to promote and enrich students' education through teaching, mentoring, advising, and counseling by way of on-going direct contact with students in their every day lives. The division was created in the summer of 1979 and was placed in under the supervision of William J. Griffiths, Vice President for Student Affairs. Griffith retired in 1991 and was succeeded by Janet S. Dickerson. Jim Clack became interim Vice President for Student Affairs when Janet Dickerson left in July of 2000 for Princeton University. The current (2011) Vice President of Student Affairs, Larry Moneta, accepted the position in 2001.
Student Affairs is comprised of a multitude of departments, all of which work in tandem to support and enrich students' educational experiences during their time at Duke University. These departments include: Campus Life; Career Center; Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS); Dean of Students Office; Residence Life and Housing Services; Student Health Center; and Resource Administration.
Students for Choice is a student organization dedicated to educating the Duke community about the status of reproductive rights nationally and locally and about available related resources, and to working to protect and uphold the freedom of choice.
The origin of the Trinity College (Durham, N.C.) Athletic Association is unclear. It is likely that it was established soon after Trinity joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association during the 1902-1903 academic year, as did other similar institutions. What is known is that in 1907, the Board of Trustees approved the formation of the Athletic Council, which served as the governing body of athletics on-campus. Between the two, athletic events/games were organized. The Athletic Association is probably the predecessor to the current Dept. of Athletics.
Richard Lovejoy Tuthill was Professor of Economic Geography from 1953-1980, when he retired as Professor Emeritus. Additionally, he was appointed the first University Registrar in 1953 by President A. Hollis Edens, a post he served until 1969. He was a Fellow of the American Geographical Society of New York and one of the founding members of North Carolina Geographical Society.
The Duke University Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), established in 1971, guided undergraduate education in arts and sciences, adopted academic regulations and admissions policies, advised on financial aid and recognized academic achievement. It succeeded the Undergraduate Faculty Council after the body no longer included representatives from the engineering and nursing schools. Council membership consisted of the president, provost, dean of the undergraduate college, and elected members of the faculties of the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. The dean presided at meetings, while a member of the faculty was elected chair of the Executive Committee.
Most of Council's work was done through its standing and ad hoc committees, which included: Curriculum, Courses of Instruction, Honors, Study Abroad, Program II, Academic Standards, Advising, Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid, Residential Life, Freshman Year, Advanced Placement, Athletics and Recreation, Health Science Education, and Non-western Studies. In 1991, UFCAS voted to disband and reorganize as the Arts and Sciences Council.
Undergraduate Faculty Council began in 1952, as a result of a re-organization of the Duke University Faculty. The Undergraduate Faculty Council (UFC) was responsible for the governance of undergraduate education, a task that the Faculty Council previously had undertaken. The UFC included representatives from the Engineering and Nursing schools. The Dean of Trinity College served as chair. The UFC first met on November 13, 1952. The Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences succeeded the UFC in October 1971, when undergraduate education in engineering and nursing formed separate governing bodies.
Standing Committees of the Undergraduate Faculty Council included Undergraduate Instruction (which absorbed the Curriculum Committee and the Committee on Courses of Instruction between 1964-1965), Honors, Program II, the Faculty Advisory System, Residential Life, Study Abroad, Undergraduate Admissions, and Financial Aid. Ad hoc committees included Academic Standards, Committee on Committees, and the Committee on the Organization and Functions of the UFC. The creation of a report called "Varieties of Learning Experience," or the Krueger Report (1968), represents one of the major accomplishments of the Undergraduate Faculty Council. The Krueger Report led to major changes in the undergraduate course of study known as the "new curriculum."
The late 1960s was a time of rapid change at American colleges and universities, as most experienced a surge of politicization by student activists; at Duke, this was most clearly exemplified in the Allen Building takeover of February 13, 1969. In response both to this local event and to national trends in higher education, the Faculty Committee on Student Concerns, the Executive Committee of the Academic Council, and the Student-Faculty-Administrative Council (SFAC) recommended the creation of a Commission on University Governance. In April 1969 Chancellor pro tem Barnes Woodhall appointed this committee, with the hopes that future demonstrations similar to the Allen Building takeover might be avoided if effective official opportunities for student participation in university governance could be established. The Commission on University Governance was therefore charged with the task of studying changes in university organization nationwide, focusing particularly on student participation in governance, and making recommendations for Duke accordingly.
Members of the Commission eventually agreed that this purpose was best accomplished by dividing university governance into three categories: departmental governance, the central university administration, and the Board of Trustees. The latter body was already the subject of a study by a Board of Trustees Special Committee headed by Brantley Watson, and the Commission coordinated its efforts with the Watson Committee. The Commission on University Governance also worked simultaneously and cooperatively with the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, "The Committee of Twelve," which replaced the SFAC as the forum for airing Duke community grievances and which was meant to advise the administration concerning potentially volatile campus issues. The Commission on University Governance met 34 times between October 27, 1969 and May 17, 1970, at which time it adjourned for the school year and was never reactivated.
Aleksandar Sedmak Vesiƒá was a Yugoslav-American geotechnical engineer and a major figure in the history of the Duke University Pratt Engineering School. Vesiƒá specialized in soil mechanics, the application of engineering principles to construction materials, behavior of soils on the ocean floor, and the use of explosives in excavation projects.
Vesiƒá studied at the University of Belgrade and received his doctorate in civil engineering. He worked at the Geotechnical Institute in Ghent, Belgium before moving to the United States in 1956. He began teaching in 1958 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 1963, he became a professor at Duke University, where he remained until his death in 1982. He was named Dean of the Pratt School of Engineering in 1974 and served as such until his death. In his honor, and in recognition for his contributions to the Engineering School, the position of department head of civil engineering bears his name, and the math, science, and technical library was renamed the Vesiƒá Library in 1982, shortly after his death. This library carried his name until it closed in 2008.
Clement Vollmer was born in 1889 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He received his A.B. degree at Heidelberg University in Ohio in 1909 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in 1913 and 1915, respectively. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania for 10 years and at Cornell University for one year before joining the German Languages and Literature Department at Duke University in 1926, where he remained until his retirement in 1956. In 1918, he published The American Novel in Germany. Professor Vollmer served as chair of the department during the 1950s, as president of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association, and was a member of numerous academic societies. He also served as government interpreter in World War I and also as army and FBI consultant in World War II. Professor Vollmer died in 1972.
The Vice President for Business and Finance was the chief fiscal officer of the university, and reported to the President. The position was established in 1962, and was superseded in 1985 by the position of Executive (or Senior) Vice President. The officer was responsible for fiscal planning, preparation of the budget, and supervision of the University's non-academic programs. Ordinarily, the Vice President for Business and Finance was responsible for signing formal requests for grants and contracts submitted to government agencies and foundations, and had custody of contracts, deeds agreements, and other documents relating to the University's non-academic operations.
The Vice President for Business and Finance was responsible for Duke's entire Business and Finance Division; at various times in division history the positions of Business Manager, Treasurer, Controller, University Architect, and Vice President for Administration and Health Affairs reported to the Vice President for Business and Finance. The Vice President for Business and Finance was also responsible for such departments as Physical Plant, Personnel, Business Auxiliaries (including Dining Halls, Stores, and Housing divisions), Material Support, Internal Audit, Data Processing, Public Safety, and Accounting, among others.
Occupants of the position were Gerhard C. Henricksen, 1962-1966, and Charles B. Huestis, 1966-1985.
Gerhard Henricksen (1907-1994) came to Duke in 1936 as an internal auditor. He was promoted to Assistant Comptroller and Assistant Business Manager in 1948, Comptroller and Assistant Treasurer in 1956, Comptroller and Business Manager in 1958, and Assistant to the President for Business and Finance in 1961. In 1962, Henricksen was appointed to fill the newly created position of Vice President for Business and Finance, a position he held until his promotion to Vice President and Treasurer of the university in 1966.
Henricksen was succeeded as Vice President of Business and Finance by Charles B. Huestis (1920-), who came to Duke from Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966. Huestis served as the Vice President for Business and Finance for the next 19 years, retiring in 1985. In addition to his professional duties at Duke, Huestis also served as a director of the Durham Investment Company and Research Triangle Foundation, was an active Sierra Club member and mountain climbing enthusiast (including participating in the 1963 American Mt. Everest Expedition), served on numerous university committees, and was a member of "The Troika" which guided the university during the period between presidents in 1969. Huestis was succeeded as Senior Vice President by Eugene McDonald.
Eula Wake was a 1929 graduate of the Woman's College at Duke University.
Calvin Ward was born in 1928 in Yancey, TX. He earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Texas and began teaching in Duke's Zoology Department in 1952, where he specialized in genetics. In 1957, he received a grant from the U.S. Public Health Service to study genetic damage from radiation.
Warwick House was a non-selective living group for undergraduate men on Duke University's West Campus. The house contained a total of 30 rooms and was part of the Few Federation during the late 1970s. The Few Federation was a unifying group of several men's and women's independent houses and men's selective upperclass houses. As an independent living group, Warwick House was at times governed by the Association of Independent Houses, Office of Student Affairs, and the Office of Housing Management.
Richard Lyness Watson, Jr. was born December 25, 1914 in Mount Hermon, Mass. He attended Mount Hermon Preparatory School and graduated 1931. He studied economics and history at Yale University, receiving his B.A. in 1935, and his Ph.D. in 1939. Immediately after attaining his doctorate he moved to Durham and began teaching at Duke University. He was drafted into the Army in 1941 and commissioned in May 1943. He first served at the Coast Artillery School until appointed to the Army Air Force Historical Office. While at this post he served as chief of the Southwest Pacific Branch and was responsible for selecting documents on and writing histories pertaining to the Pacific theatre of operations during the War. His work was ultimately included in the seven volume series, The Army Air Forces in World War II, edited by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate.
During his forty-five year tenure at Duke, Watson served as one of the university's leading "citizens." He not only served in positions of leadership at the departmental level, but at the university level as well. Duke recognized his citizenship in 1988 when they awarded him the Duke University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service. While trained to specialize in early 19th century American history, Watson filled a needed role in the Department of History by shifting his research and teaching focus to early twentieth-century American history. His particular interests lay in the Progressive, Depression, and New Deal Eras. He chaired the department from 1960-1967 and stood in as Acting Chair in 1970-1971 and 1980. He took a lead in the burgeoning development of Black Studies, teaching several summer workshops for college professors on the materials of black history.
Watson led, at numerous points in his career, the faculty's most important representative bodies. He was vice chair of the University Council from 1961-1962; Chairman of the Academic Council from 1964-1966, as well as 1975-1977; and vice chair of the Academic Council from 1973-1974. He was the first person to hold the position of Faculty Secretary of the Academic Council, a position created in 1984. In addition, he was a member of the board of the Duke University Press from 1973-1982, and was associate editor of the South Atlantic Quarterly from 1974-1987. Watson also played a central role in the faculty movement to bar the Nixon presidential library from locating at Duke.
Watson answered the university administration's call to service. This is evidenced in the numerous committees, advisory councils, and task forces to which he was appointed. He played a significant role in helping define and implement university policies during student unrest of the late 1960s. As chair of the Committee on Judicial Procedures he helped put into place judicial procedures and policies to deal with the pickets and protests regulations. He also served on the Faculty Committee on Student Concerns which helped develop policies in response to the takeover of the Allen Building in 1969 and his work on the Student-Faculty-Administration Committee addressed drug policies, military recruitment on campus, and the pickets policy.
Watson served as President of the Southern Historical Association (1976-77) and of the Historical Society of North Carolina (1972-73); he was also chair of the Organization of American Historians' Frederick Jackson Turner Prize Committee from 1964-68. In addition, he sat on the board of editors of both the Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1958-60) and the Journal of Southern History (1968-70). He was a member of the Board of Trustees of St. Augustine's College from 1965-1971.
His activity in the Durham community was recognized by the Duke University Campus Ministry, who in 1992 awarded him its Humanitarian Service Award. Watson aided in the establishment of the St. Philip's Community Kitchen and the Durham Urban Ministry Center. He was also a familiar face in community theater, as a long-time member of Durham Savoyards, a group that presents annual performances of Gilbert and Sullivan.
In the midst of his teaching and academic service, Watson continued to conduct and publish scholarly research. He won the R.D.W. Connor Award for the best article to appear in the North Carolina Historical Review in both 1960 and 1965. He contributed greatly to the teaching of history in the secondary schools by his editorship, along with William Cartwright, of Interpreting and Teaching American History (196?) and its revised edition, Reinterpretation of American History and Culture. Other books he authored or edited include, Bishop Cannon's Own Story, the United States in the Contemporary World, 1945-62, and The Development of National Power: The United States 1900-1919.
Upon retirement in 1984, Watson continued his relationship with Duke. He was active in the university's FOCUS program, as well as hosting Japanese students from Hosei University each year.
Richard L. Watson, Jr. died on September 22, 2000.

The Duke University Woman's College opened in the fall of 1930 as part of the expansion of Trinity College into Duke University. In 1924 James B. Duke established the Duke Endowment and gave funds to transform a small liberal arts college into a major university. From 1925 to 1927 the existing Trinity Campus (now Duke's East Campus) was rebuilt and transformed to become a residential campus for undergraduate women. From 1928 to 1930 Duke's new gothic West Campus and residential campus for undergraduate male students was constructed and known as Trinity College for Men. In 1972, the Men's and Women's colleges were merged to form Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.
In the Fall of 2002, the Woman's College marked the 30th anniversary of its merger with the Trinity College for Men with a reunion. Carolyn Murray Happer, Class of 1960, curated an exhibition on the history of Woman's College and decided to start an oral history interview project with alumnae for use in a proposed history of Woman's College. Barnes Woodhall served as the Special Assistant to the President and then Chancellor pro tem from 1969-1970.

The committee published their findings in a report in 1951.
Born in Lenox, Massachusetts on June 29, 1886, James Van Der Zee moved to Harlem, New York City as a young man, and had already established his own photography studio on West 135th Street by 1916; sometime in the early 1930s he moved his flourishing studio to 272 Lenox Avenue. He became one of the leading figures of the Harlem Renaissance and was much sought after due to his talent for portraiture.
in 1969 his work was featured in a 1969 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, "Harlem on my Mind," after which, already in his eighties, he enjoyed a revitalized career and received many accolades. He received the Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1978, and was named a fellow of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Van Der Zee died in Washington, D.C. on May 15, 1983, shortly after receiving an honorary doctorate from Howard University. His widow, Donna Mussenden Van Der Zee, manages the James Van Der Zee estate. His work is held by major U.S. cultural institutions and has been exhibited around the world.

Ken Wainio was born in Ukiah, California, about two hours north of San Francisco, in 1952. He began to write at age fifteen--having been influenced by the writings of the French poets Lautreamont, Rimbaud, and Nerval. He moved to San Francisco at the beginning of the 1970s to study at San Francisco State University with the Greek surrealist poet Nanos Valaoritis, and met the American surrealist poets Philip Lamantia and Stephen Schwartz. A couple of years later, in an informal "poetry class" being conducted in the home of Harold Norse, he met Thomas Rain Crowe, Neeli Cherkovski and Luke Breit--along with whom he would later help to resurrect Beatitude magazine. Wainio was co-editor of issue No. 26 which appeared in 1977. During the 1970s, his poems were regularly published in Bay area literary magazines. With Jerry Estrin, Wainio was a founding editor of the surrealist publication Vanishing Cab. After driving a taxicab for the entire decade of the 1980s, he moved to Glenhaven, California. His travels took him to Greece and Egypt, where he spent considerable time in the 1980s and 1990s. His poems and fiction were published both in America and abroad in such journals as Nexus, Asheville Poetry Review, Litterature en Marche and Gregas in Montpellier, France. His books included Crossroads of the Other (written in the 1970s and published in 1994), Letters to Al-Kemi, Starfuck (a novel published on computer disk in 1996) and Automatic Antiquity (a collection of poetry published in 2004). Wainio died on January 26, 2006.

Born August 23, 1902, Herbert Lee Waters spent the majority of his life in Lexington, North Carolina operating a photography studio. Waters supplemented his income from 1936-1942 by traveling across North Carolina and parts of Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carolina to film the people of small communities. He collaborated with local movie theaters to screen his films, which he called Movies of Local People and billed with the phrase "See yourself in the movies!" It is estimated that Waters created films in 118 communities, visiting some of them multiple times. In 1942, Waters returned to Lexington and continued operating his photographic studio until his death in 1997.

Susan Wicklund was born in 1954 and spent her career as an abortion provider in the Midwest. In her early twenties, she herself received an abortion just three years after the procedure was legalized. Her experience was relatively traumatic due in part to the apathy of the providers. This inspired her to pursue a career in medicine so that she could one day be the kind of abortion provider she wished she had when she underwent the procedure. She opened her own clinic in 1993, after which she faced constant threats from anti-abortion groups, and was targeted as a murderer of children. Despite fearing for her life, she continued practicing until 2013, when she retired and closed her clinic, the Mountain Country Women's Clinic in Livingston, Montana. She recounts her experiences in her own words in her book This Common Secret: My Journey as an Abortion Doctor, which was published in 2007.
James King Wilkerson was born in North Carolina June 12, 1842, probably in Granville County, the son of Alexander Hamilton and Mary Ann D. Royster Wilkerson. He enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1861 and served through the end of the war. He married Elizabeth Frances Slaughter (1849-1929) Dec. 16, 1869 and had two children, Luther C. (1874-1942) and Lillie (1877-1955); Lillie became Lillie Cutts by marriage. James K. Wilkerson died in Granville County, N.C. June 1, 1919, and is buried in the Stovall Baptist Church cemetery, Granville County, N.C.
The primary correspondent in this collection is Charles Wilkes (1798-1877), naval officer and explorer, who was a collateral descendant of John Wilkes (1727-1797), the noted English politician. Charles Wilkes was born in New York City, the son of John De Ponthieu and Mary (Seton) Wilkes. From 1815 through 1817 Wilkes was in the merchant service on board several ships until he was appointed midshipman in the U. S. Navy on Jan. 1, 1818. His naval career was destined to be a rather distinguished, yet controversial one. During the next fifteen years he served on board several ships including the Franklin and the Waterwitch, was promoted to lieutenant in 1826, and surveyed the Narragansett Bay in 1832-1833. Wilkes's scientific achievements were rewarded by his appointment to take charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in Washington, D. C. in 1833. In 1837 and 1838 he was involved in further surveying work at the shoals of Georges Bank and the Savannah River.
In 1838 Secretary of War Poinsett ordered Wilkes to command the South Seas Surveying and Exploring Expedition. This expedition and the publications concerning it provided the primary focus for his career until 1861. This Exploring Expedition, which was absent from the United States from 1838 to 1842, had as its chief fields of exploration the islands of the Pacific Ocean, the coast of the Antarctic Continent, and the American Northwest coast. From 1843 to 1861, Wilkes was assigned to special duty, chiefly to be in charge of the Exploring Expedition collections and reports. In 1844 his Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition was published, and scientific volumes appeared from time to time. In 1842 Wilkes had been tried by a court-martial and sentenced to be publicly reprimanded for illegally punishing some of his men. Despite this he was promoted to commander in 1843 and to captain in 1855.
During the Civil War Charles Wilkes took the controversial step of overhauling the British mail steamer Trent and removed by force the Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, He saw other service in a variety of commands and received promotion to commodore and then to acting rear admiral in 1862. Again in 1864 Wilkes was court-martialed and found guilty. Two years later he was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list and was placed on special duty for a part of 1870-1873, After the Civil War he purchased the iron works at High Shoals, N. C. and pursued business interests there for several years.
Wilkes was married twice: first to Jane Jeffrey Renwick, sister of James Renwick (1792-1863) in 1826, and then to Msry H. (Lynch) Bolton in 1854, after the death of his first wife, He had six children from these marriages, For further biographical information please consult Autobiography of Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes. U. S. Navy, 1798-1877 (Washington, 1978); The Hidden Coasts by Daniel Henderson (New York, 1953); and other sources listed in the Information Folder in box 1 of the collection,
John (''Jack'') Wilkes (1827-1908), sailor and businessman, was the son of Charles Wilkes as well as a correspondent in this collection. Immediately after his appointment as a midshipman on September 9, 1841, young Wilkes was sent to sea. He served on the Delaware and on the Mississippi in the Gulf Squadron during the Mexican War. His appointment to the U. S. Naval Academy came in 1846. After graduation he was assigned to duty on the Albany and on the Marion. In about 1848 his father had him transferred for a time to work on the charts and calculations of the Exploring Expedition. On Nov. 3, 1854, he resigned his commission.
John Wilkes settled in Charlotte, N. C. in December, 1853, probably during a leave of absence from the U. S. Navy. He moved to North Carolina to supervise certain mining and milling property but in 1858 purchased the Mecklenburg Flour Mills The next year he became the proprietor of what would eventually be titled the Mecklenburg Iron Works. During the Civil War Wilkes took an active role in the Southern effort through his service in the local vigilance committee and the Home Guards, and as a financial advisor to North Carolina state officials. Wilkes also became a railroad contractor in government service.
In August, 1869 Wilkes obtained a charter for the First National Bank of Charlotte and served as its first president until 1869. This bank had the distinction of being the first national bank established south of Richmond. Wilkes formed a business partnership in the Rock Island Woolen Mills, but after its failure he devoted his energy to the successful Mecklenburg Iron Works.
Wilkes married Jane Renwick Smedberg of New York in April, 1854. Mrs Wilkes became a prominent Charlotte philanthropist. The couple had nine children, five of whom died at a young age. For further biographical information please see Biographical History of North Carolina by Samuel A. Ashe (Greensboro, 1906); Biographical Dictionary of the Confederacy by Jon L, Wakelyn (Westport, Conn., 1977); and Confederate Military History, vol. IV(Atlanta, 1899).
Helen Maria Williams was a British novelist, poet, and translator of French-language works. A religious dissenter, she was a supporter of abolitionism and of the ideals of the French Revolution; she was imprisoned in Paris during the Reign of Terror, but nonetheless spent much of the rest of her life in France.
Bailey Willis (1857-1949) was a geological engineer who worked for the U.S. Geological Survey. He was born in New York and studied at Columbia University, earning degrees in mechanical and civil engineering. In 1879, he began working with the Northern Pacific Railroad, under the direction of Raphael Pumpelly, and surveyed regions of Appalachia and the Northwestern U.S. He visited Mt. Rainier in 1882, and later contributed to its designation as a National Park.
Willis began working for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884, spending the next decade working and researching in the Appalachian Mountains and throughout the eastern U.S. His publications on the region's geology garnered international attention from scientists. In 1903, he led an expedition funded by the Carnegie Institution to northern China, an area previously unexplored by geologists. He also traveled and mapped geology throughout South America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Later in his career he lectured at Johns Hopkins and Stanford, retiring from teaching in 1922. He remained an active explorer and geologist, however, until his death in 1949.
Willis married Altona Grinnell in 1882; the couple had one child before she died in 1896. Willis remarried in 1898 to Margaret Baker. They had three children.
This historical note is drawn from Eliot Blackwelder's biographical memoir "Bailey Willis: 1857-1949," published by the National Academy of Sciences in 1961.

The Workers League for a Revolutionary Party, originally the Leninist League of the United States, was founded by George Spiro in 1938. Spiro, known as George Marlin (a portmanteau of Marx and Lenin), formed the party after an ideological conflict with the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL), formed by Hugo Oehler as a Trotskyist movement within the Workers Party of the United States. The conflict arose after RWL's rejection of Trotskyism. Spiro and his followers, known as Marlenites, felt that the Leninsit League did not go far enough in vocalizing its rejection of Trotskyism and Trotsky himself. The party published a newspaper, In Defense of Bolshevism. Interpreteing the Second World War as a war on the proletariat, the party became critical of both Leninism and Marxism, and in 1946, changed its name to the Workers League for a Revlutionary Party. Amidst internal dissent, the party dissolved around 1950.

The Women's Guild of Arts was founded in England in 1907 by textile designer and jeweller May Morris, and grew to about 60 members. The organization offered female artists an alternative to the Art Workers' Guild, the artists' association established in 1884 to encourage excellence in the fine and applied arts, and from which women were excluded until the 1960s. Mary Seton Watts was Hon. Chairman between 1907 until 1914, when she assumed the title of Hon. President. May Morris was the first Hon. Secretary, and Chairman from 1915 onwards. Etcher and engraver Mary A. Sloane was the Hon. Secretary from 1909 to 1924. The Guild also included the painters Marianne Stokes, Annie Swynnerton, Marie Stillman, Kate Bunce and Evelyn De Morgan; the bookbinder, Katharine Adams; and the house decorator, Agnes Garrett.

Chiefly song sheets documenting the Civil War and the American South. Some song sheets have been cataloged individually. Digitized song sheets are numbered
Addition contains 212 Civil War and Reconstruction era song sheets published by prominent song sheet publishers of the period such as J. Andrews, A. W. Auner, Bell and Company, James D. Gray, Johnson and Company, Charles Magnus, H. de Marsan, T. M. Scroggy, St. Clair Smith, John T. Thorne, H. J. Wehman, and J. Wrigley. Song sheets in this addition have not been digitized.
Rare early (first?) version of a popular American drinking song, in which Adam and Eve appear as the first tipplers, "and ever since then, all manner of men/ The lame, the blind, and the mute/ Our bankers and clerks, politicians and turks/ Drink the juice of the Forbidden Fruit." This chorus is followed by a litany of public figures who imbibe, including Edwin Booth, [Henry Ward] Beecher, President Arthur, Frank James, Bob Ford, Oscar Wild[e], General Grant, Roscoe Conkling, and [James G.] Blaine. The names varied over time, but the song remained in circulation for many decades and was recorded by folklorist Alan Lomax in the 1950s. Lomax identified it as originating in the Ozarks, but by the turn of the century the song was sufficiently widespread to make an appearance in Jack London's story "The Man on the Trail, A Klondike Christmas," published in the Overland Monthly in January 1899.
Song sheets in this series are housed in the Confederate Pamphlets collection. Call numbers are listed.

The diary, begun on April 6, 1878, and ending on Nov. 9, 1878 in Augsburg, covers the travels of an American woman through England, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Included are descriptions of visits to museums and royal palaces. While in Norway, the author met and spent time with Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant. Formerly known as Anonymous diary, 1878.
Collection houses archives of the American Society of Papyrologists, including the Society's constitution, financial papers, correspondence, Director's Office files, memoranda, and other administrative files, spanning the years 1977-1993. Collection has been given basic processing: items are in original order as received.
Collection comprises seven letters from Susan B. Anthony to various correspondents, one postcard written to her, a printed item, and a letter by S. J. S. Holden that mentions Anthony, Stanton, and the 1874 National Woman Suffrage Association (N.W.S.A.) convention. In June 1870, Anthony wrote two letters to Edwin A. Studwell, who became her business manager, regarding payment for lectures in which she participated with Elizabeth Cady Stanton; her need to sell her serial, The Revolution, and plans for its continued success; competition with suffragists in Boston; her life insurance policies; and her general need for ready funds. There is also a Dec. 1873 letter from Anthony to Judge Henry R. Selden requesting copy for his argument made on Anthony's behalf regarding the Rights of Women in the U.S. District Court of New York, to be published in time for the upcoming N.W.S.A. convention. The postscript to this letter was written upon a flyer for a mass meeting of the New York Woman's Suffrage Society. Collection includes a copy of the final, printed version of Selden's argument, "Rights of women under the late constitutional amendments."
In 1894, Anthony wrote two letters to a suffragist concerning problems in Kansas; she wished to identify the Republican, Progressive, or other person responsible for "stirring things up," for the Republicans failed to include suffrage in their platform. On 1900 April 24, Anthony wrote to Rachel [Foster Avery?] regarding several publications in process, including forms for letters to the national conventions of the prohibition, Populist, Democratic, and Republican parties; a "memorial;" an appeal to the Ecumenical Council; along with other work to be shared by the suffrage leadership. A letter from Anthony 1900 July 22 was written to an unnamed suffragist who likely requested an autograph, "Yes indeed--you shall have my pen tracks--not only--but also my wish that you both believe in work for the protection of women in the crowning right of citizenship--the right to vote--and so help to hasten the day when ours shall be a true republic in practice as it now is in theory."
Collection also includes a postcard written to Anthony from Mary L. Lathrop in Jackson, [Miss.?] in 1874 regarding Lathrop's inability to send more money following Anthony's successful speaking engagement there; the money went toward advertising for the event. Another letter, from S. J. S. Holden to Rachel [Foster Avery?], in 1874 describes attendance at the N.W.S.A. convention, the speeches of Anthony and Elizabeth Cay Stanton, and other pastimes in Washington, D.C. Several of the letters in the collection are written on N.W.S.A. or National-American Woman Suffrage Association letterhead; Anthony's 1894 letters are stamped with the ownership mark of the Daughters of the Pioneers of Washington library. Collection includes dealer transcriptions for two of Anthony's letters.
Video recording consists of a slide show of still images chiefly taken at annual meetings of the American Ophthalmological Society, most of which were and still are held at The Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia. Though the series begins with historical images, the first of which is a panoramic print of the 1919 conference attendees, most date from the 1950s through 1993. Subjects typically include scenes from the meetings, candid portraits of individuals attending the meeting and enjoying recreational activities, and the locations and grounds where the meetings were held. A credit screen gives the name M. N. Luxenberg, who is almost certainly Malcom (Mike) N. Luxenberg, an opthalmologist in Augusta, Georgia, Past President of AOS, and Professor and Chair for Ophthalmology for Augusta University. Aquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.
The Anne Baker papers contains documentation of Baker's personal life and of her professional role as the Director of Counseling at the Hope Clinic of Granite City, Illinois. They include materials from workshops and trainings she gave, secondary literature about abortion counseling, correspondence, materials from different protests that she and other Hope Clinic staff attended, personal notes, histories of the Hope Clinic, and newspaper clippings from the kidnapping of Dr. Hector Zevallos and his wife Jean Rosalie Zevallos.
Manuscript journal written in 25 annual vols. of Lett's Diary. In the early volumes, Baker lived in Bayswater, England, and was a partner in a firm in the Colonial Commission trade. He wrote of attending plays, concerts, and sporting events. He spent much of his time working among boys and young men at the West London Youths Institute. Although married with children, he wrote of his great affection for boys, and sometimes mentioned taking them home and sleeping with them. He described marital discord caused by his wife's "cold" treatment of particular boys. In 1875, his wife left him.
Entries also document his financial difficulties, which necessitated his borrowing large sums of money and which culminated in bankruptcy in 1875. He attempted to open a school in 1877, but had few students due to "terrible scandals," which he attributed to his wife. By 1875, he had been ordained into the Church of England, and the later volumes describe his life as a curate in various parishes. In 1902, he signed on as chaplain on the S.S. Macquerie on a 3-month voyage to Australia, but left the ship in Melbourne with the atheist Captain angry at him. At the end of the last journal, he was living in his home town of Derby.
Papers of Henry D. Baker (1873-1939), U.S. consular official and newspaper editor and publisher, contain correspondence, clippings, genealogy, printed material, pictures, and volumes. The bulk of the papers before 1900 refer to the Griffiths, Speir, Willis and Austin families of England and Australia, related through Baker's wife, Gwyneth Griffiths. They concern family matters, and the service of Charles Ralph Griffiths (1790-1850) as British vice consul and consul at Buenos Aires, 1823-1846. Material after 1900 relates to the consular career of Henry Baker in Tasmania, 1907-1911, Bombay, 1913-1914, and Trinidad, 1916-1927; Baker's service as commercial attache at Petrograd, Russia; and his opposition to trade with Russia, 1930-1931. Tasmanian Scrapbook, 1907-1911, includes clippings, photographs, and pictures relating to Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand, and the islands of the Bass Straits. Scrapbook, 1911-1933, contains pamphlets, articles, speeches, pictures, clippings and letters concerning relations with Russia during World War I and in 1930-1931, and Baker's activities in the United States, Trinidad, Tasmania, India, and New Zealand. There are also printed copies of books by Baker and by Charles H. Baker; family photographs and copies of portraits, especially from the Griffiths family; photographs of Trinidad and Baker's trip to Persia, 1916; and photographs of "Erryd," Victorian home of the Griffiths in Wales. Printed material consists of speeches, articles and pamphlets by and about Baker. The clippings, 1910-1951, include articles by and about Baker and items about the countries in which he served. An extensive genealogical folder contains information about the Baker and Dunster families of America and the Griffiths, Speir, Willis, Hart, and Blondeau families of England and Australia.
Collection comprises 23 color photographs (4"x6") of Bamako, Mali, sent to Helene Baumann by a friend in 2002, accompanied by a letter containing descriptive information for each photograph. Baumann was librarian for African and Western European Studies at Duke University, 1988-2006. Includes images of housing conditions; markets, public spaces, monuments, and buildings; and soccer matches.
Collection consists of a single piece of paper (20 x 12.5 cm) with an autograph manuscript poem by Anna Letitia Barbauld on the front and a poem called "Follow Me" by William Allen on the back. Barbauld's poem reads as follows: Born to the weighty honours of a name/Whose deeds of mercy England's shores proclaim/Yet know, you may inherit lands or pelf/But must, for praise - for love, be good yourself. It's signed A.L. Barbauld and dated August 23rd 1823. The verso contains a two-stanza autograph manuscript devotional poem by William Allen titled "Follow Me." It is signed Stoke Newington 30 of 8th month 1823. Barbauld and Allen were both educators and abolitionists who lived in Stoke Newington at the time of this writing. These poems are evidence that they had at least an epistolary friendship.
The Bates Worldwide, Inc. (Bates) Records span the years 1934-2003 and include correspondence, corporate policy manuals, photographs, publications, graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic records and videocassettes that document the activities of this major global advertising agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates began as a simple proprietorship, but as the company grew its organizational structure took on different forms: a partnership, then a corporation before becoming a publicly traded transnational entity, and finally becoming a subsidiary in a global holding company. From the 1970s on, Bates' growth and international expansion was fueled by a long series of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that continued until the company was itself acquired, first by Saatchi & Saatchi and later by the WPP Group. Materials in the collection relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities, including Ted Bates & Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates, and Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and Draft) and parent organizations (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi & Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the late 20th century.
Bates built its early reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for promoting pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common household goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising policies developed around a philosophy Bates called the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an imperative to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason for consumers to use any given product or service. As the company grew into a global business, USP evolved into more complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients include Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the combined U.S. Armed Services, M&M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing Company, Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on the company's founder, Ted Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and the chief architect of the USP concept.
The collection is organized into ten series and one cumulative subject index--Client Files, Corporate Communications Department, Creative Department, Financial Records, Human Resources Department, Memorabilia, New Business, Print Books, Vertical Files and Audiovisual Materials. The Client Files Series includes research reports, storyboards and graphic designs for Bates' clients. The Corporate Communications Department Series includes company-wide memoranda, public relations policy manuals, and a large file of biographical sketches and photographs of Bates' executives, as well as news clippings and press releases relating to the company and its clients. The Creative Department Series primarily focuses on Bates' efforts to stimulate creativity throughout its worldwide offices through participation in internal and industry-wide advertising competitions. The Financial Records Series includes general ledgers and other accounting reports. The Human Resources Department Series includes employee benefits literature and information on company affairs including press releases and staff memoranda. The Memorabilia Series includes promotional clothing, games, office posters and awards. The New Business Series includes materials relating to requests for proposals from prospective clients. The Print Books Series contains material from over 100 albums of proof sheets and print advertisements from existing clients. The Vertical Files Series consists of an alphabetical file of general information collected to aid in various aspects of company operations. The Audiovisual Materials Series contains periodic review collections of advertising, video memoranda, speeches, retirement presentations and highlight compilations prepared for prospective clients and award show consideration. A Subject Cross-Reference Index at the end of the finding aid links materials pertaining to specific clients, corporations, events and policies scattered throughout the various subject series.

Corporate reports, correspondence and memoranda, press releases, news clippings, general office files and photographs that originated in or were maintained by Bates Corporate Communications Department. The series dates between 1940-2003 and primarily documents the corporate public relations, news events and publicity activities of Bates offices, personnel and clients. The materials contained in the series thus record mainly newsworthy events, as opposed to daily operations--client relationships and advertising campaigns rather than account management specifics, or, promotion announcements rather than personnel employment records. Other files reflect materials in general distribution throughout the corporation. Some of the material contained in the series, primarily news clippings, originated in the corporate Information Center. The series is organized into seven subseries--General Office Files, Clients, Media, Meetings, Mergers and Acquisitions, Offices, and People--and arranged alphabetically therein.
Some materials were received as electronic files. Disks were assigned consecutive numbers reflecting the order in which they were encountered. If a work has a corresponding or associated electronic file, the file is included in the container list. The contents of each disk have been migrated to the electronic records server. Consequently, the contents of these disks are available only in correspondingly numbered electronic subdirectories. Consult a reference archivist for access to the electronic files.

In 1994, Backer Spielvogel Bates renamed itself Bates Worldwide and embarked on a project to create a new corporate brand identity as a global advertising agency. The new branding emphasized the creative aspects of advertising. It was a way of reinvigorating the concept of the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), Bates's traditional advertising philosophy--every successful product inherently contained a unique or compelling idea (or proposition) that made the product attractive to consumers, and successful advertising identified that unique idea and linked it to a consumer's life needs. This project led to the creation of a Global Creative Board and inaugurated an annual internal creative competition known variously as Best of Bates or Bates's Best, the first awards for which were given during the Worldwide Management Meeting in 1996. The Creative Department was charged with coordinating this yearly competition and helped in the selection of entries for various industry-wide awards competitions.
The Creative Department Series includes entry forms, memoranda, print advertisement proofs and photocopies, slides and printed material. The series dates between 1980s-2003, but most of the materials date from 1997-2002 and document the Creative Department's coordination of internal and external awards competitions, in particular the annual Best of Bates program. It includes a significant portion of international advertisements; however, the files do not represent the total output of Bates Worldwide offices. Rather, they reflect what Bates's various international offices considered their best work for the period covered herein. They provide a glimpse into some of Bates's international campaigns and creative output for clients such as Arnott's department store (Ireland), Audi/Volkswagen, Caltex, Camel cigarettes, Heineken, Le Meridien hotels, Land Rover, Nokia cellular phones, Pfizer, Royal Mail of Australia, Seat automobiles, and Thames bottled water. Many of the submission forms (some are still attached to the submitted item) for these competitive entries include a description of the USP that informed the advertisement's design. In addition, the series contains general files pertaining to other Creative Department operations and activities.
The series is organized into three subseries--Creative Binders, Print Advertisements and Office Files--that reflect the various formats of materials in the series. Both the Creative Binders Subseries and the Print Advertisements Subseries contain examples of advertisements entered into competitive events, which are present in varying formats--slides, proofs, tear sheets, and photocopies. There is some redundancy to the container list: because of the various formats it was not feasible to house all materials pertaining to a specific client together. Thus, portions of the container list repeat client names.
Consists of materials maintained in binders by the Creative Department, primarily entry forms and slides of entries, winners for the Best of Bates and Cannes competitions, as well as other examples of Bates's advertisements. Arranged alphabetically by competition event, chronologically therein, and then alphabetically by event category.
Proof sheets and photocopies of print advertisements entered into company-wide Best of Bates competitions. Most are in color, many are large-format and several are mounted on foamboard for presentation purposes. Specific clients listed below have more than two images present; many other clients are represented in the collection by a single image, but are not listed by name. International offices are heavily represented in this subseries, but the materials present only reflect a portion of the actual output of Bates global operations. For a more comprehensive collection of Bates's domestic output, see the Print Books Series. For ease of access, the subseries is organized into two lists--chronological and alphabetical.

Audio and video tapes in multiple formats that include speeches, video memoranda, historical overviews and testimonials which commemorate company events such as anniversaries, retirements, and office openings, or pay tribute to the work and legacies of key executives. The series is organized into two categories--Audiovisual Materials Pulled from Other Series and Audiovisual Materials Added to Collection. Materials pulled from the other series have been arranged alphabetically according to the series titles in which they were originally housed, and therein alphabetically by topic and item title. Materials added to the collection have been arranged alphabetically according to the corporate identity responsible for the item's production, and therein alphabetically by topic and item title. Each item has been assigned a unique number that will be used to manage the production of any use copies requested by researchers.
Unique item numbers reflect the order in which items were encountered during processing and appear out of sequence in the following arrangement, which is according to title of the series from which the items came.

The Raymond C. Battalio and John B. Van Huyck papers document their careers as economists at Texas A&M University (TAMU), particularly their work developing the field of experimental economics in the 1990s. Their papers are combined in one collection given their close working relationship.
The primary subjects are behavioral game theory, experimental economics, and macroeconomics. There are records related to Battalio's presidency of the Economic Science Association, Van Huyck's activity for Experimental Economics, and the founding of the Economic Research Lab at TAMU.
The most common type of material by far is research files on experiments, but there are also many correspondence files, manuscript files for writings and referee reports, course files for teaching, and files for their professional activities as economists. To a lesser extent, there are university and department files for their activities as faculty members, plus personal files from Van Huyck (especially academic coursework and family material).
The greatest amount of professional correspondence is with Charles Holt, David Levine, Thomas Palfrey, Charles Plott, Alvin Roth, and Larry Samuelson. Battalio and Van Huyck communicated with many contributors to experimental economics, and there is a lesser amount of correspondence with James Andreoni, Colin Camerer, John Kagel, and Vernon Smith.
This collection contains 1,309 floppy disks, 245 optical disks, six hard drives, five quarter-inch cartridges, and three USB thumb drives. Most or all of them belonged to Van Huyck, and he migrated files and folders to newer storage mediums over time and created backups for security or home use. Electronic records from most of these items have been copied to a server and are available. 137 installation disks for software were retained (but not copied) for possible emulation in the future; a separate inventory of them is available by request from Research Services.
Battalio and Van Huyck's correspondence, which is mainly professional in nature and with other economists, especially Charles Holt, David Levine, Thomas Palfrey, Charles Plott, Alvin Roth, and Larry Samuelson. Topics include the exchange of papers and research material, referee activity, and paper submissions. Organized into three subseries to preserve their original order: Alphabetical Correspondence (for Van Huyck), Chronological Correspondence (for Battalio), and Email Correspondence (from Van Huyck's computer disk drives).
Van Huyck's correspondence, sometimes on behalf of himself and Battalio and almost entirely professional. Topics include the exchange of papers and research material, referee activity, paper submissions, and job searches and offers, and the largest amount is with Larry Samuelson. Arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent or organization/institution.

The vast majority of these files are Van Huyck's evaluations of National Science Foundation (NSF) proposals as part of his service on review panels, but he also consulted on one legal case. Arranged alphabetically.
Text files; entirely relates to NSF.
Proposal evaluations.
Van Huyck consulted on questions of milk pricing and cartel practices for legal case involving Kroger and Texas.
Material such as correspondence, drafts, supporting research material, referee reports, and reprints related to Battalio and Van Huyck's published and unpublished writings. The largest files are on "Dynamic Monetary Control and Interest Rate Stabilization," "Evidence on Learning in Coordination Games," and "Optimization Incentives and Coordination Failure in Laboratory Stag Hunt Games." Organized into three subseries: Articles and Book Chapters, Referee Reports, and Special Issue of Experimental Economics in Honor of Battalio.
Includes correspondence, drafts, reprints, and supporting research material (typically experiment data). The largest files are on "Dynamic Monetary Control and Interest Rate Stabilization," "Evidence on Learning in Coordination Games," and "Optimization Incentives and Coordination Failure in Laboratory Stag Hunt Games."
Battalio and Van Huyck coded their experiments to indicate type and vintage (see the Experiments series for more details). Experiment codes appearing in this subseries also appear in the Experiments series, possibly allowing connections to be made between published writings and experiment files. The most frequently used codes are as follows: BB are beauty contest games inspired by Keynes's famous example of the workings of financial markets; C or CONV followed by a number are experiments on conventions; CR or CRAW followed by a number are coordination games; DEC followed by a letter and/or number or DX followed by a number are on decentralized allocation decisions; and PD followed by a number are peasant-dictator games. Less frequently used codes can be found in the Other Experiments and Related Materials subseries.

Image, text, executable, and database files; zipped folder.
Material such as correspondence, experiment data (response sheets, tabulated responses, and printouts of data), statistical data analysis of results, participant instructions, and design notes for Battalio and Van Huyck's experiments on economic decision making and interactions. Data analysis was typically done with software, such as SAS, Stata, and Mathematica, and this series features a majority of the electronic records and audiovisual material.
Battalio and Van Huyck coded their experiments to indicate type and vintage (some experiments were conducted multiple times, presumably with extensions and modifications), and these codes are used as file titles when possible. The most frequently used codes are as follows: BB are beauty contest games inspired by Keynes's example of the workings of financial markets; C or CONV followed by a number are experiments on conventions; CR or CRAW followed by a number are coordination games; DEC followed by a letter and/or number or DX followed by a number are on decentralized allocation decisions; and PD followed by a number are peasant-dictator games. Codes appearing in this series also appear in the Articles and Book Chapters subseries, possibly allowing connections to be made between published writings and experiment files.

The Richard Bausch Papers, 1965-1998, document the career of the American novelist and short story writer through personal and professional correspondence, manuscripts of published and unpublished works, and printed materials. The Correspondence Series begins in the 1960s with mainly personal letters, but by the 1970s begins to document Bausch's emergent writing career, including mention of his work on early short stories and his acceptance to the Iowa Writers' Workshop. From that point on several prominent American writers and literary figures appear, including frequent correspondence at various times with Charles Baxter, Frederick Busch, Richard Ford, George Garrett, Gordon Lish, William Maxwell, and C.K. Williams; Bausch's agent, Harriet Wasserman; and his twin brother, novelist Robert Bausch. Prominent though less frequent correspondents include Fred Chappell, Alan Gurganus, Barry Hannah, and Jean Thompson. The Writings Series documents the development of Bausch's novels and story collections and consists mainly of typescripts and various stages of proofs. Although most are fair copies or only moderately hand-corrected, the sheer number of versions documents the process of creation. Of special note in this regard are the novels Rebel Powers and Violence. Two smaller series, Printed Materials and Writings by Others, make up the remainder of the collection. Highlights of the latter series include a copy of Bob Balaban's screenplay for the Bausch novel, The Last Good Time, and typescripts of several early stories by Gurganus dating from the 1970s.
Professional and personal correspondence and printouts of e-mail, arranged in chronological incoming and outgoing sequences.
Arranged alphabetically by book title. Folders for single stories are filed after the book titles in a separate alphabetical sequence. Writings in other genres, including poetry, and miscellaneous fragments of fiction manuscripts appear at the end of the series. A number of the typescripts were printed out from diskettes included in the collection; these are marked with a "Disk" number in the upper left hand corner of the first page.
Printed materials by and about Bausch. Includes some early stories in journals, clippings, reviews, publicity material, and miscellaneous other printed items. Arrangement parallels the general structure of the Writings Series: fiction first, followed by writings in other genres and ending with miscellaneous materials about Bausch and other topics.
Typescripts and printed material by various authors, most of it inscribed to Bausch by the authors. Arranged alphabetically by author.
Collection comprises 25 black-and-white and 48 color photographs taken from 2001 to 2012 by Marion Belanger, documenting the intersection of natural and human-built environments.
Belanger's series "Everglades," taken in Florida between 2001-2004, presents black-and-white images of wildlife and natural landscapes affected by the impacts of tourism, agriculture, migrant worker housing, construction, and activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Army. This series was also published in 2009 as Everglades: Outside and Within.
Her portfolio "Rift/Fault," shot between 2006-2012, documents zones in California and Iceland where the San Andreas Fault and the Mid-Atlantic Rift exist - visibly or invisibly - alongside human environments; subjects in this series include housing developments, monitoring stations, geologic features and landscapes, coastal roads, and geothermal structures such as greenhouses. The images were shot in color and are suffused with pale tonalities. Prints measure 13 1/2 x16 inches. Also published as a photobook in 2012, available in the library.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.
The collection consists of 25 16x13 inch black-and-white photographs taken from 2001 to 2004 by Marion Belanger, documenting the impact of human land use and demand for water on the Florida Everglades. The images show wildlife and natural landscapes as well as the presence and impacts of tourism, agriculture, migrant worker housing, construction, and the activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Army.
From the artist's statement:
"...I had seen the Everglades from the plane ‚Äì a dark nothingness at night, and by day a flat, often wet, expanse of swampland, punctuated by agricultural fields and housing developments. I was curious to experience the natural landscape, of course, but I was even more interested in the determined efforts of engineers, over many years, to eliminate the swamp for sugarcane fields and development profit. To me it was the dark heart of the state. Once I went there the actual place itself was more extreme than I could have imagined ‚Äì the park itself like a living museum; miles of water control canals, levees, pumps, and dams; empty spaces, acres of emptiness, vast sugarcane fields, and (mostly gated) housing developments. My working process is not to impose the preconceived, but to embrace the unexpected..."
The full artist's statement is available in the portfolio box.
Titles and dates transcribed as they appear on the print versos.
The Everglades project was supported with a 2002 John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship.
These 48 images were taken between 2006 and 2012 in dramatic geological zones in California and Iceland, and, as in Belanger's previous project on the Everglades, she focuses attention on the dual relationship of landscapes and their impact on humans, and humans and their impact on the environment.
From the artist's statement: "Rift/Fault is a study of the shifting land-based tectonic edges of the North American Continental Plate in California and Iceland. Rift refers to where the North American Plate meets the Eurasian Plate, along the Mid-Atlantic Rift in Iceland. Fault refers to the San Andreas Fault, where the North American and Pacific Plates meet. Tectonic plates slide along the mantle of our earth, underneath our oceans, our land, our homes. Tectonic plate edges are geologically active - they spread, move, erupt, and tremble. Their behavior is for the most part unpredictable, and wholly uncontainable. And while boundaries upon the land are often contested, politicized, and fought over, tectonic plate edges remain immune to any human efforts of control. I photographed the visual traces (or not) of the tectonic plate edges upon the land, as well the structures and uses of the built landscape upon those edges, allowing for dialogue between the wild and the contained, the fertile and the barren, the geologic and the human. These dichotomies create a visual tension that questions the uneasy relationship between geologic force, and the limits of human intervention."

This collection includes sixteen gold-toned, albumen prints, printed from negatives made by William Bell while on the Wheeler Expedition of 1872. Fourteen photographs are from Arizona, and two are from Utah. The primary subjects of this collection are picturesque landscapes made of the Grand Canyon and Colorado River. Some of Bell's photographs from this expedition were used for prints in George M. Wheeler's Report Upon United States Geographical Surveys West of the One Hundredth Meridian...(Washington: GPO, 1875-1889). This collection is composed of one series entitled the Wheeler Expedition of 1872 Series.
The government included photographers on western expeditions to make a visual record of the landscape and its inhabitants. The photographs created during these expeditions served to create maps used to plan for the construction of roads and railways; locate natural resources; facilitate future military operations; as well as to collect ethnographic information on and locate Indian tribes. Perhaps most importantly, the commanders of western expeditions used the resulting photographs as a public relations tool to gain support for future expeditions, and to record geological information, the study of which had become a popular science during the period. By the time of their completion, the surveys had explored much of the region between the Great Plains and the Pacific Coast. This recording made Bell and the other western expeditionary photographers some of the earliest participants in America's tradition of documentary photography.
While in the field, Bell utilized a photographic process somewhat uncharacteristic for his time; he prepared his own dry-plate negatives. This process allowed him to store prepared plates longer than his contemporaries, who used wet plates, but would have also increased the exposure times for his plates.

Blackwell‚Äôs letter begins: ‚ÄòDear Sir, No one desires more strongly than I, that a just system of Irish government should be substituted for the unjust ‚ÄúCastle‚Äù system. I therefore profoundly regret that Mr. Gladstone has not been able to see that his present scheme destroys the Imperial Parliament, and insists upon treating the absence of Irish members as a ‚Äúdetail.‚Äù I can only hope therefore that the Govt. Bill will be thrown out, and that no member supporting it, will be returned to Parliament.‚Äù William Ewart Gladstone, served as Prime Minister four separate times: (1868‚Äì1874, 1880‚Äì1885, February‚ÄìJuly 1886 and 1892‚Äì1894).

Bogart was the architect of many of the major research studies conducted during his tenure with the NAB. Bogart led two major research projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations to reverse declines in newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the newspaper industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was formed shortly afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues that began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of television. Recommendations from the Future of Advertising Project led to standardization in advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This subseries is divided into three sections: General, Newspaper Readership Project, and Future of Advertising Project. General consists mainly of materials related to various research projects at the NAB. For slides of NAB presentations, see the Photographs & Slides Series.

On behalf of the Freedom Forum, Bogart advised the Oakland Tribune on how to restructure their business in 1991 and organized a newspaper advertising workshop in Russia and Eastern Europe in 1992.
Bogart spent much of his late career sharing his newspaper industry and mass media expertise. As Director and Senior Consultant for Innovation International Media Consulting Group, Bogart advised newspapers, particularly in Spain, Latin America, Russia, and Eastern Europe; and assessed the state of newspapers and mass media for Innovation publications and conferences. Bogart also shared his knowledge about the mass media with attorneys as a media expert in two very public trials in the 1990s, Chandler v. Jackson (Michael Jackson child molestation lawsuit) and Valenzuela v. Hughes Aircraft Company (TCE groundwater contamination lawsuit in Tuscon, Arizona).
Slides of presentations given at the Freedom Forum workshop and photographs of the trip are located in the Photographs and Slides Series. Presentation scripts are in Russian and English and slide text is in Russian. Videocassette tapes of media coverage of Michael Jackson and TCE groundwater contamination in Arizona are located in the Audiovisual Materials section. Arranged alphabetically.
Documents Bogart's twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB), the advertising and promotion organization for the newspaper industry. Bogart began work with the NAB as Vice President of Marketing Planning and Research in 1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice President and General Manager in 1966. During his tenure with the NAB, Bogart was the architect of most of the major research studies. Bogart led two major research projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from 1977-1983 and the Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations to reverse declines in newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the newspaper industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was formed shortly afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues that began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of television. Recommendations from the Future of Advertising Project led to standardization in advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This subseries is divided into three sections: General, Newspaper Readership Project, and Future of Advertising Project. General consists mainly of materials related to various research projects at the NAB. For slides of NAB presentations, see the Photographs & Slides Series.

These two large photograph albums were owned by Wilbur E. Hagans, who toured the area of Palestine known as the Holy Lands around 1881. He purchased dozens of souvenir albumen prints from the studio, then upon his return had the cloth-bound albums assembled in New York. The 56 images date from about 1881 and were taken by noted 19th-century French photographer F√©lix Bonfils, who owned the Bonfils studio, and his Syrian assistant Georges Saboungi. They portray cities and towns, landscapes, ruins, monuments, tombs, and other religious and historic sites of Palestine, in areas now occupied by Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. Locations named in the captions include Beirut, Bethlehem, Cana, Damascus, Galilee, the Holy Sepulchre shrine, Jaffa, Jerusalem, the Mosque of Omar at the Dome of Rock, the Mount of Olives, Mount Tabor, Nazareth, Samaria, the Tomb of David, the Wailing Wall, the interior of the house of the English Consul in Damascus, a "crusader's tower" in the village of Ramleh, and various other sites. In some cases there are small figures visible among the landscapes, but these are the only individuals present in the images.
The two albums measure 14 x 18 inches (37 x 47.5 centimeters); Volume I holds 30 albumen prints, while Volume II holds 26 prints. The prints all measure 9 x 11 inches (22 x 28 centimeters) and are affixed to card mounts, one per print. Some show signs of fading, but most are in good condition. Each print bears the name of one of two photographers: F√©lix Bonfils (18 prints), or Georges Saboungi (38 prints); some prints are also marked with an identification number assigned by the studio, and these have been included in the inventory.
The photographer's name appears following the title for each print. All titles are taken from the original captions; original French captions have not been transcribed but appear with each print. When known, the image negative numbers assigned by the studio have been included in the description; all of these were taken by F√©lix Bonfils. Box 1 contains information on the collection, including photocopied articles on the history of the Bonfils photography studio.

The papers of Winifred Gail Soules Bradley span the period 1952 to 1982 with the bulk of the material dating from 1965 through the 1970s. The focus of the collection is the various women's organizations to which Bradley belonged and in which she held leadership positions.
The collection includes correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports, speeches and writings, newsletters, financial reports, pamphlets, clippings, flyers, and printed materials. It is organized chiefly alphabetically by name of organization, committee, or concern.
The organization primarily represented is the League of Women Voters in which Bradley held local, state, and national office. Files pertaining to the League are subdivided by the League of Women Voters, Durham, N.C., League of Women Voters, N.C., and the League of Women Voters, United States. These files are further subdivided by committees, conferences, and issues in which Bradley held an office or was involved. Within these subgroups, the papers are arranged in chronological order. The majority of materials in this file pertains to her offices at the national level, in particular her service as chair of the League of Women Voters of the United States (LWVUS) Foreign Policy Committee from 1967 to 1970 and her tenure as First Vice President from 1970 to 1974.
Papers relating to the Foreign Policy Committee include memos from Bradley to state league presidents, handwritten notes, reports and speeches (some of these made by Bradley), position papers, and newsletters. Among the topics addressed while she was Foreign Policy committee chairman were foreign aid, biological and chemical warfare, and United States trade policies.
Bradley's positions as First Vice President of the LWVUS and Chair of the Foreign Policy Committee gave her several opportunities to have a highly visible role in the League's activities, some of which are reflected in the collection. They include speeches she made before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee in support of foreign economic aid in 1968 and before the House Ways and Means Committee regarding U.S. trade policy and the Trade Expansion Act of 1968. She also represented the League on a fact-finding mission to Japan in 1972 and at the Hemispheric Conference for Women in Miami in 1976. Documentation and papers relating to both trips are included in the collection.
In 1971, Bradley was appointed by President Nixon to serve as a member of the board of the National Institute for Consumer Justice. The board's report provided findings and recommendations concerning the adequacy of existing procedures for resolving disputes arising out of consumer transactions, particularly as they related to small claims courts.
Bradley's involvement with the Overseas Education Fund (OEF) also added an international component to her work with the LWVUS. She became a life trustee of the organization. The mission of the OEF was to help women of the third world become integrated into the socioeconomic development of their societies, as well as to further understanding in the United States of issues as they related to women in development. Bradley also represented the LWVUS on the United States National Commission for UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization). Papers related to this organization contain reports by Bradley to the LWVUS about the group and to her activities as chair of its Status of Women Committee. One of these involvements was a Mid-Decade World Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1980, which grew out of the United Nations Decade for Women (1975-1985). The papers indicate that Bradley contributed to the development of this conference by devising a basic plan to involve nongovernmental organizations in the conference.
The collection contains several speeches Bradley made before League groups both while she was President of the North Carolina League of Women Voters and also when she was First Vice-President of the LWVUS. However, there is not very much material relating to her tenure as president of the League of Women Voters of North Carolina from 1962 to 1965. Some of this material has been donated to the North Carolina State Division of Archives and History and to the state league office in Raleigh, North Carolina. What material there is primarily concerns the League's efforts to revise the structure and operations of the Judicial Department of North Carolina, particularly the North Carolina court system.
The League of Women Voters of Durham, N.C. Bulletin forms the bulk of the material relating to the local league with which Bradley was involved. The Bulletin spans the years 1952 to 1982 and offers insight into League activities at the local level. Bradley was President of the Durham League from 1957 to 1959. Other materials from the Durham League include information about local workshops, general information pertaining to Durham and local issues in the areas of housing, transportation, and law enforcement.
The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) File (1971-1982) chiefly relates to efforts to ratify passage of the ERA in the North Carolina State Legislature. These papers particularly reflect those attempts which were made in the state from 1974 to 1979. The organization most prominently represented is North Carolinians United for ERA (NCUERA) which was comprised of a coalition of forty-three groups in North Carolina. NCUERA was apparently referred to by several names, including ERA United Inc., N. C. Coalition for Passage of the ERA, and the North Carolina Equal Rights Amendment Ratification Coalition. Offices Bradley held include Public Relations Coordinator for ERA United, 1974-1975 and lst Vice-President of NCUERA, 1978-1979. The files contain handwritten notes, speeches made by Bradley, correspondence, minutes, and printed materials generated to garner support for the ERA amendment. They also include personal testimonies from persons, who were surveyed by Bradley during her tenure as Public Relations Coordinator, regarding why they were working for passage of the ERA as well as samples of quotes from persons representing different groups who were against passage of the ERA.
Two other North Carolina women's groups in which she held leadership positions were WEAL (Women's Equity Action League) and Women's Forum (WF) of North Carolina. Correspondence, minutes, and newsletters relating to both groups are located in the collection and cover the years 1977 to 1982. Both organizations were affiliated with national organizations. Bradley was President of the North Carolina division of WEAL in 1976 and Vice-President of WF of North Carolina in 1979. WEAL was interested in promoting economic opportunity and pressing for enforcement of anti-discrimination laws against women. It was one of the forty-three groups that joined together to form North Carolinians United for the ERA.
The WF of North Carolina was comprised of women deemed to be high achievers and leaders. Papers indicate that in order to become eligible for membership women had to have influence in the community, have a constituency or make achievements in and beyond their fields. Additionally, members were to have made a commitment to changing the status of women. The papers document considerable debate about eligibility requirements and lengthy discussions about whether or not proposed members should be accepted. Some of the membership proposals are included in the collection.
While most of the collection pertains to volunteer organizations with which Bradley was involved, two other groups are represented in which Bradley held paid positions. She worked as a fundraising consultant for the N. C. Rape Crisis Association, Inc. and as a staff member of the Older Americans Volunteer Program Training Project (OAVP). OAVP was housed in the Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development in the Duke University Medical Center. There are two folders of miscellaneous items, including the work by Bradley, ABC's of Fundraising for Volunteer Organizations, speeches she gave (but it is unclear for which organizations they were made), and pamphlets and bibliographies concerning legal, insurance, and child care issues affecting women.
There is very little personal material relating to Mrs. Bradley or to her family in the collection. Some of the papers indicate she and her husband, Dr. David Bradley, worked together for the passage of the ERA in North Carolina and that they traveled abroad to conferences sponsored by the Wilton Park organization. [Wilton Park is described as a British organization to promote greater cooperation in Europe and the West and to offer those influencing opinion in their own countries an opportunity to exchange views on political, economic, and social questions.] Dr. Bradley was for many years on the faculty of the Duke University Religion Department.
A common goal which characterizes the various organizations and committees in which Bradley established herself as a leader was to improve the condition of women legally, economically, and politically.

Collection of 74 unpublished typewritten sermons and texts for prayer meetings (also called sermons) assembled by a Methodist minister active in Virginia in the early twentieth century. Although no author's name is given, from church appointment records it is almost certain that the minister is John Luke Bray (1871-1938). The sermons were given from 1907 to 1938 in localities in southern Virginia (almost all in Danville, Crewe, South Boston, Richmond, and Norfolk); the earliest sermon (1907) was given in Shawnee, Oklahoma. The minister served for several years in each church, the last sermons of 1936-1938 being given in the Methodist Church in the railroad town of Crewe, Va., which possibly also served a Baptist congregation, an arrangement not unusual in rural areas. The sermon notes, typed in red and black and typically two to four pages in length, offer evidence of the typical style of preaching in Methodist churches in the South and sometimes refer to social or economic issues. Each envelope enclosing the sermon text is marked with the title, taken from a Biblical text, and when and where preached; most have multiple dates and locations. Most envelopes are marked in a corner as "Sermon Notes," but some are labeled "Prayer Meetings," with the text inside still labeled by the minister as a sermon. There are also a few miscellaneous items, including newspaper clippings, handwritten notes, and one leaf with an undated hymn with words by A. W. Davis, entitled "Over the Top With Jesus," dedicated to a "Rev. D. H. Kenney." Some fragile items have been photocopied. Arranged in two series: Prayer Meetings and Sermons, with the bulk of the sermons housed in the latter group. Within each series, arranged in Biblical order.
Collection comprises two autograph, signed letters Lydia L. Brennan wrote to the Holter Hardware Company in Helena, Montana, on July 1 and October 3, 1896, to place orders for photographic supplies, particularly American Aristo Platino papers.

Bromo-Seltzer was an analgesic patented by Isaac Emerson of Baltimore, Md. in 1888. Booklet was part of World War II-era cooperation with the War Advertising Council and depicts the insignia and some history of U.S. military awards and decoration. Booklet also promotes War Bonds (precursor to Savings Bonds) on back cover as well as advertising Bromo-Seltzer. Acquired as part of the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Collection chiefly is composed of letters, educational reports, numerous writings and addresses, and various professional papers, all relating to tobacco relief, education, and agriculture in North Carolina. Specific topics cover the Department of Education of what was then known as Trinity College in Durham, N.C.; the history of North Carolina, from an unpublished draft; and the matter of education for rural populations in N.C. and elsewhere. Materials include a microfilm of Brooks' papers held by the Department of Archives and History in Raleigh, N.C.; telegrams; extensive manuscripts for unpublished works, lecture notes, and an address by Supt. Benjamin Lee Smith of Greensboro Public Schools. Other items in the collection include a scrapbook; cards from Brooks to his wife from abroad; original poems written by Brooks; photographs; memorabilia; an itinerary of his trip with other agricultural experts to Europe; a contract in manuscript drawn up in 1774 between citizens of Mecklenburg Co. and John Patterson, a school teacher, who was engaged to teach there; a printed document concerning Judge Walter Clark; and other miscellaneous items. There is also a printed copy of the diary of Dr. J. F. Shaffner, Sr. and blueprints of the N.C. State Fairgrounds.
Collection includes correspondence, genealogical materials, notebooks, legal papers, and other collected papers of Earl Ivan Brown, civil engineer with the Army Corps of Engineers. Materials document Brown's career developing river and harbor improvements on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts as well as his work on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.
Collection centers around folklorist Frank Clyde Brown's papers related to his lifelong exploration and collecting of North Carolina and Appalachian folklore, which resulted in this vast archival collection of original folklore materials and editorial records for the project which published Brown's work in seven volumes as (The Frank C. Brown Collection of North Carolina Folklore, 1952-1964. Materials comprise about 1,049 tunes and songs recorded on wax cylinders and lacquer and aluminum phonodiscs, backup copies of the recordings on glass lacquer phonodiscs made by the Library of Congress in the 1940s, 30,000 written notes on lore, 650 musical scores, and numerous journal articles, student theses, books, lists, and other items. The folklore sources originated in at least 84 North Carolina counties, with about 5 percent from 20 other states and Canada, and came from the efforts of 650 other contributors besides Brown himself. Also included are the research notes and other papers of Charles Bond, a Duke graduate student who dealt with the collection in 1970.
Subjects range widely and include: ballads and songs (music as well as lyrics); European roots of North American folklore; folk music; folk poetry; games and parties; oral traditions and storytelling; superstitions; social conditions in the Southern States; African American traditions; work songs; and North American folklore in general. In addition, one can find rich resources on the study and teaching of folklore, and attitudes during the 1920s to 1950s about Southern customs and communities.
The collection is divided into the following series: Cylinders and Discs, which includes the Library of Congress glass lacquer phonodisc copies, Personal Papers, General Editors' Papers, Associate Editors' Papers, Charles Bond Research Material.
The Recordings Series includes 1,049 performances on original wax cylinders and phonodiscs, re-recordings of the cylinders and discs created by the Library of Congress in the 1940s, and supplementary materials. The original wax cylinders and phonodiscs were digitized and described as part of a CLIR/Mellon grant in 2015-2018.
The Personal Papers series includes Brown's correspondence, research files, and the extensive materials in the folklore collection, which include transcriptions and sheet music. All items were gathered by Brown, and taken over in 1943 by Dr. Newman Ivey White, who served as first general editor of the project from its inception then until his death in 1948. The General Editors' Papers include items which were related to and produced by the work of White, and Paull Franklin Baum who assumed duties at White's death, and saw the project through to its completion in 1964. The Associate Editors' Papers have been organized by editor, and include drafts and typescripts for various volumes.
The Charles Bond Research Material Series stems from the work of Charles Bond, a student of Professor Holger O. Nygard at Duke University. Bond opened the archival collection in 1970-1971, and prepared both an outline as well as a Tabulation of Unpublished Items in the collection. This series also includes correspondence, an index, and card files.

The Personal Papers series includes all items gathered by Brown during his career as folklorist and ethnomusicologist; these materials were taken over in 1943 by Dr. Newman Ivey White, who served as first general editor of the project from its inception then until his death in 1948. Brown's personal correspondence relates to his folklore study and is filed alphabetically. It includes an extensive alphabetical index and a chronological card index, both prepared for the editorial project. Correspondents include local folklorists and fellow professors. Other papers include composition books with fragmented transcriptions of folklore findings, a draft of a talk on folklore, photographs of Brown, and some printed material.
The vast folklore collection itself is filed alphabetically by contributor (the person who passed the folklore to Brown, not necessarily the person who knew the "lore" submitted to begin with) and also includes anonymous contributions. These "manuscripts," as Newman White labeled them, are the earliest extant record of the contributions, ranging from scrawled pencil notes on scrap pieces of paper to typescripts made by Brown and others from memory or made for one of his many efforts to publish a portion of the collection at various points in his life. Occasionally such a typescript will hold contributions of more than one person, and in such a case it is filed with one of the contributors, with cross-references. Especially prominent among the contributors is Maude Minish Sutton, a fellow folklorist, who gave Brown the use of her large findings of songs and games, among other contributions, along with her often voluminous notes on these items.
Part of the folklore collection features folders of clippings gathered by Brown, arranged according to Brown's classification scheme, described below. Another portion of this series is the Papers and Articles subseries, which contains auxiliary folklore information gathered throughout Brown's effects by White and arranged in rough alphabetical order. These materials include specialized bibliographies, student papers, and printed items.
Personal correspondence related to folklore study, filed alphabetically.
Drafts of publication include the table of contents, title page, and other materials, for Volume 1 and of the general introduction, as well as other miscellaneous materials. Successive progress reports on the project include the Classification Scheme, where White sets out an extended version of Brown's sixteen-point system of folklore classification by which White organized the folklore contributions. Divisions set out included: husbandry, omens, tokens, luck-signs, folk-medicine, magic, divination, housewifery, folk-sermons, pseudoscience, words, place-names, riddles and sayings, children's sayings, games, customs, legends, ballads, and songs. The series also includes newspaper and magazine reviews, correspondence, financial papers, and administrative materials.
Finally, the series includes a vast collection of folklore typescripts, both original and carbon copies, of each item in the collection, arranged according to the Classification Scheme. These were prepared by White. There are numerous references to African American customs as well as folklore traditions in Europe carried over to the United States.

The Charles Bond's Research Material Series stems from the work of Charles Bond, a student of Professor Holger O. Nygard of Duke University. Bond opened the collection in 1970-1971, and prepared both an outline as well as a Tabulation of Unpublished Items in the collection. This series also includes correspondence, an index, and card files.
Indentures, deeds, wills, receipts, a memorandum book, and other papers, mainly dating from 1850-1878 and largely relating to George Hubbard Brown, an attorney from Washington, N.C., and his legal practice, and to his service as associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. There is a small amount of correspondence, among which are letters from John Humphrey Small, U.S. Representative from North Carolina.
The Leslie Brown papers span the years 1936-2016 and undated and cover her entire career as a historian, from her doctoral training to her final position at Williams College. There is also extensive information regarding her professional interest in African-American history and the preparation of oral histories, especially those related to the Behind the Veil project at Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies. The Interviews series includes those conducted privately by Brown as well as those from various institutions that she used in her research. There are typescripts and audiocassettes. The Research/Subject files series focuses on her courses and publications, with a particular focus on Durham, NC, African-American organizations, and well-known individuals. A few research items predate Brown's birth. The Course Materials series contains subject and course files she used in her teaching, with an emphasis on African-American studies and oral histories. The Academia series provides information regarding her preparation as a historian, as well as material related to her job talks and lectures, professional activities, and book projects. The Publications series provides various publications related to African-American history, both privately published and from the popular press.

The collection includes letters, journals, scrapbooks, writings, speeches, and printed materials related to the lives of John Emory Bryant (JEB), his wife Emma Spaulding Bryant, their daughter Emma Alice Zeller and her husband Julius Zeller and their descendants, and William Anderson Pledger who was a Republican contemporary of JEB. The bulk of the collection falls into four main divisions: the early years in Maine (1851-1860), during the American-Civil War (1861-1865), during Reconstruction in Georgia and after (1865-1887), and the later years in New York (1888-1900). Some of the materials are not original and are copies or typescripts. Of note are materials regarding Georgian Republican politics; conditions for Radical Republicans and African-Americans during Reconstruction, including correspondence with Henry McNeal Turner; historical views about the differences between the North and the South; Ku Klux Klan activity in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama; and a particularly passionate exchange between Emma Spaulding Bryant and her husband regarding her visits to a doctor about "uterine difficulties." These 10 letters from Emma Bryant have been digitized and are available online at: https://repository.duke.edu/dc/spauldingbryant
The bulk of the letters cover the years before the American Civil War when John Emory Bryant (JEB) and Emma Spaulding were in Maine, during the Civil War when JEB was at Port Royal and Hilton Head, S.C., during Reconstruction in Georgia (1865-1887), and the remaining years in New York (1888-1900). The letters document JEB's life as a soldier, his courtship and relationship with his wife Emma Spaulding, his involvement in the Republican Party, temperance organizations, the Freedman's Bureau, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, as well as his relationships with other politicians such as President Ulysses S. Grant, James Atkins, Governor Rufus Bullock, and Foster Blodgett, including prominent African-American politicians of the time such as Henry McNeal Turner and William Anderson Pledger.
Most of the letters during the Civil War were written between JEB and Emma Spaulding, whom he knew before the war when she was his student at Kent's Hill. The letters describe their courtship, their social lives, and also the conditions during the war. Some of the letters during this period are official orders from officers in the Union Army, including General Rufus Saxton, with whom JEB would continue to work after the war in the Freedman's Bureau.
There are also three volumes from the Confederate Army in Georgia that include official correspondence of the Camps of Instruction for Conscripts in the 7th and 8th Congressional Districts of Georgia and correspondence from the headquarters of Brigadier General Raleigh Edward Colston's Brigade at Fort Bartow, Georgia. It is unclear how these Confederate volumes ended up with Bryant, though it is speculated that they were found by Christopher C. Richardson of the 11th Maine Volunteers who was stationed at Griffin, Georgia, for a short time in 1865. These volumes also include added notes, correspondence, and clippings from John Emory Bryant, Captain Christopher C. Richardson (business partner of Bryant who was later killed by a political opponent), and a Black clerk named G. B. Snowden who worked at Bryant and Richardson's law firm. These volumes cover the years 1863-1868 and include information about the Freedmen's Bureau at Augusta, conditions for Black people in Augusta following the Civil War, and the Republican Club of Augusta. Bryant also pasted in letters from General Rufus Saxton, 1865.
There are a series of letters from Henry McNeal Turner (1834-1915) during April, 1866. Turner was a Black Republican leader, legislator, preacher, and Post Master of Augusta, Georgia. Turner became a bishop in the African Methodist Church, 1880-1892. His letters to Bryant describe his political activity and aspirations. On April 6th, amidst the grave illness of his wife and the death of one of his children, he writes, "Please let me have the last law passed by the Georgia legislature, granting the colored people all the protection given to the white. They claim here that Georgia has granted every right, except voting."
There are several letters throughout the collection that document conditions for Black people in Georgia. While serving picket duty on a plantation in Beaufort, S. C., on September 8th, 1862, Bryant describes attending a prayer meeting, where he heard the sermon and the call and response singing. In one letter written in 1869, African-American minister Charles R. Edwardes introduces the Colored Men of the Mechanics and Laboring Men Association to JEB. Edwardes explains how the organization wanted to help freed people buy land and homes. In 1868, Mr. P. Joiner writes to JEB reporting the shooting of a Black man by White democrats near Albany, Georgia. The White mob then continued on a rampage through the countryside, warning African Americans that it was "their country and they was going to rule it."
Much of the correspondence after the Civil War pertains to JEB's political career, aspirations, and struggles. He was a strong proponent of civil rights for African-American men, a cause that he fought for throughout his life, to the chagrin of many of his political opponents. Over the years he was embroiled in several conflicts, and at least three times charges were brought against him for corruption, charges that were eventually dropped. The letters document the different political cliques that he belonged to and fell out of favor with, his participation in the downfall of Governor Rufus Bullock, the jockeying for governmental jobs, and his attempts and failures to maintain financially viable Republican newspapers.
The correspondence between JEB and his wife Emma Spaulding Bryant documents their personal, professional, and political lives, much of which was spent living apart due to the instability of JEB's employment and the hostile living conditions for Radical Republicans in the South. Emma Bryant describes family life, financial hardship and her efforts to support herself, her interest in painting and drawing, education, and her religious and political beliefs. A particularly difficult moment between Emma and John is captured in Emma's letters from July and August of 1873. These letters shed light on women's health in the 19th century and the relationships between spouses when making medical decisions. The letters recount Emma's activities during that summer when she and her daughter Alice, were visiting relatives in Illinois and Ohio while JEB tended to his political affairs in Georgia. Emma visited a doctor for "uterine difficulties." In response to "insane" and "mad" telegrams sent by her husband, she defends her choice to see a doctor. She describes the treatment that she receives from the doctor, how she wishes to be treated with equality from her husband, and how insulted she is by the accusations of infidelity being sent to her by JEB. On August 7 she describes her husband's behavior and her response, "taunts me with leaving my baby for a few days in care of her Grandma and aunty! Morally raises the lash over me and says 'now will you obey? Will you be my inferior, my obedient child?' To him I answer Never ‚Äì I will be your true loving wife, your companion and equal in every and the fullest sense ‚Äì the mother of your children ‚Äì nothing less and nothing else‚Ä¶" She also writes that she had no choice but to see a male doctor, "His manner of treatment was perfectly delicate and such as all women afflicted with such disease and wishing to recover must receive at the hands of some male physician until there are sufficient educated female physicians to supersede the males." The Bryants soon overcame this dispute. This portion of the Bryants' letters have been digitized and transcribed and can be found here: https://repository.duke.edu/dc/spauldingbryant

William Anderson Pledger (1852-1904) was an editor of the Atlanta Blade, teacher, and prominent Black Republican politician. In 1880 Pledger was elected chairman of the Republican state committee in Georgia, the first Black man to serve in that office. He and Bryant worked together and were political allies. The letter press copybook in this series includes faint copies of letters written by Pledger to various Georgian politicians and Republicans including John Emory Bryant, Henry McNeal Turner, E. R. Belcher, Benjamin Conly, Henry Farrow, M.T. Ackerman, and others. Also included in this series is a typescript of the letter press copybook by Raymond Zeller and a scrapbook created by Pledger about Georgian Republican politics and Black leadership and participation.
Two typescript copies created by Raymond Zeller. The typescript is incomplete in many places and includes corrections written in pencil.
The original letter book is difficult to read due to fading, faint ink. The notes written here were gleaned from the typescript made by Raymond Zeller and should be verified in the letter book if possible. Includes letters written to various politicians and Republicans including John Emory Bryant, Henry McNeal Turner, E. R. Belcher, Benjamin Conley, Henry Farrow, M.T. Ackerman, and others. Many of the letters are about seeking employment from Republicans. Pledger states that "The schools of this county being in the hands of the Democrats and they having such an avowed hatred to me till it is become impossible for me to obtain employment" (page 23). He writes recommendation letters and comes to the defense of others. He makes repeated arguments as to why African-Americans should be appointed to government positions. He also mentions threats against him, the Ku Klux Klan, and his unwillingness to abandon his principles and Republican ideals (page 104 and page 145). Some of his letters attend to the business of the Grand Fountain of Georgia (also referred to as the "colored Good Templars") a Black temperance organization. On page 206 he mentions relations between the White and Black templars of Georgia, and a schism between the American and English orders. In a letter to O. P. Morton, Pledger describes injustices faced by African-Americans in Georgia and argues as to why it is important that the Republican party remain in power (pages 157-163). Pledger writes a letter to the editor critiquing plans for emigration to Liberia, "We were born in America, our fore fathers and mothers for generations back are buried here, and when we leave for another land let us leave as men, not chattel..." (page 213).
Mainly clippings about Georgian Republican politics and black leadership and participation. Some of the articles mention Pledger's involvement and opinions.
The collection consists of a diary in four volumes that chronicles the vacation in Great Britain of a young American named John Buck from August 10 to September 25, 1887. The volumes comprise 249 handwritten pages in total, with commercial prints, menus, receipts, and theater playbills attached to the back of selected pages. The script is elaborate, but legible, and the narrative is remarkably descriptive. Humorous sketches illustrate the first volume in particular and the third volume includes three photographs of the author.
Buck began his diary, which he entitled Eight Weeks Vacation and How I spent it, with a detailed account of the people and activities on board the R.M.S. Britannic while on route from New York City to Liverpool, England. Upon landing, he traveled to London, where he spent the majority of his vacation. Although he visited tourist destinations such as London Tower and Winsor Castle, Buck professed little interest in sightseeing and clearly preferred the social life, including attending dinner parties, meeting pretty young women, playing sports such as pool, baseball, and tennis, and above all, attending and discussing the theater. Initially, Buck socialized with an actor he met aboard the Britannic, W. A. Faversham, and the noted basso profundo, Franz Vetta, whom he met in London. From August 30 to September 4, Buck stayed in Edinburgh, Scotland, as the guest of Henry Irving, the famous actor and manager of the Lyceum Theatre. He spent these days in the company of Mr. Irving, Bram Stoker, the actress Ellen Terry, and her son, Teddy Craig. Buck frequently noted Mr. Irving's thoughtfulness and recounted their activities and conversations, including one humorous anecdote about Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. From September 5 to September 9, Buck stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort at Badminton House. Buck described the house and grounds, formal dinner parties, informal breakfasts, sporting activities, and sightseeing excursions to Gloucester Cathedral and Raglan Castle. The remainder of the vacation was spent in London, much as it began, visiting acquaintances and going to the theater until September 20 when he departed for Liverpool and the return voyage on the Britannic. Buck ceased recording events mid-Atlantic due to his sudden interest in a female passenger.

The political correspondence deals largely with the policies of John C. Calhoun and the question of secession. After 1860 the material relates chiefly to Burt's law practice, especially to the management of estates of Confederate soldiers, and the Calhoun estate. Other matters referred to include the political corruption and economic conditions in postwar South Carolina. Among the correspondents are Armistead Burt, Pierce M. Butler, Henry Toole Clark, Thomas Green Clemson, T. L. Deveaux, James H. Hammond, A. P. Hayne, Reverdy Johnson, Hugh S. Legare, Augustus B. Longstreet, W. N. Meriwether, James L. Petigru, Francis W. Pickens, Robert Barnwell Rhett, Richard Rush, Waddy Thompson, and Louis T. Wigfall.

Collection consists of a single autograph manuscript letter written by May Byron to Reverend Edwin J. Matthews. Byron's return address is "c/o British Weekly" and Matthews' address is "The Rectory, Calstone, Calne, Wiltshire." Matthews had written to ask Byron, "the one lesson which has been most impressed upon me by my life's experiences." Byron replies, "These experiences have been so wide, so varied, and in several respects so unique that I could not possibly sum up their results in one lesson." Matthews had also asked Byron for a list of her writings, and she replies that she's unable to do so because she's lost track of them. She states that both the British Museum and the Library of Congress had asked her for a similar list, and she was unable to help them, in part because of her use of pseudonyms, and also because of her many years' work as a journalist. She concludes by stating that most all her writings are currently out of print, except for her children's books, "which have been going on selling for some 20 years."

The Cannon Mills Records, a textile manufacturer, span the years 1836-1983, although the bulk occurs during 1887-1983. Files and account books concern the operations of Cannon Manufacturing Company and its successor in 1928, Cannon Mills, its subsidiary and associated textile mills, related business interests, and community involvement. The records include correspondence, volumes, memoranda, statistical compilations, reports, printed material, and financial and legal documents.
In 1898 Cannon Manufacturing Company switched to towel manufacturing, and in later years the product line expanded into blankets. In 1971 sales exceeded $305 million, and the company dominated over 50% of the country's towel business and over 20% of the sheet business.
Important topics include the textile industry, economic conditions related to the textile industry, textile marketing and sales, state and national textile industry associations and public and governmental relations; textile industry consolidation; textile equipment and manufacturers; textile production and costs; an antebellum textile mill; and the Cannon, Patterson, Swink, Odell, Barringer, Johnston, Murdoch, and other families who were owners and managers of one or more of the textile mills.
Topics and materials related to personnel are millworkers (both men and women), child labor (both girls and boys), employee retirement plans, the Textile Workers Union of America, time books, employee injuries, company mercantile stores, and mill houses and villages.

Community relations are evident in records relating to churches, schools, the Y.M.C.A., Freemasons, philanthropy to local organizations, and secondary boarding schools in North Carolina and the inception of agricultural training for boys and home economics for girls. The city of Kannapolis, N.C., in which the main offices of Cannon were located, was a particular focus of company interest.
There are record series for the nine companies that were consolidated in 1928 to form Cannon Mills: Cannon Manufacturing Company, Cabarrus Cotton Mills, Barringer Manufacturing Company, Franklin Cotton Mills, Gibson Manufacturing Company, Kesler Manufacturing Company, Patterson Manufacturing Company, Norcott Mills Company, and Hobarton Manufacturing Company. These mills were all in the western Piedmont of North Carolina.
A number of other mills, owned by or associated with the Cannons or Cannon Mills, had a separate existence in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Those mills, represented in this collection by series, include Central Mills, Central, S.C.; Bloomfield Manufacturing Co., Statesville, N.C.; Brown Manufacturing Co., Concord, N.C.; Roberta Manufacturing Co., Cabarrus County, N.C.; Imperial Cotton Mills, Eatonton, Georgia; Social Circle Cotton Mills, Walton County, Georgia, Swink Manufacturing Company, Rowan County, N.C.; Travora Textiles, Graham and Haw River, N.C.; Windemere Knitting Mills, Albemarle, N.C.; and Wiscassett Mills, Albemarle, N.C.

These firms include: Amazon Cotton Mills, Thomasville, N.C.; Durham Hosiery Mills; Efird Manufacturing Co., Albemarle, N.C.; Tuscarora Cotton Mill, Mt. Pleasant, N.C.; Buck Creek Cotton Mills, Siluria, Ala.; and Paola Cotton Mills, Statesville, N.C.

Collection primarily comprises a photograph album, entitled "The Occupation of Japan: Nagasaki, Isahaya, Kumamoto, Sasebo," Edmund J. Catrow maintained during his service in the marines from 1945-1946. There are 277 black-and-white photographs, mostly 3 1/4 x 4 1/2 inches, plus five Japanese newspapers and several other clippings. Many of the photographs have handwritten captions in white ink. The photograph album begins with the embarkation of the 2nd Marine Division at Garapan Harbor in Saipan and continues with images of the convoy en route. Arriving in Nagasaki, Catrow found abandoned and destroyed Japanese ships and the skeletal remains of the Mitsubishi factory in the harbor. The photos from Nagasaki itself show the destruction of the atomic bomb, and document street scenes and some of the few remaining buildings, such as the train station. There are also several pictures of the Isahaya airfield, including a number of Japanese airplanes.
After Nagasaki, Catrow moved to Kumamoto, where he was assigned to a Military Police company. His photos include pictures of Japanese soldiers still in uniform, numerous images of post-war life in Japan and military life at the barracks and in town for the American occupation forces, and well as a number shots of military duties and activities. During this time, Catrow apparently provided photos for the local newspaper, the Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimsun; five newspapers containing his work are tipped into the rear of this album, which also contains a picture of Catrow in front of the newspaper office. A translation of one of the articles states that, "Catro-San... keeps a sharp eye on the city as he patrols on his jeep, but he casts another 'cultural eye' on what happens around him." After a weekend leave at Mt. Aso, which is documented in twelve photographs, Catrow left Kumamoto for Sasebo, where he was due to embark for the United States. The images there concentrate on the harbor and several Japanese and American vessels. The rest of the album is devoted to the voyage home to San Diego, including an organized wrestling match and the celebration of Christmas aboard the ship. Catrow's arrival in California is well documented, and the final images of the album are at Camp Pendleton, where he stayed while awaiting his discharge. Laid-in at the back of the album were newspaper clippings and one magazine clipping, dating between 1967 and 1972 and undated, on topics related to Saipan, all presumably added by Catrow. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts.
The records of the documentary project "Indivisible: Stories of American Community" span the dates 1988-2002, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1999 to 2002, the primary timeframe for the project. Through documentary photographs and oral histories, project records, videos, and other materials, the collection documents the social conditions in twelve American communities as well as the history of the project, which explored civil activism, struggle, and change in the following locations: the North Pacific Coast of Alaska; Ithaca, N.Y.; San Francisco, California; Navajo Nation, Arizona and New Mexico; Eau Claire, South Carolina; Delray Beach, Florida; Western North Carolina; Stony Brook, N.Y.; San Juan, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Yaak Valley, Montana. Each project is fully described in its entry in this collection guide. The project co-directors were Tom Rankin of the Center for Documentary Studies and Trudy Wilner Stack of the Center for Creative Photography. The project was also supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the NEA, and other agencies.
The photographs in this collection, most of which formed part of a traveling exhibit, were taken chiefly during 1999 by twelve well-known documentary and landscape photographers working in partnership with project oral history interviewers. The photographers are Dawoud Bey, Bill Burke, Debbie Fleming Caffery, Lucy Capehart, Lynn Davis, Terry Evans, Lauren Greenfield, Joan Liftin, Reagan Louie, Danny Lyon, Sylvia Plachy, and Eli Reed. Their images capture the experiences of individuals participating in grassroots initiatives addressing American social issues such as housing, immigration (in particular, Haitians in Florida), the natural environment, race relations, youth empowerment, and economic and cultural development, and others.
Also preserved in this collection are detailed oral histories recorded in each community, with audio recordings and transcriptions; information on the traveling exhibit; and materials on other project outcomes, including a hardbound large-format book of the images, a postcard exhibit, a guide for educators, booklets and other publications on community organizing, and radio and television programs. Other files document the establishment of research archives based on the documentary project's output, at Duke, in Arizona, and in each of the twelve communities.
The collection is arranged into three series: Audiovisual Resources, Photographs, and Project Files. Audiovisual Resources houses the interview tapes as well as other media associated with the project; Photographs includes photographic prints, most of which accompanied the project book and exhibition; Project Files houses the interview records as well as tape lists, logs, and transcripts in both paper and digital formats. Additional supporting materials found in the Project Files Series include postcards and videocassette tapes from exhibits; a CD-ROM of the 2001 website; field notes in paper and digital format; and other office files generated by the project and its staff, including Tom Rankin, one of the project co-directors.
Acquired as part of the Archives for Documentary Arts at Duke University.

Transcript available. Telephone interview. Nonviolence is the way to survive the future. Human beings are violent, either by running, hiding or participating in it. Violence has never changed anything, it makes realignments of power and authority. Culture we grow up in says you step to me, I'll step to you. Culture of the human race. Incarceration of people, majority in prison for drugs. No voices were there to speak about nonviolence after the movement. Post Civil Rights era: discussion of non violence never center of the discussion was used as a means for the movement. There's no values training, The philosophically committed to nonviolence still exist but they don't organize in the communities. The Rev Lawson type of people have always existed, their tools became relevant because of the mission of civil rights, the mission got consumed by reform politics, e.i: voting rights, immigration, etc. When the generation fulfilled it's limited mission, it ended. A nonviolent movement against violence (Of all sorts/across the board), you have to have a conversation about violence itself, sort of like groups like the quakers, Jim Lawson (Bernard lafayatte who was a student of Lawson), Thoreau. No one wants to hear about violence as a concept, we deal with it more as an issue for example, "domestic violence", get boys to stop being on girls.

The photographs of Cedric N. Chatterley span the years 1983-2013, and were created throughout his career as a documentary photographer, beginning with his Master in Fine Arts thesis project, Ambivalent Ecstasies/Converging Energies, on American religious experience. The photographs are primarily black-and-white gelatin silver prints ranging in size from 8x10 to 18x24 inches.
The most prominent themes in Chatterley's work are labor, community, and religious expression. He has photographed chicken slaughterhouse workers in Maine; Cambodian immigrants in North Carolina, a project undertaken with Barbara Lau of the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University; David "Honeyboy" Edwards and other Southern blues musicians in Mississippi and on tour; a substance abusers' rehabilitation community in Durham, N.C., also with Barbara Lau; tornado survivors in South Dakota who rebuilt their town over a period of ten years; Holy Land USA, an abandoned religious theme park in Connecticut; and a woman sheep rancher's work during lambing season in Montana. Some of the images were taken with Chatterley's hand-built cameras.
A final series consists of materials relating to Barbara Lau's book, From Cambodia to Greensboro, documenting Cambodian immigrants in North Carolina, that includes images taken by Chatterley, and a set of recorded interviews from 2008 in which Chatterley speaks about his career as a documentary photographer. The cassettes have been converted to digital files and use copies are available for access. Original recordings are closed to use.
Series are arranged in chronological order; prints are numbered and captioned by the photographer.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.

Consists of 91 11x14 inch and 10 16x20 inch gelatin silver prints. On February 24, 1988, Penobscot Poultry in Belfast, Maine closed down. Chatterley documented the final days of the last chicken processing plant in the state and followed former employee Linda Lord as she sought new employment afterwards. The plant became the subject of the book, I Was Content and Not Content: The Story of Linda Lord and the Closing of Penobscot Poultry by Alicia J. Rouverol and Stephen A. Cole, with Chatterley contributing the photographs. Original captions, with Chatterley's contextual side comments, were taken from back of prints. Arranged chronologically.

Arranged chronologically.
This large body of work consists of images documenting the aftermath of a powerful tornado that caused the nearly total destruction of Spencer, South Dakota (McCook County) by a tornado on May 30, 1998, as well as the subsequent rebuilding of the town, and the tenth anniversary of the tornado. The photographer, Cedric Chatterly, is a resident of South Dakota. Original captions are taken from back of prints. The 268 gelatin silver prints are arranged in original order as received, with some gaps in numbering present.
This is one of the very first photographs I made when I arrived a half a mile north of Spencer on May 31, 1998. People were gethering on the corner of South Dakota Highway 38 and County Road 431. A state police barricade would stop many people from entering, including residents. I entered easier than most with my Press Pass. Governor Bill Janklow was there giving the "go ahead" to anybody wanting to board the bus.
F-4 tornado hit the town around 8:30 pm, May 30, 1998.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
A kid on a four-wheeler wanted to show Chatterley where a circular saw blade had stuck itself into a tree. This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
Cliff had lived in this house for six months and had considered buying it from the Webbs. The mud on the walls of the house was caused by the water tower falling to the ground during the tornado.
Among those present are Governor Bill Janklow, Senator Tom Daschle, Senator Tim Johnson, FEMA Director James Lee Witt, and Vice President Al Gore.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
Governor Bill Janklow asked for 500 volunteers through media outlets just days prior to this event. A F-4 tornado came through Spencer around 8:30 on May 30, 1998, destroying nearly 75% of a town with 325 people. Only six people were killed.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.

This was the day (ironically) that we rounded up the last of the cattle on Webb's farm, putting an end to three generations of having cattle on this land. The dead calf was close by and the mother cow was nearly dead at the time of this shooting. It was 15 degrees and windy.
This print was made from three negatives printed consecutively.
Her calf is twelve feet away (left). Complications arose the night before while giving birth in the north pasture. Ironically, this was the day Lloyd and I rounded up the remaining cattle for market, leaving the Webb's land free of beef -- only about twenty horses remained. Valentine's Day, February 14, 2000. McCook County, South Dakota.
They were among the 25 or 30 that remained on Lloyd and Nancy Webb's farm, thus ending the bovine legacy that began with her father. Nancy refused to help because she was too emotional about this event.
Lloyd will buy a 1952 Chevy later in the year. He had a 1953 Chevy heavily damaged in the tornado and regrettably let Bernie Opland crush it and haul it off.
This was pertaining to his contractor abandoning the Stone's home construction in Spencer and leaving them $35,000 in debt. A court settlement was finally reached but the Stones filed for bankruptcy a few years later.
This building had once been the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and it was connected to several motor lodges. Dave bought their home in Spencer around 1990.
Richard had been living with friends or relatives and coming and ging from Spencer. He is now 17 and thinking of leaving school.
One box was for him and Nancy and the other was for their daughter Jenna. The mail carrier could not come down this road unless there was more than one mailbox, although Jenna only lived part-time at the farm.
This had been the location of St. Mary's Catholic Church, which was destroyed by the May 30 tornado.
Bridgette looks on. They are in the north pasture about 1/4 mile from their farmhouse. Nancy's grandfather homesteaded this acreage.
The church was rebuilt during the years that followed the tornado. The woman in the right image is holding an Argus Leader newsprint, published the day after the May 30 tornado.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
The youth minister at this church would let kids come and go and Richard was basically a runaway at this time.
Richard has returned home after being away for several weeks living on the streets and staying with friends in Mitchell, South Dakota.
Jessica is nearly 9 months pregnant with her first born Kaitlyn Ann.
This is directly in front of the closed motor lodge rooms on the commercial property they are making into a home. Dave is planning to start a herb and vegetable business called "Asphalt Gardens."
There were several birthdays in the Webb/Tilotson clan celebrated that day (Suzy, Jenna, and Myrta).
Steve is Nancy Webb's brother.
Steve is Nancy Webb's brother and the boyfriend of Maggie, Tim's mother.
Nixon got his name because he was born in a milkhouse. At first, he was called Milkhouse, which quickly turned to Millhouse, which quickly turned into Richard Nixon. I ran over Richard Nixon when the dog came running out to greet me at Lloyd's birthday party in late March 1999. Lloyd and I took him to the vet in Salem, got him fixed up and returned to the farm to finish the party. They made a pen in the house to keep Richard Nixon from running.
The gift was for Myrta, Nancy's sister. Mama cat is in the bottom center.
He is staying part-time with his cousin in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Richard is currently living with his aunt, Danny's sister, in Baltic, South Dakota.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
The hogsed planter belonged to Dave and Mary Twedt. Ironically, this was before I met them. Weeks later, after meeting them, I went with them to McCook Central High School to retrieve items. They gave me the planter and I ended up giving it to my sister, Jolea.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
Inmates from the South Dakota Department of Corrections were bussed out there every day to help with the clean-up.
The chruch was destroyed by a tornado on May 30, 1998. This was the last service before a complete razing took place, preparing the way for a new chapel to be built. South Dakota Department of Corrections inmates gather. They had been instrumental in helping clean up efforts from the very beginning a week earlier.
He and his wife were not home at the time. Their house was built in the 1980s.
(Henry operating equipment nearby did not allow me to hear the timer on my camera, thus causing the awkward moment.)
Nancy was the only person I knew who stood and witnessed their home being razed. I introduced myself shortly after making this image.
Donated items streamed in for days following the May 30, 1998 tornado. Most of the items were not taken.
The pile of rubble in the distance is one of two such heaps, increasing by the day. Near the end of June, both piles will be set on fire.
His truck was loaded with cars he had crushed after the Spencer tornado.
Opland and I were leaving the crushed cars at a recycling yard in Sioux City, Iowa. Bernie lived near Baltic, South Dakota.
Bernie crushed these cars in Spencer following the May 30, 1998 tornado. This load was one of several loads.
The dog is fake.
The books on the left were being sold by Salvation Army Volunteers. The display board on the right listed all the families and home sites affected by the May 30th tornado. Urban planners from Sioux Falls had suggested that those who rebuild in Spencer try and do so by possibly trading their property and building closer together. Believing that not everybody in Spencer would rebuild, they wanted to avoid large gaps between homes. The idea was roundly rejected by those who planned to stay.
This was the very last image I made with the original Ilford HP5 from the 100 foot bulk rolls.
The six brothers and sisters are in reference to the six deaths during the tornado in Spencer on May 30, 1998.
I would park at the corner of South Dakota Highway 38 and County Rd 431 and work or hitchhike into Spencer during the first 10 days or so following the May 30th tornado. I did not know at the time that Dave and Mary Twedt owned this property, having only met them briefly a few days after the tornado destroyed their home in Spencer. The driver is an unidentified Spencer resident with a truckload of furniture salvaged during the thunderstorm.
Inmates will launder and fold the clothing and it will be offered to Spencer residents in July.
This was the West pit.
The pile was at the southeast edge of town and made from the top of the grain elevator.
This image was made with a telephoto lens.
Donated items streamed in for days following the F-4 tornado that hit Spencer 10 miles west. Most items were not used and they were eventually sent to various organizations like the Slavation Army.
After having their home in Spencer destroyed by a F-4 tornado, they have decided to rebuild their commercial property into a home 1/2 mile south of town. This was once the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge. Legend has it that an artist traveling through sometime in the 1950s painted the scenic mural on the wall in exchange for several days stay in the adjoining motel. I tried to talk Dave into letting the mural remain in what would become their living room. Consideration was given but the mural fell to the Twedts' hammers the following week. Over the month of July, the Twedts and I filled several dumpster loads in the gutting process of this property.
Dave is watchful of gathering storm clouds.
The Twedts and I used to take a daily cruise through town as a way to take a break from working on their home. Dave called these little rides into town as "dress codes" or "inspecting the dress code" out of a tongue-in-cheek poke at the recent building code enforcements that followed the tornado. Dave was very vocal about the local politics.
They had been cruising around Spencer one day in mid-July and saw it laying near the monument that had been placed to remember the Spencer School.
The Twedts are rebuilding what once was the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge. Dave bought this property less than one mile south of Spencer in 1986, several years before they bought a home in Spencer Proper.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
The Twedts and I were on our way to burn trash at the end of the property. Mary is looking north towards Spencer.
5 days after a F-4 tornado destroyed 75% of the town organized volunteers then cleaned recovered items and set them on tables in the McCook County High School gym. The clothes that had been recovered were taken to the Springfield State Prison near Yankton where they were laundered in 200 pound capacity machines. Other items were cleaned and sorted by local organizations. I saw several people, including Dave and Mary, pick up and examine items that had been theirs prior to the tornado, then return them to the table. Dave said, "Some things are better left alone..." Upon walking into the gym for the first time, Nancy Webb said, "This is worse than the tornado." Many folks stood over the tables that had been covered with photographs from a period of at least 100 years and wept openly. It was the most powerful photo exhibit I had ever witnessed.
Mary is wrapped in a quilt made by her grandmother. The Twedts and I were in the McCook Central High School gym where all the items recovered after the tornado by volunteers had been set out. There were 7-8 tables of nothing but photographs. The quilt and these photographs were among the many items that filled the gymnasium.
Clothing and objects that had been picked up by volunteers after the tornado were stacked on tables for Spencer residents. Over 5,000 volunteers combed Spencer on June 5, filling plastic bags with clothing, kitchen appliances, utensils, and many personal items. More than 7 tables were completely covered with carefully cleaned photographs. Mary is holding a quilt made by her grandmother.
There were 7 tables of photographs laid edge to edge.
This print was made from two negatives printed consecutively.
The Twedts had been without running water for 45 days following the tornado. The Twedts are now rebuilding commercial property into a home. The property was once the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge with several hotel rooms. Dave Twedt bought this property in 1986, several years before they bought their home in Spencer about 1/2 mile to the north. The Twedts and I filled the dumpster (right) more than 3 times with material during the "gutting" process. The Twedts lived in the camper trailer for 6 months while working on their home.
Kallie's father, Ed Rogers, dressed in white. Delphia's new home was built by South Dakota State Penitentiary inmates on site at the Springfield prison yard near Yankton. The interior is 768 sq ft, two bedrooms, one bath. Applicants must be 62 or older, or 18 with disability. The cost was $19,400, including delivery. Five of these homes were purchased in 1998/99 by families displaced by the tornado, three of which were placed in Spencer. Although Kallie and her parents moved to Michigan, Delphia said later, "Kallie is fifth generation Spencer."
The Webb's house in Spencer proper was destroyed after receiving heavy tornado damage on May 30, 1998. They decided to use the insurance money to rebuild the farmhouse.

She and Dave passing the vacant lot where their house had been just a few months earlier in Spencer, South Dakota.
They are rebuilding commercial property to make their home about 1/2 mile south of Spencer, South Dakota. (Their home in Spencer was destroyed 5-30-98). This property was once "The Golden Pheasant", a restaurant/bar connected to several small hotel rooms.
She let him and Kara and Brandon (4 mo.) stay in the mobile home in Salem, South Dakota, while the Stones had their new home begin construction in Spencer.
Danny was the main canvas worker at Spencer Canvas in Mitchell.
Officiating is the Reverend Ward Satterly of Spencer, South Dakota. He lost his wife in the May 30th tornado. She ran upstairs to try and save their dog as the tornado approached. The dog survived, but she perished... Kara's twin sister, Sara, pictured at right (Maid of honor).
He was only one month old when the tornado hit. His mother, Kara Arends, hovered over him in the basement and looked up to see the house beginning to life off the foundation. Minutes later, the entire house was gone.
Lloyd Webb, left, and Nancy Webb holding Alexa Roth, the daughter of Vicki and Tony Roth... Vicky was a foster child who lived with the Webbs for many years.
While Nancy's parents were still living in the farmhouse, a small fire broke out. The smoke from the fire blackened the wall, leaving ghost images from ceramic birds that had been hung. Her parents left the farmhouse not long after the incident.
Lloyd, Nancy and Suzy lived in the camper trailer for several months, during construction.
The image on the left is a new downstairs bathroom/shower under construction. The image on the right is from an upstairs bedroom. The bookcase still holds books and toys from when Nancy, Myrta and Steve were children.
He was basically a runaway at this point, staying with friends, cutting school.
(He did a page spread on the Twedts for the June, 1998 issue, visiting them just days after the tornado hit.)
The intersection of South Dakota Highway 38 and County Road 431.
The hardwood flooring pieces were purchased at an auction that had featured many salvaged items from the closed Spencer School (several years prior).
A group of people from their church came to help do clean-up around the property.
This dinner was sponsored by local businesses a few days before Thanksgiving Day, 1998.
The home builder he hired abandoned the project completely the month before, leaving the Stones with more than $35,000 debt. In other words, essentially taking $35,000 from their pockets.
The Stone's original contractor abandoned him, leaving them with about $35,000 debt. Danny had to finish the house himself.
The builder he hired abandoned the job, leaving the Stones with more than $30,000 debt.
He taught me how to operate the backhoe and I got pretty good at it. However, two weeks later I accidently pulled up and severed the main power lines that had recently been buried (near the center of this image). I was digging a phone line and the hired electrician was the only other person there at the time. He said folks get killed doing that sort of thing. When Nancy came home later, I admitted my mistake. She laughed and said, "Don't worry about it! Lloyd does that sort of thing all the time." I held a flashlight late into the night while the electrician repaired it.
It eventually read: THE BIBLE SAYS ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE SARIN SAYS BE BROKE, BE HUMILIATED, BEG, AND MAYBE WE'LL HELP WITH DONATED MONEY. SARIN (Spencer Area Recovery and Interfaith Network) was a faith-based organization headed by the Rev. Mark Dickson, pastor of the Sun Prairie Baptist Church near Salem, South Dakota. Nearly 1 million dollars was collected in donations and SARIN was responsible for distributing the funds--which they did mainly to those who were under (or not) insured. The Twedts felt this was unfair. Dave made this sign in December, 1998 and it was stolen from his property on Christmas Eve, 1998.
They are living in the garage area of the commercial property currently under re-construction. The "home" part of the building process will not be ready for several more weeks. They were nearly to their wit's end.
She and Dave are living in the garage area of the commercial property they are remaking into a home. The "home" part of the building is under construction. Here, they were surrounded by tools Dave used to rebuild cars. The sheet makes me think of a tornado.
In front of his and Mary's home on the corner of South Dakota Highway 38 and County Road 431.
Because the Twedts were well insured, like many others, SARIN helped those who were not insured--from the very beginning. Dave felt the money should have been distributed evenly. His sign was stolen on Christmas Eve, 1998. Two negatives printed consecutively.
She has loaned out the use of the mobile home to Danny, Kara and their toddler, Brandon, and Richard while their new home in Spencer is under construction ten miles away.

Lloyd was pulling ticks off Powder (the white dog) and Issac was smashing them. Richard Nixon, Nancy's dog, watches.
Five years to the day when a F-4 tornado destroyed most of Spencer, South Dakota (about 1/2 mile north of this location). Winds to 50 mph were reported in Sioux Falls on the day this photograph was made.
Katie's 4th birthday. In Al and Doris Westerman's backyard.
We are at Al and Doris Westerman's in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Westermans are Mary Twedt's parents, making them Peanut's great-grandparents. Mary is left, with Paityn over her shoulder.
Six years to the day from the Spencer tornado.
We were celebrating Peanut's 5th birthday (July 19). This was the same year Jessica divorced Kaitlyn's father, Jayson Fredricks.
Jessica is the only child of Dave and Mary Twedt.
Jessica and Tony Byre were married earlier that day in Brandon, South Dakota.
Dave and Mary were in the process of rebuilding a part of their roof that had been blown off the year before (Spencer can be seen in the distance).
Katy is looking out the window of what was once their grandfather's bedroom (Dave Twedt). Katy's 6th birthday.
The Reverend's wife was one of six deaths during the May 30, 1998 tornado... He married Kara and Danny Stone in September, 1998... A sign on the Parish Center's door advertised free lots to those who would build in Spencer.
The local firemen are competing with one another to see who can spray the barrel to the opposite end of the suspended rope.

Hillbilly golf is a game played with two golf balls attached by a string of 18 inch rope. Each player has a set of three, and they toss them one at a time to one of two "gates" set about 20 feet apart. When a flopping string of golf balls catches a rung and stays on or wraps itself around, points are awarded: 3 points for the top, 2 for the middle, 1 for the bottom. The player who gets 21 points first wins.
The pool had been part of the Golden Pheasant Restaurant and Lounge. The building Dave and Mary made into a home following the Spencer tornado on May 30, 1998. Image made with a handbuilt 8x10 camera, fitted with a 100 year old lens.
Mary has been hosting Home and Garden Parties in private homes, school fundraisers, etc, for a second income. 5x7 contact print from handmade, handheld camera.
His Junior League football team from Salem, South Dakota had just played their first competitive game of the season. The opposing, more experienced team won... Four years earlier, Brandon, his mother, Kara and his two younger sisters, Rebecca and Tiffany, were involved in a rollover accident about a mile from Spencer. He kicked out the window of the minivan and ran a 1/4 mile in stocking feet through the snow and ice to get help, essentially saving her life.
(Daughter, mother, Virgin Mary.)
Her father, Lloyd Webb, is in the doorway. (Suzy was adopted by the Webb's when she was a child. Lloyd and Nancy had several foster children come and go from their home. Jenna--not pictured--was their only biological child.)
We were taking a break between Suzy Webb's wedding and the reception to be held later that evening. This is the first time Nancy had seen Lloyd in two and a half years.
I had not seen Lloyd in nearly four years--about the time he and Nancy divorced. When this image was made, he was living in Sheldon, Iowa, an hour and a half from Sioux Falls and working in an ethanol plant. I once thought of him as my closest friend in South Dakota... Many people thought the tornado had hardly fazed Lloyd, and they were probably correct. But nobody in his family called and asked how he was in the weeks that followed the storm... This image was made the day Suzy Webb married her high school boyfriend, Mike... Lloyd had not been out to the farm in nearly three years. It was hard to know what he was thinking.
Later that evening they will attend Suzy and Mike's wedding reception in Salem, ten miles east. Nancy's grandfather, Tillotson, homesteaded this land shortly before South Dakota became a state in 1889.
We were in the stairwell landing of the farmhouse, about an hour after Suzy Webb's wedding.

The kids Chatterley knows are Rebecca Stone (far left), Paityn Fredricks (fourth from left), Kaitlyn Fredricks (eighth from left), Breyton Fredricks (next to Kaitlyn, front). Chad Mentle is the coach (wearing sunglasses). This image was shot at Spencer's ballfield is in the Northeast part of town.
This photograph was made with Chatterley's hand-made camera fitted with a 100 mm lens removed from a plastic camera.
The home in the center of the photograph belongs to Cookie Mentle. Her son Troy once owned the car in the driveway. Troy, Richard Stone, and another boy were fishing during the day of the May 30, 1998 tornado. They were in Troy's garage cleaning fish when Troy saw the tornado coming into town. He managed to get himself, Richard and the other boy into a storm cellar just seconds before the tornado passed over them. Richard Stone credits Troy for saving his life. Troy died the following Halloween weekend from liver failure due to excessive drinking. He was living an apartment in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I spoke to him on the phone just a few days before. His name is present on the tornado memorial in town along with the six others who passed on May 30, 1998. The Stones' house is in the distance to the left.
This is one of two large trenches dug to accept the tornado damaged town following the May 30, 1998 tornado, June 1998

The photographer's own niece was also helping out at the time the series was shot. Pachy Burns passed away some years later. After her death, Chatterley visited her daughters, Bluesette Campbell and Piney Hardiman, and their father, in Red Lodge and Scotch Coulee, Montana, in 2013; there he took six more photographs, and recorded oral histories concerning Pachy Burns, her family, and her life as a rancher.

The collection of film advertisements and transcripts of Chinese documentary films and newsreels spans the years 1946 to 1985, although the bulk of the items in the collection are transcripts for the documentary films and newsreels from the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976. It should also be noted that the dating of the 1946 item is questionable. All documents in the collection are in Chinese. The collection is arranged into the following series: Advertisements and Film Description Series, 1953-1966 and undated; Documentary and Newsreel Scripts Series, 1946 (?)-1985 and undated; Feature Filmscripts Series, undated; and Newspaper Clipping Scrapbook Series, 1950-1959 and undated. Topics include industry, agriculture, the economy, military matters, education, public health care, medicine and science, as well as political movements, foreign relations, cultural and sporting events. Most of the documentary filmscripts are short, focusing on a specific subject or event, whereas newsreel scripts are numbered sequentially within each year and cover multiple topics or events. During the Cultural Revolution, documentary films and newsreels were powerful and popular propaganda tools for patriotism, nationalism, Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and socialist construction, and served political purposes.
In this collection, there is also a group of printed advertisements and other publicity for Chinese and foreign films, plays, opera, and local performances. This collection is valuable for studies of contemporary Chinese culture, the Cultural Revolution, history and politics, communist propaganda, and mass media.
Parts of this collection have been digitized and are available to the Duke University Community in the following database: Chinese Film and Newsreel Scripts from the Cultural Revolution Online
A separate searchable index is available at: Film title index of Chinese filmscript and advertisement collection
The collection was microfilmed for broader access in 2006, and the original master copies of the microfilm are in the final box of the collection.

Also includes some posters, performance schedules and programs for films, plays, opera, local performances, etc. Some of these have illustrations and screen shots. Arranged by title, then chronologically.

Transcripts and shot lists for newsreels and documentary films. These focus on specific subjects, events or personal stories. Scripts in boxes 2 and 3 are arranged by subject, then chronologically within each subject. The date on the earliest item in box 3 is questionable. There are also a few special issues. For example, a special issue in February 1966 is entitled: Chairman Mao's Good Student- Jiao Yulu. Scripts for Xin Wen Jian Bao in box 4 are arranged by number and year.

The collection consists of approximately 280 zine titles (some with multiple issues) collected by Cohen and several hundred pieces of correspondence addressed to her during the 1990s. The collection is arranged into two series: Zines and Correspondence. The zines have been divided into sub-series based on editorship by women, men, or both, and within each sub-series, alphabetized by title. The zines primarily focus on popular culture, opinion pieces, and music. Letters in the Correspondence Series are mostly addressed to "Lara" and "Runt," Cohen's zine, with standard mailing envelopes and self-made envelopes using re-purposed materials. The correspondence is arranged chronologically. Along with letters, the series includes postcards, greeting cards, flyers, photographs, and pamphlets. Most of the correspondence includes requests for zines or personal notes to Lara.
Acquired by the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture.
The zines have been divided into sub-series based on editorship by women or men; zines are filed under women if they are co-edited and at least one editor is a woman. Within each sub-series, zines are alphabetized by title. Each folder contains an individual title with a range of issues included if known.
Correspondence is arranged by month and year ranging between 1992-1996. Most material remains in its original envelope to preserve its context and original order. Items with no discernible "month" are foldered at the end of each year. Undated items are foldered at the end of the series. Series includes letters addressed to Lara Cohen or "Runt," her zine, as well as greeting cards, postcards, and photographs. There is also one folder of miscellaneous materials.

The Sabina Allred Allen Collection of Carl Corley papers consists of love letters written from Corley to Sabina during World War II, as well as artwork that Corley produced for Sabina during the war. The artwork accompanied Corley's letters but was separated from them prior to arriving at Duke. The letters frequently state how much Corley misses and loves Sabina, as well as their plans for engagement, marriage, and living together after the war. Many of the letters and envelopes were lightly annotated by Sabina, and some of the envelopes did not have any contents.
This colelction also includes correspondence from Corley to Sabina dated 1999 through 2002, during which time Corley was working on an illustrated autobiography. It seems that Corley reconnected with Sabina because he needed her help reconstructing parts of his story. These letters contain requests for images and artwork, and they also discuss Corley's life, his dog, politics, diets, and the health of family members. Many of the letters from this later time period contain racist diatribes against Black Americans, as well as offensive language and stereotypes. Like the World War II-era material, these envelopes were annotated by Sabina.
Also included in this collection is a small amount of correspondence from Corley to Sabina's parents, from Corley's mother to Sabina, and from Sabina to Corley.

Exchanges reflect professional relationships Davidson maintained with colleagues in the United States, Italy, England, Japan, and other countries.

Tolbert, President and the Press Exhibit (1956), Gold Coast Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah Visits Liberia (1953), Progress Through Cooperation (1957), home movie Coketails for Dorothy, Monrovia Children's Birthday Party (1956), and Night Village Dancing in Liberia (1956).
This series consists chiefly of contact sheets created by Davis from his nitrate and safety film negatives, also found in this collection. The original negative numbers are marked next to each image on the contact sheet, and in a few cases, there are captions.
Not all of the 342 negatives in the collection are represented on these contact sheets; however, all of the negatives have been digitally scanned and are available to view through the Scanned Negatives series in this collection guide.
A few gelatin silver prints are included in the contact sheet folders, left as they were originally filed.
This album was created with photographs by Griff Davis to promote a partnership between the government of Liberia and Liberia Mining Company. It contains 20 black-and-white prints, measuring approximately 10 1/4 x 12 1/4 inches, and each print includes a typed caption.
The 342 original safety and nitrate cellulose film negatives in this collection were taken by photojournalist Griff Davis for use in three publication projects. They are almost all black-and-white.
Almost a third of the images, 108 negatives, derive from a photo-essay in Ebony magazine on African American author and New York resident Langston Hughes. Another 124 images document African American student life at the Palmer Memorial Institute preparatory school in Sedalia, N.C., also published in Ebony. Finally, 110 images document African American artists and mural painters Hale Woodruff and Charles Alston at work in their studio on a mural for the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. There are also a dozen color photographs of Alston's modernist paintings and a sculpture.
All of the negatives were digitally scanned for preservation purposes by library staff; the digital files are viewable through links in this collection guide, or through the Duke University Libraries Digital Collections website.
The Palmer Memorial Institute (PMI) was an African American preparatory school for junior and senior students, and was attended by more than 1,000 students from 1902 until it closed in 1971. In 1946 and 1947, Griff Davis visited the school, documenting daily student life at PMI for a 1947 photo-essay in Ebony magazine. A copy of this article is in the Photographs and Papers series.
The images show students in class and enjoying extra-curricular programs and recreation; school administrators, including President and founder Charlotte Hawkins Brown; and teachers.
Positive scans of the negative images are available for viewing through the links with each entry.

The images in this group, in safety film negative format, were taken by photojournalist Griff Davis in the late 1940s to document African American artists Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff as they worked in their New York City studio on a mural project for the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company. The giant mural was commissioned by the Los Angeles-based African American-owned company to illustrate the historic role of African Americans in the settling of California. These studio photos feature the artists at work; other people - unidentified sitters and casual visitors - also appear in the photographs. There are also a handful of color images of some of Charles Alston's modernist paintings and one sculpture.

Includes a map of France with the front outlined, along with the Delannoy ration cards for sugar and gasoline, safe-passage documents for Paul and Jeanne (one set contains their black-and-white photographs), and insurance papers they signed recognizing the risk of war in areas they traveled. Three pieces of French paper money are attached to one page. The final page contains an undated poster from the Paris Chamber of Commerce regarding war loans.

The collection chiefly documents DeLapp's long-term involvement with the North Carolina Republican Party at the state and local level. While correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection, there are also some legal and financial papers, writings and speeches, printed material, and clippings. Being Chair of the North Carolina Republican Party (1942-1950) and legal counsel to the party (1950-1964), provided DeLapp access to state party leaders, which is reflected by the correspondents that include J. E. Broyhill, Wilmer D. Mizell, William E. Cobb, and Jesse Helms.
Included is information concerning political appointments, canvassing and registering voters, political campaigns, and political speeches (some made by DeLapp). DeLapp's efforts to promote Republican presidential candidates is highlighted in 1952 when he served as North Carolina State Chairman of Dwight D. Eisenhower's campaign. The earliest corespondence primarily relates to Delapp's father, Alexander T. Lapp, who was sheriff of Davidson County, N.C., from 1906-1912 and 1916-1918. Also represented are DeLapp's responsibilities with the Evangelical and Reformed Church (later the United Church of Christ); information about the DeLapp family and DeLapp's published work, People, Politics, Religion; and concern about the Duke University administration during the 1960s and early 1970s.
Collection contains editorial files of the Democratic Digest, dating from 1953-1961, with the contents of the files falling into three large categories: correspondence, editorial, and art files. The correspondence files, arranged in alphabetical order, include telegrams and memoranda between the Democratic Digest staff, the Democratic National Committee and other organizations, and many letters from readers, critics, and Democratic Senators and Governors, chiefly responding to political issues of the day, such as McCarthyism, scandals and corruption, civil rights, the American economy, labor, farm subsidies, nuclear weapons, war, and elections, and offering criticism on the content of the publication. There is also some personal correspondence.
Voluminous editorial files contain nearly complete content for issues, and are filed in publication order by month and year, 1955-1961. The files enclose copy for articles and columns, with many corrections and layout notes; condensed versions of TV and radio addresses, including speeches by Democratic candidates; and many clippings from original articles reprinted in the Digest, attached to the magazine's own copy. Some of this material is brittle and fragile.
About a third of the collection consists of hundreds of pieces of original layout art, printers proofs of covers, and political cartoons, and a handful of photographs of Democratic leaders of the time such as Truman, Stevenson, and Johnson (Box 25). For an unknown reason, there is also a portrait of Durham native and Duke alumnus and benefactor William Washington Flowers. A few complete copies of the Digest are sometimes included in the artwork files next to associated cover art. There are many examples of production artists' layout materials that include original art and sketches, and paste-ups on boards with directions for layout. The original art for the cover cartoons by noted illustrator Leo Hershfield is rendered in vivid watercolors. The artwork and layouts are loosely arranged in chronological order.
Finally, a smaller group of printed materials deriving from the Democratic 1960 national campaign includes political leaflets, pamphlets, party platforms and position papers, a newsprint publication examining of the records of Nixon and Kennedy, and a few other items.

A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and Christopher G. Karagheuzoff took on the cases of Bahraini detainees pro bono in 2004. The records in this collection document the lawyers' legal motions, public campaigns and diplomatic negotiations for writ of habeas corpus and the release and repatriation of the Bahraini detainees, as well the surrounding issues of the Bush administration's responses to terrorism, the civil rights of prisoners of war, and the use of interrogation and torture at U.S. installations.

The Case Files Series (nine boxes of the thirteen in the collection) comprises petitions, filings, documents relating to the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CRST), and a wide variety of legal records regarding the six Bahrainis' and other concurrent Guant√°namo detainee cases. The Correspondence Series includes exchanges between client detainees, Department of Justice officials, Bahraini diplomats and officials, U.S. senators and congressmen, law scholars, and colleagues of the Dorsey & Whitney team representing the Guant√°namo detainees.

The high-profile case of Jumah Al-Dossari, detained in 2001 and eventually released without facing any charges in 2007, is covered in depth in this series, becoming an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guant√°namo Naval Base and detrimental consequences of long term solitary confinement. Also covered in depth in the Correspondence Series is the Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment approved by the Senate on November, 15 2005, which prohibits all habeas corpus claims by Guant√°namo detainees and allows military tribunals to rely on evidence gathered by the use of torture. The Publicity Series brings together news articles regarding Bahraini Guant√°namo detainees, commentaries addressing the legal process and human rights issues, and interviews with Dorsey & Whitney lawyers about the conditions at the military base and the legal and living situation of the detainees. The clippings in the collection were published by major news press and online media outlets worldwide, and include seven folders which hold many Arabic language news clippings. Many of the legal team's documents are also present in the form of electronic documents which are organized into folders described in the Digital Files Series.

Collection comprises a diary (124 pgs.) maintained by an unidentified woman who was educated, knowledgeable about sailing, and quite religious, during her voyages and travels around the northern coast of Scotland to cities in Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, France, and Spain. The diary began with a business trip, when she accompanied her husband (who was likely captain of the unnamed ship), from Workington, Eng., to Horten, Norway, in order to deliver a cargo of rails to the Norwegian government. The rest of the travel was apparently for pleasure. The author described ocean and weather conditions, with emphasis on dangers for ships; lighthouses; shipwrecks; landscapes; architecture; historic sites and ruins; castles; cathedrals and churches; palaces; paintings, sculptures, and artists; bridges and engineers; and gardens. She also commented on the inhabitants of and various practices in individual European countries, often in comparison to England, and with a particular focus on the women in each country. She made occasional literary references. More often she interwove her Evangelical beliefs into her descriptions, with references to the resurrection of the dead, comments on Protestant denominations, and strongly worded anti-Catholic sentiments. Includes visits to William Thorburn, who was then British Consul to Sweden; Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady; Waterloo battlefield; the Norman Cathedral at Durham; and the Castle site at Newcastle.
This collection has been arranged into nine series, most of which reflect the life and work of J. Claude Evans. One series, the Maxilla Evans Materials series, relates exclusively to Maxilla Evans' interests in birding, bird breeding, and horticulture, and also includes some of her writings, correspondence, family history, and other collected materials.
One of the largest series relating to J. Claude Evans is the Sermons series, with sermons arranged alphabetically by title. Files in this series reflect Evans' own arrangement of his papers, which typically include sermon copies with annotations punctuating his delivery and emphasis, notes and research about the subject, lists of when the sermon was preached and at which church, and occasionally bulletins from various services. Sermon topics varied widely, with many fairly liberal sermons on controversial issues like women's rights, abortion, racism, drugs, communism, atheism, and homosexuality.
Another large component of the collection is the Subject Files series, collected by Evans to support his research and writings both as a pastor and a columnist. This series includes many clippings, notes, and other materials curated by Evans, and is also arranged alphabetically by subject.
Evans' Correspondence is arranged into alphabetical and thematic sub-series. Most of the correspondence is sorted alphabetically by correspondent, unless Evans purposefully collected and grouped a batch of letters together under another heading; usually these are letters he received in reaction to an article or sermon on controversial issues like race, abortion, and so on. Evans also separated letters between him and Maxilla during World War II and his other travels. These headings are listed beneath the alphabetical correspondence files.
Evans' Personal Files relate to largely non-pastoral or counseling topics, including his childhood, marriage and family, military life, family history and photographs, and scrapbooks. The Pastoral Activities series includes Evans' materials from various churches and community organizations such as the Intentional Growth Center, as well as counseling and theology professional memberships. This series also includes a small amount of audiocassettes recording Evans' devotionals, seminar workshops, and other speaking engagements. Finally, the Courses and Notes series contains most of Evans' handwritten notes from the many seminars, workshops, and classes he both took and taught during his long career as a pastor and counselor.
Evans' prolific Writings began while he was a student in the 1930s and continued until he retired from writing columns for the Waynesville Mountaineer in 2000. The series is arranged into Published Articles, Drafts, and Prayers. Within the Drafts are Evans' multiple working copies of his Mountaineer columns, arranged alphabetically by title. (Copies of the published versions are filed chronologically under Published Articles.) Additional reactions to Evans' writings can also be found in the Correspondence series. The Prayers are unsorted, except for a batch of prayer cards organized by subject, kept by Evans during his chaplaincy at SMU.
The Printed Materials series contains texts both written, edited, and collected by Evans, including college yearbooks, bound copies of the Methodist Advocate dating from his tenure as editor, and other books that reference Evans and his work as an abortion counselor.
This series contains sermons written and preached by J. Claude Evans throughout his career. The materials include handwritten and typed drafts, notes, and some reference materials such as magazine or newspaper clippings. Many of the sermons were revised and reused throughout the decades, and Evans's own lists of the places and dates he preached particular sermons are often included with the text.
Evans's sermons address a broad range of subjects. Most of them address contemporary socio-political topics, issues of faith and Christianity, or, frequently, both. Examples of sermons that address the Christian faith directly include seasonal, sacramental, or celebratory topics such as "Advent Joy," "What Can I Believe about Baptism?" or a variety of sermons for weddings. Also included are sermons about belief and the place of religion in modern life, such as "Liturgy and Life" and "Science and Religion: A Needless Argument."
More numerous are the sermons which address contemporary socio-political issues and current events. These sermons address abortion (as in "The Problem of Unwanted Pregnancies"), race ("Racism: A Contemporary Wilderness"), women ("Are Women Really Persons?"), homosexuality ("My Sister Was a Lesbian"), communism and politics (as in "Marxist Communism and the Christian Faith"), marriage and family ("My Son Was a Runaway" and "Enduring Marriage: An Impossible Possibility") and, later, dementia and illness.
The sermons are filed alphabetically by title.
The Subjects series includes an assortment of newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements, and other clippings, including materials from numerous religious periodicals such as the Methodist Advocate. Evans collected much of this material while researching subjects for his sermons and columns. The subjects reflect current events, especially of the 1960s and 70s, as well as theological issues.
Subjects contained within the series can for the most part be grouped under three categories; current events, counseling, and faith or religion. A sample of subject files from the current events group include information on the Berkeley riots, capital punishment, the draft, energy, homosexuality, J.F.Kennedy's assassination, modern medicine and health care, and playboys and playmates, among many others. There are additional materials related to the abortion issue that Evans collected in an album, which is included in the Personal series.
Subjects pertaining to counseling include files on anxiety, apathy, death and hope, depression, grief, hypnotism, and suicide. Subjects regarding faith include documents on the bible, Catholicism, church and state, evangelism, vocation, and files on other pastors such as Billy Graham, among others. There are also a number of files labeled "Column Ideas" which include materials that Evans had specifically put aside as sources for his writing.
The Subject series is filed alphabetically by subject.
The Correspondence series contains letters, greeting cards, postcards, notes, and telegrams sent to and by J. Claude Evans throughout his lifetime. These letters include personal correspondence such as Christmas cards, correspondence with Evans's wife, Maxilla, and other family members, and a number of letters exchanged while Evans was stationed at various locations while serving in the navy and during later trips to Central and Eastern Europe. For additional personal letters to Evans's family, please see the scrapbooks and albums in the Personal series.
The majority of the letters concern professional matters, such as Evans's sermons, appointments at Clemson, SMU, and the Mountaineer, correspondence regarding Evans's counseling practice, and exchanges with colleagues at various institutions. Some letters were written to Evans in response to controversial subjects as abortion or race which he addressed in his sermons and columns.
The Correspondence series is filed alphabetically by the correspondent's last name with the exception of certain file folders which contain correspondence grouped based on topic, which are included at the end of the list below.
The Personal series includes documents from J. Claude Evans's youth, military and pastoral careers, and family life. These materials are Evans's passports, official navy orders and records, information on his education, a childhood diary, awards and certificates, court records, and articles about Evans, among other documents. The series contains photographs from J. Claude's youth and years at Duke as well as later, professional photos. A large scrapbook contains wartime letters and postcards from J. Claude to Maxilla while he was stationed abroad and an extensive scrapbook Evans created with articles and other notes regarding the abortion debate. The Personal series also includes a leather-bound bible that is inscribed by Evans in 1944 and has a note that it belonged to a T. Ligau c. 1896.
There are also a number of files pertaining to the Evans family's genealogy, including extensive research into both J. Claude and Maxilla Evans's family history. This includes a large photo album from the early twentieth century.
The Writings series includes three subseries: Published Articles and Columns -primarily J. Claude Evans's writings for The Mountaineer, Drafts, and Prayers. These materials include Evans's writings throughout his career for various pastoral and professional purposes.
The Published Articles and Columns subseries is filed alphabetically by the name of the newspaper or periodical in which Evans's writing was published. The Drafts subseries is filed alphabetically by title, with drafts for columns listed under "C" and then listed alphabetically by title within the folder.
The Printed Materials Series includes a range of materials saved and collected by J. Claude Evans. It contains assorted clippings, publications, and articles on theology, women's issues, and LGBT. The series also includes bound copies of the South Carolina Methodist Advocate dating from his time as editor (1952-1957), and bound bulletins from Southern Methodist University dating from his time as chaplain (1959-1979).

This collection includes correspondence, diaries and journals, course material, published books, articles and book reviews, and all the supporting research for these publications. There is also printed material, as well as additional research material on index cards and microfilm. The files contain fellowship and grant applications, conference and seminar programs, notes and texts of lectures and speeches, as well as financial papers, a scrapbook, and pictures. The collection highlights the academic and consulting experiences (particularly the Kemmerer Commission) of Fetter, and documents his intellectual development as an historian of economic thought. Centering on his publications and research, and to a lesser extent his teaching, the largest series are the Publications and the Research series. His publications and research focused on the study of the history of economics, in particular inflation and international economic thought. As reflected in the Correspondence series, he corresponded with economists, academics, and writers. There is a relatively small amount of material concerning his personal life.
Fetter's research interests and publications were wide-ranging, and they are documented in both the Publications and Research series. His articles and pamphlets from 1921-1990 address such topics as Irish and Latin American currency, economists and their relationship to politics, as well as trade, tariff, and hard money issues. His articles focus mainly on the economic history of Great Britain in the 19th century, including the rise and fall of various economic trends and theories in the British financial system. One of the Kemmerer missions provided the basis for his first book, Monetary Inflation in Chile (1931), which foreshadowed his enduring interest in the causes of monetary instability. When later interests changed his focus to classical economics, and in particular British economic thought from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill, he illuminated the classic controversies over money and banking, which at the time of the Napoleonic Wars shaped the economic theories and institutional structures that served Britain and the world before 1914.
The Research series complements the Publications series, as Fetter used these files for many different projects. Much of this material deals with English banking history, and includes files on Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, the bullion controversy, and tariff issues.
In addition to research, Fetter's career involved a great deal of international consulting outside academia. He accepted commissions for projects throughout the world, and in the 1920s he participated in missions led by the Princeton economist E. W. Kemmerer (known as the "money doctor"), advising numerous Latin American governments and others on their monetary problems. The Commissions, Consulting, and Government Service series includes the material used to produce various economic reports for the foreign governments of Guatemala, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Poland, and China. He worked collaboratively with the US government and the governments of India, Cuba, and Germany to secure economic stability for each of these countries.
Not only was Fetter a consultant, but he also taught economics at Princeton, Haverford College, Northwestern University, and, upon his retirement, Dartmouth College, where he adapted his Northwestern University course material for his classes. Both the Northwestern University series and the Teaching subseries in the Professional series highlight such courses as "Money and Banking," "History of Economic Thought," "International Investment," and "Latin American Culture and Civilization."
The Student Papers subseries in the Personal series and Teaching subseries in the Professional series detail Fetter's educational experiences, both as a student and teacher. The Teaching subseries chiefly covers his teaching experiences before his appointment to Northwestern University, with just a few files during and after the Northwestern years.
Letters to and from colleagues with whom Fetter was closely associated, as well as correspondence with friends and family members (including his father, the Princeton economist Frank Albert Fetter), can be found in the Correspondence series. Among his correspondents were J. Garner Anthony, Robert D. C. Black, J. Chester Bradley, R. C. Brooks, Colin Campbell, Lino Castillejo, S. G. Checkland, (Chick) Eagen, Luther Evans, Max Farrand, Milton Friedman, Craufurd Goodwin, Barry Gordon, Frank Graham, Keith Horsefield, Hollard (Ho) Hunter, Per Jacobsson, E. W. Kemmerer, John Maynard Keynes, Charles Kindleberger, Samuel Loescher, Vernon Mund, Leslie Pressnell, Lord Robbins, Richard Sayers, Franklin Scott, Joseph B. Shane, Frederick Jackson Turner, F. W. Taussig, Alan Valentine, Jacob Viner, C. R. Whittlesey and Harold Williamson. Other correspondents of note are E. M. Forster, Upton Sinclair, and Gore Vidal.
Varying aspects of Fetter's personal and professional life are reflected in both the Personal and Professional series. His associations with a number of professional organizations are represented in the files of the American Economic Association, Midwest Economic Association, History of Political Economy, and National Bureau of Economic Research. Personal information, including his marriage to Elizabeth Pollard in 1929, and his second marriage to Elizabeth Stabler in 1978, are part of the Biographical subseries.
Fetter was a consistent diarist, and the Calendars, Diaries, and Journals series records many events during his life. There are also travel journals of Elizabeth Pollard from her 1929 trip to China and 1937 trip to England.
The Visual Material series contains personal images and documentary photographs of Fetter's consulting work. The majority of the photographs are from Fetter's trip to Russia in 1930, taken mainly in Kazan and Moscow.

The references and recommendations files include letters written by him and letters from others requesting recommendations and thanking him for writing.
Fetter was a consistent diarist, and this series records many events during his life. The earliest diaries document his 1917-1918 work with the New York Shipbuilding Yard and 1920 trip and work throughout the Western US. There are other miscellaneous travel journals, including those of Elizabeth Pollard from her 1929 trip to China and 1937 trip to England. There is also a run of calendars from 1967-1989 and address books containing the addresses of friends and colleagues throughout the US and abroad.
Fetter's career involved a great deal of international consulting outside academia. He accepted commissions for projects throughout the world, and in the 1920s he participated in missions led by the Princeton economist E. W.

This includes the material used to produce various economic reports for the foreign governments of Guatemala, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Poland, and China. Other files contain his personal diaries, detailing how he spent his time while commissioned abroad. Photographs taken during consulting visits are in the Visual Material series. He worked collaboratively with the US government and the governments of India, Cuba, and Germany to secure economic stability for each of these countries. In the early 1950s, he was a State Department advisor on the German Debt Settlement. He also testified before congressional and governmental committees in the US in the 1950s. In 1974, an oral history interview conducted by someone from the Harry S. Truman Library detailed his years of consulting and government service regarding international monetary issues.

Fetter taught economics at Princeton University, Haverford College, Northwestern University, and, upon his retirement, Dartmouth College, where he adapted his Northwestern course material. He occasionally taught or advised at institutions such as Swarthmore College, the School for Advanced International Studies, and the University of Wisconsin. Both the Northwestern University series and the Teaching subseries in the Professional series highlight such courses as "Money and Banking," "History of Economic Thought," "International Investment," and "Latin American Culture and Civilization." Also of interest are the files on the Ford Foundation Faculty Research Summer Seminar in 1957, where he taught "International Economic Problems and Economic Development" to faculty from various colleges and universities throughout the Midwest. He served on various Northwestern University committees, such as the Budget Committee (1954) and the Honor System Committee (1963-1964).

His articles focus mainly on the economic history of Great Britain in the 19th century, including the rise and fall of various economic trends and theories in the British financial system.

Such ideas are illustrated in his Development of British Monetary Orthodoxy 1797-1875 (1965) and The Economist in Parliament: 1780-1868 (1980). These are just two of the books for which the Publications series holds drafts and final copies of manuscripts, revision notes, English and foreign language editions, background research, and correspondence. Manuscripts, research, and correspondence are also available for his unpublished books, one dealing with the role of foreign capital in assisting developing countries, and the other concerning the rise of England's Overend, Gurney bank and its subsequent financial collapse in 1866.

The Research series complements the Publications series, as Fetter used these research files for many different projects. The Alphabetical Files subseries, organized by topic, reflects his personal and professional interests and holds the body of reference material he collected throughout his career. Much of this material deals with English banking history, and includes files on Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, the bullion controversy, and tariff issues. Examples of other interests are also in these files, including his debunking efforts concerning the inscriptions on the Christ of the Andes monument and on the Jefferson Memorial. Other materials of interest are the de Tocqueville files, and his efforts at cataloging the economic references in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. A second alphabetical subseries of index cards and microfilm contain research on many topics of interest to him. The Research on Published Articles and Pamphlets subseries complements the Published Articles and Pamphlets subseries in the Publications series and contains correspondence and background research for the articles and book reviews.
The Alphabetical Files are organized by topic and include magazine and newspaper clippings, bank records, court records, statistics, charts and tables, notes on readings, and bibliographies.

The papers of John William Firor span the years 1860-1985, but the bulk of the papers falls between 1900 and the 1950s. Included are correspondence, articles, a diary, postcards, printed material, clippings, notes, and pictures. This collection primarily consists of his personal and family correspondence, although there are papers relating to his work as a university professor, author, and farmer.
Firor began his career as a horticulturist prior to World War I and eventually broadened his interests to the field of southern agricultural economics, teaching at the University of Georgia. A major focus for his work was problems relating to Georgia agricultural crops, including especially pecans and peaches, but also watermelons, tomatoes, Irish potatoes, and apples. Particular interests in this field included fertilizer tests, diseases, expansion and economics of the farming industry, the impact of the boll weevil, distribution of farm price information, and general farm problems. In addition, he was known for developing the idea of carlot marketing of poultry and livestock.
The single diary in the papers covers chiefly the latter part of Firor's career as a professor in the College of Agriculture at the University of Georgia, 1949-1952, with only intermittent entries for 1941-1948. He wrote about veterans, his farm, and his economic, agricultural, and political philosophy. Entries also discuss various farming topics, such as cost and prices, crops, planting, cattle, sales, and the effects of temperature and rainfall on crops.
The Correspondence Series comprises over one-half of the collection. Pre-World War I correspondence consists primarily of incoming letters. Family correspondents include Firor's mother, Anna Catherine Wisotskey Firor, and his brothers Guy W., George, and David F. Some of the letters concern J. William Firor's job searches. In his World War I letters from France, he reflected on the U.S. Army, the Armistice, the French people, and AEF (American Expeditionary Forces) University (1919). He wrote to his fiancee Mary Valentine Moss, a student at Simmons College in Boston, and to Guy and his wife Helen. Firor and Mary corresponded from 1915 until their marriage in 1920. In France Firor met Viscountess Therese de Montford, and their correspondence extends into 1953. After the war, his letters express concern about the arrival of the boll weevil in Georgia. He referred to varieties of pecan trees, fruit trees, spraying, and some letters pertain to his job searches. Few letters exist for the 1930s.
Correspondence in the 1940s and 1950s includes a few World War II letters that Firor wrote from Lowry Field, Colorado and letters from Yvonne Ragon, a friend in France. Other war and post-war letters pertain to Firor's return to the University of Georgia and changes in the College of Agriculture and in courses in rural sociology. In letters between Mary and J. William Firor, and their daughter Anne Byrd Firor Scott, professor of history at Duke University, Dr. Scott wrote of her career and family life. In 1951 Firor wrote to former students in agricultural economics and associates in response to the volume of letters presented upon his retirement from the University of Georgia. Most of the post-1951 correspondence is between Firor and his daughter Anne Scott. Prominent individuals represented in the Correspondence Series include Reuben ‚ÄúShorty‚Äù Brigham (late 1940s), Harmon Caldwell (late 1940s), Paul Wilber Chapman (1940s), William Mauzy Kemper (ca. 1908-1914), and Anne Firor Scott (1949-1961).
The Writings and Speeches Series includes clippings of Firor's articles from such publications as The Country Gentleman, The Georgia Democrat, The Progressive Farmer, Southern Ruralist, and The Southern Agriculturalist. Included is a rough draft of his Farm Plan for the Future, 1952. Firor wrote on a variety of southern agricultural topics, such as economics, prices, mortgages, the marketing of crops, sharecroppers, surpluses, farm ownership and management, father and son farming, planting, conservation, and farm people. The writings reflect a particular concern for problems relating to the cultivation of the pecan, sweet potato, peach, watermelon, and cotton crops. He also wrote about politics and veterans as farmers.
The Subject Files Series includes biographical and genealogical files on the Moss and Firor families as well as a folder for Anne Firor Scott. There are folders for Thurmont, Md., Firor's boyhood home, and for Country Gentleman, to which Firor frequently contributed articles.

The papers of the lawyer and educator William Righter Fisher and the journalist Mary Wager Fisher consist primarily of correspondence, but also include photographs (several of them tintypes and cartes-de-visite), financial papers, diaries, clippings, printed material, and writings and speeches. Among correspondents are many journalists, physicians, educators, and other notable figures of the late nineteenth century including Lucy Abbott, Mercy Baker, Jennie Chapin, Mary L. Booth, W.S. Burke, James Gowdy Clark, M.E. Dodge, Weston Flint, P. Girard, S. D. Harris, Albert Leffingwell, Henry C. Olney, W. Trickett, George Boyer Vashon, and Frank J. Webb. The collection also includes letters from James B. Hazelton of the First Regiment, New York Artillery. Hazelton's letters describe battles and political events of the Civil War, including Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft riots. The papers are particularly rich in documentation of women in medicine and women's medical education in the second half of the nineteenth century; the Freedmen's schools in the Reconstruction South; the movement for women's rights; and friendship among American women in the late Victorian era.
The Correspondence Series includes letters from three prominent women physicians of the period (Jennie Chapin, Mercy N. Baker, and Lucy M. Abbott) to Mary Wager before her marriage to Fisher. In their letters they described their medical education, their obstetrical experience, and the high cost of tuition and living expenses at the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia. Letters prior to her marriage in 1876 also attest to Wager's numerous romantic involvements. Among her admirers was lawyer and educator Weston Flint, and the Correspondence Series includes over 100 letters from him describing his political, social, and literary interests as well as his deep affection for Mary Wager. He also wrote about his wartime travels and his interest in helping the contrabands medically and educationally. Flint detailed political events of the Civil War, including Lincoln's re-election campaign and the anti-draft riots, and mentions the Copperheads. He expressed particular interest in the moral state of soldiers, decrying their drinking of alcohol and consorting with prostitutes. Flint sometimes included poetry in his letters.
Also in the Correspondence Series are two letters (1870) from Frank J. Webb, the author of The Garies and Their Friends (1857), a daring novel about an interracial couple. In one of these letters dated May 5, he referred to a 500-page manuscript sent to Harper's for an unpublished novel, Paul Sumner, which he considered to be superior to The Garies. In a four-page letter to Wager (April 9, 1870), African American writer, attorney, and educator George Boyer Vashon provided an autobiography. The events of his life were penned on the letterhead of The New Era: A National Journal, Edited by Colored Men.
The collection offers insight into emotionally intense friendships between women of the nineteenth century. Wager's female friends sent good wishes, but expressed great jealousy at the time of her marriage to Fisher. Young women wrote of both romantic and sisterly love for Mary, and sometimes discussed such issues as women's education, women's dress, women's suffrage, and temperance.
The bulk of William Righter Fisher's letters in the collection were written between him and his parents. A small cache of letters from author and dean of Dickenson College Law School William Trickett, who lived in Germany in 1872, provide a vivid illustration of the political climate and structure of the Germany of Bismarck. Also to be found among letters to Fisher are several written in the late 1860's by agents of the Freedmen's Bureau and the Freedmen's school in Wytheville, Virginia.
While the bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, some speeches and writings by Mary Wager Fisher and Weston Flint are included. Of particular interest is a photocopy of Mary Wager's article entitled Women as Physicians. Also, the Pictures Series includes both cartes-de-visite and tintypes.
The William Righter and Mary Wager Fisher Papers provide numerous windows through which researchers can view aspects of late Victorian America. The collection provides an unusual entree into the private and public lives of nineteenth-century men and women, and particularly provides information about the professionalization of American women, relationships between women in nineteenth-century America, and race relations in the Reconstruction South.

Collection comprises 18 color photographs taken from 1939 to 1942 by Farm Security Administration (FSA) photographers Jack Delano (8 prints), Russell Lee (7) and Marion Post Wolcott (3). The prints are sized 10 x 13 and 11 x 14 inches, with image sizes ranging from 6 1/2 x 9 3/4 to 10 x 13 inches. They were printed by photograph collector and gallery owner Tennyson Schad in the 1980s from original transparencies in the Library of Congress, using the dye transfer process.
Subjects include industrial settings such as a Pennsylvania steel mill and a sawmills in Georgia and Maine; rural settings such as a wheat field in Washington State and grain elevators in Idaho; and photographs of people, including a group of African Americans fishing near a cotton plantation in Mississippi, and a gathering of white men in a rural Kentucky town. One sequence documents people mingling, saying grace, and serving food at a rural fair in New Mexico. There are several photographs of tobacco cultivation and a federal housing project taken in Puerto Rico, where photographer Jack Delano settled shortly after his FSA assignment.

Collection is comprised of files documenting the development and daily operations of the Feminist Women's Health Center (FWHC), a feminist non-profit women's healthcare center, from the years 1974-2003. Major components of the collection include files from research studies conducted at the center, policies and procedures for maintaining the center, and incidents of anti-abortion protests at the center, specifically involving the group Operation Rescue. The National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers in the United States and Canada, also figures prominently throughout these records. The collection is organized into six series: Administrative Files, Clinic Files, Subject Files, Financial Material, Legal Files, and Audiovisual Material. The collection also contains a physically separated Closed Series.
The Administrative Files Series most clearly documents the day-to-day operations of the FWHC. Materials in this series include policies, procedures, and guidelines for operation of the center; minutes and notes from a range of meetings held by the center; personnel files; and schedules. This series contains four subseries: General Administrative Files, Meetings, Personnel Files, and Schedules.
Materials in the Clinic Files Series include a range of records related to clinical services provided and research studies conducted at the FWHC. This series has been divided into four subseries: Statistics, Laboratory Statistics, Research, and Patient Education Information.
The Subject Files Series includes files maintained by the staff of the FWHC on a range of topics related to women's health issues, events, local information, and other women's health clinics. This series contains two subseries: a General subseries which covers these subjects broadly, and an Anti-Abortion Violence subseries which focuses specifically on anti-abortion protests at the FWHC and other locations, the anti-abortion movement in the United States, and pro-choice efforts to counter this movement.
Items in the Financial Material Series consist of records, reports, and files documenting the financial situation of the FWHC between the years 1982 and 2001. These files detail the intricacies involved in operating a women's health clinic from a financial standpoint.
The Legal Files Series contains files related to legal issues faced by the FWHC, including lawsuits and legislation which would affect women's reproductive health and the clinic.
The Audiovisual Material Series consists of 28 audiocassettes and 11 videocassettes. Audiocassettes are primarily recordings of workshops, conference sessions, and events. Videocassettes are primarily educational. One videocassette documents anti-abortion protesters outside the FWHC.
The Closed Series consists of sensitive materials removed from the previous six series and CLOSED to research.

The Ann Henshaw Gardiner Papers begin in the early years of the settlement of Berkeley County, Virginia, with two pioneer families, those of Captain William Henshaw of Springfield MIlls, Mill Creek, and of William Snodgrass of Clifton Mills, Back Creek. Both groups married into other prominent families of the region, so that their papers furnish two hundred years of local history and genealogical material for Berkeley County. The Andersons, the Verdiers, the Turners, the Evanses, the McConnells, the Pendletons, the Robinsons, and the Rawlingses, among others, appear throughout the collection.
The early letters are predominantly business in character, concerning the land transactions of John Turner, the surveyor of Berkeley County who registered the land titles of many local families. He was related to the Snodgrass family through his marriage to Ruth Rawlings.
By 1814, the correspondence is centered in Robert Snodgrass and his brother Stephen. As Berkeley County produced wheat in abundance, the sale of flour from its mills became increasingly important. The Henshaws of Mill Creek in particular left records of sales of large quantities of flour on the Alexandria and Baltimore markets. The Snodgrasses in this period were also milling although their records are not as numerous for their sales.
Both the Henshaws and the Snodgrasses were involved in the political affairs of Berkeley County. Levi Henshaw (1769-1843) was a gentleman justice of the peace, captain of militia, a member of the county court and of the Virginia House of Delegates, and sheriff in 1840. Robert Verdier Snodgrass (1792-1861) was commissioner of county revenue, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and colonel of the 67th Regiment of Virginia Militia. Their papers reflect these offices, both in the correspondence and in the legal papers. Levi Henshaw (1815-1896) married Sarah Ann, the daughter of Robert Verdier Snodgrass, thus uniting the papers of both families.
Berkeley County was an agricultural community, whose conditions were reflected in references to slaves in estates, as runaways, and for sale or hire.
Robert Verdier Snodgrass was concerned in both Democratic politics and legal business with Charles James Faulkner. His son-in-law, Israel Robinson, wrote to Snodgrass of political conditions in Washington, D. C. where he was an office holder. (Later Israel Robinson became clerk of the county court, a judge, and a Confederate general) The son of Robert Verdier Snodgrass, Stephen, became postmaster at Hedgesville, Va., in 1855.
By 1860 the settlement of various family estates reveals a maze of Snodgrass relatives. A letter from a cousin in 1860 comments on John Brown's raid and the arrival of the Japanese Embassy in Washington.
The outbreak of the Civil War shows divided political opinion in the family. In 1862, a letter describes the condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in wartime and of the Negroes in Washington, D.C., where slavery had been abolished. Stephen Snodgrass, a Unionist, did not have an easy time at Hedgesville during the war, and he had to have papers attesting his loyalty. On May 12, 1865, comment is made upon the assassination of President Lincoln.
Henshaw papers predominate after 1865. Business is dull; the collection of money, difficult.
As the family has scattered, letters of cousins come from many places, and grandchildren write to Sarah Ann (Snodgrass), the widow of Robert Verdier Snodgrass.
The first William Henshaw (1736-1799) in Berkeley County had married Agnes Anderson. William was the son of Nicholas Henshaw who came from Philadelphia to Berkeley County; thus Nicholas is the settler, William the first of that home. In 1886 correspondence begins about the history of the Anderson family; letters continue into the twentieth century.
By the 1890's Valley of Virginia Henshaw and her sisters, Mabel and Francis Little Henshaw, begin to write letters about genealogical matters; in particular, the Rawlings family is the subject of great interest.
Mabel Henshaw married Dr. Samuel H. Gardiner. Her concern for history led her to teach at Shepherd College, Shepherdstown, Jefferson County, W. Va., where she also served as librarian. Mrs. Gardiner was a district chairman of the West Virginia Equal Suffrage Association with correspondence in 1915 and 1916 which reveals the methods women were using to insure the pas sage of the woman suffrage amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
The daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Gardiner, Miss Ann Henshaw Gardiner, historian, scientist, and teacher, founded nursing education at the Duke University Hospital in 1930.
Between 1926 and 1930, Mrs. Mabel Gardiner wrote to many friends who remembered details of family weddings in the mid-nineteenth century. As late as 1940 she corresponded with R. B. Woodworth on the history of the Tuscarora Church and other Berkeley County churches. A picture of the Tuscarora Church is with these papers. (See Picture Cab. II-7)
The heart of the Ann Henshaw Gardiner Papers is the collection of legal papers which date from 1763. Both the Snodgrasses and the Henshaws as justices of the peace and county office holders were involved in a great deal of legal business through the ions . A grouping of legal papers for both families is followed by special sections on land surveys, on estate settlements, and on militia.
The general file of legal papers begins with gants from Lord Fairfax in the 1760s, when Berkeley County was still a part of Frederick County, Virginia. Richard Rigg, the land agent for Lord Fairifax, was the first surveyor in the district settled by the Henshaws and the Snodgrasses. Rawlings family deeds appear in the 1770s.
At the end of the Revolutionary War, John Turner appears as a chain carrier for the land surveys of the County. He became county surveyor, an office which he held until his death in 1811.
Among the family wills is that of Nicholas Henshaw (died 1777). With the deaths of Robert and Stephen Snodgrass in 1830 and 1832, a great deal of administrative work for their estates enters the papers, as Robert Verdier Snodgrass was appointed executor for both men. (Robert V. Snodgrass was the sone of Stephen Snodgrass) David Hunter and Israel Robinson are the clerks of the county court in these early documents.
Schools, roads, runaway slaves, the hiring of servants mail are concerns Which occupy the papers. With the death of Robert Verdier Snodgrass in 1861, his estate is settled and the legal papers belong to the Henshaws from that date.
The second division of legal papers concerns the settlement of a number of estates, usually those of relatives . The Turner and Gorrell families had intermarried with the Snodgrasses and Henshaws. The earliest papers dating from 1798 contain the will and estate inventory of Joseph Evans. Israel Robinson was executor of the estate of Elan Miller in 1849.
A large group of legal papers concerns the acquisition of land, basic in Virginia economic life in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Survey plats began in 1753 in old Frederick County, which had been established in 1738. From it Berkeley County was created in 1772. The first surveys, made for the Rawlings and Morgan families, were for land purchased from Lord Fairfax. Richard Rigg, his surveyor, signed the plats showing the Fairfax grants. Rigg is followed by surveyors Thomas Jones and Josiah Swearingen. Many names of early settlers appear in the survey papers. In the 1780' s a chain carrier, John Turner, began to make surveys. He married Ruth Rawlings, whose land plats are in the papers. John Turner became surveyor for Berkeley County and remained in office till his death in 1810. His son Thomas, who was his deputy, succeeded him as surveyor for the county; The estate papers of the Turner family, elsewhere in the legal papers, show them as early residents of old Frederick County.
In 1803 land office records appear in conjunction with the survey appears. By this time Robert Verdier Snodgrass was a county commissioner of revenue who worked with the Turners in the sale of land.
The Snodgrass family was involved in militia affairs from 1798, when Robert (d. 1830) was a 1st lieutenant in the 67th Regiment 16th Brigade, 3rd Division, Virginia Militia. This county regiment was divided into local companies, each of which was subdivided into classes of roughly seven men. Class rolls, rosters, and officers' lists make up the official papers. By 1820, Robert Verdier Snodgrass was serving as an officer. He became colonel of the 67th Regiment in 1838, thereafter making annual returns.
The constitution of the Berkeley Rangers was drawn up on November 26, 1859, to organize a company of militia from Berkeley County. This company is listed as the Berkeley Border Guards Co. D. 2nd Virginia Infantry, C.S.A. Army, under J.Q.A. Nandenbousch of Martinsburg.
The financial papers are divided between Levi Henshaw I and II and Robert Verdier Snodgrass. Bills and receipts, loans, and household accounts increased as the nineteenth century brought a less self-sufficient life on the farms of Berkeley County. The Snodgrasses no longer lived at the Bill on Back Creek, but had moved to Hedgesville.
With such long family histories in Berkeley County, it was to be expected that descendants of the Henshaws and Snodgrasses should turn to writing the history of their section of Virginia. Valley of Virginia Henshaw was a leader of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Berkeley and throughout West Virginia. Her sisters, Mabel and Frances, were in Martinsburg by 1916. They were the children of Levi Henshaw II and Sarah Ann, the daughter of Robert Verdier Snodgrass.
Mabel (Henshaw) Gardiner wrote a thesis on the history of Martinsburg in 1930 for the degree of Master of Arts at the University of West Virginia. This work was developed into Chronicles of Old Berkeley by Mrs. Gardiner in collaboration with her daughter, Ann Henshaw Gardiner. Published in 1938, this history is based on the Ann H. Gardiner Papers and contains the diaries which Captain Levi and Hiram Henshaw kept on trips to Kentucky, ca. 1828-1830.
Ann Henshaw Gardiner graduated from Shepherd College and went into training in nursing at the Massachusetts General Hospital. She saw service in World War I in a United States Army base hospital in France (U.S. Base Hospital NO. 6). In 1927 she wrote her thesis The Development of the External Form of the Squid Embryo, at Kansas State Agricultural College for the degree of Master of Science. With the manuscripts of this work are pamphlets and papers of Francis Noyes Balch on Cephalopods.
Broadsides and pamphlets refer to Berkeley County and its history, to estate sales in the county, to the Whig Party, to the militia, and to the Free masons.
Clippings pertain to family members and to the story of Martinsburg and West Virginia. A series of articles by B. F. Voegle on local history is also in clipping form.
Among the miscellaneous material is a manuscript arithmetic book, 1790-1791, which was used by Robert Snodgrass II.
The volumes contain a number of old account books and other records. Family data for the Snodgrasses is preserved in their Age Book, 1821-1861 for each generation from William to Robert Verdier Snodgrass, as well as a list of the family slaves and their ages. Daybooks and farm books date fray 1803 to the 1840's. Four postal card albums, an autograph album, and scrapbooks with many other miscellaneous volumes are in the collection.
At the end of the papers are two albums and two manuscript histories of the first ten years of the Duke University School of Nursing. Pictures, programs, invitations, and clippings in the first album document the beginning of the nursing program in 1930. In the second album are photographs of nursing and laboratory classes
A number of letters, poems, and pamphlets unmounted in albums, conclude the nursing papers On December 27, 1934, the Duke University School of Nursing Alumnae Association was organized with a constitution. A reprint from the Southern Medical Association Journal contains the speeches made in April, 1931, at the dedication of the Medical School. Among the pictures are a number of photographs of members of the various classes of the Nursing School. The Henshaw family is well illustrated by pictures of individuals, their homes, and antique furnishlngs. For further details on this collection, see F. Vernon Aler, History of Martinsburg and Berkeley County, West Vlrginia; Willis F. Evans, History of Berkeley County West Virginia; and A. H. and M. H. Gardiner, Chronicles of Old Berkeley.

Simpson; land investments in Kansas; and, after the 1860s, iron ore mining operations in Virginia. The letters from Montana and Kansas also document the harsh life on the American frontier. Included with this mostly business correspondence are a few letters from Thomas B. Sykes describing his experiences at Camp Chase, a Union prisoner-of-war camp near Columbus, Ohio, and as a resident of Aberdeen, Miss. during Reconstruction.
The second period, from the 1890s to 1910, consists chiefly of letters to Emma or her sisters Mary and Mabel, which discuss news of family and friends.

Doyle Dane Bernbach. "Getting Rid of the Work Is the Work of Burlington."
Doyle Dane Bernbach.
Doyle Dane Bernbach.
Collection consists of four volumes connected with Dr. Eugene Grissom, related to his superintendentship of the North Carolina Insane Asylum in Raleigh.
Volume 1 is a register of admissions, 1883-1887, including information about white patients admitted to the Raleigh Insane Asylum including names, NC county of residence, and occasionally the outcome of their admission (typically either their cause of death or the note that they had left the hospital, cured). This register tracked only admissions for the Eastern Division of white patients in North Carolina; patients residing in the Western Division were treated at an insane asylum in Morganton.
The other three volumes are scrapbooks, largely consisting of clippings about Grissom or the asylum. All of these scrapbooks include coverage of Grissom's medical lectures and papers on the treatment of the insane, his roles in various medical organizations, the work of the insane asylum as a progressive institution, and the political turmoil Grissom occasionally faced.
In addition to clippings relating to Grissom's medical career and his work at the Insane Asylum, Volume 2 (a scrapbook dated 1875-1877) includes clippings from various newspapers covering a controversy about whether Grissom (a Republican) should be removed from his position as superintendent during the fallout of the 1877 election in North Carolina.
Volume 3 is a scrapbook assembled by A. Watkins Verith (sp?) on Grissom's behalf, dating from circa 1877-1880. It includes clippings and notations (by Verith) about Grissom's political career, including debates about his potential run for North Carolina governor in 1879; coverage of a controversy with Dr. William A. Hammond over Grissom's treatment methods (including Grissom's proponency of mechanical restraints for violent patients, such as handcuffs and straightjackets); his expert testimony in a Danville murder case that the accused, Justin Thomas Dejarnette, was clinically insane; as well as public notices about his various lectures and appearances.
Volume 4 (1877-1880) contains clippings and some annotations about Grissom's service as superintendent for the Insane Asylum, including a published letter from Dorothea Dix praising the work of the hospital. There are additional clippings covering the Dejarnette murder case (1880), Grissom's involvement in Masonic ceremonies in 1880, and Grissom's potential runs for governor.
Collection includes three generations of the Hall family and documents their involvement with tobacco and other plantation operations in Maryland during the 18th and 19th centuries, including the shift to lumber and wheat after 1800. Also includes information on cotton plantations in South Carolina and the sale of cotton to England, Maryland politics and government in the 1780s, insurrections by enslaved people, and naval impressment at the time of the War of 1812.
The papers begin in 1736, when John Hall (ca. 1717-1790) and his brothers Henry and William become actively engaged in tobacco planting. The letters open with a land indenture of 1745 and continue as business correspondence with London, Annapolis, Baltimore, and local merchants and factories. Comment is made on salt as a necessity for plantation life in 1778 and 1782. An overseer's contract in 1764 gives details of plantation management and enslavement.
A letter is signed by John Hall of "Vineyard" on June 11, 1778. As a member of the Maryland Assembly, he discusses the check and balance theory as it was working out in the "young government" of Maryland, he mentions violent contests, the quit rents and state revenue, militia service, and the role of the governor. In 1787 "Publicanus" addresses the people of Anne Arundel Co. on the topic of paper money.
The will of John Hall (made in 1787) gives his estate as "Bachelor's Choice," on West River, and names his children and their families. Enslaved people are listed as part of the estate. Many of the later letters are from the families of Hall sibilings to William Henry Hall, son of John Hall. A series of law suits occurs in the 1790s as William Henry Hall settles his father's estate.
A letter dated Oct. 3, 1796, to William Henry Hall describes the life of an American seaman impressed into the British navy. Samuel Hopkins, a young Maryland plantation overseer, and John Wilson of Cheraw, S. C., comment in letters to Hall from 1810-1813 on cotton planting in S. C. Hopkins describes on July 1, 1810, a plot by enslaved people to rise against enslavers in the Marlboro District of S. C. In 1813 he writes of hiring a substitute for himself if drafted in the War of 1812. Among W. H. Hall's correspondents were William, John, David, and John G. Weems of Anne Arundel Co., relatives of Mason Locke ("Parson") Weems.
The bills and receipts contain many an "acct. sale" of tobacco, listing custom duties, charges, etc., in tobacco shipping. Estate inventories for Major Henry Hall, 1758, Thos. Lane, 1790-98, John Hall, 1795, and Mrs. Ruth Hall, 1803, include enslaved people and list possessions. Many mercantile and household accounts are included.
There are 7 volumes dated 1765-1902. Six are account books, two that belonged to John Hall and 4 to William Henry Hall. There is one volume that belonged to Harriet Hall.
Collection comprises business and family correspondence, accounts, and receipts, including papers related to several of Hamilton's business partnerships (dating mainly from 1785 to 1818) and numerous private transactions, including purchases of slaves (1784-1785, 1801, 1808). There also are papers from voyages of ships in which he had a major interest, including routes to India, the Mediterranean, and the West Indies. The collection concludes with accounts and records related to the settlement of his estate from 1832 to 1870.
Subject headings found in the correspondence were compiled by a researcher in 2005.
Includes cotton and rice, London market, and shipping.
Includes cotton and rice, London market, shipping, and one letter from niece in London, 1804.
Includes tobacco, steam engine (1805), cotton, financial, panic, France (1806), and politics.

Collection comprises 37 letters, dated 1850-1866, Abraham Hanson wrote to his wife, Lydia, and one he wrote to his father from Monrovia, Liberia, among other places. Topics include abolition, diplomatic duties, commercial affairs, emigration, shipboard travel, the condition of Liberians and his aspirations for them, health concerns, and personal matters. There are also 15 incoming letters written to Hanson and his wife, dated 1846-1866, reporting on Hanson's welfare and conditions in Liberia and Africa, along with personal travel and religious matters. Includes several condolences written to Lydia following Hanson's dearth. In addition, there is funeral sermon Hanson preached on 1848 December 10 in Wisconsin, a copy of the New York City Colonization Society's circular dated 1840 May 3, and a copy of an 1852 Liberian court decision regarding payment of tuition and provision of clothing for Robert Savage. There is also a sermon dated 1863 Dec 10, entitled "Zion's Compliance and God's Answer, Isaiah 49-16-15." Two of the letters in the collection are incomplete. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American History and Culture.
Collection comprises Haworth's medical diary and journal (approximately 156 pages), including his notes on treatment of physical ailments and on childbirth in the rural south before and after the Civil War. Haworth studied medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia; he recorded the purchase of this notebook at Auner's bookstore to be used for his medical notes during 1846-1847. At the beginning he listed the titles and prices for the medical reference books he purchased. He then recorded 30 pages of remedies and cures, and provided a 4-page manuscript index to this material bound in at the back of the volume. He also included notes on course instruction (at one point mentioning the lectures of Nathaniel Chapman). The balance of the volume is, however, a record of over 750 obstetric deliveries that Haworth accomplished during his career, some with full case histories. The organization of the notebook is somewhat confused because Haworth stitched in pages with notes written longitudinally among the original medical course lecture notes he retained. The obstetric entries date from 1846-1894; there are two clippings inserted, one dated 1908.
Collection consists of correspondence, diaries, notes, scrapbooks, clippings, and literary manuscripts of Hayne and his family. The papers illustrate Hayne's career and refer to Russell's Magazine (which Hayne edited), literary criticism, Southern writers, American literature, politics, Reconstruction in South Carolina, Civil War conditions, fears of Black or enslaved peoples' rebellions, poor economic conditions for white Southerners, and general antagonism towards the writings of Walt Whitman and William Dean Howells. Includes Hayne's diaries (1864-1884), largely composed of comments on correspondence received, notations of ideas and events, and manuscript copies of poems, many autographed, by Hayne's son, William Hamilton Hayne.
Major correspondents include Edward Bok, Jefferson Davis, Charles A. E. Gayarr√©, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sidney Lanier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Thomas Nelson Page, James Platt, Margaret Junkin Preston, Francis S. Saltus, William Gilmore Sims, Edmund C. Stedman, Alexander H. Stephens, Algernon C. Swinburne, Henry Timrod, Moses Colt Tyler, and John Greenleaf Whittier.
The addition (accession #2000-0273) (250 items; 2.2 linear feet, dated 1831-1886, contains transcriptions of selected letters, typed and annotated by Rayburn Moore as he edited A Man of Letters in the Nineteenth-century South (1982). Many of the original letters may be found in Duke University's David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library.
Typed and annotated by Rayburn Moore, editor of A Man of Letters in the Nineteenth-Century South: The Selected Letters of Paul Hamilton Hayne, 1982
This collection consists mostly of letters to Benjamin S. Hedrick, Professor of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina, 1854-1856, and Examiner in the Patent Office, Washington, D.C., from 1861 until his death in 1886. In 1856, expelled from the University for his opposition to slavery, he was driven from North Carolina. However, it is evident from his correspondence that he maintained an intense concern for the welfare of his native state and employed his influence in Washington for the benefit of the state during the Civil War and Reconstruction period.
The collection consists largely of correspondence between the Hedricks and their friends and colleagues. Early correspondence from 1848-1854 includes family news and affairs. Letters of courtship between Benjamin Hedrick and Mary Ellen Thompson, dated 1851-1852 (before their marriage), mainly detail personal news and opinions on new fashions and trends, such as bloomers, temperance, and women's rights. Political events are also mentioned, including the Railroad Jubilee of September 1851, as well as Hedrick's impressions of Harvard and details about his activities while travelling in the North.
Letters from 1854 discuss Hedrick's decision to accept the professorship position at the University of North Carolina and his subsequent plans for the program there. In 1856, Hedrick's article opposing slavery and endorsing John Fremont and the Republicans was published in the North Carolina Standard. The collection includes both clippings, minute excerpts, and correspondence about his subsequent expulsion from the University. Also included are details about the publicity and negative reactions to Hedrick's views; one letter from Mary Ellen Thompson Hedrick recounts UNC students burning Hedrick in effigy. Letters from the Hedricks' friends and supporters describe their own troubles in finding work as a result of backing Hedrick, and also include updates on the political climate throughout the country. Hedrick's grandfather, Benjamin Sherwood, was a regular correspondent from Marion County, Iowa, and provided regular news and opinions on the conditions of the Midwest. He opposed slavery, Democratic Party, and immigration from Catholic countries, and favors letting the Southern states secede. His letters also include family history along with updates from Marion county activities. Know Nothings, President Buchanan's cabinet, and Kansas violence are all discussed in letters from 1856-1857.
After Hedrick's expulsion and departure from North Carolina, incoming letters from friends and family offer news and updates on Chapel Hill residents, including University of North Carolina adminstrators and professors; schools; crops and prices; as well as family news, courtships, and events. Several letters mention Hinton R. Helper's book, The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It, which Benjamin Hedrick helped promote in 1858. At one point, Hedrick is warned against travelling in North Carolina until after the presidential election, for his own safety.
Following Lincoln's election in 1860, Benjamin Hedrick's letters describe the flood of Republicans moving to Washington, including his own relocation and pursuit of an appointment in the Patent Office. Included is a letter from March 1861 where he describes meeting President and Mrs. Lincoln. Meanwhile, letters to Hedrick from North Carolina mention secession fervor in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as preparations for arming white citizens against Black people. The North Carolina convention and its delegates are discussed, as are preparations for war in both the North and the South. Hedrick writes about the feelings in Washington, while his stepsister describes sewing uniforms for soldiers in New Bern, North Carolina.
There is little material directly related to the Civil War, apparently due to interruption of mail service between North Carolina and Washington. The letters within the collection include mention of several battles, including Fort Sumter, Bull Run, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga. The homefront is also reported on, including North Carolina's conscription laws, the confiscation of Union-sympathizers' property, the arrival of refugees, and the condition of UNC's campus. Politics are another frequent topic, including the Copperheads.
One interesting component of the collection is a group of letters from John A. Hedrick, Benjamin Hedrick's brother and Internal Revenue Collector at Beaufort, N.C. John Hedrick's original letters are interfiled chronologically with the collection, and also exist in typewritten form, filed together at the end of letters from 1863. His reports from Beaufort mention the health and condition of the city; the arrival of refugees after the battle for Plymouth in April 1864; the spread of measles and smallpox; and his thoughts on the Massachusetts 55th Regiment, an African American regiment stationed in North Carolina. In February 1865, John Hedrick writes that the presence of African American Union troops keep Confederate troops away, since they do not like to fight Black soldiers. His correspondence also mentions the death of Lincoln and Johnston's surrender to General Sherman. Post-war letters discuss North Carolina politics, universal suffrage, and crop-sharing by former slaves. He denounces W. W. Holden, the North Carolina provisional governor, and encourages Benjamin Hedrick to run. Later letters describe the North Carolina Constitional Convention and subsequent election of 1868, where both brothers ran for Congress (Benjamin for the 4th District, John for the 2nd District).
Another notable sub-group of letters about the Civil War come from prisoners of war at Point Lookout, Old Capital, Camp Elmire, Fort Deleware, and Johnsons' Island prisons. The prisoner letters exist only in typewritten form; no originals remain with the collection.
Following the surrender, correspondence transitions to discuss North Carolina's adjustment to Reconstruction. Benjamin Hedrick's visit to North Carolina results in a report to the Secretary of the Treasury that Carolina wants peace, and that hunger, crime, and speculation are serious problems for the population. Some letters to Hedrick complain about freedmen and their labor. Several correspondents discuss the poverty they face in the post-war period, both from their loss of property to the Confederacy and in their loss of slave labor following emancipation. Many write to Hedrick asking for seeds. One notable letter to Hedrick from February 2, 1866, comes from Milly Walker, formerly enslaved by D.L. Swain, who writes she is searching for her father and three children, who had been owned by Dr. Shoaf of Washington.
Another common topic in 1865 is Hedrick's efforts in establishing Internal Revenue districts throughout the state, resulting in much correspondence about the various posts and jobs that resulted.
The political letters of value are found mostly between 1865 and 1870. There is much discussion of the election and its various components, including candidates W.W. Holden and Jonathon Worth; secret political parties, including the Red Strings; the distrust towards the military government; and the issue of universal suffrage. The Test Oath is strongly criticized as impossible, and North Carolina statehood, disenfranchisement, and inclusion into the Union is a regular concern for correspondents, including Hedrick. Many letters denounce W.W. Holden as provisional governor, who is accused of electioneering among the state's freedmen. Hedrick is asked multiple times to promote Jonathon Worth among Northern newspapers. Hedrick's own political ambitions are regularly discouraged by his wife, who in 1867 also writes that he should not accept the presidency of UNC. Several letters in 1868 mention signs of the Ku Klux Klan. Others discuss national politics and the impeachment of President Johnson.
Letters from late 1868 and early 1869 detail the takeover of the University of North Carolina by Col. C.L. Harris and the subsequent appointment of Solomon Pool as president. With Holden as governor, Internal Revenue business in North Carolina beomes a regular topic of correspondence. In May 1869, Hedrick writes of his changing interest from politics to the growth of industry and the activities of the Patent Office. Later letters contain reports on North Carolina news and events, including the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, Governor Holden's impeachment, the Greensboro railroad, a report on the revitalization of UNC, and other political news.
Another significant part of the collection consists of patent papers from Hedrick's career in the Patent Office, including reports and other information on disputed patent cases.
In addition to the patent papers, there is an extensive and varied collection of printed materials that is helpful in glimpsing the personal, professional, and social life of a civil servant in post-Civil War Washington. Besides the usual accumulation of advertisements, calling cards, etc., there are numerous items on the Freemasons, the Cosmos Club of Washington, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Art, and the formative years of the American Chemical Society, among others. One group of items deals with the litigation of the bankrupt house of Jay Cooke and Co., in which Hedrick had holdings. Another series of items contains commenement announcements, etc., from the various schools and colleges with which the Hedrick family was associated (including Georgetown University, New York University, the United States Naval Academy, Cooper Union, Johns Hopkins, Rutgers Female Institute of New York City). Other items relate to political events of the mid-nineteenth century, such as a group of memorial exercises for Samuel F.B. Morse, James A. Garfield, and Charles Darwin, as well as an invitation to the services for the removal of James Monroe from New York to Richmond in 1858. There are also a number of printed pieces relating directly to the events of the Civil War and Reconstruction era, including broadsides, announcements, pamphlets, and clippings.
Bills and receipts cover four decades of business transactions, beginning with Hedrick's college days. Among the miscellaneous items are drafts of political speeches, newspaper articles (mostly ante-bellum), and an assortment of school papers and genealogical items. The bound volumes accompanying the collection are three memoradum books and one daybook.
The David Newton Henderson Papers contain the office files of Congressman Henderson when he was the U.S. Representative for the Third District of North Carolina. The papers span from 1930 to 1976, but the bulk of the papers covers Henderson's years in office, 1961-1976. Henderson's predecessor, Congressman Graham A. Barden, left Henderson many papers on ongoing business, especially local projects.
The Henderson Papers contain correspondence, printed material, speeches, invitations, newspaper clippings, photographs, newsletters, financial statements, legislative reports and notes, and drafts of bills. The great majority of this collection is correspondence which Henderson's office exchanged with constituents, legislative officials, and officials of federal and state agencies.
The papers are divided into the following fifteen series:
Campaign Files
Case Files
Committee Files
Correspondence: Answer Copies
County Project Files
Engagements
Federal and State Agencies
Legislation
Military Academy Files
Newsletters and News Releases
Newspaper Clippings
Post Office Files
Speeches
Subject Files
Oversize Box
The largest series are Committee Files, County Project Files, Federal and State Agencies, Legislation, and Subject Files. The Committee Files contain material relating to Henderson's various committee and subcommittee memberships and reflect the actual creation of legislation. The Legislation Series contains drafts of specific bills and legislative reports and notes. Subject Files contain mostly constituent mail on legislation, current issues, and various subjects. County Project Files concern projects and local affairs in the Third District. The Federal and State Agencies Series reflects Henderson's role as an intermediary between constituents' problems and requests and the appropriate governmental agency which could deal with their problems.
There is some overlap among series. For example, using the broad subject Agriculture, a constituent's letter supporting an agricultural price-support bill would appear under Subject Files. Agriculture. Drafts of that specific bill might be under Legislation. Material on an agricultural cooperative project in the Third District would be in the County Project Files. A constituent's request for exemption from certain federal regulations regarding crop measurement would be under Federal and State Agencies. Agriculture, Department of. For more information summarizing the contents of each category see the introductions at the beginning of each section in the inventory.
The papers reflect many types of public opinion: organized and repetitive pressure mail, professional lobbying activities of national interest groups, letters ranging from semi-literate constituents to well-known local and national leaders. The papers show a definite paper spiral during the 1960s and 1970s with the volume of Henderson's files increasing yearly.
The Henderson Papers illustrate many national trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Henderson's work on the Post Office and Civil Service and the Public Works committees made him instrumental in matters of national importance and brought him correspondence from around the nation. These papers particularly reveal trends in federal employment practices in the 1960s and 1970s. The papers contain much material about the reorganization of the Post Office Department into the Postal Service in 1969-1970. The papers reveal public opinion and legislative trends on such issues as civil rights, the Vietnamese War, the energy crisis of the early 1970s, and the Watergate affair. Henderson illustrates well the position of a conservative southern Democratic congressman voting against all civil rights legislation, opposing extension and raising of the minimum wage, federal aid to education, the War Against Poverty, and foreign aid. He consistently supported the presidents' positions on Vietnam, right-to-Work laws, and agricultural price supports.
The Henderson Papers contain rich information on local interests, affairs, and personalities in the Third District of North Carolina. Henderson vigorously supported local interests in Congress. He vehemently opposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and other anti-tobacco legislation. Henderson's correspondence and campaign material reveal the network of the Democratic political machinery in eastern North Carolina and his relationship with the local power structure.
Specific subjects are discussed in more detail in the inventory.
Contains correspondence, notes, and newspaper clippings concerning Henderson's congressional campaigns, 1960-1974. Henderson concentrated most of his time and attention to the Democratic primary in May of each election year. There is much less material about the November election. The Campaign Files contain many lists of electoral officials, party leaders, and targeted support groups, e.g. teachers, veterans. The papers reveal the rising importance of television in political campaigns of the mid to late 1960s.
The Case Files formed a massive part of Henderson's office files. They consist of correspondence from constituents and Henderson's responses concerning problems and requests of all sorts such as pensions, military transfers, job requests, etc. Since these papers are very routine and not topical in nature, a representative sample has been retained only for the letter C, a large letter which includes a wide range of ethnic groups.
Concerns Henderson's work on the Post Office and Civil Service and Public Works committees and their various subcommittees. Contains correspondence from constituents relating to issues before the committees and much national correspondence from lobbyists and concerned parties. This category also contains much printed material, reports of committee hearings, and notes and documents relating to the formation of specific bills. Committee Files were arranged by committee, subcommittee, then general subjects within the committee.
Contains miscellaneous material about committee matters.
Henderson became chairman of this subcommittee in 1963 . Committee name was changed in 1967 . See below.
In 1969 through 1970 the Post Office Department experienced a major reorganization. First introduced in 1969 as H.R. 4, this reform was finally implemented in 1970 as H.R. 17070. This legislation converted the Post Office Department from a Cabinet-level department to an independent establishment in the executive branch of government. This independence necessitated reorganizing rates so that revenues of the Postal Service as a whole met expenses. The bills provided the framework for collective bargaining by postal employees, and enhanced the pay scale and advancement opportunities. One oversized item is located in oversized box at end of collection.
This series provides a complete record of Henderson's outgoing correspondence from 1968 through 1976. These files are composed of second carbon copies of outgoing mail. The first copy was attached to the correspondent's letter and filed away to its appropriate place. For each year the letters are filed within alphabetical folders such as all surnames beginning with letters Sl-So are in a folder so labeled. Within the folder labeled Sl-So, the letters are arranged not alphabetically but chronologically during the year.
Contains correspondence, notes, newspaper clippings and printed material concerning projects and local affairs in the Third Congressional District. Much of the material relates to projects such as urban renewal, housing developments, anti-poverty programs, water and sewer projects, the construction of recreational facilities, hospitals, and public buildings, etc. Henderson's correspondence with federal agencies, local officials, and interested constituents reflects his position as an intermediary between local interests and federal financing. The County Project Files contain a considerable amount of material from the office of Graham H. Barden. This material is indicated in the inventory by dates prior to 1961.
Includes invitations received by Henderson's office and correspondence and printed material relating to accepted engagements. This material illustrates lobbying efforts of both local and national interest groups, businesses and organizations. These papers also reveal something of Henderson's daily schedule. Materials were left in the arrangement as they were filed by Henderson's office. Accepted invitations were filed by following the date of the engagements. Declined invitations were filed as they crossed Henderson's desk, i.e. at the time when Henderson's staff responded to the invitation.
Contains mainly correspondence reflecting Henderson's role as an intermediary between constituents' problems and appropriate federal and state agencies which could resolve those problems. There is some expression of opinion by constituents over the activities, regulations, and administration of such agencies. These papers are similar to the Case Files in nature. Folder headings for North Carolina departments and agencies are preceded by N.C. Those without this indication are federal agencies. Each agency is listed alphabetically even if it is part of a larger department or agency. State and federal agencies are filed separately.
The following folders deal with Henderson's efforts as an intermediary between local petroleum dealers and federal energy authorities in the allocation of gas during the shortage.
Contains copies and drafts of specific bills, informative material about the bills, committee reports and statements, and Henderson's notes on such specific pieces of legislation. For public opinion on bills, see Subject Files. This category is not a complete file of every bill passing through Congress during Henderson's years; much of this legislation reflects Henderson's committee memberships and bills of local interest. The papers are arranged by Congress and session and specific bill number. A comprehensive listing of the title and number of each bill in this category is located at the beginning of the first box of Legislation files.
Contains general information about the service academies and guidelines for congressmen in their appointment of candidates for openings at the academies. Application materials and academic records of Third District appointees have been removed from this collection and destroyed. The Buckley Amendment of 1967 to the Priacy Act prohibits the use of such materials without the individual's written consent.
Henderson's office sent weekly newsletters to constituents which dealt with national affairs, current legislation, and Henderson's policies and views. Frequent topics included civil rights, Vietnam, and foreign aid. The news releases were bulletins sent to newspapers and radio and television stations. This series also contains letters from constituents responding to the newsletters.
Contains mostly clippings of publicity Henderson received in newspapers in the Third Congressional District.
Contains correspondence and notes concerning the building of new post office facilities and consolidation of some local post offices in the Third District. Also contains much material about the appointment of personnel. Files for local post offices were retained only for Morehead City and county seats.

Most speeches were given in the Third District at schools, colleges, rallies, civic clubs, dedications of public facilities, etc. Included also are some speeches made by Henderson in the House of Representatives (see also Subject Files. Congressional Record Remarks) and around the country. Speeches concerned national affairs, especially Vietnam and civil rights, and local projects and concerns. The speeches are arranged chronologically.
The largest and most diverse category in the Henderson Papers, the Subject Files contain correspondence and printed material concerning a wide range of subjects and legislative items. They include much public opinion on current legislation arranged both under the name of the issue itself (e.g. Gun Control) and under the name of the standing committee through which the legislation passed (e.g. Judiciary). There is similar material under Gun Control and Judiciary so both subject and committee listing should be checked. There is also much material on general subjects and administrative matters.

She lived with her husband Lawrence (Larry) Henderson in Angola doing missionary work from 1947 to 1969. The collection includes many materials from this time (including journals and letters), and she kept in touch with people from Angola throughout the remainder of her life. The collection also includes many materials documenting her and her family's life in the early 20th century in the Pacific Northwest (mostly in or around Tacoma, Washington), including photographs, diaries, children's drawings and letters, school report cards, diplomas, letters, recollections (many typed) from family members, and ledgers of household expenses.

The forty color inkjet photographs in this collection were taken by Lauren Henkin in May 2015 in and around Hale County, Alabama, part of the Alabama and Mississippi "Black Belt." The prints (17x22 inches) form part of a body of work titled "What's Lost is Found." Subjects include rural inhabitants, white and black; house interiors; church exteriors and interiors; and rural and wooded landscapes. Many of the images contain religious symbols and objects such as crosses. As part of the photographer's intent to capture the spirituality she perceived in the place and its people, captions for each image are taken from biblical verses. Collection includes five sheets, also 17x22 inches, with detailed captions and locations for each image.
The Black Belt region is noted for its black topsoil, cotton plantations, the legacy of slavery, civil rights history, and photographic history: Walker Evans, Gordon Parks, and William Christenberry both produced some of their most well-known work in these same places.
From the artist's statement: "It wasn't a place that should be simplified by an imposed narrative. The people I met had a request, 'Please, no more photos of poor kids barefoot on a front porch.' I wanted to show the complexity of a place that could in one moment take the viewer into the woods, to the home of a man that lives with his dogs in the poorest of conditions to the grounds of a mansion covered in soft southern light, to the interior of a home populated with Andrew Wyeth reproductions depicting wind and billowing curtains. I wanted to avoid stereotypical perspectives on the racial and socioeconomic divides, and instead, focus on the interconnectedness between the landscape, the flesh, and the spiritual."
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.
Five paper sheets measuring 17x22 inches, each with eight color thumbnail images of each photograph, accompanied by detailed contextual captions and image locations. Also includes two title pages, also 17x22 inches.

Hubbell, and a copy of "The Academic Writings of Ima Honaker Herron: A Checklist" by Eddie Gay Cone were added to the collection in 1986.
Collection includes business, personal, and legal correspondence of Edward B. Hicks (died 1858), lawyer and planter of Lawrenceville, Brunswick County, Virginia, and of his son, David S. Hicks, lawyer, planter, and land agent. Papers of Edward B. Hicks include jockey club dues, records connected with his duties as sheriff in 1821 and possibly later, and with Hicks' position as superintendent of schools in Brunswick County in 1847.
Included also is an extensive series of letters and papers relating to the operation, in partnership with John W. Paup, of Spring Hill plantation at Red River, Arkansas, in 1837 and later. An early letter, 1840, describes the deaths ("losses") of enslaved persons at the plantation, and the building of better quarters. Letters also show that Hicks engaged in selling enslaved persons in New Orleans during 1852. Other interesting letters are from Lewis Taylor on the War of 1812 and another, in 1817, relative to disturbances at Princeton College, Princeton, New Jersey, caused by refusal of professors to accept state bank notes.
Centering around David S. Hicks, the papers dated after 1858 are largely legal documents, notes, and correspondence concerned with his law practice and the administration of the estate of Edward R. Hicks. The most continuous series among these legal papers is a set of letters from Leigh R. Page, a Richmond attorney. Papers also pertain to the efforts of Hicks and one Turnbull to sell lands in Brunswick County to Northerners.
Included also are records of Hicks's activities as judge of Brunswick County, as dealer in Texas lands, and as an organizer of the Atlantic and Danville Railroad. One letter, June 30, 1866, from D. J. Claiborne, Jr., concerns African American congressmen in the South and his hatred for them amidst fears of a "Negro supremacy." Fifteen letters from General Thomas Ewing are concerned with the Atlantic and Danville Railroad Company.
The volumes, generally mercantile records, seem to have into the collection as a result of Hicks's legal practice and duties as sheriff in Virginia. These are chiefly in the form of account and ledger books.
One letter from November 13, 1840, recently added to the original collection, was written from John Paup, Spring Hill Plantation, Hempstead county, Arkansas, to Edward Brodnax Hicks, his partner in the plantation and resident of Brunswick County, Virginia. His thee-page letter refers to the economics of enslaved labor and buying enslaved persons; illness and the deaths of enslaved persons on the plantation; the cotton crop, insurance, and prices; and the survey of the border between Arkansas and the Republic of Texas.
Much of the correspondence on and after 1858 concerns the estate and death of Edward Hicks and the related activities of his son, David S. Hicks.
These account and ledger books seem to all originate from the Lawrenceville, Virginia area, and were generated by small mercantile businesses such as general stores. The owners of some of the ledgers have not been identified.
An account book from 1864 bears the names Hicks, Jones, and Mallory, and appears to be records of a tanyard.
Two of these daybooks (1821-1828) belonged to Edward Brodnax Hicks.
The collection consists of 10 scrapbooks donated by Dr. Higham to the Duke Manuscripts Department in 1963. Contents include images and press clippings, largely featuring German, British, and U.S. planes from World War II. Also includes one scrapbook with images of ships. All images appear to have been cut out of magazines and newspapers.
The Cornelius Baldwin Hite papers contains report sheets for Cornelius B. Hite, Jr., from several schools in Virginia, 1855-1860; letters from the period of the Civil War, for the most part dealing with the impact of the war on civilians in western Virginia; a large amount of material showing the effect of Reconstruction on Cornelius B. Hite, Jr., and his relatives, including descriptions of economic distress, politics, and the migration of many Virginians to the western United States. There are letters describing social life and community health in Winchester, Virginia, in the 1870s; conditions at Shenandoah Valley Academy, 1868; and a long trip to Texas, 1875-1876. Letters, 1890-1895, are to Elizabeth Augusta (Smith) Hite, mother of Cornelius Baldwin Hite, Jr., from her sisters and grandchildren.
The collection also contains legal papers of the Christman, Fravel, and Branson families from 1797; a 19th century copy of excerpts from a journal kept by Ann Butler (Brayne) Spotswood, 1709-1711; and legal papers and letters of the Gales family, 1824-1865. Miscellaneous items include six volumes of songs, poetry, and scrapbooks; bills and receipts; clippings; printed matter; and an account book, 1838-1841, and a ledger, 1839-1841, of Cornelius Baldwin Hite, Sr.
Collection contains two manuscript pocket diaries, dated 1867 and 1869, and two pocket memoranda books, dated 1854-1855, 1859, and 1863-1865, kept by Annie L. Hobbs, an instructor at the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College (Methodist) in Tilton, Belknap County, New Hampshire and at the Troy Conference Academy in Poultney, Rutland County, Vermont. In the diaries, Hobbs records her travels to and from her schools, evening readings, croquet games, naps, teas, Saturday excursions, her sewing work, occasional written work, receipt of letters and newspapers, Methodist festivals and Sabbath observances, and fluctuations in her health. Hobbs also regularly records her moods and her uncertainty about whether or not to go back for another term. Generally, the diaries document the life of a young female teacher living away from home, her daily routine, her social contacts, and her intellectual pursuits. In the two memoranda books, Hobbs records student names and recitation periods, Lyceum lectures she attended, mathematical equations, and her expenses for 1863 to 1865.

The Clyde Roark Hoey Papers consist of Hoey's senatorial files accumulated in his offices in Washington, D. C. and Shelby N. C. The papers cover the period from 1943 through April, 1954, but there are few items for 1943. The quantity of material is greater for the years toward the end of Hoey's career. The Hoey Papers are divided into two series: Correspondence and Subjects. For information on the structure of the collection consult the Series Description.
Incoming and outgoing correspondence with related clippings, printed material, and photographs predominates in both series. Constituent mail forms the largest category of correspondence, encompassing several types of letters and varying widely in significance and content. Many letters from constituents urge Hoey to support or oppose particular legislation, such as universal military training, grain exports to India, or tax measures. They range from the mass-produced form letter to the more detailed and analytical arguments of prominent businessmen, educators, and politicians in North Carolina. Other constituent mail relates to North Carolina projects and affairs such as power dams, defense plants, and appropriations to local interest groups. Still other constituent mail consists of requests for Hoey's assistance in obtaining employment or promotions, changing military status, obtaining visas, and similar personal matters, Routine correspondence involves requests for publications, general letters of commendation, or publicity about individual constituents
Correspondence from all areas of the country concerns legislation or provides comment on world or domestic affairs in the postwar period. Colleagues in the Senate and members of the North Carolina congressional delegation are represented in the correspondence, but frequently they write only letters of transmittal or send personal greetings. A few letters involve the Hoey family. Most of these are exchanged between Senator Hoey and his son-in-law, Dan M, Paul. For some years personal and family papers are filed with H correspondence. For more information on individuals who corresponded with Hoey, consult the Partial List of Correspondents for 1949 in the Series Description.
The main part of the Subject Series is an alphabetical file containing correspondence and printed material about national and state affairs.

Post-war materials concern the history of journalism in North Carolina; Holden's appointment by Andrew Johnson as provisional governor of North Carolina in 1865; his election as governor in 1868; Reconstruction policies; Ku Klux Klan activity in the state; the Kirk-Holden War; the "Ferrell Matter," a debt case in which Holden was the guarantor; Holden's impeachment as governor in 1870; his conviction by the N.C. Senate in 1871; his appointment as postmaster by Ulysses S. Grant in 1873; and life and politics in Washington during the period of Radical control. Of note are depositions and other evidence gathered by Holden and his supporters of various members of the Ku Klux Klan, documenting their membership and activities during 1869-1870.
The collection also includes Holden family papers, including scrapbooks and account books kept by Holden's wife and daughters; Holden's memoirs, recorded by his daughter Mary Holden Sherwood and edited by W.K. Boyd as part of the Trinity College Historical Society; some family photographs and materials related to the Holden homestead in Raleigh, N.C.; writings and poetry by Holden and his son, Joseph Holden; obituaries and clippings about Holden and his legacy; and other assorted personal and financial papers. Though removed from public life, Holden continued to write about public policy and government, sometimes critical of both parties, until his death in 1892.
Re: Holden's Postmaster duties, Raleigh, N.C.
Booklet with printed account of Holden's impeachment from 1870, with annotations from 1891.
Certificate is in two pieces.
The collection consists of four photograph albums collected and assembled by the Hollands during their time in Guatemala, from 1923-1927. The albums include gelatin silver prints in a variety of sizes, ranging from 2x3 inch snapshots to 3.5x12 inch panoramas. The prints themselves are generally in good condition, but the binding on two of the albums needs repair.
The photographs include a wide range of images, from scenery and landscapes of the Guatemala countryside, to personal photographs of the Holland family and their friends. Album 1, a Kodak 7x12 black album, appears to have been created by Corabelle Anderson, Philip Holland's wife and Pito and Isabelle's mother. The creator has included captions for nearly every photograph, which have been written in ink on the edge of the print. The majority of images in this album are snapshots, highlighting the activities of the family, such as their travels through Guatemala, their home and the American Legation building in Guatemala City, family photographs of the children (including images of Isabelle and Pito playing and posing for the camera), and photographs of Holland's colleagues. Some of the first photographs in the album are of President Harding's memorial service at the American Legation in Guatemala. The album also includes images of Antigua, including its markets, the Agua volcano, and Mayan ruins; coffee farms and fences of the United Fruit Company; church processions and parades in Guatemala City; the American Consulate; San Jose, which appears to have been the family's port when travelling to and from Guatemala; and photographs of the family hunting and hiking in the Guatemala countryside.
Album 2, a brown album labelled Photographs, includes very few captions and has no indication of who created it. It includes additional family photographs, but seems to contain more photographs of Guatemalan people, especially street scenes with Guatemalans in native dress; markets with Guatemalan women selling food or products; local musicians with instruments; and local children. This album also includes images of Guatemala City's Columbus memorial; Tecpan's palace, markets, churches, and people; and more photographs from San Jose, Antigua, and the Agua volcano. There are some duplicates between Albums 1 and 2. Of note are the various means of transportation captured in this album, including automobiles being pulled up a mountain by hand, streetcars in Guatemala City, and mules or horses for traversing rural areas.
Album 3 appears to have been created by Dr. and Mrs. Anderson from 1923-1924. It includes ink captions on the prints, which again are snapshot-sized, as well as a few pages of scrapbook materials (such as cards, clippings, and tickets) in the album's back pages. There are very few images of the Holland family. Instead, a large proportion of the photographs are of travels throughout Guatemala. Scenes include Guatemala City, Antigua, Lake Atitlan, Panajachel, Tecpan, Escuintla, Guatemala City, Solola, Chichicastenango, Patulul, and Quirigua. It also includes images from San Jose's beaches and piers, where the couple seems to have caught a United Fruit Company pacific steamer. Along with landscapes, local architecture and buildings, and street scenes from throughout the country, this album has a few photographs highlighting United Fruit Company's farms, Mayan ruins, volcanoes, Guatemalans in native dress, the firing and selling of pottery, and local markets.
Album 4 consists largely of panoramic photographs, each stamped on the verso or on the mount by Boston photographer Henry J. Thayer. His relationship to the Holland family is not clear, but the album cover is stamped P.H. Most of Thayer's panoramics are titled, in the negative, directly on the print. The images include Guatemala's West Coast, featuring railroad stations, Mayan ruins near Quirigua, and native huts. Other photographs are from Antigua, including both street scenes and skylines with the Plaza Central, Santa Carolina church, and the Fuego and Agua volcanoes. Guatemala City is another featured city: Thayer's panoramas include its Mapa en Relieve (a scale model public monument of Guatemala's geography, opened in 1904), city vistas and plazas, and a bullfight. Other areas of the country represented in the images include Tecpan, Solola, Chichicastenango, Lake Atitlan and its surrounding areas, the Quetzaltenango Valley and its local markets and plaza, and the Zacapa desert, among others. Thayer also took occasional pictures highlighting Guatemalan history, with images of the Quetzaltenango monument to Ticam Uman (the last king of the Quiche), the Bridge of the Slaves near Santa Rosa, and Indian mounds near Tecpan. This album had several inserted pages and images, which have been foldered separately to protect the original album. Most of the loose pages are additional panoramas by Thayer, but there are also some black-and-white 6.5x8.5 undated prints taken by the U.S. Army Air Service. These images were clearly taken from the air, and show Guatemalan cities and villages.
The papers of Frederick William Mackey Holliday contain letters from Holliday while a student at Yale University, 1846; papers relating to the 33rd Virginia Regiment, which Holliday raised and commanded during the Civil War; letters concerning the International Exhibition held in Philadelphia in 1876, at which Holliday served as a commissioner from Virginia; and letters and papers relating to Holliday's election as governor of Virginia in 1877 and letters from his term as governor, for the most part dealing with routine political and administrative matters.
Printed material includes The Struggles, Perils and Hopes of the Negroes in the United States, a pamphlet by Reverend C. Clifton Penick, 1893; a typed copy of The Virginia Debt in Politics, by William L. Royall, published in 1897 as History of the Virginia debt controversy; and broadsides, campaign literature, and other political material.
Volumes include ten scrapbooks of clippings; letter books of Holliday as a student at Yale and the University of Virginia, 1845-1849, and as governor of Virginia, 1878-1879; and four record books concerning Holliday's legal work.

Collection includes correspondence, notes, diaries, and literary works of George Frederick Holmes (1820-1897), scholar, educator, author; and correspondence of William Howard Perkinson (1861-1898), educator and son-in-law of Holmes; and of Joseph Henry Herndon Holmes (1794-1831) and Mary Ann (Pemberton) Holmes (1790-ca. 1862), father and mother of George Frederick Holmes. The papers of Joseph Henry Herndon Holmes, barrister of Demerara, British Guiana, consist of treatises on contracts and exchange of money, fragments of poetry, poems, his will, and pictures. Among the papers of Mary Ann (Pemberton) Holmes are the following: a brief record of her life in Demerara with interesting comments on the people and the country, family history and genealogy, personal letters, epitaphs, and verses of Stephen Pemberton written while attending Oriel College, Oxford, England.
The papers of George Frederick Holmes are chiefly concerned with family affairs, including financial troubles, and accounts from his wife, Eliza Lavalette (Floyd) Holmes, of the unsatisfactory performance of Negro servants; accounts of Holmes's connection with educational institutions, notably Richmond College, Virginia, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, the University of Mississippi, Oxford, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. The correspondence throws considerable light on dissensions in the Board of Visitors at the College of William and Mary in 1848. The collection consists of Holmes's correspondence with leading literary figures and educators of the South; notes and works on almost every phase of philology, grammar, history, political science, and economics; notes for lectures; articles and manuscripts for books and periodicals; lists of students; examination questions; and diaries which cover a great part of the period from 1856 to 1891. The collection includes a letter book, 1834-1874, containing contemporary copies of letters, in Holmes's hand, of many notable figures, among whom are E. E. Bellinger, Auguste Comte, J. D. B. DeBow, Thos. R. Dew, R. T. W. Duke, Wm. H. Ellet, Geo. Fitzhugh, John B. Floyd, Wm. Harper, R. R. Howison, R. W. Hughes, D. F. Jamison, Wm. S. Lewis, Francis Lieber, P. N. Lynch, Jno. McClintock, Cornelius Mathews, W. E. Martin, B. B. Minor, W. G. Minor, T. V. Moore, J. D. Munford, Edw. Nicholson, Wm. Ogilby, Cotesworth Pinckney, J. D. Pope, Wm. C. Preston, Jas. Ryder, W. G. Simms, R. W. Singleton, A. G. Summer, Jno. R. Thompson, Jas. H. Thornwell, Samuel Tyler, and D. K. Whitaker.
Papers of William Howard Perkinson are confined to a few records of his work as professor of Latin and Greek at the University of Virginia, a few business papers, and records of the administration of the estate of George Frederick Holmes. Some of Perkinson's letters to his wife give glimpses of the management of the university and of his work. M. Schele De Vere and W. Gordon McCabe, as well as a number of scholars in England, were among Perkinson's correspondents.

Box 7 also contains notes and correspondence by Mary Anne Holmes, Joseph H. H. Holmes, and Stephen Pemberton.
Collection consists of the exhibit detail book, probably produced in the 1950s or 1960s, containing text and illustrations for the exhibit "Ostetrical Forceps Delivery," curated by Dr. Frederick H. Falls and illustrated by Charlotte S. Holt, as well as six exhibition panels.
The exhibit consisted of five sections: Anesthesia; Technique; Management of Newborn; Pathology; and History and Indications. Within each section, Falls and Holt presented examples of situations leading to a forceps birth, correct technique for the use of forceps, the issues arising from this method, and the treatment of the newborn after this procedure. The five larger exhibition panels feature hand-drawn color illustrations, text, and photographs of models, and measure 39.5 x 26.5 inches; the smaller title panel measures 11 3/8 x 17 1/2 inches.
Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.
Series consists of an exhibit detail album, probably produced in the 1950s or 1960s, containing text and illustrations for the exhibit "Ostetrical Forceps Delivery," by Dr. Frederick H. Falls and illustrated by Charlotte S. Holt.
Collection consist of historical medical instruments and artifacts, art objects, realia, and other three-dimensional objects, primarily originating from Europe and the United States, but including some artifacts from China and Japan. Ranging in age from the late 16th to the late 20th centuries, objects include physician's medical kits and pharmaceutical items (often in the original cases and bags); clinical equipment used in amputation, obstetrics, opthalmology, surgery, neurology, early electrical therapies, and in research and diagnostic settings; instructional objects such as anatomical models; and art objects such as apothecary jars, a bas-relief memento mori, a marble skull, and fetish figures.
There are many models of microscopes, from a small monocular "flea glass" to mid-20th century models. Other early medical instruments and supplies include amputation saws, bleeding bowls, cupping glasses, hypodermic needles, infant and invalid feeders, lancets, opthalmoscopes, pill rollers, stethoscopes, syringes, and other items. A more unusual item - and one of the larger pieces - is an adult walker made of wood, dating perhaps to the 19th century or earlier.
Of interest is a large collection of early anatomical and diagnostic human models from China and continental Europe, in the shape of small, intricately detailed manikins, most crafted from ivory. Some feature removable anatomical parts, and female figures often include a removable fetus. There is also a model illustrating acupuncture points. Other instructional artifacts include glass slides used in medical school lectures.
Most of these objects were photographed by Medical Library staff; at a later time, digital images of almost all of the objects in the collection were added to the online Duke University Historical Images in Medicine database, linked in this collection guide and now available through the Duke Digital Repository. Many of the original black-and-white photographic prints are filed in the History of Medicine Picture File collection. See the Related Materials section in this collection guide for links to these resources.

Zeiss compound monocular microscope with mechanical stage. Signed: Carl Zeiss, Jena, No. 41871. Brass and black laquer on a cast-iron base. This microscope has the jug handle design which was introduced in 1898. Basically a hand grip was added to the limb of the microscope; at its best, the handle was integrated and sleek. The style did not last long and ended before 1920. White lettering on the cast-iron horseshoe base indicates the microscope once belonged to Dr. Frederic Moir Hanes, chair of the Department of Medicine.
Dr. Carl Zeiss founded a business in Jena, Germany and began making microscopes in 1847. His was the dominant optical firm in the world from the beginning of the 20th century through 1945 when it was seperated into two firms following partition of Germany after World War II. Many firms have been associated with the Zeiss firm and have produced Zeiss products under license or as partners. Bausch & Lomb, which originated in Rochester, NY in 1853, was among those.

In the 18th century there was a demand for microscopes which could be kept in a small space and carried into the field. The "pack-away" microscope reached its heyday between 1790 and 1830. Such instruments were made for the amateur market since no serious microscopist would want to keep dismantling his instrument. The Cary-type microscope came in a limited variety of sizes. This is one of the larger versions.

Signed: R. & J. Beck, London & Philadelphia, 8292. Brass and lacquer microscope with curved "Lister Limb" (the arm which attached to the body tube to the base) which was designed by Joseph Jackson Lister.
The firm began as Smith and Beck in 1847 and became R. & J. Beck in 1869 and eventually Beck & Beck. It was one of the first British makers to develop factory production methods and to manufacture to standard dimensions.
Entirely of brass, including the round base. The wooden case has a few surviving accessories including: a small case of specimen slides with identifying label inside the top of the case. It is unsigned.
Unsigned. Brass with scrolled legs.
This unsigned brass microscope is mounted on a rectangular metal base with a black matte finish. The stage is supported by two round pillars and can be adjusted to tilt. The body-tube swivels from the pillar to which the stage is attached and has a bull's-eye condenser fixed to the front on a jointed arm. The mirror is missing.
Compound binocular, signed: M. Pillischer, London, No. 1441. This brass microscope has four high-quality objective lenses and two sets of eyepieces housed in the original wooden case with brass handle.
A great advance in optics was achieved in the mid 19th century with the development of achromatic lenses. These employed a combination of lens elements, constructed from two or more different types of glass, to correct the spherical and chromatic aberations that had limited the image quality and resolution of lenses for the previous two hundred years. The optical binocular vision is different from that in modern microscopes. It reduces resolution slightly but gives a stereoscopic image.
Signed: Carl Zeiss, Jena, No. 27233. Brass with black lacquered iron base. Wooden case with metal label: E. Admet, Paris. Accessories include lens and occulars.
Dr. Carl Zeiss founded a business in Jena, Germany and began making microscopes in 1847. His was the dominant optical firm in the world from the beginning of the 20th century through 1945 when it was separated into two firms following partition of Germany after World War II. Many firms have been associated with the Zeiss firm and have produced Zeiss products under license or as partners. Bausch & Lomb, which originated in Rochester, N.Y. in 1853, was among those.
Simple monocular microscope, signed E. Culpepper, Londini. Brass with ivory handle. Housed in a small box covered in fish-skin and lined with green velvet. Some of the original parts are missing (notably the extension for opaque objects); however, it does include: six brass-mounted objectives, four ivory sliders, one brass slider, or animalcule cage, for living specimens, one opaque specimen holder with black and white disks and forceps, and one small ivory talc box.
Developed by 1710, the brass screw-barrel microscope was the most common pocket microscope produced by instument makers in the 18th century. Intended primarily for tranparent specimens, this single lens microscope's small size, ease of use, and low price made it quite popular among amateurs. Normally held by an ivory handle screwed to the side of the body, the microscope could also be mounted via a ball joint at the top of a pillar which stood on a flat tripod. Over time many modifications were made to the original design and numerous accessories were employed which allowed a broader range of use.

Minkisi (singular nkisi) are ritual objects used by the BaKongo (people of the Congo) for oath taking and healing. They are complex objects that derive their power from the dead, and to them, paradoxically, have been attributed the abilities both to afflict and to heal, to visit good as well as evil on a person.

Popular in England between 1820 and 1850, the drum microscope evolved from a design introduced in 1738 by London optician Benjamin Martin, author of the "Pocket Reflecting Microscope."

One of the first American microscopes was made in 1850 by C.A. and H.R. Spencer of Canastota, New York. Spencer lenses earned a reputation at home and abroad and some experts considered them superior to any European product. Spencer objectives received a Gold Medal at the 1878 Paris Exhibition. The firm subsequently moved to Buffalo in 1890. The complex business history of the firm involved multiple names and leadership changes. In 1935 the Spencer Lens Company was absorbed by the American Optical Company.

A caustic pencil is a short stick of medication usually containing silver nitrate, used to cauterize skin, for instance for the treatment of nosebleeds, removal of warts, or pyogenic granuloma. They are not used as a treatment for minor cuts. A frequent source of confusion appears to be the difference between styptic and caustic pencils. Silver nitrate sticks are often used for hemostasis in medical situations where patients are not under general anesthesia, where electrocautery would be painful and inconvenient.

Press clippings document mentions of Hopwood, Seigler, and their dojo in print media, largely from Triangle-area publications. Materials from the National Women's Martial Arts Federation (NWMAF) provide documentation of that organization's history, particularly its early years. Hopwood and Seigler were both very active in the organization, and Hopwood served as its archivist for a 10-year period. There is also extensive documentation of NWMAF's yearly training camps for women and girls. Materials from other women's martial arts groups across the country are well-documented, as are materials on sexual assault and rape prevention, particularly from the Triangle area. Also included are books and periodicals on the topic of women's martial arts and self-defense. Photographs document the dojo's work, as well as national training sessions conducted by Hopwood and Seigler. Other audio-visual material consists of training films and examples of the dojo's instructors at work. Consists of materials generated by and relating to the North Carolina dojo founded by Kathy Hopwood, known over time as the Triangle Women's Karate Association, Triangle Women's Martial Arts, and finally SafeSkills. Largely consists of programming and educational materials focusing on self-defense strategies for women and children. Includes some correspondence and files documenting the individual work of Hopwood and Siegler. Also includes organizational newsletters published by the dojo over the years, published articles by Kathy Hopwood, and a booklet entitled Touching the Past detailing the organization's history in Box 23.
Drafts, notes, thoughts, reflections and papers about self-defense and martial arts, focusing on the why and how of teaching and what social obstacles are in the way.

Collection includes, but is not limited to writings, research and subject files, project files, talks/speeches, and files documenting group work.
Collection comprises a letter (dated 1909 September 22) from Julia Ward Howe to Magister H.R. Sanborn of Concord, Massachusetts. The letter was written from Green Peace, Bedford, New York (Howe's son's house). The main topic of the letter is Howe's unnamed poem which she will read at the upcoming Hudson-Fulton celebration on the evening of the 27th. The Hudson-Fulton Celebration was held in New York and New Jersey from September 25 to October 9, 1909. The purpose was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson‚Äôs discovery of the Hudson River and the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton‚Äôs first use of the paddle steamer on the Hudson in 1807. Howe also mentions the books she has been reading. Included with the letter is an additional envelope addressed to J.L. Sanborn of Bradford, Massachusetts. It appears to have contained Howe's letter and been sent a few days later.
Collection consists chiefly of research and planning materials deriving from Hudson's ground-breaking work during the 1950s on endemic syphilis in the Middle East, in the regions of modern-day Syria and Iraq. The "Bejel Project," as it was known, from a term for endemic syphilis, is documented through correspondence, planning documents, case files, reports, hand-drawn maps, and related articles and other writings. Most of the patients mentioned are only referred to by first names. The bulk of the material dates from 1948 to 1952, the lifespan of Hudson's project. The collection also includes drafts of writings concerning the history and epidemiology of venereal and non-venereal syphilis in colonial-period Americas and in Europe.
Forms part of the Trent Manuscripts Collection ans was acquired by the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University. Additional papers and many photographs relating to Hudson and his work can be found in another Ellis Hudson collection in the Rubenstein Library, which is represented in the online catalog and finding aid.
Original folder titles have been retained. Dates range chiefly from 1948-1952.
Contains very detailed reports from the beginning of the project, including notes about setting up the laboratory and project headquarters, shipping equipment, lab animals, and medical supplies, difficulties in the field, tensions among players (both political and cultural), and assessments of personnel and situations.
Folders contain articles by various authors, reprints, drafts of writings, notes, and correspondence, including a long series of exchanges about the etymology in Arabic and Hebrew of various words for leprosy, yaws, and syphilitic symptoms.
The collection consists primarily of first editions, limited editions, translations, and other editions (many of them autographed or inscribed, 1965-1998) of the works of Anne Tyler, delineating her prolific career.

The records of the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) span the years 1918 to 2020, with the bulk of the materials from the late 20th and early 21st century. The materials document the activities of ICTJ in its support of peace processes and to the pursuit of legal reparations and reconciliation in areas of conflict involving human rights violations. Formats in the collection include ICTF office and administrative files, annual reports, single articles, legal journals, human rights organization publications, reports and white papers, conference proceedings, newspapers and clippings, trial transcripts, teaching materials, and photographs, as well as some posters and other ephemera such as fliers, graphics, invitations, and programs. There are many audiovisual and digital formats.
There are four main series: Geographic Files, Reference and Reports, Program and Subject Files, and Administrative Files. The Geographic series contains materials from countries directly impacted by the work of ICTJ and its partners. It is arranged by continent and then by country. These materials cover virtually every major case of human rights abuse and violation worldwide. There are also materials on affiliated armed conflicts such as the Iraq War and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; violent ethnic clashes; refugee movements; refugee and detention camps; women's rights; and case studies of human rights abuses.
The Reference and Reports series formed ICTJ's documentation library. The Program and Subject files contain thematically-arranged publications about ICTJ's main subject areas, such as transitional justice and reparations, as well as the programatic materials from ICTJ conferences, workshops, publications, truth commissions, and program divisions. The final series, administrative files, is largely comprised of the files of former ICTJ presidents Alex Boraine and Juan Mendez and other staff files, including Louis Bickford, director of multiple ICTJ units. The staff files and the institutional memory files come together to form the narrative of the creation and work of ICTJ since its beginnings in 2001.
Each series also lists audiovisual materials and digital files. These materials are inserted into the series they correspond with. Formats include Betamax tapes, mini-DVs, DVDs, CDs, VHS tapes, and cassette tapes. The audiovisual materials include trial recordings, staff interviews, conference recordings, and truth commission proceedings; some of these were digitized by ICTJ staff. The born-digital records contain similar materials and also include training materials, ICTJ administrative materials, and program specific documents.
Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive at Duke University.
The Geographic series, the largest in the collection, is comprised of files representing about 100 countries and forms the backbone of ICTJ's collection. The country files include ICTJ reports, journal articles, publications about governance, rule of law, political stability, reparations, and human rights violations, as well as materials from various country's truth and reconciliation commissions. These materials are unique to each country and provide insight into the impact ICTJ's work has on every citizen, from victims to perpetrators, children and women to ex-combatants.
The multi-continent records contain oversize posters and newspapers collected by ICTJ from several countries across the globe.
Oversize material including newspapers from Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Ghana and posters from Colombia, East Timor, Germany, Liberia, Kenya, and Latin America.
Each African country contains journal articles and other publications, including ICTJ reports, related to governance, rule of law, political stability, truth and reconciliation, reparations, and human rights violations.

The Rwanda Videotapes and Audiotapes section of the International Monitor Institute records contains descriptions of 47 tapes and 282 audiotapes collected by IMI that depict human rights issues and themes in Rwanda. These materials span the years 1992-1999. The videotapes largely document massacre sites and mass graves, evacuations, the role of missionaries and human rights activists, and conditions in refugee camps holding both victims and killers. Several documentaries and news reports examine the development of a genocidal ideology in Rwanda tied to its colonial past, as well as offer histories of Tutsi/Hutu animosity, including the role of the Belgian colonial government, France, and the Catholic Church. Many of the materials in this collection offer an analysis of government structure and politics in Rwanda before and after the genocide. In addition, this collection includes various news segments reporting on the movements of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and the Rwanda Army as well as the effectiveness of the United Nations in the conflict; includes a documentary on Belgian soldiers killed in Rwanda.
The majority of audiotapes in this collection are RTLM and Radio Rwanda broadcasts inciting violence and orchestrating the genocide, encouraging youth to join military actions, and frequently referring to specific targets, such as Bilyogo and Nyamirambo. Broadcasts also include frequent reference to Inyenzi (cockroaches) and Inkotani (Tutsi Rebel Army). Many of the RTLM broadcasters accuse the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) of the assassination of President Habiyarimana and argue that the Inkotani want to exterminate Hutus and so they must, in turn, be exterminated. Broadcasters speak out against French intervention and accuse the Belgians of alignment with the Rebel Army. The remaining audiotapes were produced by Reporters without Borders (RSF).
The majority of the materials in this collection are in French and Kinyarwanda. Both documentaries and news reports take the form of interviews with Rwandans about the massacres and interviews with members of the RPF as well as with figures involved with organizing the killings. The collection includes interviews with notable figures, such as Th√©oneste Bagosora on his role in the genocide, Ferdinand Nahimana, the former director of Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) about his failure to stop broadcasts that fueled the genocide, as well as accounts given by members of the death squad.
The series in this collection include the Rwanda Videotapes Series, the Rwanda Audiotapes Series (Audiocassette), and the Rwanda Audiotapes Series (Electronic Records). The bulk of the material for this collection belongs to the Audiotapes Series. Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive. Further material from the IMI Rwanda records can be found in IMI's organizational records, including printed transcripts of many of the audiotapes. All videotapes in this collection are in Betacam SP format. Please note that the descriptions of the tapes in this collection are based on IMI's data and were not originally drafted by Rubenstein Library Staff. Further organizational material on Rwanda can be found in the International Monitor Institute Records, also at the Rubenstein Library. Air Date: 1996 Aug. 15

This report begins with Rwandans being interviewed at a grave site and follows with churches being accused of not showing a strong moral conscience, as well as denying any responsibility. An interview is featured with a Tai Chi professor, showing how he works to instill in the minds of Rwandans the 4 qualities of Tai Chi discipline: softness, humility, realism and patience. A close-up of a classroom follows, where Rwandans are learning self-discipline and self-control. It is believed that had the Rwandans taught self-control, the massacres would not have happened. The program focuses on Tai Chi training as a method to help heal the ills of the society and prevent future killing.

"Sitting on a Volcano" is the first in a three-part series on Rwanda by independent reporters Daniele Lacourse and Yvan Patry. In this report, Lacourse and Patry trace the exodus of Hutus who fled Rwanda to take refuge in neighboring countries. The reporters discuss the difficulties of life in the refugee camps, focusing on camps in the Democratic Republic of Congo near Goma, where thousands are falling victim to daily violence and disease. UN officials Chris Janowski, Guy De Tousignant and Luc Andre Racineare are interviewed. The report also focuses on assurances by the Rwandan government that it is safe for refugees to return home. "Sitting on a Volcano" criticizes the international community for continuing to feed the killers in these refugee camps outside of Rwanda while failing to acknowledge grave human rights violations in Rwanda. The report concludes by making the case that until those responsible for the genocide are brought to justice, Rwanda cannot begin to heal itself.

This video focuses on the murder of two Canadian missionaries, killed for having protested against corruption and human rights violations. The first of the two, Brother Fran√ßois Cardinal, worked at the controversial Rwanda College of Rambura , funded by the Canadian government and located in President Habyarimana's hometown. The report shows how Brother Cardinal was shot after charging that Canadian aid money was being diverted to the Rwandan president's advisors. The report also points out that Brother Cardinal's killers were never found. The second Canadian missionary featured on this video is Father Claude Simard, the only Canadian to have stayed in Rwanda during the genocide. Father Simard was murdered in 1994, after the genocidal regime had been overthrown by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The report discusses how Father Simard risked his life to rescue Tutsis and speculates that his killers were Hutus acting to prevent Father Simard's testimony. However, the video goes on to reveal that Father Simard had made enemies within the current RPF regime by speaking out against reprisal killings against the Hutus. The investigation carried out by this team of journalists also raises some disturbing questions about Canada's own role in the Rwandan genocide.

This video features Fran√ßoise Saunier, an attorney with Doctors Without Borders, interviewing Fran√ßois-Xavier Nsanzuwera, the Rwandan Chief Prosecutor, and Joseph Matata, a human rights activist in Rwanda. Both Nsanzuwera and Matata discuss their disillusionment with the lack of intervention on the part of the international community in the face of the Rwandan genocide. Both of these individuals also focus on how they took it upon themselves to gather evidence that could help bring people responsible for the genocide to justice. Saunier seeks to show how the UN has yet to come any closer on delivering the justice promised to the Rwandans and the world. While Saunier visits the United Nations in New York and in the Hague, Mr. Matata completes his report in Belgium. Fran√ßois Xavier conducts interviews in Rwandan prisons, making sure there is sufficient evidence to convict, prosecute and start trials. At the time of this report, Doctors Without Borders and 42 other agencies had been ordered to leave Rwanda for political bias. The report also shows the International Tribunal's announcement of the first eight indictments for genocide. The report cites that no arrests have been made, however, and trials for those accused of genocide-related crimes in Rwanda have yet to take place.

The debate is taking place in Belgium in August 1991. The subject of the discussion is on the multiparty system. For a period of thirty years the Rwandan government operated under one party system (the Mouvement r√©publicain national pour la d√©mocratie et le d√©veloppement [MRND]). On June 10th 1991 president Habyarimana declared a multiparty system. The focus in this debate is on the creation of a National Assembly, a process which was not provided in the constitution but reclaimed by opposition parties. In the debate there is a balance between Rwandan scholars and Belgian experts. The Habyarimana's government at that time of the debate was represented by Francois Ngarukiyintwari, Rwandan ambassador in Belgium.

The report begins with three people accused of genocide explaining that they were forced to commit their crimes. Their testimony is overlapped with footage of various atrocities. The camera then follows Madeleine, a Tutsi returning to Rwanda from France. The experience of the returning refugee is one of joy at being "back home" and one of sorrow upon learning who has died. Th√©r√®se is another Tutsi who fled during the genocide and returns to find her home destroyed and her family dead. She confronts the sister of the man she believes led the attack against her family. The report then gives a brief history of Tutsi/Hutu animosity emphasizing the role of the Belgian colonial government and the Catholic Church. However, the report's main focus is on the role of the French government starting in 1975 which marks the first of several military pacts signed between the French and Habyarimana. Through a series of interviews and photos of signed documents the report builds a compelling case against the French. Mitterand, in particular, becomes quite involved in Rwanda's affairs and when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launches its first invasion in October 1990, the French are there to halt their advance. The French mission is called NORWA and it does not call for direct involvement in the conflict. But several eyewitnesses as well as official Rwandan documents point to a French presence on the frontlines. The report then shifts its focus to the testimony of Janvier Afrika who alerted authorities to the existence of an organization within the government called Network Zero. Network Zero is purported to have carried out political assassinations and to have overseen the development of highly incendiary propagandist newspapers like Kangura. The documentary also points to the speech by Leon Mugesera in November of 1992, which along with Nahimana's creation of Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) in 1993 helped set the tone for the genocide. The report continues with a series of interviews of people like Bagosora and Hutu who have found refuge in the safety zone provided by the French in Operation Turquoise. Everyone maintains their innocence and blames the violence on the population's violent reaction to Habyarimana's death. The report does point out that the violence in the south, in Butare, did not begin until two weeks after the president's death. The documentary ends on the theme of justice. The chief prosecutor of Kigali points out the difficulties in prosecuting such a large number of accused. Indeed almost everyone is a victim or a perpetrator of genocide. Conditions in the Kigali prison are terrible and the process of bringing people to trial is very slow. The final question is whether genocide in Africa bears as much weight as one in Europe.

This video explores the extent of France's involvement in Rwanda and the degree to which it can be implicated in the events that lead to the genocide. It also attempts to explain why a European power would take such a strong interest in the affairs of such a small central African nation. The report begins by explaining that President Francois Mitterrand sent French troops into Rwanda, a country it had never colonized in October 1990 following the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invasion. According to various officials, France wanted to maintain relations with a French-speaking Rwanda and feared the effects of an RPF-influenced government. The video traces the genesis of the RPF back to the refugees who fled Rwanda during the Hutu revolution in the early 1960's. Many of the Tutsi went to Uganda where they learned English and began planning their eventual return to their homeland. The report hypothesizes that the French worried that the United States overly influenced the RPF. The French accused Paul Kagame, the RPF leader, of being little more than a CIA product. Kagame was in fact invited to the states to receive military training. The report then explains that the French qualified the RPF invasion in 1990 as a terrorist act and sent French troops in to evacuate foreign expatriates. However, Panorama learned that among the French deployment there was a strong training contingency, intelligence experts and military advisors. The French maintained a military presence in Rwanda until the signing of the Arusha agreements in 1993. The report reflects on the fact that France provided more aid and development money to Rwanda during the Habyarimana regime than any other European power. However, since the new RPF government has taken power, France has all but abandoned this once favored nation. The report includes numerous interviews with government officials including President Mitterrand's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Presidential Adviser on African Affairs from 1988 to 1992. Jean Carbonare who lead the International Human Rights Commission mission to Rwanda in 1993 and was President of "Operation Survie" immediately following the genocide, is quoted as saying "I am very critical of my country before, during and after the genocide. There is a great deal of suspicion about the delivery of arms. You can't on one hand give arms to those responsible for genocide and then say we take pity on the Rwandan people, we'll give you humanitarian aid. I think this is a question of consistency. I'm very unhappy, as a Frenchman, to see my country not have that consistency."

In the video Bagosora explain his role in previous government and denies his involvement in death squad killing before and during the genocide. When asked if he could go to the international criminal tribunal and answer questions in relation to the war and his involvement, Bagosora approved the idea of the international tribunal and agreed to stand trial if accused. But he refused to stand trial in Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) court he accused to be judge and jury. Bagosora argued that the security council caused all problems in Rwanda by imposing an arm embargo on the Forces Rwandaises de D√©fense (FAR) army. Bagosora also accused the international community for conspiracy by collaborating with the Tutsi minority group. Bagosora denies accusation for having said in Arusha that he was going to prepare an apocalypse if the Arusha Peace agreement was going to be implemented.

"A psychological search into the human soul. Lindsey Hilsum had launched a full investigation reaching the core of evil. Her analysis was that the core of Rwanda was rotten and even the church which was supposed to be the "moral authority, the most powerful institution in the land had a rotten center."
"You haven't yet discovered man, neither in his greatness nor in his misery," Ntezimana, a theologian, told Lindsey Hilsum. His theory was that the missionaries had a historical responsibility. They brought the Christian revelation, which reinforced the traditional attitude of naivet√©. It was easy not to question the teachings of churches. Everything the priest said was taken as truth. That behavior was the prelude to genocide. The church in this search for truth was accused of encouraging the evil that took root in the hearts of the Rwandans. Orders were blindly carried out. Many churches are under investigation for their participation in the killings. Some nuns and priests fled to Zaire. Others have adopted the denial attitude, few Catholic leaders spoke out during genocide, and many were helpless witnesses to the carnage.
Hilsum goes deeply into the problem, questioning herself and her actions during the genocide. Hilsum was present at the time of the massacres and found it hard to help anyone because "she wasn't brave enough, or strong enough to protect them." The important thing is not to pass judgment on the people but to investigate the reason that lead to the madness.

This Rwanda Nightmare is a story of a journey of extremists tearing the country apart, a true account of the numbing horror that was Rwanda in 1994. Does anyone understand what happened in this part of the world? According to Catherine Bond the "agony seemed to the outside world a senseless tribal bloodbath war" that had no impact on the international community and reinforced its lack of responsiveness toward the killings. However, to many observers and experts on this central part of Africa, the legacy of colonialism fueled the conflict and exacerbated the division between Hutu and Tutsi which became the source of tension since the country's independence in 1992. The conviction that the other is the plague, that the only way is the eradication of a no ethnic but just socially and economically different group " If you want to eliminate rats, you have to start with the little ones", or that " Their progeny are the rats of the future" make one wonder who and what reinforced the hatred that became so embedded in the Rwanda culture. The government had its fair share of the blame by using a strategy that that systematically destroyed the bonds of family and friends. By doing so it spread the blame to tens of thousands of Rwandan to alleviate its own guilt.

2. A history of United Nations intervention in Africa. The first intervention took place in 1960 in the Congo. The latest UN mission in Somalia was highly criticized. The American led force switched from humanitarian in scope to military following the deaths of several American soldiers. The Americans are accused of acting outside the control and command of the UN even though the UN ultimately had to take political responsibility. The operation was characterized by a "total lack of peacekeeping experience."
3. (1994 May 10) The focus here is the refugee problem on Tanzania's border, problems with water and sanitation. Mixed Tutsi/Hutu couples are running from the problems in Rwanda and living in the same squalid conditions as everyone else in the camps.
In the wake of failed mediations and negotiations, Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers have continued advancing towards Kigali.
The RPF is opposed to foreign countries meddling in the war.

The Tanzanian General is unhappy about all the Rwandan corpses littering Tanzanian water sources.
4. (1994 May 13) The focus is on the Rwanda/Burundi border: the one has descended into hell the other is teetering on the edge of anarchy.

There is footage of a village outside of Gitarama. It is difficult to see what the international community could do to make a difference in the face of such horror.
5. (1994 Aug. 14) Questions are asked about the effectiveness of the UN peacekeeping mission.

"The International Tribunal created in November 1994 has no investigative team in Rwanda. The lone prosecutor in his empty Kigali office personifies the hypocrisy of current international policy with respect to the Rwandan tragedy: A parody of justice with no power and no muscle."
Goldstone at The Hague: "The process must be sped up."
9. (1995 Mar. 15) (Newsnight) Refugees in eastern Zaire engaged in military training in the middle of the night. Kaminyola camp has become a training camp for militiamen instead of a place of refuge for civilians. The United Nations is very concerned about the situation. Recruiting combatants from refugee camps is against UN regulations. Troops hidden and official are training and they are armed. They believe the army has only lost a battle, not the war.
In refugee camps Ngeze gathers the youth around him and feeds their appetite for war against "Tutsi oppression." He writes: "We know our enemy and we know where he lives. Every one of us has to get ready to save our country with any weapon he can lay his hands on‚Ä¶ There is no question of waiting‚Ä¶ saying 'when shall we go back?' we have no time to wait. We must do our best. Even if we should die, we shall die in Rwanda, not in a foreign land. We must show the RPF that they made a mistake when they shared our country out amongst themselves."

The BBC Newsnight has invited many guests to the studio, all specialists on Africa, to reflect upon and dissect the Rwandan crisis. At the time this special program was aired the crisis was still going on. 20.000 had recently died of cholera in the refugee camps; 100.000 children were without parents or family; the international community was trying to recognize the new government. A myriad of political and diplomatic maneuvering had already taken place on the Rwandan crisis: hence an offer from Strasbourg to oversee the investigation into Rwandan war crimes; an Italian pledge of 17.000.000 dollars to be sent to Rwanda; Germany had sent 500 hospital beds, the French were prepared to leave the country while the British were arriving; the US had recognized the new Rwandan government (the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]) and announced that they would be putting 200 people on the ground in Kigali in an effort to inspire confidence in the refugees to come back. The program was devoted to the analysis of a country devoured by rage: roots of the killings, the international response to the problem and its failure to come up with a solution, would the United Nations deliver? The program focused also on how the West is dealing with post-colonial Africa. The program was interspersed with reports on Rwanda by BBC reporters. John Simpson in particular was featured on the show.

"Can a nation put an end to its culture of murder? Stephen Bradshaw opens this documentary with a provocative question and analysis. The documentary focuses first on Rwandan refugees crowding the Goma camp in Zaire where approximately 200 orphans rejected and abandoned had arrived after walking for 70 kilometers. Neither the French (Operation Turquoise) nor UNAMIR came to their rescue. The children, obvious victims of the adults' folly, were found lost in the fields and brought from the bushes where they had been hiding for days. Some adult refugees stricken by hunger returned to scavenge their own abandoned maize and tea fields, but many others fear reprisals from the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and so prefer to stay in the squalid conditions of the refugee camps in Zaire. The conditions "defy a journalist's clich√®s" with no water available and corpses that lay near the camps waiting to be picked up by trucks. 43.000 have died and bodies are taken to the roads for collection. However, the truth is, most of the bodies remain untouched close to campsites being used by the international press.
Another major problem is the violent and chaotic situation in which everyone is living. A culture of murder means that the law lies in the hands of young thugs walking around with machetes and maintaining an atmosphere of threatening violence. Knife fights over the food distribution process are quite common. Bradshaw maintains that the village system has moved as a whole into the camps. Everyone obeys the Hutu elders. Food goes to them first. Grain, which is desperately needed, is taken by force then distributed the way the elders see fit. Aid workers are aware of who sets the rules and the United Nations has no illusion about who is really in control. These Hutu elders, many of whom bear responsibility for the massacres back in Rwanda, have brought with them their own system of justice. They send out thugs to control the rest of the refugees. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) official acknowledges that among the refugees they are helping there are murderers. The very same people who helped initiate the violence with their propaganda on the radio are now holding the refugees hostage in the camps. "When you have 1 million people in a camp it is impossible to stop and ask them: 'Have you committed a crime?'" Yet many of them are afraid of returning, preferring to risk dying of malaria, cholera, dysentery rather than at the hands of the RPF. When asked about revenge, Paul Kagame denies any desire for summary executions maintaining instead that "There are no reprisals. What the refugees fear most now is to be brought to Justice."

The tape contains discussions in meeting between Bagosora and UNAMIR officers debating on the evacuation of orphans during the war. The issue was to evacuate the children from the Forces Rwandaises de D√©fense (FAR) held area crossing the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) held area to airport. Bagosora's argument was that the children were to be accompanied by the militias (Interahamwe) through the area held by RPF soldiers. The UNAMIR representatives suggested that children would be accompanied by the militias to the government held territory then from there UNAMIR would take over and take the children to the airport. There is no information indicating which plan was adopted. The second part of this tape contains an interview with Col. Gatsinzi discussing how after Habyarimna died Bagosora was in charge of organizing meetings with high army officer s and tried to convince them to take over the leadership of the country. As the army refused this suggestion and chose to follow the Arusha peace agreement, Col. Gatsinzi reports that Col. Bagosora established his secret network with the president guard division to try to overthrow the transitional government. Several eye witnesses discuss the massacre in Butare. Some of these witnesses argued that the massacre started after Sindikubwabo's speech in Butare and Robert Kajuga's visit the national leader of the militia Interahamwe. The reporter continued to Goma where he met with Sindikubwabo Theodore. When asked to comment on his speech in Butare, Sindikubwabo argued that in his speech he reminded the population to focus on their daily works. Sindikubwabo argued that people could have misinterpreted his words that his intension was to incite people for the massacre he explained. In Goma the journalist interviewed also Bagosora on the existence of death squad responsible of much of the killing in 1994. In Kigali prison the journalist met with Janvier Africa who claimed to ex-member of the death squad. The sketch he gave to officers from the International Human right Federation Officers led to the first mass grave in Rwanda. The reporter comments also on Mugesera's speech, the journal Kangura, Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM) and other sources of incitement in preparation of the genocide. The journalist also visited some of the FAR soldiers in camps and reports on their training and the possibility of returning to Rwanda by force.

Bizimana thanks the French government for assisting Rwanda but regret that France military involvement couldn't be possible. When asked how he will evaluate the United Nations' role in the conflict, Bizimana replied by stating that United Nations was failing in Rwanda like it failed in Somali. He questioned the credibility of the United Nations in conflict resolution.

"One year after what J. Clancy describes as a genocidal civil war, a CNN crew traveled to Rwanda for investigation. While millions had fled the country, survivors and the dead alike are crying out for justice. A year later the memories are still very fresh and nothing was going to take away the pain that had transformed Rwanda forever. Those crimes, according to some, were inexorably tied to power, to others, a mere tribal bloodbath that "Africa is so famous for."
Tracing back the genocide would entail going back forty and some years ago, to the first Hutu outrage and burst at the Tutsi feudal regime.
The first attempt to peace was signed in Arusha in 1993; Habyarimana reluctantly gave in under international pressure. But that didn't last. The civil war broke seconds after the plane crash that claimed the lives of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi. It took 100 days of vicious fighting before the 20.000 Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers brought the Interim government to its knees. Genocide turned Rwanda into a cemetery. The country is littered with mass graves; its churches were and at the time of the report are still filled with the skeletal remains of the women and children who sought shelter but found death. The massacre has left the country deeply scarred. Many survivors remember the slow; agonizing deaths of loved ones along the roadside. Today these same people remain embittered by the international community's indifference to their plight. Clancy suggests that Rwanda's tragedy demands some answers: Who is responsible for the genocide? Members of the interim government deny responsibility and eyewitnesses all concur that the killing was planned in advance and carried out by government officials. One of the United Nations officers said that it was "clear that Bagosora was in charge of the Interahamwe." In Butare alone it was ministers and officials who ordered the killings according to eyewitnesses.
1. Kambanda was recorded passing out arms to militiamen and telling them to use their new guns to kill civilians. Most ministers and journalists are accused of taking part in the massacres.
2. Victims of rape gathered in the maternity ward. Nothing can measure the level of anguish these women feel. It became common for women to walk away from the maternity ward without their babies, living symbols of an ordeal they will never forget. Additionally many of the women have contracted AIDS, which appears to be heading for Rwanda with the strength of an epidemic.
3. Kayishema, a doctor from Kibuye, is under investigation for his role in the genocide. There is outrage at the fact that Kayishema is still free in Zaire while those who were merely following his orders are locked away in prison.
4. There are 8500 inmates in a jail built for a few hundred. The Rwandan judicial system is facing an unprecedented crisis. Rooms are stacked with case files waiting to be reviewed. Lack of attorneys and judges has made the caseload impossible to handle. Each month more prisoners are added to the inmate population. Most of them know they face the death penalty if they are ever tried and found guilty.
5. A CNN crew captures an arms deal on videotape in the courtyard of a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya. There is still a UN arms embargo on Rwanda.

1. First item shows the St. Jean church in Kibuye. Services were still being held despite the sight and smell of decomposing bodies scattered around church grounds. A priest was asked about the smell. He responded that "people are getting used to it."
Images of Tutsi hiding in the hills out of fear of Hutu attacks.
2. Goma in the evening. Surgeons operate on wounded and mutilated children. They were the victims of machete attacks.
Several survivors offer their testimony. Some Tutsi hid in the forests.
3. 94 Tutsi, survivors of various attacks, arrive in Goma. Most of them are young as the old were too fragile to survive their extensive wounds. Alphonsine, a ten year-old girl, is interviewed.
4. Helicopters of the French army evacuate about 40 nuns. A nun is asked whether they feared for their lives. She responds that "on √©tait sur le qui-vive."
A French army officer is interviewed.
5. French soldiers bring jean-Baptiste, a Tutsi survivor, to Kibuye stadium. This was the site of yet another massacre. Jean-Baptiste gives a moving account of the events that took place within the stadium.
6. Reporters arrive at a mission where a number of nuns from St. Marie have taken refuge. One nun maintains that local authorities attempted to protect the nuns from attacks.
7. Reporter comes across several members of the interim government at the Meridien hotel in Gisenyi, a few kilometers from the border with Zaire. One minister proclaims that the "massacres have been spontaneously organized by the population. It is a civilian rebellion."
The minister maintains that there is no militia to speak of. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s better equipped but the French presence has served to reassure the government forces.

Il faut v√©rifier que le discours de Kambanda passe en fait √† la RTLM.
Kantano commence l'√©mission avec un appel aux Rwandais de combattre les "Inyenzi", notamment les enfants de Tutsi qui sont partis en 1959. Il parle ensuite de l'extermination imminente des Tutsi dans "le monde entier." Kantano demande aussi que le peuple Rwandais fasse attention √† sa r√©putation internationale et participe √† la guerre sans se permettre de piller et tuer n'importe comment. Il termine la face a en soulignant l'importance de la RTLM. La face B est compos√©e enti√®rement d'un discours du Premier Ministre Jean Kambanda. Il adresse le peuple Rwandais et explique la formation et les objectifs du nouveau gouvernement. Kambanda accuse le FPR d'avoir assassin√© le Pr√©sident Habyarimana et il incite la population √† se r√©unir pour combattre les "Inyenzi" et les enfants de Tutsi qui ont quitt√© le pays en 1959. Il ne laisse aucun doute qu'il s'agit d'un probl√®me entre les ethnies et que le FPR est compos√© de Tutsi.

Unidentified speaker begins by suggesting Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has massacred 8000 Hutus with the consent of the UN. Georges Ruggiu and unidentified journalist enjoin people in Kigali not to let journalist get interviews or images of their activities, which are apparently compromising.
Kantano previews upcoming interview with a 12 year old RPF soldier. The boy will reveal the RPF's use of collaboration with 'sorcerers' and 'women who suck themselves' and Inkotanyi plans for a massacre in Nyamirambo that will start with the killing of a man called Abdou.
Kantano (1) calls for vigilance at the barriers; (2) tells listeners to watch their neighbors' reaction to the upcoming taped interview, and arrest those neighbors that seem concerned by what the child is saying; (3) calls for the arrest of other Inkotanyi street children bearing a certain mark on their scalp; (4) for an attack to kill Inkotanyi living in huts near Rugunga before they listen to RTLM and flee; (4) for the "arrest" of three specific street children at Kimisagara as well as 30 others. Kantano says the interviewed child should be kept alive.
In an interview with journalists Biziyaremye Thimothe and Kayitare Vianney, the RPF boy soldier claims to have spied on the barriers with other boys bearing grenades, kalachnikovs and pistols. Under interrogation, the boy gives the location of his fellow Inkotanyi: (1) at Gitega on the macadamized road, (2) at Kiyovu, "in front of the houses of whites who keep horses," (3) at Gatenga, (4) "at the marsh near road to Gikongo," (5) at Butamwa, (6) at Byumba, (7) at Jari, (8) at Rebero. Child provides names of family members, reveals that soldiers travel by foot and work with sorcerers and gives specific information about vehicles and weapons used by his fellow Inkotanyi. Interview ends with account of how he and other boys set up booby trap mines to kill Hutu.
Kantano launches another monologue in which: (1) Belgian are called 'sons-of bitches" who car only for women and money, (2) Inkotanyi are described as wild animals that "hunt moles, partridges and cicadas, (3) a prophesy is made that "Inkotanyi will die in our potatoes', (4) FAR soldiers are encouraged to remain in good spirits,(4) the invaders are described as dogs that must be killed before they kill, (5) citizens are encouraged to help FAR soldiers or be taken prisoner by the Inkotanyi, (6) a letter is read from a listener telling of collaboration between the Ugandans, the Belgians, and the "cockroaches." These "cockroaches" (no discrimination made between soldiers and civilians) are being hunted down and killed by FAR soldiers, and this will continue until they accept negotiations.
Side A concludes with personal missives from and to active soldiers. (Side B is blank)
Tape includes strong evidence: direct calls, ethnic slurs, anti-Belgian rhetoric. Suggestion that captured RPF soldiers must reveal name of family members.
Need voice analysis to confirm that the journalist "George is in fact George Ruggiu.

The tape begins with discussion by Simbizi, Bemericki, Bamwanga, and Karamira regarding the objectives sought and roles played by various political parties including the RPF, CDR, and MDR. Bamwanga then announces that no one has fled Kigali and urges listeners to remain on night patrols and on the barriers.
Kantano then begins a long monologue which runs through the end of side A. The monologue goes as follows: (1) Rwandans are united in fighting the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and foreigners cannot come in and steal what the Rwandans have built; (2) a direct call against four Tutsi in the Kimisagara and Nyakanda area; (3) a call to vigilance on the barriers; (3) a report of Tutsis being shot in Remera and a justification of this on the grounds that Tutsis have encircled and killed people; (4) a report that Tutsis are using people as shields; they are thieves and they kill Hutus with machetes; (5) an attack on Twagiramungu, Kanyarenwe, and Pasteur Bizimungu and an expression of appreciation that Rwandans continue to work together; (6) a warning that Tutsis will track Hutus down and kill them; (7) the Tutsis have lied about taking certain regions; (8) criticisms of the UN.
Side B continues with Kantano's monologue. He states that the transition government is strong and that the Rwandans are recruiting young boys and girls into the army, waiting with machetes to kill the cockroaches. The Tutsis are in Arusha using Ibizungerezi (attractive Tutsi women) to mislead people. RTLM was bombed and broadcasters were injured but the station will continue to broadcast.
Ruggiu replaces Kantano. He indicates the cockroaches are malicious and attacks Twagiramungu. He then speaks about Rwandan history with respect to the Tutsi superiority complex and feudalist aspirations.
Gahigi replaces Ruggiu and speaks of Rwandan delegations going abroad to promote the cause of Rwandan government. He states the delegations will explain that Habyarimana was killed by the RPF, which (1) wanted to take power by force, (2) annulled the Arusha Peace Accords, and (3) has killed innocent people.
Tape contains some strong evidence: direct call, strong accusations of Tutsi atrocities, anti-Belgian statements
Tape labeled April 12, 1994, but in broadcast, date given as April 22 or 23, 1994 (see records 1 and 5); April 22 appears to be correct date.
Need to confirm that "Karamira" is "Frodauld Karamira"
Tape begins with a round table discussion on politics among Simbizi, Bemericki, Bamwanga, and Karamira. Kantano then launches a long monologue in which he accuses the RPF of committing atrocities, justifies killing "cockroaches," and makes a direct call against suspected "cockroaches'. Ruggiu then recalls the historical oppression of Hutus by Tutsis in past centuries and under colonialism. Gahigi ends the broadcast by summarizing how the Rwandan government is explaining the current events to the world.

Cette cassette contient des √©missions datant du 15 Mai 1994 aussi bien que du 16 Mai.
La face A de la cassette, anim√©e par Gaspard Gahigi, est tr√®s courte. Gahigi lance un appel aux les citoyens Rwandais de joindre la FAR dans sa bataille contre les envahisseurs arrogants, de rester vigilants, et de montrer du courage aux barri√®res. Il raconte qu'un radio √©metteur a √©t√© saisi d'un Inkotanyi √† Munanira, Nyakabanda, et que les citoyens doivent "d√©nicher l'ennemi partout o√π il se cache pour qu'ils sachent que nous sommes vigilants." La face B de la cassette est anim√©e par Kantano et Ananie. Kantano critique les hommes politiques hutus d'avoir attendu l'assassinat du pr√©sident pour commencer leurs discours anti-Tutsi. Puis Ananie fait un rapport sur un nombre de complots couv√©s par les Tutsi pour conqu√©rir le Rwanda ou le repartitioner pour en cr√©er un pays tutsi. Ananie reprends le microphone et accuse le FPR d'avoir commis des atrocit√©s contre des Hutu (au Stade Amahoro et √† l'h√¥pital Roi Faycal), et sugg√®re aussi qu'il y a des groupes de faux Interahamwe qui ont de fausses listes. Kantano continue; il dit que la tuerie ne doit pas continuer sans discrimination, que les Tutsi qui sont toujours vivants sont peut-√™tre innocents, et que "les jolies femme [tutsi]" ne doivent pas √™tre tu√©es simplement pour plaire aux jaloux femmes hutus. Puis, Kantano dit aux auditeurs qu'ils doivent "encercler," et "stopper" ces "kamikaze" tutsi.

Face B commence avec un monologue d'un animateur non-identifi√© (peut-√™tre Simbizi)
La face A de la cassette est anim√©e par Georges Ruggiu et Val√©rie Bemeriki. Pendant l'√©mission, les animateurs r√©p√®tent que les Accords d'Arusha sont des accords de guerre, et non de paix, une ruse des "Inyenzi-inkotanyi" pour assujetir la majorit√© et revenir aux temps des massacres et de la domination Tutsi [avant '59]. Le FPR et Twagiramgu sont √† plusieurs reprises accus√©s du meurtre de Habyarimana: Bemeriki appellent aux citoyen de r√©agir contre les tueurs comme on r√©agirait contre les tueurs de son propre p√®re; Ruggiu appelle aux citoyen de pr√™ter main forte √† la FAR et d'aider √† "netoyer" Kigali et tout le pays des "Inyenzi" ‚Äî comme le FAR viens de faire sur la colline de Rebero. Les Belges sont aussi critiqu√©s et accus√©s d'√™tre les perroquet du FPR.
Sur la face B de la cassette, Kantano et Bemeriki dirigent un entretien avec Simbizi (CND) et Froduald Karamira (MDR). Pendant la discussion, un premier animateur accuse les Belges d'une longue liste d'injustices et crimes contre "la majorit√©." Puis Karamira et Simbizi appellent √† la population de s'unir avec l'arm√©e et d'aider √† decouvrir tout ennemi qui essaye de se cacher (dans la canalisation, dans les buissons, dans les bananaraies). Les animateurs accusent les Tutsis d'avoir essay√© de retourner √† la domination √©conomique et politique qu'ils occupaient avant 1959. Les animateurs ajoutent que les Tutsis ont provoqu√© leurs propre morts. Le FPR est aussi accus√© d'avoir tu√© des Hutu important et d'avoir commis des massacres contre la population.

-la face B est vierge
Ananie commence la face A en d√©clarant que chaque jour mille r√©fugi√©s traversent la fronti√®re pour s'√©chapper des "Inyenzi." Il souhaite que ces r√©fugi√©s s'organisent √† la fronti√®re pour qu'ils puissent revenir au Rwanda et participer √† la guerre contre les "Inyenzi." Ananie se lance ensuite dans une tirade contre Museveni et les Am√©ricains qu'il accuse de soutenir les Tutsi dans leur but d'exterminer les Hutu. Kantano le suit dans un entretien avec Bugingo qui se trouve souvent aux barri√®res. Ce dernier rapporte que la s√©curit√© √† Kigali s'am√©liore et que la population participe aux rondes nocturnes. Il annonce que les Interahamwe ont du succ√®s dans leur chassent √† l'Inkotanyi. Par contre, il d√©clare que la population ne doit pas utiliser sa position aux barri√®res, ni le fait d'avoir un fusil, comme pr√©texte pour voler. Bugingo ajoute que des patrouilles ont √©t√© form√©s pour fouiller les maisons soup√ßonn√©es de h√©berger des "Inyenzi." Kantano continue unmonologue sans Bugingo. Kantano se moque d'abord de Kagame qui a promis de passer la nuit √† Kigali. Il annonce ensuuite que les Fran√ßais vont envoyer des troupes au Rwanda. Il demande alors √† la population de ne plus s'entre tuer et ignorer la justice. Il termine l'√©mission en d√©clarant que des femmes sorci√®res sont en train de br√ªler √† Rebero et que la communaut√© internationale a finalement compris que les "Inyenzi" tuent les gens en les torturant.

La cassette commence avec un dialogue entre Gahigi et Nemeye Ephrem √† propos de "ce probl√®me d'√©thnicit√©" √† partir duquel les "Inkotanyis" sont accus√©s d'avoir commis des massacres, tu√© le pr√©sident, commenc√© la guerre, et negoci√© les Accords d'Arusha. Puis, Gahigi entretiens Claire Kayirange, une fille qui "travaille" √† la barri√®re de Muhima. Elle est lou√©e comme un example pour les autres filles qui doivent, elles-aussi, prendre des armes contre "les petits Inyenzis" et faire "la ronde nocturne." Apr√®s une intervention de Nkomati, et un autre d'un animateur francophone non identifi√© entretiens deux refugi√©s hutus: Epimaque Abiyingoma (assistant bourgmestre de la commune de Rutare) et Cyriagque Habiyambere.

Kantano is the only speaker on side A of this transcript. Among other things Kantano addresses the refugee problem. He alternately pleads with his listeners to resist fleeing and berates them for leaving. He insists that the Inkotanyi present very little threat to the lives of Rwandans if only the population stays put. Kantano explains that the Inkotanyi use "whirlwind tactics" to hide their small numbers and to scare the Rwandan population into taking flight. In a rage, he calls on people at the check points to check refugees who have left with all their belongings. He refers to them as cowards. Kantano also adresses the Inkotanyi and warns them that they will "be a party without adherents," that no one will be left in half of the communes they have conquered if they do not stop their invasion. He informs them that Rwandans will never allow the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) to rule over them and he urges the population to take up arms against the "Inyenzi." Finally, Kantano also emphasizes that Kigali is not yet in the hands of the "Inyenzi" regardless of all the rumors and misinformation.
Apart from Ananie's brief discussion of the foreign press and his quip that "Kigali has been captured, it has been captured by RFI, the BBC and Radio Muhabura," side B is devoted to Gahigi' interviews with people at various check points throughout Kigali. Gahigi speaks with children, CDR militants, FAR soldiers, militants at the road blocks and several civilians. The interviews give evidence that Kigali is in no danger of falling to the Inkotanyi and that many "Inyenzi" have been killed.

Transcript begins mid-sentence with unidentified speaker urging listeners to come "work with RTLM." Those who do not understand that "this war . . . is the final one" and so cannot work "there" [reference is possibly to roadblocks] should be kept away and appointed to "non-confidential and unimportant cases," such as "checking vehicles that have broken down."
After an interruption, transcript begins with Kantano interviewing a Kimicanga resident who claims to have killed 5 Inyenzi thieves in Magerwa. Kantano congratulates the resident, who he calls "Caporal," and asks that he "keep it up." The resident then urges "soldiers in Kicukiro" to also "keep it up," and specifically names their precise locations. Kantano and interviewee suggest that soldiers are working with residents in Magerwa, and perhaps other places, where Inyenzi were killed. The residents suggests that contrary to reports, the FAR still controls Kimicanga, Kacyiru, Magerwa, Kicukiro.
Another resident then speaks on behalf of RTLM. Kantano urges this resident and others to "test" people's knowledge of the station and its broadcasters. Residents standing close by respond by pronouncing the names of their favorite announcers.
Another resident in the crowd, a member of the CDR and of the Kimicanga security committee, says he is a peasant, part of the "mass who is at the barriers" and which often listens to RTLM. He says his militia is "keeping it up" at Kimicanga, Kajevuba, and Rwintare. He says roadblocks should be more lax for the "sons of Sebahinzi," (i.e. Hutu peasants), but that those who do not have papers showing that they are "sons of Sebahinzi" should "leave their head there" at the roadblock.
A soldier then takes the microphone and warns that Inkotanyi chased out of Kanombe "will be beaten for a long time" if they come there to Kimicanga. Kantano once again says "keep it up."
After a Bikindi song, Ananie transmits a few missives to and from soldiers.
Gahigi then begins a circuitous monologue about how the government should deal with the refugees in Mille Collines Hotel and Amahoro Stadium and ensure their security.
After another musical interlude, an unidentified speaker (1) criticizes false RFI reports about Kigali's fall, (2) speaks of plans to "evacuate people . . . in Mille Collines Hotel and Amahoro Stadium, (3) discusses common international misunderstanding about what the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is doing and "who is [really] massacring who," (4) alleges governments supporting the arms embargo bear responsibility for RPF massacre of civilian population, (5) accuses Beligian mercenaries of collaboration with RPF in massacre of Hutus, (6) denies that militias of presidential guards were involved in massacres, saying that at time of massacres, there was no government, (7) alleges that assassination of Habyarimana and other top Rwandan officials marked beginning of RPF's massacring plans.
Broadcast ends with criticism of U.S. participation in arming of UN troops in Rwanda.
Very strong evidence of RTLM collaboration with militias.

Les deux face de la cassette sont anim√©es par Kantano. Il f√©licite la FAR pour son d√©tournement d'un massacre qui, il dit, allait √™tre perp√©tu√© par les Inkotanyi contre la population de Kicukiro. Pendant le reste de l'√©mission, trois th√®mes sont abord√©s √† plusieurs reprises: (1) le plan des Inkotanyi de massacrer tout les Hutus, (2) le fait que le Rwandais doivent avoir du courage pour "travailler" contre ceux qui viennent les tuer et prendre leurs biens, (3) une critique de Radio Muhabura et une accusation qu'elle aide √† verser le sang des Hutus, (4) la population et l'arm√©e sont encourag√©es de fumer du chanvre "pour affronter efficacement ces voyous qui ont envahis nos champs en vue de voler nos r√©coltes." Kantano conclue la face B avec la caution que, "ils (les Inkotanyis) ont tout int√©r√™t √† arr√™ter les combats car si ils continuent √† se suicider, ils seront tous √©limin√©s."

La face A de cette cassette contient un long monologue de Kantano. Il commence avec un rapport qui accuse le Inkotanyi d'avoir essay√© de s'infiltrer √† Nyamirambo, Muhima et Gisozi. Kantano rassure ensuite ses auditeurs que le grondement d'armes lourdes sont ou la manifestation du FAR qui pourchassent les "Inyenzi" ou une strat√©gie des Inkotanyi pour faire peur aux peuple Rwandais. Kantano continue son monologue avec des exhortations dirig√©es aux √©couteurs de la RTLM. Il les indique que des fusils seront distribu√©s √† la population et que si ils se mettent ensemble ils pourront exterminer les "Inyenzi." Kantano accuse aussi les Inkotanyi d'emp√™cher que des n√©gociations prennent place.
La face B commence avec Kantano d'humeur plut√¥t hilare. Il incite la population √† s'armer et √† d√©fendre le pays mais de ne plus s'enfuir. Il dit aussi que les Inkotanyi sont maintenant des "fant√¥mes." Ananie annonce ensuite que les militaires Rwandais ont encercl√© les Inkotanyi √† Kacyiru de telle fa√ßon qu'ils ne pourront pas s'√©chapper. Kantano reprend lemicro et annonce l'extermination √©ventuelle des "Inyenzi." De son c√¥t√© Gahigi d√©clare que la population doit s'armer avec des armes traditionnelles. Il fait une comparaison entre les "Inyenzi" et les buffles et les lions. Kantano termine la cassette en disant que "si ils veulent que nous les √©liminions . . . nous les exterminerons."

La th√®me centrale de l'emmision est que les "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi" ne sont pas massacr√©s, mais se suicident.
Le FPR est accus√© √† plusieurs reprise d'avoir planifi√© des massacres, et m√™me d'avoir prepar√© des "listes." Des differents journalistes souligne l'importance de la RTLM dans la guerre; Ananie dit m√™me que la radio est aussi importante que les mortiers. Ananie souligne que toute le monde ont une r√¥le √† jouer dans la guerre contre les Inyenzi.
Philippe Mbilizi anime le d√©but de la face A. Il f√©licite les FAR et la population pour son "travaille" contre "les tentatives d'infiltrations" des Inkotanyi, dont 100 √©taient tu√© hier, "rien qu'√† Kigali." Puis, Kantano parle de l'orgueil des "Inyenzi-inkotanyi" et explique que cette qualit√© les poussent √† leurs propre extermination. De surcro√Æt, Kantano affirme que tout "les Tutsi du monde entier allaient combattre les Hutus" et que tout les Hutus doivent donc se lever pour les combattre ensemble. Gahigi prends le microphone. Il charge que le FPR a planifi√© les massacres √† Rwanda en incitant la population avec l'assassinat du pr√©sident et du premier ministre. Il nie que la RTLM a appelait aux Hutus de tuer les Tutsis et sugg√®re que les Tutsis sont responsables pour ses propres actes "suicidaire". Kantano conclue la face A de la cassette en constatant que ceux qui vengent l'assassinat du pr√©sident "sont innocents parce qu'ils n'ont fait que s'adapter √† la situation de ce temps-l√†."
La face B de la cassette commence avec un dialogue entre George Ruggiu et un journaliste non identifi√©: ils (1) rapportent que la communaut√© internationale appelle √† la FPR de arr√™ter ses massacres, (2) accusent les FPR d'avoir interrompu l'√©vacuation des r√©fugi√©es du Stade Amahoro et d'autre cite et (3) affirment que le FPR est responsable des massacre √† Kibungo et Byumba. Ils souligne aussi le "r√¥le m√©diatique" de la RTLM dans la guerre. Puis Ananie Nkurunziza commence un longue monologue dans lequel il parle des "astuces" des Inkotanyi, leurs mani√®re de mimer les sons des b√™tes sauvage, et la fa√ßon de lutter contre eux aux barri√®res. Il rapporte aussi sur les √©v√©nements √† Kinamba et Nyamirambo, o√π les Inkotanyi √©taient "corrig√©." Au cours de son rapport, il souligne que "il faut consid√©rer les Inyenzi comme les Inyenzi. Il ne faut pas les craindre‚Ä¶" Ananie affirme que "tout le monde doit combattre [les 'Inyenzi] √† sa fa√ßon, et loue le travail des malices qui sont aux barri√®res (il pr√©cise quelque noms). Gaspard Gahigi continue l'√©mission: il accuse le FPR encore une fois d'avoir planifi√© les massacres, et pr√©tends avoir entre les mains une liste pr√©par√© par les Inyenzi des "v√©ritable Inyenzi" marqu√© pour la mort. Ananie conclue la cassette en affirmant que dans cette guerre, la RTLM est "une arme" aussi redoutable que les mortiers.

Gahigi commence cette cassette avec une s√©rie d'accusations d'atrocit√©s commises par le FPR. Selon Gahigi un repr√©sentant du HCR a t√©moign√© que le FPR a tir√© dans une foule de r√©fugi√©s. Gahigi maintient que le FPR s'attaque aux civiles plut√¥t qu'aux militaires. Kantano passe au micro et y reste jusqu'√† la fin de la face A. Kantano rapporte qu'il a r√™v√© de l'extermination des Inkotanyi. Il donne plusieurs raisons pour l'annihilation √©ventuelle des Inkotanyi et finit par dire que les Inotanyi seront extermin√©s parce qu'ils sont suicidaires. Kantano exige des ses auditeurs qu'ils ne prennent pas fuites car les Inkotanyi sont moins nombreux. Kantano termine la cassette avec une description de la vie actuelle √† Kigali. Kantano commence la face B de cette cassette en s'adressant aux personnes qui s'enfuient des Inkotanyi. Il d√©clare que tous Rwandais doit rester se battre contre les Inkotanyi et il proclame que la chasse aux Inkotanyi devientun jeu. Kantano souhaite aussi que les gens se comportent de fa√ßon plus raisonnable sans prendre des "libert√©s physiques" avec les femmes sous pr√©texte que le pays se trouve en temps de guerre. Ananie lit plusieurs annonces et adresse surtout la conf√©rence de presse de Museveni o√π il admet enfin que certain de ces "boys" participent √† la guerre du c√¥t√© des Ikotanyi. Gahigi termine la face B avec une "analyse" des commentaires de Museveni. Gahigi explique que les membres du FPR ont re√ßu leurs entra√Ænement militaire dans l'arm√©e de Museveni et que ce dernier esp√®re cr√©er un "Hima Land" qui comprendrait l'Ouganda, le Rwanda, le Burundi et le Nord Kivu.

Cette cassette commence avec une discussion entre Gahigi et Ananie. Les deux animateurs maintiennent que Museveni joue un r√¥le important pour les Inkotanyi dans cette guerre. Ils sugg√®rent que Museveni veut cr√©er un "Hima Land" pour la "race" Hima-Tutsi et qu'il veut exterminer la race Bantou. Kantano, de son c√¥t√©, pense que Museveni va faire exterminer les Tutsis si il continue √† les mener de sa fa√ßon. Cette cassette contient aussi deux entretients par Gahigi avec des hommes aux barri√®res: Bukenengaho de la barri√®re de Nyabugogo accuse les "Inyenzis" d'avoir massacr√© sa famille et Nyamaswa de la barri√®re de Yamaha annonce qu'avec ses compatriotes ils combattent tous les "Inyenzi," m√™me les femmes, les enfants et les vieillards. Ananie termine la cassette avec une discussion du r√¥le de l'Ouganda dans cette guerre.
Ruggiu commence cette cassette avec un rapport du HCR qui accuse le FPR d'avoir commis des atrocit√©s contre la population civile du Rwanda. Il explique ensuite que le FPR est prot√©g√© par Museveni en Ouganda etpar la Belgique. Kantano passe au micro ensuite et s'adresse surtout aux "fuyards" parmi la population et les forces arm√©es. Il incite la population Rwandaise √† rester se battre avec des paroles encourageantes et des menaces. Kantano annonce plusieurs fois que les "Inyenzi" seront extermin√©s. Ruggiu annonce la prise d'une mitrailleuse qui sera utilis√©e pour massacrer les Inkotanyi. Gahigi termine la cassette avec un commentaire sur la mauvaise foi des Inkotanyi en ce qui concerne les n√©gociations.

Cette cassette est compos√©e surtout d'un monologue par Bemeriki. Elle commence avec un message provenant du feu Pr√©sident Habyarimana √† la population leur demandant de prier. Elle invoque aussi le souvenir de l'apparition da la Sainte Vierge √† Kibeho. Bemeriki cible un pr√™tre et une ensiegnante. Elle s'adresse aussi √† tous les rumeurs propag√©es par les Inkotanyi et leurs complices avec but de faire fuir la population. Bemeriki maintient qu'au contraire les "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi" perdent la guerre et ne font qu'envoyer des bombes qui ont un effet n√©gligable. Ensuite elle loue les efforts des personnes aux barri√®res et annonce que Karemera promet une distribution d'armes dans les jours qui suivent. Bemeriki termine son monologue en d√©clarant que les "Inyenzi" ont tu√© "d'innombrables personnes" et qu'ils sont connus pour leur "barabrie." Kantano prend la suite et d√©clare que les Inyenzi ont √©t√© envoy√© par Museveni pour d√©truire le pays. Mais il ajoute que les "Inyenzi" vont se faire extemin√©s et qu'ils sont d√©j√† minables au point qu'ils doivent voler leur nourriture qu'ils ne peuvent trouver qu'au tomb√© du soleil. Kantano insiste aussi sur le fait que la population ne doit pas fuir devant l'avance des Inkotanyi. Il conseille aux "Inyenzi" d'accepter les n√©gociations et termine son monologue avec une menace implicite: "vous avez vu les cons√©quences qu'ont subies ceux qui ont choisi le mauvais c√¥t√©."

La premi√®re partie de cette cassette consiste d'une r√©trospective des √©v√®nements au Rwanda depuis le 19 Mai, anim√©e par Ananie. C'est une occasion pour Ananie de faire de nombreuses accusations de massacres commis par les "Inyenzi." Ananie d√©montre aussi que malgr√© les pr√©visions de Kagame, Kigali n'est toujours pas tomb√© dans les mains des "Inyenzis." Ananie commence une attaque contre Museveni qui sera continu√© par Kantano et Gahigi. Selon les trois animateurs de la RTLM, Museveni s'engage du c√¥t√© des Inkotanyi et Gahigi d√©clare que c'est avec l'espoir de cr√©er un "Hima Land" qui comprendrait l'Ouganda, le Rwanda, le Burundi et le Nord Kivu. Kantano note que "nous les exterminerons" si "ils" choisissent de "continuer comme √ßa."

Ananie et Kantano ont un dialogue tr√®s bref autour des rumeurs propag√©es par la Rdio Muhabura. Celle-ci a annonc√© que le FPR a pris le Ruhengeri, mais Ananie maintient que la jeunesse de Giciye, Kinigi et Mukingo r√©siste encore aux Inkotanyi. Il ajoute que des barri√®res ont √©t√© √©rig√©es et que la population n'a pas peur des bombes lanc√©s par les Inkotanyi. De sa part, Kantano gronde les soi-disant intellectuels qui refusent de participer aux combats et qui prennent fuite. Ananie termine la cassette en d√©clarant que les Inkotanyi sont en train de perdre la guerre.

Cette cassette consiste surtout en un discours du Premier Ministre Jean Kambanda. Kambanda fait le lien entre les "Inyenzi" de 1959 et les "Inkotanyi" de 1990. Il encourage le FAR et la population civile de continuer leur collaboration contre l'ennemi tout en √©vitant le pi√®ge des Inkotanyi qui tentent de cr√©er des divisions dans l'arm√©e Rwandaise. Kambanda continue a rappel√© ses auditeurs que les Tutsi ne composent que 10% de la population Rwandaise et qu'ils veulent simplement restaurer la monarchie qu'ils avaient √©table avec l'aide des Belges avant 1959. Il sugg√®re que les Inkotanyi ont recrut√© leurs complices "au sein de des partis politiques" et qu'ilsont d√©j√† fait preuve de mauvaises foi quand ils ont "liquid√©" les t√™tes des partis qui s'opposent au FPR. De plus Kambanda accuse les Inkotanyi d'avoir assassin√© le Pr√©sident Habyarimana et de s'√™tre lanc√© dans cette guerre avec l'aide de l'Uganda dont le Pr√©sident Museveni veut "conqu√©rir cette partie de l'Afrique que nous habitons." Kambanda termine son discours avec un appel √† la population de se lever contre l'ennemi et de participer √† cette guerre qu'il qualifie de "guerre finale."
Bemeriki prend la rel√®ve et essaie de faire comprendre aux Inkotanyi qu'ils n'ont aucun espoir de gagner cette guerre. Elle continue son monologue en visant des Inyenzi qui se trouve dans le Mont Kigali, en particulier un homme qui aurait semer la propagande lors des √©lections des conseillers. Elle vise ensuite le conseiller de Nyakabanda qu'elle accuse de complicit√©. Bemeriki demande que la population "s'habitue √† informer imm√©diatement le conseiller de tout √©v√©nement qui se produit dans le secteur."

Bemeriki commence la cassette avec un appel aux FAR et la "jeunesse Rwandaise" de faire "une chasse aux Inyenzi qui restent . . . que tous soient extermin√©s." Elle accuse en m√™me temps les "Inyenzi" d'avoir commis des atrocit√©s envers la population Rwandaise et d'avoir tu√© des religieux catholiques et protestants. Bemeriki continue son monologue en appelant le G√©n√©ral Dallaire de la Minuar un "Inkotanyi d√©guis√©." Ensuite, un journaliste non-identifi√© lit deux communiqu√©s de l'URVAN. Le premier incite la population √† se mobiliser et prot√©ger la Nature Rwandaise d√©truite par la guerre avec les Inkotanyi. Le deuxi√®me communiqu√© accuse le FPR d'avoir commis des massacres et de ne pas vouloir partager le pouvoir. Kantano passe au micro et sugg√®re que les "Inyenzi" ont √©t√© envoy√© par Museveni. Il sugg√®re aussi que les "Inyenzi" ont √©t√© "d√©couvert" par la communaut√© internationale. Le reste du monologue de Kantano consiste surtout √† inciter la population √† se soulever contre les Inkotanyi: il accuse les hommes de Kagame d'avoir massacr√© la population civile, de travailler avec Satan et d'avoir tu√© des personnages religieux. Mais tout en les accusant des pires atrocit√©s, Kantano compare les "Inyenzi" √† des vaches qui vont vers l'abattoir. Il s'attaque aussi aux membres Hutu du FPR. Gahigi prends bri√®vement le micro pour remercier les gens aux barri√®res et pour encourager les auditeurs de chercher "la victoire d√©finitive." Bemeriki termine la cassette avec un appel √† la population de "an√©antir l'ennemi."

L'identit√© du journaliste du "Record" 19 n'est pas certaine.
Cette cassette commence avec un interview entre le G√©n√©ral Major Augustin Bizimungu et plusieurs journalistes de la RTLM et de Radio Rwanda. Bizimungu se contente de convaincre ses auditeurs que les "Inyenzi" n'√©pagnerons personnes et qu'il est donc pr√©f√©rable de participer compl√®tement √† la guerre. Il avertit ensuite les "Inyenzi" et les laisse savoir qu'ils p√©riront tous si ils ne consentent pas aux n√©gociations. Parmi ses incitements, Bizimungu encourage toute la population de s'armer, ne soit qu'avec un b√¢ton si il le faut, pour se battre avec l'ennemi. Il accuse aussi Museveni de s'√™tre align√© du c√¥t√© des Inkotanyi. Ruggiu passe au micro ensuite pour donner les informations du jour. Ruggiu accuse les Inkotanyi d'avoir tu√© un soldat de la MINUAR. Il r√©pond aussi aux reportages de la RFI et du journal "Le Soir" qui concernent les milliers de cadavres qui polluent le lac Victoria. Ruggiu annonce que les cadavres sont des victimes du FPR car ils ont les mains li√©es derri√®re le dos. Il lit un communiqu√© de la PDI qui d√©nonce les actions de Museveni et qui demande que le G√©n√©ral Dallaire soit renvoy√© au Canada. Ruggiu termine son monologue en insistant que la population ne doit jamias oublier les atrocit√©s des "Inyenzi." Gahigi termine la cassette en saluant les personnes aux barri√®res et en expliquant que le FPR est contre l'intervention Fran√ßaise, que le FPR fera de son mieux pour faire croire que les Rwandais sont coupables des massacres perp√©tu√©s dans le pays.

L'identit√© du journaliste des "records" 15-17 est peut-√™tre Kantano au lieu de Ananie.
Gahigi commence cette cassette en rappelant ses auditeurs qu'il faut rester vigilant. Il annonce ensuite l'intention des Inkotanyi d'exterminer la population et il ajoute qu'il est donc n√©cessaire d'exterminer les Inkotanyi. Il accuse le FPR d'avoir assassin√© le Pr√©sident Habyarimana et d'avoir commenc√© la guerre. Il justifie la r√©action du Rwanda en expliquant que qund quelqu'un est attaqu√© "il doit se d√©fendre." Kantano passe au micro et annonce l'arriv√©e des troupes Fran√ßaise. Il demande √† ses auditeurs de se pr√©parer √† accueillir les Fran√ßais et il annonce que les "Inyenzi se suicident" mais que les Tutsi n'ont en aucun cas √©t√© extermin√©s. Il annonce aussi que les "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi" ont l'intention d'exterminer les Hutu. Kantano accuse les Belges et Museveni de s'√™tre align√©s du c√¥t√© des Inkotanyi mais il ajoute que sinon les Inkotanyi n'ont plus le soutien de la communaut√© internationale.
Ananie commence la face B avec des informations √† propos des "combats" dans Kigali. Il est suivit de Bemeriki qui annonce la mort de nombreux "Inyenzi." Elle les appelle des "suicidaires" et ajoute que les routes sont couverts de cadavres d'Inkotanyi. Tout en insistant que les "Inyenzi" se font extermin√©s, Bemeriki annonce que les "Inyenzi" trouvent quand m√™me le moyen de massacrer la population Rwandaise.

Ruggiu sugg√®re que le FPR et ses accomplisses ont refus√© "le partage du pouvoir. Il indique ensuite que le G√©n√©ral Dallaire, les Belges et les Ugandais sont des accomplisses des "Inyenzi". Ruggiu caract√©rise les "Inyenzi" et Kagame de "bourreau" et "massacreur". Il encourage aussi ceux qui m√®nent les combats dans les quartiers de Bilyogo et Nyamirambo. Bemeriki parle bri√®vement des combats √† Kabakene, Rugenge et Gisenyi. Gahigi et Ananie s'adresse √† la situation dans la cellule de Duha dans la commune de Gikoro o√π, selon Gahigi, les Inkotanyi auraient tu√© 120 personnes. Cette cassette contient aussi un interview de Gahigi avec Jean Sibomana. Ce dernier explique que les Tutsi sont astucieux et ont bien √©tudi√© la situation √† Arusha pour qu'ils puissent monopoliser le pouvoir. Gahigi et Sibomana sont d'accord que le gouvernement pr√©c√©dant n'avait pas maintenu assez de contact avec la population.

Side B of this tape is blank
Bemeriki begins the tape accusing the Inkotanyi of "drinking Rwandan blood" and killing residents. She calls on the population to exterminate the Inyenzi-Inkotanyi. She is followed by Kantano who mockingly sings a song about the Inkotanyi having all perished. Kantano gives some of the local news from Kigali and targets several sectors and communes as areas where conflicts have taken place. As he targets areas like Nyamirambo he comments that the "Inyenzi" are committing suicide. He also refers to the current war as the "final" one. Kantano then announces that the imminent arrival of French troops to intervene against the "suicidal Ugandans and suicidal extremists Tutsis." He criticizes Kagame's tactics and tells the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) leader that he has done nothing but sow seeds of hatred for the Inkotanyi. Ruggiu ends the broadcasts with the beginning of an interview with George France Hategekimana about the impending French intervention.

L'identit√© de l'animateur les "records" 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 et 14 est √† v√©rifier. Je pense qu'il s'agit de Ananie.
La face A commence avec un interview entre Kantano et un gendarme non-identifi√© de Kacyiru. Le gendarme lance un appel √† la jeunesse de participer aux actions militaires. Kantano annonce qu'il y aura des r√©compenses pour les gens courageux. Bemeriki prend le micro et souhaite √† la jeunesse "de garder votre courage et bravoure habituels." Elle avertit la population de se m√©fier des nouvelles astuces des "Inyenzi" et de garder contre l'infiltration des "Inyenzi." Ananie suit Bemeriki et s'attaque d'abord √† Twagiramungu qu'il dit √™tre devenu un "Inyenzi." Il annonce que les Belges et les "Inyenzi" se sont alli√©s contre le Rwanda et les Fran√ßais. Il dit aussi que les "Inyenzi" sont les "diables" dont parle le New York Times. Ananie insinue ensuite que les "Inyenzi" ont tu√© 850 r√©fugi√©s de l'√©glise St Paul. Ananie est suivi d'un entretien entre Gahigi et le Premier Ministre Kambanda. Kambanda annonce que le gouvernement essaie de trouver des armes pour la population et il accuse le FPR de n'avoir pas respect√© les Accdords d'Arusha. Bemeriki suit avec un interview de Pauline Nyiramasuhoko du Minist√®re de la Famille et de la Protection F√©minine. Nyiramasuhoko affirme que les Rwandaises participent aux combats contre les "Inyenzi" et elle demande aux femmes du Rwanda de collaborer avec tous les Rwandais pour faire face √† l'ennemi. Ruggiu termine la cassette avec des nouvelles de l'interventio Fran√ßaise. Il accuse aussi le FPR d'avoir tu√© le Pr√©sident Habyarimana et de ne pas vouloir arr√™ter les massacres et prendre une place √† la table des n√©gociations. Ruggiu s'adresse aussi aux reportages de la RFI qu'il qualifie de faux. Il pr√©tend qu'il n'existe pas de milices au Rwanda, qu'il s'agit seulement d'une d√©fense civile.

Kantano commence la cassette. Il dit que l'Uganda s'enrichi grace √† cette guerre en vendant du mat√©riels aux Inkotanyi. Kantano s'adresse aussi au rapport de Ren√© Denis S√©gui qu'il qualifie de honteux. Kantano dit que les "Inyenzi" sont des "trafiquants de la mort" et il encourage la population de prendre courage et de faire face aux Inkotanyi. Ananie prend sa place et d√©nonce les reportages de RFI qu'il accuse de soutenir l'ennemi. Ensuite Ananie se lance dans une longue riposte contre le rapport de Ren√© Denis S√©gui. Ananie l'accuse de n'avoir pas fait des recherches √† fond et il l'accuse aussi de soutenir les Inkotanyi. Par contre Ananie fait usage du rapport pour d√©montrer √† ses auditeurs ce qui arriverait si les Inkotanyi perdent la guerre. Gahigi aussi s'adresse aux r√©sultats de ce rapport et annonce que ce sont les "Inyenzi" qui ont commenc√© la guerre, une guerre qu'ils ont pr√©par√© pendant 27 ans et qu'ils ont appel√© une guerre "finale." Gahigi tente ensuite de lier les "Inyenzi" aux "Iinyenzi" de 1959. Il explique que les "Inyenzi" ont form√© une organisation qui s'est r√©pandu un peu partout au monde pour pr√©parer cette guerre √©ventuelle. Kantano prend la suite et s'attaque aux "√©trangers" qui ne font que propager "de fausses informations." Bemeriki termine la cassette en remarquant que les "Inyenzi" esp√®rent restaurer la monarchie. Elle aussi s'attaque au rapport de Monsieur S√©gui qui elle accuse d'avoir accept√© de l'argent des Inkotanyi.

Kantano commence la face A. Il salue les efforts de la radio "soeur," Radio Rwanda. Il se moque ensuite des Inkotanyi qui ont des barbes et chevelure hirsute et plein de poux. Il dit que les Iinkotanyi "sont fonci√®rement m√©chant." Kantano s'adresse ensuite aux "d√©pouilles" de Hutu qu'il offre comme preuve du but exterminatrice des Inkotanyi qu'il accuse d'avoir traumatis√© des enfants et b√©b√©s. Il exhorte la population de se lever pour combattre les "Inyenzi" et il ajoute que le Rwanda exterminera les "Inyenzi" qui sont d'ailleurs "suicidaires." Kantano passe ensuite √† une attaque contre Museveni qu'il accuse de vouloir r√©gner sur toute l'Afrique centrale. Il termine son monologue avec une r√©f√©rence aux Tutsi de Burundi qui sont en train de cr√©er des probl√®mes pour ce pays. Ananie prend la rel√®ve et donne les informations. Il note l'arriv√© des Fran√ßais et il fait mention de la cr√©ation d'un Tribunal international pour le Rwanda. Il ajoute que la RTLM est parmi les accus√©s. Gahigi prend la suite et d√©fend les actions de la RTLM. Il essaie de d√©montrer que la RTLM n'est pas √† l'origine des probl√®mes entre les "Inyenzi" et le Rwanda. Il d√©nonce ensuite Dallaire et Ren√© Denis S√©gui qu'il accuse d'avoir fabriqu√© de faux rapports pour convaincre la communaut√© internationale de la m√©chancet√© de la RTLM.

This tape contains some evidence of general incitement. Towards the end of side B, the last sentence of the second to last paragraph, a reference to 10 Germans who have disappeared should probably be double-checked.
This tape contains a long discussion by Bemeriki about the creation of a new parliament in Gisenyi and the role of the PSR (Rwandan Socialist Party). Ruggiu focuses on foreign journalists' misrepresentation of the situation in Rwanda. He also reports on the "military situation" in some detail.

Much of side B is inaudible -- The tape is fairly light and humorous in tone. Kantano pokes fun at most of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) leadership with stereotypical comments about Tutsis.
The tape contains Kantano's account of his visit with the RPF at the CND. He lists a series of RPF dignitaries alternately poking fun at them and accusing them of wanting to obtain power. It also contains an interview with Deputy Rutaremara of the RPF. Kantano casts the interview as an example of the Inkotanyi way of thinking.

Unidentified Kinyarwanda news caster begins with news headlines: (1) Prime Minister Kambanda's meets with religious, political, and party leaders in Gitarama, (2) UN Special Representative Booh-Booh's pledges "never to forsake Rwanda," (3) 400 Belgian troops are leaving Rwanda.
Reporter Rwakana Gaspard continues with report on Kambanda meeting which allegedly discussed ways of ensuring the security of displaced people. These measures include appointing and replacing prefects and appointing a new Army chief of staff. These measures are allegedly hindered by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s unwillingness to stop fighting.
Rwakana then reports on the RPF's "unlucky streak" and the FAR's control over all the communes in Ruhengeri save Butaro. Rwanaka repeats that despite the government's best efforts, security of refugees can only be ensured if the RPF stops fighting. Bourgmesters present at the meetings also blamed the shortcomings in security on logistical problems and a shortage of policeman, vehicles, and fuel.
Unidentified newscaster continues with (1) report on the FAR's control of Nkumba and Kidaho communes in Ruhengeri, (2) UN support for cease-fire, (3) announcement of Western Europe Foreign Affairs Ministers' decision to send food aid and the departure of 400 Belgian troops.
Unidentified French newscaster repeats the headlines and the report on Kamabanda meeting.
Reporter Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka repeats earlier reports on Kambanda meeting adding (1) that it was intended to "persuade the population to cease their vindictive acts and the settling of scores" and (2) to dismiss prefects who were unsuccessful at controlling violence. Bicamumpaka then repeats the remainder of the headlines, this time further specifying FAR strongholds on Byumba, Mutara, and Kigali.
An unidentified Kinyarwanda reporter continues with report that officials have set up several meetings to "clear up misunderstanding among the population" and to help re-integrate people who have fled. This message was reportedly delivered by Sindikubwabo in Gikongoro, in Maraba commune, Butare, and in Nyakizy, Butare. The Gikongoro Prefet gave the President three reasons for the breakdown in security: (1) anger over Habyarimana assassination, (2) a belief that given the opportunity, the RPF would "not spare them at all," (3) simple banditry. The President reportedly answered that revenge does not justify violence.
A taped version of Sindikubwabo's speech follows. In the speech the President (1) urges Rwandan's to watch over each other like gendarmes and not repeat the story of Cain and Abel, (2) argues that gendarmes, population, and army have complementary roles,(3) insists that "security" is primarily the citizens' responsibility, (4) says that citizens who think themselves above the government's orders should be identified and punished.
Sindikubwabo continues alleging the enemies strongest weapon is his ability to sow ethnic division. This division causes Rwandans to seek magic cures for their problems rather than finding and questioning those who support the enemies' allegations. "That's how the enemy fulfills this plan without using . . . bullets . . . those who do not understand are requested to listen before its too late."
Reporter breaks in adding that the President asks refugees to return to their property wherever possible.

Cette √©mission est anim√© par des journalistes de Radio Rwanda aussi bien que de la RTLM. La premi√®re partie de la cassette est anim√© par un journaliste non-identifi√©, Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka et Jean Baptiste Murutampunzi tous originaire de la Radio Rwanda. Cette premi√®re partie s'adresse surtout aux √©v√©nements des derniers jours qui ont produit de nombreuses "victimes innocentes." Ces journalistes, √† l'aide de communiqu√©s officiels, demandent √† la population de retrouver le calme tout en restant vigilant. Parmi d'autres, les Belges et la MINUAR sont d√©nonc√©s d'avoir aid√© le FPR qui est d√©nonc√© √† son tour d'avoir repris les hostilit√©s. Par contre, la communaut√© internationale est lou√©e pour avoir condamn√© les actions du FPR. Jean Kamband a suit ces premiers journalistes avec un discours qui explique que "les moments difficiles" qui caract√©risent le Rwanda sont le r√©sultat de la peine et fureur de la population √† cause d ela mort de leur Pr√©sident Habyarimana. Lui aussi d√©nonce le FPR ainsi que Twagiramungu. Il ajoute que la population doit rester calme toute en doublant de vigilance. Bemeriki passe au micro ensuite et accuse les Belges d'avoir assassin√© Habyarimana tout en accusant la MINUAR de n√©gligence. Bemeriki est suivit d'un entretien entre Ruggiu et Thomas Kabonake, un journaliste avec "L'Echo des Mille Collines." Les deux hommes insistent que le FPR pr√©parait cette guerre depuis six mois et qu'ils essaient maintenant de s'infiltrer parmi la population histoire de les confondre ainsi que les soldats du FAR. Kabonake ajoute que le FPR aurait pay√© certaines agences de presse √©trang√®res pour qu'elles publient de fausses informations. Kantano prend la suite et lance une attaque contre Shyaka de la Radio Muhabura. Il ajoute que la RFI, la BBC et la RTDF sont tous coupables d'avoir diffus√© de faux reportages. Il conclut son monologue avec des incitations √† la population de rester courageux et vigilant. Un journaliste non-identifi√© suit avec des nouvelles des combats √† Kigali.

Side A of the tape begins mid-sentence. Journalist Hyacinthe Bicamumpaka (1) reports on the Defense Minister's praise of the population's "bravery" and patriotism in helping the army, (2) suggest that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is receiving logistical and material assistance, such as helicopters, from foreign countries, (3) claims that in the north and in Kigali the RPF is now "infiltrating to reach places that it could not conquer by arms . . ."
Bicamumpaka continues with a summary on the various options under discussion by the UN Security Council.
After a break in the tape, Bicamumpaka praises the "courage" of the Rwandan people following the "assassination of the Chief of our State by criminals." The Reporter then introduces his interviewee, Eliezer Niyitegeka, Minister of Information.
Niyitegeka explains (1) that cell leaders who "finish their duty" receive rewards from the government, (2) that cell leaders are in a position to "ensure security" by organizing the population to "conduct patrols" and "fight against and denounce the enemy to the authorities." Niyitegeka also (3) stresses that the government has always needed the cell leaders in this capacity.
Niyitegeka continues by saying (1) that the Rwandan army is fighting against the "enemy," (2) that the "enemy" violates the population's rights by shooting at innocent people and burning them alive in their houses, (3) that the population should continue fighting alongside the soldiers and in their place against the "small Inkotanyi," and (4) that the population should do this with whatever weapons it has‚Äîspears, bows, and arrows.
Following Bicamumpaka's mention of "Inkotanyi wickedness," Niyitegeka (1) suggests that 3,400 of the RPF's 4,000 soldiers in Kigali are either infiltrators or spies, (2) asserts that in Gikondo and Nyabarongo, Inkotanyi have killed innocent people, (3) and that Inkotanyi trained by RPF soldiers encircle civilian families at night and throw grenades at them.
In response to a question about Muhabura and Bujumbura Radio, Niyitegeka denies the "enemy's" claims regarding refugees and the fleeing of top government ministers.
The reporter then asks Niyitegeka to respond to RPF appeals to the population to fight against the "government of killers." Niyitegeka denies the charges and claims that in Kigali only RPF soldiers were killed, and that this was after they infiltrated the Presidential Guard compound. Niyitegeka admits that the Presidential Guard was responsible for violence in the immediate wake of the President's assassination but asserts that this violence did not come on orders from the army, but as a result of the Presidential Guard's justifiable "anger and fury" at the murder of their President.
Niyitegeka then explains the Inkotanyi's motives for violence: they are furious because they mistakenly believed that assassinating the President would allow them to "enthrone" their own leader.
Niyitegeka's final remarks regard the RPF's alleged unwillingness to sign a cease-fire or abide by the Arusha accords.
Following the interview, there is a report on the death of Major General Nsabimana D√©ogratias ‚Äî he was on Habyarimana's plane ‚Äî and the cabinet's choice for replacement, Colonel Bizimungu Augustin. The journalist explains that promotions in the army are based on soldiers' "competence, work, courage at work and at the front."
Tape stresses need for population to show its "courage" by collaborating with the army and local officials in "ensuring security " against the "enemy."

Side A consists of a discussion hosted by Agensta Mukarutama featuring Murego, Ngirumpatse, Nsengiyumva, and Mugenzi.
Murego begins with a monologue arguing, (1) that people are beginning to recognize that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s goal is to return Rwanda to its pre-revolutionary time in which "some people commanded . . . and others obeyed," (2) that the RPF was deluded and "made a mistake" in thinking that it could dominate as before, (3) that Rwandans have learned their history and are "saying 'no'" to a repetition of history and are "resisting en masse" the RPF's attempt to "'live handsomely at the expense of his subordinates,'" (4) and that "Rwandans will never again‚Ä¶be a people of slaves."
Agenesta Mukarutama then continues along the same lines suggesting that the RPF has brought the current hardship upon itself, having fallen "victim to its [own] illusions," and that the "Tutsi" could have predicted that this "socio-political disaster" would follow from their attempt to bring back apartheid.
Murego then asserts that, unsatisfied with the right of return offered by the Arusha Accords, the RPF wanted "conquest and revenge," wanted "to massacre their fellows [and] enslave a people who has said 'no' to slavery."
Mukarutama then introduces Ngirumpatse, MRND President, who argues (1) that it would be a "mistake" to think the "Revolutions [of 1959] was finished once and for all," (2) that in this respect, the Arusha Accords were an exceptional attempt on the part of Rwandans to prevent a repetition of history.
Ngirumpatse continues by stressing the exceptional generosity of the Arusha Accords and suggesting that the RPF's stubbornly monarchist desire for domination prevents it from accepting these accords.
Ngirumpatse then asserts that the future of the Arusha Accords depends on the RPF and that as long as it continues to "provoke war" (1) Rwandans will defend themselves, (2) that the RPF's attacks are making Ngirumaptse fear the day when the "minority" sends the "majority of the population" "to the bush," (3) and that this fear explains the desire to see "the minority . . . deleted from the face of the country."
Nsengiyumva then echoes Ngirumpatse's appeal to the RPF to abide by the Arusha Accords.
In an exchange with Mukarutamu, Mugenzi then suggests (1) that both the RPF and the international community were "warned" of the "disaster" that could ensue if the RPF did not abide by the Arusha Accords and so are "responsible" for what has happened, (2) and that negotiations have been made even more difficult by the President's "assassination" and the "fear" and "fury" that it has generated among the Rwandan people.
Next, Ngirumpatse defends the Rwandan government against charges that it is constitutionally invalid. In the course of his defense, Ngirumpatse again refers to RPF "illusions."
Mugenzi then suggests (1) that the international community is largely "responsible" (this word is repeated many times) for the "socio-political disorder" that some journalist call "barbarity." (2) that the international community was "responsible" for allowing the unchecked "infiltration of RPF agents and soldiers in different quarters of Kigali," (3) that the President's assassination by the RPF bears witness to the UNAMIR's faulty surveillance, (4) that he, Mugenzi, warned several UN ambassadors that their treatment of the RPF was unacceptable and threatened to bring about events for which the UN would be "responsible."
Repeating the word "responsibility," Mukarutamu asks Ngirumpatse to say more about the Belgian contingent's role.
Ngirumpatse "denounces" the international community's role in the "disaster," alleging that in the UNAMIR and Belgian controlled regions of Kirambo and Mutura the RPF was allowed "to kill the population," including politicians like Gatabazi Felicien and Bucyana.

In this round table discussion hosted by Agensta Mukarutama featuring Murego, Ngirumpatse, Nsengiyumva, and Mugenzi, the participants discuss RPF plans to return Rwanda to its pre-revolutionary state in which the minority enslaved the majority. The speakers suggest that both the RPF and the international community were warned about the consequences of an RPF attack and so are now responsible for Rwanda's "socio-political disaster."

Continuing the discussion that ends side A, Ngirumpatse (1) suggests that the Belgians collaborated in the President's assassination, (2) asserts Belgians were seen fighting on the side of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and firing at Rwandan soldiers and (3) concludes that the Belgians and UNAMIR bear "responsibility" for the "disaster."
In response, Mukarutamu says it is "curious that Belgium gets bogged down every time there are problems between Hutus and Tutsis."
Murego explains that the UN is "responsible" for the situation in Rwanda because (1) it favored the RPF, (2) allowed the RPF to commit assassinations, (3) was insensitive to the rights of "the Rwandan people."
Murego goes on to suggest that (1) the Belgians act as though they wish "to conquer the country again, (2) that though they may soon leave, this does not "cancel the judgment" made upon them, (3) that some Belgians have decided to side "with the RPF to harm Rwanda and the Rwandans," (4) that some of these Belgians might have been killed in a fire fight. Murego concludes by saying that "Rwanda became an independent country that nobody can invade."
Responding to a further question about the role of the Belgians, Ngirumpatse suggests (1) that Belgians think of Rwandans as exceedingly polite and try to take advantage of this, (2) that some Rwandan political parties tried to strengthen Belgium's influence in Rwanda, (3) that if Rwandan's aren't more careful people will confuse their "docility" with a lack of self-determination, (4) and that submitting to the RPF "hands and feet tied" will bring not bring prosperity to Rwandans. Ngirumpatse concludes by suggesting that Rwandans should be more like the Roman emperor who understood that it was better to be feared than liked.
Next, in an exchange with Mukarutama, Ngirumpatse discusses Ugandan reaction to the current events, charging that Museveni (1) helped the RPF wreak havoc in Kigali and elsewhere, (2) and that he did not respect or understand that Rwandan people had killed because of anger over their President's assassination. Ngirumpatse also criticized the hypocrisy of the international community because it does not condemn the human rights violations perpetrated in Uganda. Finally, Ngirumpatse predicts that before too long Museveni will have Rwanda type "problem."
Dr. Murego ends the "debate" by highlighting its main points: (1) that the "Rwandan people's . . . fierce defense" demonstrates a refusal to "any longer be unconditionally docile" and a desire "to be in control of their own destiny," (2) that a new step is being taken to complete the Revolution of 1959, wherein the Rwandan people are not liberating themselves from "bad physical leadership" but from those related "to the family or ethnicity of those leaders," (3) that the latter signals a "mental revolution" because it shows that the Rwandan people "will never stand anymore to be anyone's slaves," (4) that this revolution will ensure that the "docility" (this word is often repeated) attributed to the Rwandan people will never again be used to humiliate them and deprive them of their rights, (5) that this is a way of saying "'no' to any dictatorial" intentions of the enemy.
Mukarutamu ends the broadcast by thanking her guests and calling on the Rwandan people to "control their destiny‚Ä¶defend their right to dignity . . . [and to be] vigilant and intelligent."

In the second half of this round table discussion hosted by Agensta Mukarutama featuring Murego, Ngirumpatse, Nsengiyumva, and Mugenzi, the participants focus on the Belgians and their "responsibility" for the "disaster" taking place in Rwanda. They are accused of collaborating with the RPF and its murder or Habyarimana and taking advantage of the "docility" of the Rwandan people. The Rwandan people are in turn praised for their "fierce defense" which ensures that they will "never again" be enslaved as they were before the Revolution of 1959.

This tape consists of Bamwanga's interview with political party leaders Karemera (MRND), Mbonyumutwa (MDR), Mbonampeka (PL), and Nsengiyumva (PSD). They discuss the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s true motives behind its claim that it is only fighting the Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe-CDR. Bamwanga also asks the party leaders to discuss why the RPF appears concerned with the deaths of former Hutu politicians. The four men generally agree that the RPF is interested only in obtaining power and in disguising their "Inyenzi" and UNAR origins.

This tape has the second half of Bamwanga's interview from Archive #080A with political party leaders Karemera (MRND), Mbonyumutwa (MDR), Mbonampeka (PL), and Nsengiyumva (PSD). They continue their discussion about the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s motives when it defends the cause of dead Hutu politicians. Bamwanga and the party leaders also address the RPF's call to Rwandans to join them before "it is too late." Again there is general agreement that the RPF is interested only in obtaining power and that the RPF is attempting to "trick" and mislead people. The men also suggest that the RPF is appealing to the population because it fears it will lose the war.

Un journaliste non-identifi√© commence la cassette avec une d√©claration que les forces arm√©es du FPR "massacrent syst√©matiquement" la population Rwandaise. Il ajoute que le FPR est responsable de l'assassinat du Pr√©sident Habyarimana et que la population doit collaborer avec la FAR pour combattre l'infiltration des Inkotanyi. Ce journaliste est suivi d'un entretien de Froduald Karamira du MDR par Nkundibiza. Karamira annonce que les "Inyenzi" se trouvant √† Kigali se font arr√™t√©s par la population aux barri√®res. Il annonce aussi qu'il ne reste plus que Nyanza, Rebero et Kacyiru a nettoy√©. Karamira dit √† la population de ne pas se mettre engroupe car les Inkotanyi sont capables de tirer dans la foule. Il accuse le FPR de vouloir exterminer la population et qu'il faut donc donner une formation √† la population pour qu'elle puisse se d√©fendre. Karamira ajoute que les Inkotanyi font exterminer les Tutsi car ils ont fait de cette guerre une guerre ethnique. Rwakana prend la rel√®ve et s'entretient avec plusieurs citoyens Rwandais √† Kigali. Ces Rwandais rapportent que les Inkotanyi font des masscres un peu partout dans le pays. Certains ajoutent que les routes sont pleins de cadavres d'Inkotanyi aussi. Un journaliste non-identifi√© annonce que le FPR refuse de prendre sa place aux n√©gociations sans que le gouvernement Rwandais mette fin aux massacres.

Bemeriki maintient que l'installation des institutions de transition n'a pas √©t√© accompli parce que les "Inyenzi Inkotanyi" ont re-d√©clench√© la guerre. Elle interview Jean-Pierre Kajuga de la commune Murambi qui rapporte que la pr√©fecture de Byumba est devenu "un repaire des soldats de Museveni." Kajuga explique qu'un comit√© a √©t√© form√© pour se charger de "l'autod√©fense" et que chaque personne doit se servir des armes m√™me si ce ne sont que des armes traditionnelles. Bemeriki rapporte ensuite que la presse internationale "a avou√©" que les "Inyenzi" ont tu√© des religieux et que le Pape est d√©concert√©. Ananie prend son tour au micro et explique que la communaut√© internationale continue √† rapporter des informations erron√©es obtenues des Inkotanyi. Un journaliste non-identifi√© rapporte que 650.000 Hutu sont morts √† Byumba et 500.000 sont morts √† Kibungo. Bemeriki reprend le micro et commence une discussion avec Bernard Hategekimana qui travail au journal "Kamarampaka." Les deux journalistes sont d'accord que les forces arm√©es Rwandaises "ont la situation en main" et que les habitants qui avaient fui devant l'avance Inkotanyi sont revenus. Hategekimana explique que les Inkotanyi continue √† lancer des bombes sur la population. Bemeriki, Bernard Mukwiye et Ananie terminent la cassette. Ils s'adressent √† la situation √† Gisenyi o√π la population a √©t√© "sensibilis√©," et √† la propagande des Inkotanyi qui veulent que les Rwandais se disputent entre nord et sud.

This tape contains evidence of general incitement. Listeners are warned that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) will never accept democracy and will carry out attacks whenever possible. The tape also implies that the government is losing control of the situation.
This tape begins with a short monologue by Kantano criticizing the government's unwillingness to respond to the situation in Ruhengeri. The interview/discussion with Gahigi and Nahimana follows and focuses on the government's complicity in alleged Inkotanyi plots to take power. The Inkotanyi are linked to Tutsis and the "Inyenzi" of 1959 and are accused of numerous atrocities.

The tape offers strong evidence of incitement in the sense that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is exclusively blamed for recent atrocities in Ruhengeri. The participants of the discussion are adamant about the RPF's unwillingness to find a peaceful solution.
This tape continues a discussion/interview with Gahigi, Kantano, and Nahimana. They discuss Kanyarengwe's defection to the RPF and his chances of political survival in the game he is playing. Much of the broadcast is otherwise spent criticizing the RPF and warning Rwandans of the RPF's divisive tactics and unwillingness to obey the Arusha Accords. Kantano spends some time teaching listeners how to recognize UNAMIR soldiers.

Cette cassette est compos√©e enti√®rement d'une discussion entre Gahigi, Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, un homme nomm√© Ravi, Madame Mbonampeka, Charles Nkurunziza et Marie Claire Rwabukwisi. Leur discussion tourne autour de ces th√®mes: (1) l'importance des ethnies au Rwanda - Ravi maintient qu'il n'y a pas de diff√©rence entre les Hutu et Tutsi tandis que les autres, Barayagwiza en particulier, maintiennent qu'il existe des diff√©rences et qu'il faut les souligner, (2) les Hutu ont longtemps souffert sous la domination des Tutsi et il est impossible d'oublier ce fait maintenant, (3) les Tutsi ont gard√© la mentalit√© de sup√©riorit√© qu'ils tenaient avant la r√©volution de 1959, (4) la vraie diff√©rence Hutu-Tutsi est une diff√©rence de culture, (5) le probl√®me Hutu-Tutsi est un probl√®me de "qui doit gouverner ce pays," (6) une accusation que les Tutsi veulent monopoliser le pouvoir, (7) les Hutu constitue la majorit√©, ils devraient donc pouvoir gouverner le pays, (8) le probl√®me des Hutu et Tutsi est localis√© chez une "mauvaise administration," (9) les Tutsi n'ont pas le droit d'exterminer la population si ils sont refus√©s le droit de rentrer au Rwanda, (10) le seul rem√®de pour le probl√®me ethnique est que les deux c√¥t√©s s'asseyent ensemble pour discuter.

Aside from claims that the genocide was planned by the authorities and that the radio in Rwanda played a role, the transcript offers little in the way of evidence. It mainly attempts to portray the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in a positive light.
This tape consists of two interviews done by Radio Muhabura. Both involve Rwandans formerly involved with the FAR. In conjunction with an unidentified journalist, Alphonse Mukurarinda and Christophe Ntiryigirayo attempt to reassure Rwandans about the Inkotanyi. Both insist that they have been well treated and that the RPF has been misrepresented.

La plus grande partie de cette cassette contient une discussion entre Bemeriki et plusieurs personnes d√©plac√©es se trouvant maintenant dans les environs de Kigali. Au cours de ces √©changes nous apprenons que les Inkotanyi ont tu√© de nombreux Hutu qui n'ont paspu s'√©chapper. Bemeriki essaie de convaincre ces r√©fugi√©s de retourner dans leurs propres communes pour pouvoir participer aux combats contre les Inyenzi. Elle tente de convaincre ces personnes que les soldats du FAR sont en train d'exterminer les Inkotanyi ou que les r√©fugi√©s eux-m√™mes, si ils s'unissent et retournent chex eux, peuvent vaincre les Inkotanyi car ceux-ci sont peu nombreux. Bemeriki explique aussi que en quittant leurs biens, les r√©fugi√©s aident la cause des "Inyenzi." La majorit√©s des r√©fugi√©s sont pr√®s √† retourner chez eux mais seulement en compagnie du FAR ou de leurs bourgmestre, conseillers, etc. Ils r√©clament des armes aussi. Un des d√©plac√© annonce que la pr√©fecture de Byumba est presque enti√®rement vid√©e de Hutu. Bemeriki termine l'√©mission en annon√ßant que la plus part des d√©plac√©s sont pr√®s √† s'armer pour retourner chez eux et faire face √† l'ennemi. Elle ajoute que les "Inyenzi" continuent √† essayer de tromper l'opinion internationale.

Ccassette contient la fameuse annonce que "quelque chose se pr√©pare le 3, 4 et 5 √† Kigali . . . etc.
Cette cassette commence avec l'interrogatoire d'un soldat captur√© du FPR par un interrogateur de la FAR. Le soldat captur√© r√©v√®le que les Inkotanyi se trouvent √† Rebero et qu'ils ont v√©cu ensemble avec les Belges. Hitimana passe au micro ensuite pour commencer un long monologue dans lequel il d√©clare que: (1) plusieurs complices des Inkotanyi ont √©t√© d√©couvert √† Butete, Kidaho, Gitare et Burambi, (2) des gens se font tu√©s ou enlev√©s par les Inkotanyi dans la zone tampon, (3) un certain Fr√©d√©ric Nzamurambaho a refus√© de para√Ætre au tribunal au sujet d'une enqu√™te √† propos de la mort de F√©licien Gatabazi. Gahigi suit Hitimana dans un entretien avec le Procureur G√©n√©ral Mbarushimana. L'entretien s'adresse au refus du Ministre Nzamurambaho de compara√Ætre devant la cour. Le procureur donne son avis que personne ne devrait se permettre de croire qu'il est plus important que la loi. Ananie entre en discussion avec ses coll√®gues et offre l'opinion que Nzamurambaho est responsable de la famine dans sa pr√©fecture de Gikongoro. Hitimana reprend le micro ensuite et termine la cassette avec les propos suivants: (1) il vise plusieurs chauffeurs de taxis sous pr√©texte qu'ils transportent les Inkotanyi au CND, (2) le FPR se pr√©pare √† exterminer la population Rwandaise, (3) en attendant la guerre les Inkotanyi se contente de tuer des Hutu petit √† petit, (4) il annonce que selon ses complices inkotanyi "le 3, le 4 et le 5 il devra avoir quelque chose dans cette ville de Kigali ‚Ä¶ se reposer le 6 et ensuite le 7 et le 8 reprendre en utilisant les balles et grenades," (5) il demande que Madame Uwilingiyimana s'explique devant un tribunal pour avoir accus√© le CDR "d'avoir fait le g√©nocide."

Un journaliste non-identifi√© suit avec un interview du G√©n√©ral Rom√©o Dallaire. Ce dernier parait irrit√© mais il annonce qu'il est de l'avis qu'un cessez-le-feu est pr√©f√©rable √† l'√©tat de guerre que subit le Rwanda. Ensuite Robert Simba ou Aimable Sibomana lit un communiqu√© du Pr√©fet Karera qui demande √† la population de redoubler de vigilance. Bemeriki le suit et annonce que des "Inyenzi" sont en train de br√ªler dans la cave de Sebera. Elle d√©nonce ensuite les Belges qu'elle accuse d'avoir √©t√© complices des Inkotanyi. Mbilizi est le prochain √† prendre le micro. Il demande lui aussi √† la population de redoubler de vigilance et de veiller sur les "petites infiltrations."

The tape begins with an unidentified francophone speaker who (1) says that the war has become a "guerrilla" conflict with the FAR "pursuing the enemy everywhere" and watching out for infiltrators because, (2) "Either we crush the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), or we get crushed by it!"
The broadcaster continues by alleging that the RPF "orchestrated" the massacres "with the complicity of the Belgians" and that the killing of President Habyarimana and other politicians such as Gapyisi, Rwambuka, Gatabazi, and Bucyana was meant to provoke the population's anger and cause the massacres.
After a musical interlude, Nkurunziza Ananie takes the microphone and (1) details the RPF conspiracy to assassinate Habyarimana and alleges that Mobutu had also been slated to die, (2) claims that Kanyarengwe and "his Inyenzi-tutsi" had killed Hutus in Murera, Buberuka, Kibali, Ndorwa, Rukiga, Buganza, Gisaka, and that "the Tutsi army exterminated all the Hutus in Bwanacyambwe region," (3) denies Muhabura claims of RPF advances, (4) and claims that the US is finally realizing the RPF are "Tutsi terrorists" who refuse to negotiate.
Kantano speaks next. He (1) denies reports that the RPF is capturing Kigali, (2) says the Belgians will heretofore be "treated like . . . any Inkotanyi in this country," (3) lauds the arrival of French troops, which he suggests might "preserve [the RPF] from being exterminated" in their loosing war.
Ananie then tells of how Inyenzi were shot out of their hide-out in the "Belgian Village in Nyaryarama" and of how the Inyenzi burnt the Belgian houses during their retreat. Ananie then suggests that Sindikubwabo is like Mandela who "fought for the liberation of the whole race of . . . "bahutu"‚Ä¶"
Ananie then discounts reports of RPF advances and ridicules the RPF's military disorganization. He then "remind(s) everybody that Kigali city won't be [taken]" and suggests that the FAR's situation parallels that of the Allied Forces vis √† vis Hitler "who is similar to the Inkotanyi who strongly believed in a superior race like the Inkotanyi, in a race created by God to govern."
Kantano then mocks Kagame's promise to take Kigali within 24 hours. He then elaborates on the RPF's conspiracy to kill the President and alleges that the RPF expected that after Habyarimana's assassination (1) everyone would bow before the RPF's heroism, (2) and that the RPF's accomplices, who were hiding in wait, would "attack you at night."
Kantano explains that this plan foundered when the Rwandan people discovered it and "immediately lynch(ed) all the accomplices within communes, prefectures or RPF brigades," so that "those who had prepared holes to put in Hutus have been the ones to go inside." Kantano claims that having lost "accomplices" like "Agatha, Ngango, Nzamurambaho", Kagame can no longer see beyond his immediate army.
Kantano claims that the elimination of accomplices has changed Kagame's strategy, because he now fears the "population [that] had smoked some hemp" and "became furious with their machetes and clubs." Kantano claims that the 50,000-80,000 armed men in Kigali would defeat the RPF, "though Tutsis pretend to be dodging artists."
Kantano then mockingly dismisses the RPF's claim to possess half the country, saying that it only holds un-populated, desert-like areas like Cyungo and Butaro. Kantano then ridiculed Kanyarengwe's instruction to "Tutsis" not to seek revenge, suggesting that such instructions might actually incite the wrath of other Tutsis who will say "'all Tutsis countrywide are dead, our relatives, our sisters, mothers and fathers.'"
After a musical break, Kantano denounces the Belgians and urges Rwandans to have courage despite adversity. Kantano then speaks of refugees from Kabeza-Kanombe whom the FAR liberated from the "RPF who had started surrounding them to kill them." At the same time, Kantano suggests that when it comes to news of RPF advances, the refugee "who is under panic . . . tends to exaggerate his story."
Kantano continues with a long monologue about the RPF's take-over of the Kigali airport which he dismisses as militarily and strategically insignificant.
Segueing from his discussion of Kigali airport, Kantano insists that in war, like in soccer, nothing is definitive until the end of the match, and that a "counter-offensive" is always possible. Kantano devotes a long moment to developing this analogy between soccer and war.
The racial designations of "Hutu" and "Tutsi" are common in the tape and are suggestive of a synonymy between "RPF," "Inkotanyi," "Inyenzi" and "Tutsi." There are also many suggestions of Tutsi against Hutu extermination goals.
Repeatedly using ethnic slurs, RTLM broadcasters Habimana and Ananie discuss the RPF's conspiracy to kill the President and massacre Hutus and false reports of RPF troop advancement. The broadcasters stress the importance of eliminating the RPF's accomplices and draw a parallel between the Nazis and the RPF, which is accused of planning and executing massacres of Hutus.

The tape contains very strong statements of general incitement -- The broadcasters repeatedly insist that the conflict is between Tutsis and Hutus.
The broadcast encourages listeners to disregard rumors of Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) victories and stay "courageous": those who "work" hard at the roadblocks will be rewarded, while deserters will be tracked down and exterminated by the population. Kantano and Ananie make repeated calls to exterminate Inyenzi everywhere in the country. They also repeatedly accuse the Tutsi/RPF of perpetrating massacres and insist that the conflict is really between Hutus and Tutsis.

Bemeriki est l'animatrice de cette cassette. Elle s'adresse d'abord √† la situation √† Kibeho o√π, selon elle, un pr√™tre, l'Abb√© Pierre Ngoga, a tir√© sur des Hutu qui pourchassaient des Tutsi qui les avaient attaqu√©s. Elle ajoute qu'une situation similaire a transpir√© √† Nyumba. Elle incite ses auditeurs √† d√©truire toutes cachettes de l'ennemi, m√™me une √©glise. Bemeriki rapporte ensuite que les "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi" et les Tutsi se servent de ruses pour faire croire que les Hutu massacrent les Tutsi tandis qu'en r√©alit√© ce sont les Tutsi qui veulent exterminer les Hutu. Elle ajoute que les "Inyenzi"ont collabor√© avec les sales Tutsi pour tuer le Pr√©sident Habyarimana. Bemeriki fait r√©f√©rence ensuite aux paroles de la Vierge Marie √† Kibeho le 20 mars 1989. Bemeriki d√©montre √† travers le message de la Vierge Marie que la m√®re de J√©sus prot√©gera les Rwandais et accueillera lefeu Pr√©sident Habyarimana. Mais Bemeriki encourage comme m√™me ses auditeurs √† se battre s√©rieusement car la Vierge Marie ne les aidera que si ils s'aident d'abord. Par la suite Bemeriki s'entretient avec Hassan Ngeze du journal "Kangura." Au cours de plusieurs longues r√©ponse, Ngeze explique que le FPR tente de semer la m√©sentente et le d√©saccord parmi la population Rwandaise de fa√ßon de se mettre en position pour une prise de pouvoir. Il discute longuement cet aspect m√©chant des Inkotanyi.

This tape contains a very long monologue by Kanatano sandwiched between two smaller monologues by Ruggiu and Mukingo. Kantano focuses especially on the need for the Rwandan population to participate in the war effort. He calls on them to stay and fight the Inkotanyi rather than fleeing at the sound of every explosion. Kantano employs several forms of motivation from threats to promises of rewards.

Cette cassette est anim√©e par Kantano et Ananie. Kantano commence en souhaitant que les r√©fugi√©s retournent √† Kigali parce que les Inkotanyi n'ont plus de complices dans la ville. Il ajoute que les r√©fugi√©s peuvent donner un coup de main aux barri√®res et aider √† terminer le "boulot" au bout d'un mois. Kantano d√©montre aussi que les Inkotanyi n'ont fait que semer la haine partout au Rwanda, qu'ils n'auront jamais la paix dans ce pays. Kantano conclut que les Inkotanyi n'aime pas l'√™tre fumain et il demande √† la population de s'armer de machettes et de lances pour se joindre au FAR et exterminer les Inkotanyi. Il compare aussi les Inkotanyi √† des moustiques. Ananie suit Kantano et demande que les personnes aux barri√®res soient vigilantes. Il accuse les "Inyenzi" d'avoir tir√© sur le stade Amahoro o√π se trouve de nombreux r√©fugi√©s. Ananie commente aussi que les Inkotanyi, aid√©s par Museveni, ont commis de nombreux massacres sans que la communaut√© internationale ou les radios √©trang√®res en disent un mot. Kantano termine la cassette en d√©clarant: (1) que les "Inyenzi" ont trop pourchass√© les gens et vont maintenant se faireexterminer, (2) les Inkotanyi sont coupables d'avoir chass√© des gens de leurs biens, (3) les blancs qui aidaient les Inkotanyi les ont abandonn√©s, (4) que la population surmonte sa peur et parte √† la chasse aux Inkotanyi.

Side A of the broadcast, hosted mostly by Bemeriki and Ruggiu, focuses broadly on the French troops' arrival in Rwanda. The broadcasters tell the population that they should cooperate with the French, but that the advice of numerous scholars and intelligent men is that it would be "absurd" for the population to hand-in their weapons or dismantle roadblocks.

Side B of the tape consists mostly of two extended monologues. In the first, Valerie Bemeriki explains that when she says "Inyenzi," listeners should understand she means "criminal." Bemeriki accuses the "Inyenzi-Inkotanyi" of using the French Army's arrival to extend their exterminations, and warns that anyone remaining in "Inyenzi" controlled areas is clearly also an Inyenzi and will eventually be treated as one. Bemeriki subsequently calls for the death of the four political figures she holds responsible for Habyarimana's assassination. In the second monologue, Ananie Nkurunziza makes a direct call against the occupants of a house in Kacyiru, encourages people in Kimisagara, Muhima, and Rugenge to fire at any "Inyenzi" coming their way, and urges listeners not to let bad weather keep them from manning the roadblocks. Ananie also criticizes the unequal distribution of international aid between Tutsi and Hutu refugees, but says that the international press now acknowledges that "Inyenzi attack villages to kill Hutu populations."

The identity of the journalist should be verified, but it does appear to be Kantano.
The tape consists mostly of specific attacks against Gasana, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and to accusations of Uwilingiyimana's and the extended transitional government's collaboration with the Inkotanyi. It also accuses the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) of recent massacres in Ruhengeri and of wanting to set up a "Tutsi land" within Rwanda and Burundi.

The identity of the speaker should be double-checked, but I am reasonably certain that it is Habimana Kantano.
The entire tape is a long monologue by Kantano focusing on the massacre that took place in Ruhengeri. Kantano repeatedly accuses the Inkotanyi of having committed the atrocities and includes witness testimonies from the area in his monologue. Kantano also suggests that neither the UN forces nor the Rwandan government have done anything to investigate the massacre and establish the Inkotanyi's guilt. Faustin Twagiramungu and Minister Gasana are both taken to task for their ineffectiveness. It is implied that both men are also guilty of various improprieties. Twagiramungu in particular is said to have a favorable relationship with the Inkotanyi.

The tape consists of a series of Kantano Habimana reports from Burundi and an extended monologue by Gaspard Gahigi. Gaspard, in his extended monologue, critiques the transitional government, alleging that it takes the power from the people. He calls on the church to lend its intelligence apparatuses and files to the cause of restoring the people's power and helping to identify the "killers who are trying to decimate the population." Gahigi then discusses the political significance of popular songs and demonstrates how they can be read for inspiration. He then introduces Kantano's reportage from Burundi by suggesting that the "known enemy" in Burundi is the same as in Rwanda. From Burundi, Kantano reports on the recent murder of the Burundian President Ndadaye and obliquely suggests that Tutsis in the government might have been behind the murder. Kantano also reports that Tutsi bandits are taking advantage of the Burundian refugee crisis to rob and kill Hutus.

Kantano commence cette cassette et sert d'animateur pour une grande partie de l'√©mission. Il d√©clare que: (1) il ne d√©fend pas la cause du MRND, mais il refuse de l'entendre faussement soup√ßonn√© d'avoir commis des atrocit√©s dont les Inkotanyi sont coupables, (2) certaines personnes qui r√©sident au Byumba et au Ruhengeri sont en fait des complices des Inkotanyi, mais il ajoute qu'il ne hait pas les Tutsi, (3) qu'il y a une conf√©rence de presse √† l'h√¥tel des Diplomates pour le PL Hutu et Tutsi, (4) le Premier Ministre Uwilingiyimana dit que quelqu'un veut la tuer, (5) que deux professeurs Za√Ærois et Victor Niyitegeka devraient veiller √† ce qu'ils ne se battent pas avec leurs √©tudiants parce que cela risque de mal tourner pour eux.

La face B est vierge
La cassette commence avec un monologue de Gahigi. II s'adresse aux sujets suivant: (1) Le Premier Ministre Uwilingiyimana n'aide pas la cause des femmes quand elle manque de respect √† un homme, particuli√®rement au Pr√©sident Habyarimana, (2) un communiqu√© du PDC annonce que le parti retire son soutien du Premier Ministre D√©sign√© Twagiramungu car ce dernier voudrait ignorer la d√©mocratie. Kantano prend la suite et fait un rapport sur les c√©r√©monies au CND o√π le Pr√©sident Habyarimana vient de pr√™ter serment de diriger la transition aux √©lections. Il raconte que Madame Uwilingiyimana a tourn√© son dos au Pr√©sident et que toute l'assembl√©e a √©t√© surpris de voir Habyarimana pr√™ter serment. Kantano reste au micro et dirige un entretien avec Monseigneur Sebununguli. Les deux hommes discutent le d√©veloppement d'une nouvelle faction du PL. Dor√©navant il existera le PL/Lando et le PL/Mugenzi. Les d√©put√©s du FPR annoncent d√©j√† qu'ils ne pr√™teront pas serment si les d√©put√©s du PL/Lando ne pr√™tent pas leur serment. Gahigi reprend bri√®vement le micro pour d√©clarer que le journal "Interahamwe" d√©plore l'attitude malhonn√™te de Twagiramungu, Uwilingiyimana et Kavaruganda. Habyarimana, lors d'un discours plus tard dans la journ√©e au CND, annonce qu'il est d√©√ßu que certains d√©put√©s ne se sont pas montr√©s pour pr√™ter serment. Kantano termine l'√©mission en d√©clarant qu'il pense qu'il y a un pi√®ge et que c'est pour cela que des d√©put√©s ne sont pas venus pr√™ter serment.

The first part of side a features an interview between Gahigi and Froduald Karamira in which the two men attack Twagiramungu for his unlawful attempt s to manipulate parliamentary law and thereby help the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The second part of Side A consists of an extended monologue by Gahigi in which he analyses a recent assassination attempt against Mugenzi, the President of the PL. Gahigi asserts that Twagiramungu, Landouard, and the RPF are behind the matter and that this is part of a larger strategy of using assassinations to gain power and influence in Rwanda. Reading a letter from Martin Ndabazi, Gahigi warns that Rwandans know who these "enemies" of the country are plan to take their revenge on them. In the course of his monologue, Gahigi suggests that Habyarimana himself might be one of the people targeted for assassination by the enemies of Rwanda.

Side B of the tape is comprised of a single monologue by Kantano. It begins with an appeal to gendarmes not to attack the population should it "get angry" at Twagiramungu and decide to attack him. The monologue continues with a call to political parties "to strangle" like a common thief, anyone in their midst who does not who does not work for the good the party and the state. (Twagiramungu is given as an example.) Later in the tape, in the midst of a series of short reports on various Hutu-Tutsi tensions, Kantano suggests that Tutsis have plans "to bring turmoil and kill[ing]" to Rwanda and that Inkotanyi spies have infiltrated the country to begin "sensitizing" the Tutsi population to their plan.

A quelques endroits la traductrice donne un r√©sum√© du programme
La face A de cette cassette est anim√© par un journaliste non-identifi√© qui s'adresse aux probl√®mes autour du Projet Cr√™te Za√Ære Nil. Le journaliste accuse Fr√©d√©ric Nzamurambaho, le Ministre de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage, de semer le d√©sordre dnas ce projet. Il se trouve que Nzamurambaho veut remplacer le Directeur du Projet, Monsieur C√©lestin Mutabaruka avec Monsieur Tharcisse Bakundukize qui est Tutsi et adh√©rent du PSD comme Nzamurambaho. Le journaliste lit les deux lettres que a √©crit Mutabaruka aux officiels du gouvernement. Mutabaruka maintient que Nzamurambaho est responsable de l'ins√©curit√© autour du projet et de la r√©gion. Hitimana commence la face B en annon√ßant que les id√©es sanguinaires des Inkotanyi ont √©t√© d√©couvertes √† temps et qu'ils ont r√©alis√© que les Tutsi seraient extermin√©s si ils mettaient le programme en place. Hitimana d√©clare aussi que les Hutu ont eu le temps d'√©tudier depuis 1959 et qu'ils contr√¥lent l'infiltration des Inkotanyi dans le pays. Hitimana termine l'√©mission en visant plusieurs personnes et les accusant d'√™tre soit Ugandais, soit Inkotanyi.

The first part of the tape consists of a long monologue by Kantano in which he reports on the alleged Inkotanyi massacre of five workers from the COOPTHE tea project in Cyohoha-Rukeri. Kantano criticizes the UN for allowing the Inkotanyi to occupy the demilitarized zone in which the murders took place. Kantano also details the Inkotanyi infiltration of the commune of Sake and warns of coming attacks by the Inkotanyi. An MRND communiqu√© is read warning that the Rwanda people will take action if the Rwandan government and the UNAMIR do not do a better job of protecting people. Ruggiu and Rucogoza follow with similar reports in French.

Producer: RTLM
Original Language: Kinyarwanda, French
An unidentified journalist states that the CDR should be allowed to participate in the transitional government. Ruggiu then reports that the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)'s Radio Muhabura is waging a war of disinformation and blaming the CDR and MDR for crimes committed in the demilitarized zone. Rucogoza follows with a report about the student demonstrations at the Faculty of Law in Kigali. He interviews two students, Viateur Kamali and F√©lix Aimable Mujyambere who deny the notion that the demonstrations have a political background. Rucogoza then interviews Dr. Jean Gakwaya, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Kigali, who is of the opinion that the crisis at the university is linked to the current political and socio-economic troubles prevalent throughout Rwanda. Ruggiu then implies that the Belgians are "blackmailing" Rwanda. A conversation between Ruggiu and Gahigi follows. They discuss the RPF's "infiltration" plots, the fact that the "enemy is known" and the RPF's unwillingness to share power. Their conversation is interspersed with reports that a certain Jean Ndamiye's house is under attack in Kiyovu. Mr. Katumba's death is mentioned as well as an incident that took place in Karago. At one point Ruggiu muses about why "some MRND and CDR militants are regularly attacked." Towards the end of the cassette Kantano comes on to report that Mr. Niyongira in Muyira apparently plotted against an MP Muhutu. Kantano hopes that the people of Muyira are listening. Rucogoza and Mbilizi end the tape with the following comments: 1) Should General Dallaire continue as commander of the UNAMIR? 2) the RPF has recruited 13 students out of Nyanza. 3) The RPF has no right to prevent the CDR from participation in the transitional parliament.
Air Date: 1994 Mar. 31
Producer: RTLM
Original Language: Kinyarwanda, French
Kantano begins the tape retracting an earlier statement alleging that Christophe Bazivamo is an "Inyenzi." He then targets Justin Niyongira and a number of "collaborators" including Balthazar Bazatoba, Silas Ruzinda and Conseiller Theobald Rutaganzwa. Niyongira in particular is accused of allowing members of the PSD and of his ethnic group of committing murder without having to face punishment. Mbilizi then interviews Stanislas Simbizi of the CDR who it is said has just "narrowly escaped" an attempt on his life. Simbizi accuses the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) of committing atrocities and of being unwilling to participate in a peaceful democratic process. Rucogoza then provides an eerie description of the "gloomy" atmosphere pervading Kigali city. Mbilizi follows with a list of students from Nyanza said to have formed the "Inziraguteba Brigade" with the intent of joining the RPF. Mbilizi then addresses the conflict between the CDR and the RPF about the CDR's participation in the Transitional National Assembly.
Air Date: 1994 Mar. 31
Producer: RTLM
Original Language: Kinyarwanda, French
Double-check air date. The tape appears to begin with a broadcast from the night of March 31, 1994. However, the tape apparently ends the following morning April 1, 1994.
Mbilizi begins the tape reading from a letter addressed to Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana from eleven Ministers in her Cabinet. The letter is a criticism of Uwilingiyimana and implies that she has inappropriate contact with the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Mbilizi then launches into a monologue about the difficulty of implementing the Arusha Accords and particularly the problems the RPF are creating by opposing the CDR's entry into the Transitional National Assembly. He also accuses the RPF of committing atrocities. Ruggiu follows with an interview of Gahigi. Among other things they touch on the true face of the RPF and its desire for power. Gahigi also predicts a "total war" should fighting break out again.
Air Date: 1994 Apr. 01
Producer: RTLM
Original Language: Kinyarwanda, French
The translator appears to have summarized parts of the tape (see record #14, end of transcript).
Bemeriki begins the tape with a communiqu√© from the Laurien Karumuhinzi, Secretary General of the Democratic Party. Karumuhinzi extends his party's support to the CDR in their fight to gain entry into the Transitional National Assembly. Hitimana follows with a long monologue in which he targets two men, Dr. Ngirabanyiginya and Dr. Iyamuremye, for responsibility in the death of Katumba, a member of the CDR. Hitimana also targets two employees of the Department of Taxes, Albert Niyotwilingiye and Immaculee Bamurange, for allegedly offering a reward to Katumba's killer. Hitimana implies that the Inkotanyi are the source of the murder. He ends the tape with an analysis of the major parties during which several party leaders are targeted as particularly inefficient or as having ties to the Inkotanyi. The MRND's woes are blamed on the war and the CDR is lauded as the only party with the population's interests at heart.
Air Date: 1994 Apr. 01
Producer: RTLM
Original Language: Kinyarwanda, French
Again, as in Archive #189A, there are two sections (records 1 and 8) where the translator did not translate the text.
Nkomati begins the tape attacking the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) for their statements broadcasted on Radio Rwanda in which they criticize the government, intellectuals and journalists. He then proceeds to summarize the letter written by the Democratic Party in support of the CDR's participation in the Transitional National Assembly. Gahigi follows with an on-site report of a grenade attack directed against Thomas Kabonabake, editor of the newspaper "Echo des Milles Collines." Kabonabake explains that it is the second such attack and the he suspects his "Tutsi neighbors" and their accomplices. He also suggests that the Inkotanyi have informants among the Rwandan population who report back to the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) leaders staying at the CND.

The Incarceration Zine Collection covers 1995 to 2007. Contents are almost exclusively produced by the South Chicago ABC Zine Distro publishing group, led by Anthony Rayson. A significant portion of this collection include essays by Rayson. The collection is predominately zines, most of which are written by Anarchists. Additional items are ABC Zine Distro catalogues and a few pieces of inmate art.
Most zines are original creations, though some pieces are reproduced texts by other authors. These works include Anarchist Morality by Peter Kroptokin, chapter 1 of Black Panther Party (Reconsidered) edited by Charles E. Jones, and The Diary of Bobby Sands.
Zines include republished pieces of famous inmates, including poetry and writings by Weather Underground member David Gilbert and political prisoners Mumia Abu-Jamal and Harold H. Thompson. Some pieces have an international focus, covering topics such as Vietnam, the Russian Revolution, and the El Mozote massacre. Domestic issues covered include race in the prison system, the resurgence of the Black Panther Party, revolutionary organizing in prison, Native American rights, and growth of the prison-industrial system.
Noted authors in this collection in Mumia Abu-Jamal, Sundiata Acoli, David Gilbert, Kevin "Rashid" Johnson, Dennis Kyne, Ashanti Alston Omowali, Anthony Rayson, Bobby Sands, Sean Swain, and Harold H. Thompson.
Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive (Duke University).
Included are two prints of inmate artwork. One, by Kevin "Rashid" Johnson is a hand-drawn collage of Malcolm X. The other item, signed "RJC" features Mickey Mouse pointing at a sign which reads "Capitalism is a crime against humanity! Join the revolution now!"
International collection of picture postcards (6500 items, ca. 1900-1982), almost all of which date from 1920 or earlier. Arranged by country and filed in 28 albums. Almost all European countries are represented, and there are many rare postcards from Russia. (96-0135) (7 lf)
The addition to this collection (18000 items, from ca. 1900-1950) also is international in scope, but focuses on the United States. The collection comprises fifty, three-ring binders that hold picture postcards in pocketed mylar sleeves. About two-thirds of the cards show scenes in the United States, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; state capitols; worlds fairs; and other tourist destinations. Thirteen of the fifty binders document Atlantic City, N.J., and are subdivided by the images shown, including boardwalks, beaches, and hotels. The rest of the collection comprises postcards from other countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. Asia, Africa, Latin America, and North America are also represented. A small group of postcards depicts costumes from around the world. (00-422) (12 lf)
Formerly cataloged as the International Postcard Collection.
Collection consists largely of correspondence between historian Nell Irvin Painter and her parents (1969-2003), documenting various stages of their lives, travels, and Painter's scholarly career. Also includes writings by or about Nell Painter, including reviews of her work; copies and reviews of Dona Irvin's writings; documents related to Frank and Dona's education and careers; Frank irvin's diary (2000-2003); legal papers; and other items.
Photographs also form an important part of the collection. Along with papers and records, Frank and Dona Irvin kept early photos and tintypes (circa 1890s-1910s) of African Americans in Victoria, Texas; together, these materials speak to their early life near Houston, and document aspects of African American history in that area. There are also family photographs from later decades (1930s-1980s).
For preservation purposes, original audiovisual media are closed to use; copies may be available on request.

This collection contains Ren√©e Jacobs' archive of her project Slow Burn: A Photodocument of Centralia, Pennslyvania. Slow Burn, first published in 1986 by University of Pennsylvania Press, chronicles Centralia‚Äôs demise from an underground coal mine fire and depicts a singular epic event in Pennsylvania history, representing the confluence of environmental, scientific, bureaucratic, and emotional tragedies. As an award winning photojournalist, Jacobs moved into a house in Centralia‚Äôs impact zone in 1983 to document, in photographs and interviews, the end stages of the tiny anthracite coal town‚Äôs unsuccessful fight to resolve the intractable problems that began with the mine fire in 1962 and culminated in the razing of the town by the federal government.
Photographer Shelby Lee Adams has written of the project stating:
"Where once there was familiarity with open doors and trusting hearts, in a community that could be your home anywhere in America, an invisible cancer grew. It‚Äôs the unseen, slow-moving nature of this underground burning that took Centralia apart. The human spirit doesn‚Äôt want to believe, see, or hear what can destroy our sanctified special places in the world. Ren√©e Jacobs faithfully and compassionately documents in pictures and words the confusion, uncertainty, and fighting spirit of Centralia‚Äôs residents‚Äîand the painful destruction and relocation of the residents of this little Pennsylvania town. Slow Burn is a compelling story about‚Äîand for‚Äîall of us.‚Äù
The archive consist of more than 200 rolls of 35mm black and white film, the accompanying contact sheets, more than 1,000 silver gelatin work prints, contemporaneous news articles, oral history interviews and vintage exhibition prints. Additionally, the archives include maquettes for the original 1986 book and the 2010 re-issue, as well as prints with printer‚Äôs notations.
Loose negatives, some with contact strips included. One set includes a caption re: Centralia Demolition.

The collection consists of Japanese books, periodicals and other printed materials relating to the Japanese student movement of the 1960s and later. The materials derive from the first confrontations of 1960 provoked by the Anpo treaty, through the protest movement's years of crisis and decay in the 1970s, but there are more recent materials as well. Original order of groupings arranged by format has been retained; within groupings, materials are in date order with a few exceptions. Items of interest include radical left-wing student newspapers, large flyers and smaller protest handouts, special issues from mainstream media outlets, clippings, and North Korean and former Soviet Union Communist propaganda. Notably, the collection includes a full 12-month run of the Japanese magazine, Kisetsu. Protest movement ephemera also includes original writings, chiefly mimeographed essays and manuscript submissions for publication. The collection is strong in material relating to the BUND movement (Ky√¥san Shugisha D√¥mei), the rise of Zengakuren radicalism, and the birth of the Japanese Red Army Faction (Sekigun-Ha). Materials and this collection guide are in the Japanese language. Romanized titles are given for books and serials.
Part of the collection's original printed material was featured in the landmark "1960s Graphism" exhibit curated by the Tokyo Printing Museum (Insatsu Hakubutsukan) in 2002. Other visual material of interest is available in the dedicated issues of Asahi Graph and Shis√¥ included in the collection.
The collection is part of a larger gift pertaining to the radicalization of the student movement in Japan, including books, a video, and other items which are available as part of the holdings of the East Asian Collection in Duke University's Perkins Library.

The oral history video recordings, audio recordings, and transcripts in this collection were created or collected by the Jewish Heritage Foundation of North Carolina (JHFNC) and historian Leonard Rogoff as source material for various projects related to the history of Jews in North Carolina. The collection consists of individual and group interviews of Jewish residents of urban and rural North Carolina, including rabbis and elected public officials. Families represented include the Brenner, Cone, Evans, Kittner, and Samet families. Topics discussed by interviewees include family and community history, religious education, participation in Jewish congregations, anti-Semitism and race relations in North Carolina, World War II military service and the Holocaust, family businesses, and philanthropy.
The JHFNC projects for which the oral histories were created include the museum exhibit "Migrations: Jewish settlers of eastern North Carolina" (2000-2002), the book "A history of Temple Emanu-El: an extended family, Weldon, North Carolina" (2007), and the museum exhibit, documentary film, and book "Down Home: Jewish life in North Carolina" (2007-2012). Unaffiliated projects from which the JHFNC collected oral histories include the Duke University undergraduate honors thesis "From Pine Street to Watts Street: an oral history of the Jews of Durham, North Carolina" by Robin Gruber (1986), the oral history project of the 1986 Beth El Synagogue (Durham) Confirmation class, Rogoff's book "Homelands: southern Jewish identity in Durham and Chapel Hill, North Carolina" (2001), and the Steven Channing documentary film "Durham: a self-portrait," which shares video interview footage with "Down Home." Some of the media on which the oral histories were recorded contain additional video footage used for "Down Home" or "Durham: a self-portrait."
The majority of the interviews were performed by Leonard Rogoff and volunteers from the profiled Jewish communities. Other interviewers include Robin Gruber, Steven Sager, Steven Channing, Sharon Fahrer, and Jan Schochet. Geographic locations represented in this series include Asheville, Brevard, Burnsville, Hendersonville, and Camp Blue Star.

This series consists of questionnaires, instructional packets, bibliographies, and related materials produced or collected in connection with the creation of the oral histories in this collection.
The collection includes correspondence, printed matter, clippings, and other papers, relating mainly to North Carolina politics, especially the senatorial campaigns of 1948 and 1950. Includes legislative papers (1937-1941) on Johnson's service in the North Carolina Senate, material relating to tobacco-production quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, material from his service on the Supreme Court of N.C., and materials from Joseph Melville Broughton, North Carolina Governor and senator, and Frank Porter Graham, U.S. Senator and president of the University of North Carolina. Correspondents include Broughton, Graham, and Samuel Lubbell.
The Campaign Recordings series consists of original audio recordings from the 1948 and 1950 Senatorial campaigns. These are closed to use due to preservation concerns. Please contact Research Services if you are interested in these materials.

Many of Smith's materials are racist.
Many of these materials are in poor condition due to water damage.
Boxes are blue clamshell boxes from the original 1963 addition.
This series includes a large amount of material relating to Johnson's life and career beyond his campaign management positions. It includes materials from his fraternity at Trinity College (now Duke University), and some references to his baseball career. Larger amounts of materials relate to his judicial and legislative careers throughout North Carolina. Also includes materials documenting his friendship with Frank Graham.

The papers of Joseph Jones (1749-1824) span the period 1681 to 1895, with the majority of papers dating from 1794 to 1842. The collection is divided into six series: Correspondence, 1781-1895 and undated; Legal Papers, 1681-1888 and undated; Financial Papers, 1772-1875 and undated; Customs Collector Papers, 1796-1836 and undated; Military Papers, 1788-1864 and undated; and Miscellany, 1801-1854 and undated. Within each series the material is arranged chronologically. The Correspondence and Customs Collector Papers comprise the bulk of the collection.
Primarily emphasized in the collection are Jones' land holdings in Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Ohio, some awarded on account of his military service during the Revolution; his service as Brigadier-General in the 15th Brigade of the Virginia Militia during the Whiskey Rebellion; his work as customs collector at the port of Petersburg; and a variety of legal and financial papers.
The collection covers three generations of the Jones Family. After Jones' death in 1824, papers chiefly relate to his children and other relatives. Among those represented are Jones' sons: Joseph Jr., who managed some of his father's farming interests; R. Benson, who worked for various merchants in New York in the 1840's; Thomas, who was sheriff in Chesterfield County, Va. in 1838; and Thomas' wife, Mary Newton Jones, and her brother Virginia Congressman Willoughby Newton, plus other related families. There is extensive correspondence between Mrs. Mary M. Jones and others (chiefly in the 1840's) indicating that she owned both real estate and slaves. Some of this property was located in Westmoreland County, Va.
Other subjects include reaction to the passage by Congress of Jay's treaty, documents relating to slave holdings, social conditions of women in the 19th century, and the service of Jones' grandson, Captain Thomas Jones, in the 40th Virginia Infantry Regiment during the Civil War.
For further information about Jones, see the Department's William Bragg Papers. Bragg became Jones' business partner about 1770 in Petersburg, Va.
Includes personal and business correspondence. The bulk of the business correspondence relates to the family's landholdings and finances.
Includes land grants, survey patents, copies and extracts from deeds, bonds, land plats hills of lading, contracts, articles of agreement, promissory notes, power of attorney agreements, and some indentures involving slave sales. Three land grants (1798) awarded Jones several hundred acres of land in Northwest Ohio for his military service.
Accounts, receipts, bills of sales (some involving slaves) and other miscellany financialpapers. A subseries (1853-1875 and undated) is listed under Mrs. Mary H. Peeples. It includes tax, clothing, and tuition receipts, and other financial records, covering the period after she was widowed in 1853. Her connection to the Jones family is unclear.
Includes correspondence, printed circulars from the United States Treasury Department, lists of licensed vessels, and other items, relating to Jones' position as Collector of Customs at the port of Petersburg, Va. Among the items is a bill of lading (1818 Oct. 21) from Marseilles, France, to Jones notifying him of articles sent through Petersburg for Thomas Jefferson at Monticello.
Correspondence, printed circulars, return lists, muster rolls, and brigade division, and military orders, relating to Jones' military service with the 15th Virginia Militia Brigade. A few items concern the 40th Virginia Infantry Regiment. Jones' grandson was in the Quartermasters Department with the regiment. Includes supply receipts, supply vouchers, other quartermaster reports, and additional miscellaneous items.
Includes information about an association for improving its members' legal knowledge, speeches, and other items.
The Kensinger Jones Papers, 1934-2001, document Jones's primary career as an executive for several major advertising agencies, including Leo Burnett Company, Campbell-Ewald Company, D.P. Brother and Company, Wilding Advertising, and William R.Biggs/Gilmore Associates; and his second career as a professor of advertising at Michigan State University. Materials consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, notes, reports, scripts, and audiovisual materials that document the development of print, radio, and television advertising campaigns for a wide variety of clients. The history and management of advertising companies in Chicago and Detroit in the United States, in Australia, and in Singapore is also represented. Major clients documented include Chevrolet, the Florida Citrus Commission, General Motors Corporation, and Oldsmobile.
The Advertising Agencies Series, the largest, includes memoranda and correspondence related to the executive management of each agency and Jones's role in organizing and directing the creative activities of the agency or advertising team. Materials from Jones's work at the Leo Burnett Company consist primarily of office memoranda and weekly progress reports for radio and television commercials for clients such as: Mars, Incorporated; Kellogg Company; and the Green Giant Company. In Southeast Asia, Jones served as Regional Creative Director for Leo Burnett offices in Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok. Materials include correspondence, speeches for creative seminars, and scripts for two films for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board. Jones worked mainly with clients in the automotive industry, specifically Chevrolet at the Campbell-Ewald Company and Oldsmobile at D.P. Brother Company (as well as at Leo Burnett). Materials about General Motors relate to the potential of television specials for corporate advertising to promote the GM "Mark of Excellence" and the corporation's responsiveness to environmental and safety issues in the late sixties and seventies. Closely related to the Advertising Agencies Series, the Correspondence and Memoranda Series consists of carbons of outgoing correspondence from Jones, filed in chronological order with some memoranda.
Nearly a third of the collection pertains to Jones's tenure from 1982-1995 as Lecturer in the Department of Advertising, the School of Communication Arts at Michigan State University. The Michigan State University (MSU) Series includes correspondence with colleagues and students, materials from academic conferences and MSU's Visiting Advertising Professional program, as well as copies of Impact, the alumni newsletter for the Advertising Department. Of particular note are materials related to China and Taiwan in 1988 and 1990. The Course Materials Subseries details his advanced courses in creative advertising. In order to create a realistic, professional experience for the students, Jones assigned group projects that required students to create advertising campaigns or marketing strategies for national or state clients, local businesses, and university departments, including Archway Cookies, Oldsmobile, McDonalds, American Tourister, the Muskegon County Museum, and several MSU facilities and departments. The projects were presented to the class and evaluated not only by the client and Professor Jones, but also by the other students.
Throughout his life, Jones considered himself primarily to be a writer, and the Writings and Speeches Series reflects Jones's lifelong writing efforts. The series includes a wide variety of professional, personal, and unpublished writing: advertising presentations, speeches, articles, advertising seminars, scripts for radio programs and plays, poetry, an unpublished novel, and an autobiography. The Speeches Subseries and Published Articles Subseries document his creativity in advertising and his contributions to the industry as well as to local schools and organizations. Material in the Personal Series demonstrates his activities with professional and civic organizations; in addition this series contains personal correspondence and materials about the life and career of Leo Burnett.
Much of Jones's creative work in advertising was produced for the broadcast media, especially the early days of television advertising in the 1950s and 1960s. The Audiovisual Materials Series includes film and sound materials that document television advertising and Jones's creative contributions to the professional education of his advertising colleagues. Because several of his most successful films about advertising or creativity originated as speeches with slides, these materials are particularly rich in conjunction with related materials in the Writings and Speeches Series.
Arranged in subseries for each agency where Jones worked; subseries appear chronologically by the date that Jones first worked at each agency. This series consists primarily of office memoranda, correspondence, scripts for advertising presentations to clients, scripts for television or radio commercials, newspaper and magazine articles, and a few photographs. An Information Folder found in the inventory drawer at the Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library contains additional biographical data and a description of Jones's positions with each agency. See individual subseries for more specific arrangement notes.
Arranged by three chronological time periods, when Jones held different positions with the agency in Chicago and South East Asia. Within each time period, the folders are arranged alphabetically.
Arranged alphabetically by major subject categories that correspond to Jones's work as Creative Director and Executive Vice-President. Major accounts include Chevrolet, General Motors, Florida Citrus Commission, and other new business prospects. Many of the files pertain to the operation and reorganization of the Creative Department as well as the management of the agency, when Jones served on the Executive Committee. Several Chevrolet film commercials won awards at notable advertising competitions. The papers also reflect Jones's focus on professional development -- coordinating seminars within the agency, writing articles, and presenting workshops with state, regional, and national advertising organizations. One effort resulted in the Creativity film, later renamed the Horse and the Fiddle. Another, Whatever Happened to Mrs. Momiyama, related the role of advertising in a free economy and the resurgence of the Japanese economy after WWII. Both a filmstrip and a film version were distributed by the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) to high schools and colleges. See also the Audiovisual Materials Series.
Arranged alphabetically by subject, the series documents Jones's work as Creative Director and Executive Vice President of the agency and his work on the Oldsmobile account. DPB became a subsidiary of Leo Burnett Company, Chicago, in 1967 and was renamed Leo Burnett Company of Michigan in 1971. In January, 1971, Jones moved to Leo Burnett Company headquarters in Chicago, continuing to direct the creative activity for all Oldsmobile advertising. See also Leo Burnett Company subseries, 1971-1972, for material related to Oldsmobile advertising and to interoffice coordination between Chicago and Detroit.
Arranged alphabetically by subject, this subseries documents Jones's part-time consulting work and includes correspondence, memos, brochures, and scripts for several projects. Of particular note are the Ford Marketing Institute seminars on advertising and marketing presented to car dealers, often at the annual National Automotive Dealers Association meetings. Included are the transcripts of interviews with several successful car dealers, which were used in the 1980 seminars. See also the Audiovisual Materials Series for film versions of the seminars.
Arranged alphabetically by subject, this subseries includes agency newsletters, memoranda and correspondence related to Jones's evaluation of the creative activities of the newly merged company and print ads for various clients. As Creative Director, Jones worked part time through 1982 and as a consultant thereafter.
Arranged chronologically, this series consists of carbons of outgoing business and personal correspondence, and office memoranda related to the advertising campaigns of the several agencies. Additional correspondence, from 1964 to 1974, occurs in the Advertising Agencies Series. From 1982 to 1995, professional correspondence and memoranda are located in the Michigan State University Series. Miscellaneous personal correspondence appears in the Personal Series.
Divided into two subseries, Subject Files and Course Materials, this series pertains to Jones's teaching activities, while he was a Lecturer in the Department of Advertising, in the School of Communication Arts, at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich. (Material describing the curriculum or memos about Mr. Jones's teaching schedule are part of the Subject Files Subseries.)
Arranged alphabetically, the Subject Files Subseries consists of correspondence, primarily with students, conference papers, articles, newsletters, and departmental memoranda. Of particular note are the materials related to China. In 1988, Jones and his wife traveled throughout China with a U.S. Exchange program related to the advertising profession. In 1989, Jones conducted a weeklong seminar for advertising professionals in Taiwan and a similar seminar in East Lansing for visitors from Taiwan.
Arranged chronologically by academic quarter and by course, the Course Materials Subseries pertains primarily to two advanced courses: Advertising 417-"Advanced Creative Strategy and Execution" and Advertising 441-"TV-Radio Advertising." For most courses, Jones taught over fifty students, divided into two sections. Other courses include: Advertising 317-"Creative Strategy and Execution" and after 1989-1990, Advertising 492-"Advanced Copywriting." For each course, a "Course Materials" folder typically includes a syllabus, a midterm and final exam, and for the later years, a coursepak of readings.
Subsequent course folders pertain to student projects and are titled with the name and location of the particular advertising client or product assigned for the course. Materials typically include: 1) background information on the client or product; 2) student reports often with creative illustrations and sample advertising; 3) evaluations of the group presentations by the client, by Jones, and by the other students; and 4) peer evaluations of individual contributions to the group. During some courses, students produced video or audio tapes. On occasion, selected student projects were presented at state or regional competitions. (A folder at the beginning of this subseries contains chronological and alphabetical listings of the student project assignments.)
Divided into four subseries: Speeches, Published Articles, Other Writings, St. Louis; and Other Writings, 1960-2001 and undated This series documents Jones's continuous dedication to writing. The bulk of the materials, 1955-1972, correspond to his advertising interests and consist of text and correspondence related to speeches (written for himself and occasionally for others) and related to articles submitted for publication. See also the Audiovisual Series for slides, films, videos, and audio products, which may relate to speeches.
Arranged chronologically, the Speeches Subseries contains the text and correspondence for speeches (written for himself and occasionally for others) to be delivered at advertising conferences, creative seminars, schools, or civic events. A chronological list compiled by Jones is in a folder at the beginning of the series; the same folder also contains a copy of this list annotated during processing regarding the presence or absence of folders and speeches.
Arranged chronologically, the Published Articles Subseries contains the text and correspondence for articles to be published in regional and national advertising publications. At the end are articles submitted to Advertising Age. A chronological listing is in a folder at the beginning of the series.
Arranged alphabetically by title, this subseries primarily includes writing from Jones's early career as a freelance writer in St. Louis.
This subseries includes published and unpublished literary and autobiographical writing, published articles and books about Jones's advertising career and experiences in World War II, miscellaneous speeches and talks, and other short pieces such as reviews and brochures for various groups.

Of particular note are the materials by and about Leo Burnett and the Leo Burnett Advertising Agency. Arranged alphabetically by category of material.
This series is arranged by media format subseries: 35mm slides, videotapes, audiotapes, and 16mm films that document commercials, speeches, and seminars and often augment print materials elsewhere in the collection. Live action film commercials for Chevrolet advertising on television shows from 1957-1967, such as The Dinah Shore Show, Bonanza, and Bewitched, were typically produced in Hollywood or Europe. In 1959 and 1960, two films won international awards - American in Paris and Magic Ride.A Child of My Own, is a film created for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board in 1974-1975. Other films, including Creativity (renamed The Horse and Fiddle),Truth and Consequences: Form and Function in Advertising,The Importance of Being Interesting, and The Minstrel Principle, originated as seminar speeches with slide illustrations and were later produced as films. Whatever Happened to Mrs. Momiyama, a speech to students, was developed by the Advertising Association of America into a filmstrip and film for secondary schools about advertising, American business, and the Japanese economy after WWII.

The Sidney Ralph Bernstein Company History Files span the years 1873 to 1964, but the bulk of the material dates from 1963 to 1964. The collection consists primarily of research files containing transcripts of interviews; notes and excerpts copied from publications, facsimile copies, correspondence, and printed material; correspondence and memoranda; manuscripts; speeches; indexes; clippings; lists; and chronologies. The files were created by Sidney Ralph Bernstein and Marianne Keating, his research assistant, for a commemorative history of the J. Walter Thompson Company at the time of its centennial anniversary. The history was not published. The collection documents the history of J. Walter Thompson Company, especially through personal reminiscences, recollections, and evaluations of the company by its executives and other employees; advertising executives; women in the advertising industry; and J. Walter Thompson, founder of the company.
The Correspondence Series documents the planning phases of the project and the selection of Sidney Ralph Bernstein from a pool of prospective authors. Company executive Milton Moskowitz was primarily responsible for arranging the project but the Executive Committee approved all aspects of it. Bernstein's and Keating's research activities are described throughout the series. The correspondence includes biographical material about various company leaders, including William James Carlton and Stanley B. Resor, and information about the 1918 tax law case against the J. Walter Thompson Company.
A substantial part of the project included interviewing company employees about their personal experiences and about clients. The transcripts of the interviews are in the Oral Interview Transcripts Series. Most of the interviews were indexed and provide access to four areas of information: Agencies and associations, accounts, personalities, and selected topics.
The Biographical Files Series has varying quantities of information about officers and staff, some derived from printed sources and some from personal narratives. Most of the files contain information about more than one executive or staff member since, in many of the narratives, subjects discuss other employees. The International Office Series also contains personal narratives about office histories, chronologies, and client relations. Subjects in the Client Files Series that have the most documentation include Chesebrough-Pond's, Eastman Kodak Company, Kraft Foods Company, Pan American World Airways, and Scott Paper Company.

The papers of Colin Dawkins, a former Vice President of the J. Walter Thompson (JWT) advertising agency, span the years 1776 to 1986 with the bulk of the papers being dated between 1920 and 1981. The collection consists of Dawkins's research files, gathered for a proposed book on the history of the advertising business as it paralleled and was influenced by the growth and international development of JWT. These files contain correspondence, printed materials (including JWT newsletters), articles, clippings, speeches, writings, advertisements, reports, oral interview transcripts and cassette tapes. Clients represented in this collection include primarily the Ford Motor Company but also Kraft, Chesebrough-Ponds, Pan American, and Lever Brothers, and JWT executives represented include James Walter Thompson, Stanley Resor, Howard Kohl, Sam Meek, Helen Lansdowne Resor, Edward G. Wilson, Shirley Woodell, James Webb Young, and Dan Seymour. Much of the collection duplicates material found elsewhere in the extensive J. Walter Thompson Company Archives and many items are photocopies; however, the collection does contain unique material specifically in the Oral Interview Series and items thoughout the collection which Colin Dawkins collected.
In October 1978, Dawkins began his advertising history project. During the next two years, he wrote to ‚ÄúJWT vets‚Äù requesting information about people and places, letters and memos, excerpts from speeches, artifacts, advertisements, pictures, and information on JWT offices.
The Officers and Staff Series contains information by and about key personalities who contributed to the development of the J. Walter Thompson Company. The JWT employees represent the majority of the company's departments: broadcast, research, creative, international, publicity and public relations, and the executive administration. Especially well-documented individuals include Gelston Hardy, Kennett Hinks, Howard Kohl, Sam Meek, John Monsarrat, Helen Lansdowne Resor, Stanley Resor, Dan Seymour, Norman H. Strouse, James Walter Thompson, Edward G. Wilson, Shirley Woodell, and James Webb Young.
The Clients Series consists of background information on a limited number of major and minor JWT clients, including Kraft, Pan American, Chesebrough-Ponds, Lever Brothers, and Ford Motor Company. Dawkins worked for many years on the Ford account, for which there is extensive information in this series. The Ford files document the 1957 ‚ÄúAround the World‚Äù campaign, international campaigns, background information on campaigns for Mustang and Maverick models, the history of JWT's relationship with Ford, presentations made to Ford, and Ford firsts in advertising.
The Alphabetical Files Series is the largest series in the collection. The majority of information focuses on JWT through short company histories, the establishment and growth of departments (such as Broadcast and Radio), and both domestic and international offices, especially New York and London. The Alphabetical Files Series also documents JWT's innovations in the advertising business in the use of market research, testimonials, and women's perspective in advertising. The series contains some information about other advertising agencies in particular Batten, Barton, Durstine, Osborn; Lord & Thomas; Foote, Cone & Belding; and N. W. Ayer. Other topics in this series include general advertising history and economic comparisons of advertising agencies. Dawkins's research notes and correspondence files he kept for his advertising history project are in this series also.
Dawkins travelled to visit key officers and staff members and recorded and transcribed their conversations. The cassettes and transcripts from these interviews are in the Oral Interview Series in both the Audio Subseries and the Transcripts Subseries. They provide personal insights into the history of the J. Walter Thompson Company.
After three years of researching, Dawkins set out to write a history of advertising focussing on the J. Walter Thompson Company. The resulting text, entitled ‚ÄúAin't It Hell On A Windy Day‚Äù was not published. The manuscript copy is in the Writings Series and is CLOSED except to the members of the J. Walter Thompson Company.
The Advertisements Series is filed with the Oversize Material and contains the advertisements associated with specific Officers and Staff, Clients, and files in the Alphabetical Files. Also in this series are advertisements from Dawkins's Advertisement Portfolio.
Includes correspondence, biographical information, clippings, notes, photographs, and articles about or by JWT staff members. Employees represented are primarily from the U. S. offices; however, William Hinks, Douglas Saunders, and Rae Smith are from the London office, and the James Hamilton Russell and Timothy Hamilton Russell files contain information about the South Africa office.
Contains printed materials, correspondence, articles, clippings, press releases, and account histories of JWT clients that Dawkins researched for his book.
Consists of articles, clippings, printed materials, chronologies, notes and excerpts from publications, correspondence, writings, and speeches. In this series exists a unique history of JWT's offices in Spain.

Don Johnston's interview was conducted by others in Bombay, India and there are two interviews with Louise Fox Connell, one by Dawkins and another by Rosamond Hartshorn in 1977. Some files contain multiple transcripts that are annotated by the interviewee.
Consists of a recording tape and cassette tapes of Dawkins's notes and interviews he conducted for his book.
Contains several drafts of sections and sidebars for Dawkins's book. Also has two smaller drafts of manuscripts Dawkins wrote using the materials found in this collection.
The Diamond Information Center Vertical File spans the years from the 1930s to the 1980s and is chiefly an informational file of printed materials. The file was originally created when the N.W. Ayers advertising agency handled the De Beers account. The vertical file was transferred to JWT along with the account. JWT currently handles the advertising for De Beers diamonds.
The file is organized into numbered, topical sections that cover a broad range of subjects relating to diamonds, the diamond industry, and the fashion design industry. The numbered subjects reflect the original classification schema used by the Diamond Information Center. Some high-level subjects have been added to improve readability; these have been inserted within brackets, and follow the numerical pattern previously established by the Center. Topics include: famous diamonds; the annual Diamond International Awards; diamonds, diamond mining and trade in Africa (especially Angola and South Africa), Brazil, India, Russia and the United States; the analysis, classification, grading and cutting of gem-quality and industrial diamonds; public and private collectors, collections and exhibitions of diamonds, gems, precious stones and jewelry, including the crown jewels of European (particularly Great Britain), Russian and Indian monarchies; the history, advertising and marketing of diamonds, gems, precious stones and jewelry; the manufacture and mechanical properties of artificial diamonds and other artificial precious stones; and the history, cultural and social aspects of the clothing and fashion design industry, with folders on individual designers, merchandisers, and fashion shows.

The Domestic Advertisements Collection consists of print advertisements created by U.S. offices of the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT). The bulk of the collection dates from the 1920s and after, but a few examples are available from as early as 1875. Print advertisements appear in a variety of formats--magazine, newspaper, color, black-and-white, proofs, tearsheets, negative transfers, clippings, along with a limited number of sketches for outdoor advertising installations. Some of the advertisements feature work from notable artists, such as Norman Rockwell, and photographers like Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, and Baron De Meyer. In addition to the actual advertisements, the files dating from the 1910s to 1950s often contain insertion schedules that provide the dates and names of the magazines or newspapers in which a given advertisement appeared. In general, proofs for JWT's long-time clients have been saved more systematically than those for accounts that JWT did not hold for a long time. The collection does not include advertisements which have been transferred to microfilm (see the JWT Microfilm Collection). Also, advertisements created for clients that JWT lost prior to the 1940s are less likely to have been saved, although some were microfilmed and are still available in that form. For some JWT clients there are no print advertisements at all in this collection. Among the most extensive files of print advertisements are those for the following JWT clients: Champion Spark Plug, Chesebrough-Ponds, Eastman Kodak (Instamatic, Pocket Instamatic, and Disc cameras, Kodak film), Ford Motor Company (consumer and dealer advertisements), R.T. French, Irving Trust Bank, J. Walter Thompson Company (house advertisements), Kraft Foods (including Kraft cheeses, Miracle Whip, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Velveeta), Lever Brothers (Lifebuoy, Lux, Close Up, Mrs. Butterworth), Pan American World Airways (passenger jet travel, cargo transportation), Radio Corporation of America (RCA) (RCA Victor recordings, consumer goods, National Broadcasting Company), Reader's Digest, Scott Paper, Seven-Up, Standard Brands (Chase and Sandborn, Fleischmann, Royal, Tenderleaf tea), and Warner-Lambert (primarily Listerine, including advertisements produced by the Lambert and Feasley agency).
The Collection is organized into three series--Main Files, Small Files, and Oversize Materials--that reflect both the size of the holdings for each client as well as the physical location of the advertisements. Within each series, clients are arranged alphabetically and then the advertisements are arranged chronologically. The Main File Series includes clients for which at least one box have been preserved. A separate Small Files Series is maintained for clients for which less than one box of advertisements, and often much less, has survived. The Oversize Materials Series includes many of the clients found in both the Main and Small Files Series.
The collection is continued by the J. Walter Thompson Company. Domestic advertisements, part 2.
Chesebrough Ponds, 1875-1968. Proofs from the 1920s to 1950s feature testimonial advertising for Pond's Cold Cream. Noted socialites endorsing the product were photographed by well known photographers, including Edward J. Steichen and Baron DeMeyer.

Consumer advertisements feature photographs by well known photographers, famous slogans and trademarks, and depict the American family over several decades in settings where the cameras are used. Introductions of new camera models are well represented, including the Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket Instamatic in 1972, the Instant camera in 1975, and the Disc camera in 1982. At different times JWT handled both film and cameras (still and/or movie) or just Kodak films.

Lever Brothers, 1900-present. The earliest advertisements are for Lifebuoy Soap. J. Walter Thompson Co. introduced Lux Flakes in 1915 and Lux Toilet Soap in 1925. The early Lux Flakes advertisements employed the talents of fine illustrators. Comic style advertising appeared in the 1930s (Peggy Lux and others). The Lux Toilet Soap campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One noteworthy campaign dates from 1953-1954 when Irving Penn photographed some of Hollywood's most famous stars. The Lever Brothers advertisements for both Lux products also include photographs of car cards (subway and bus posters) from the 1920s. Other Lever products represented in the collection include Stripe and Close Up toothpastes, Mrs. Butterworth syrup, and Lever 2000 bath soap.

The vast majority of the advertisements are for Listerine Antiseptic, with other products represented beginning in the late 1960s. Listerine was manufactured by the Lambert Pharmacal Company beginning around 1915. William Warner acquired the company in 1955, merged it into his own pharmaceutical business and changed the name to the Warner-Lambert Co.
Warner-Lambert is the only client file in this collection that includes the work of an agency other than JWT. Until 1962, Listerine advertising was handled by the Lambert and Feasley agency in New York, the house agency for the Lambert Pharmacal Co. (St. Louis) up to 1955, and for its successor the Warner-Lambert Co. (Morris Plains, N.J.), from 1955-1962. When JWT obtained the Listerine account in October 1962, the back files of Listerine advertisements were transferred to JWT.
Includes clients for which at least one box (usually at least 100 advertisements) have been preserved. A few files contain photocopies or prints made from microfilm, a fact which is noted in the list. Parenthetical identification of the client or product or the JWT office or division responsible for the ad has been added in some cases. The files are arranged alphabetically by client (not product), insofar as it has been possible to determine the client name accurately and as it was known during the relationship with JWT (hence, Lever Brothers in lieu of Unilever). The files are then arranged chronologically within client groupings.
The main clients in this series include Chesebrough Ponds, Eastman Kodak Company, Ford Motor Company, Irving Trust Bank, J. Walter Thompson Co., Kraft Foods Corporation, Lever Brothers, Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company, Pan-American Airlines , RCA (Radio Corporation of America), Reader's Digest, Scott Paper Co., Seven-Up, Standard Brands, and Warner-Lambert. The clients in this series are NOT represented in the Small Files Series but MAY have advertisements in the Oversize Series.

Organized into two categories--Consumer and Trade advertisements--that correspond to Kodak's two major marketing areas. Consumer advertisements feature photographs by well known photographers, famous slogans and trademarks, and depict the American family over several decades in settings where the cameras are used. Introductions of new camera models are well represented, including the Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket Instamatic in 1972, the Instant camera in 1975, and the Disc camera in 1982. At different times JWT handled both film and cameras (still and/or movie) or just Kodak films. Trade advertisements include campaigns for medical and industrial films, Kodel fibers, and Eastman Chemical, as well as advertisements aimed at Kodak dealers.
Eastman Kodak advertising is also represented in various other collections: JWT Account Files (includes films and videos plus account information); Wayne P. Ellis Collection of Kodakiana

This category provides extensive documentation of the trade oriented advertisements from the Eastman Kodak Company from 1931-1990. Although formal division titles changed slightly throughout the company's history, general markets consistently advertised include:
Medical, including dental and radiography; chemical, including chemicals, plastics, and cellulose divisions; business reproductions, including Recordak; Tennessee Eastman, including Eastman Chemicals and Eastman Fibers (Kodel); industrial photography, including engineering and functional photography; motion pictures; business premiums; and pharmaceutical trade, probably the least represented.
International advertisements may be found as early as 1961 randomly included and continuing throughout the collection for various years. The majority of advertisements are proofs; very few tearsheets appear. Prior to the 1960s, the physical condition of the advertisements varies from poor to good with many advertisements still attached to black scrapbook paper. The remaining advertisements were not initially stored in the scrapbooks; therefore, they range from good to very good physical condition. The quantity for any given year varies somewhat; however, the following years have a minimal number of advertisements: 1966-1967, 1970, 1972-1973.

The Lux Toilet Soap campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One noteworthy campaign dates from 1953-1954 when Irving Penn photographed some of Hollywood's most famous stars.

The purpose of the reports was to insure maximum use of studies and projects of a broad general interest throughout the J. Walter Thompson Company offices.

The reports consist of photo-offset copies and printed material in which such topics as advertising techniques, research, media, industries, and demographics are discussed. Some reports contain excerpts or reprints of articles from external sources. The reports were arbitrarily numbered at some point; they have been arranged in order by these numbers.

Some reports did not have obvious titles. In those cases, the information folder was consulted and the names given for the corresponding numbered report were listed below.

The Series arrangement created by the J. Walter Thompson archivist reflects Meek's activities and has been retained. Several categories of material are included: correspondence, market surveys and research reports, letters, official documents (such as the records of Meek's military service), and the transcripts of talks.
The International Offices Series, 1942-1964 and n.d. is comprised primarily of correspondence between Samuel Meek and the heads of J. Walter Thompson's international offices.

The Personal Series, 1917-1979 and undated is primarily concerned with Samuel Meek's personal life: records of his military service, financial details of his retirement, his coat of arms, and other issues.

The correspondence is primarily between Samuel Meek,Vice President in charge of International Operations, 1930-1964, and the directors of the various branch offices.

Others deal with the more personal aspects of a multi-national business: arranging gifts, meetings and receptions for visiting dignitaries, assisting executives of J. Walter Thompson and of client companies with their travel plans, letters of condolence for the deaths of executives' family members, etc.
A frequent topic of the correspondence is how to reduce xenophobia and to increase the acceptance of an American advertising agency and U.S. products in the face of the nationalistic climate in many of the relevant countries.

This collection is grouped by country and includes submissions on innovation and milestones as determined by JWT executives. These materials were submitted as part of a larger JWT Traveling Archives project in 1994. Countries represented include Japan, South Africa, India, Brazil, Spain, and Australia. Also includes a brief history of the JWT Company.
Treasurer's Office Records span the years from 1928-1952, although the bulk of the material dates from 1928 to the 1940s. The collection documents the financial operations of JWT offices around the world and to a lesser extent in the United States. The materials consist of correspondence, financial records, and legal documents relating to the activities of JWT's Treasurer's Office. Correspondents include Earle Clark (Treasurer, 1921-39), Donald C. Foote, (Assistant Treasurer in charge of accounting and budgeting in JWT's international operations, 1937-52), Luther O. Lemon (Assistant Treasurer and Comptroller, 1937-46; Treasurer, 1946-57), and Sam Meek (Vice President in charge of International Operations 1930-64); senior staff members in domestic and international offices; JWT's legal counsel; and representatives from numerous financial institutions. Multinational clients represented in the International Offices Series are the Eastman Kodak Company, the Kellogg Company, the Gillette Company, RCA, and Reader's Digest. International offices well-documented include those in Antwerp, Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. Records for many of JWT's offices are not included in the Treasurer's Office Records, which indicates that the files in their present form may be incomplete.
The Domestic Offices Series focuses particularly on the New York, Detroit, and San Francisco offices. In addition to documenting routine matters relating to budgets, billing, and salaries, the records include material relating to the regulation of testimonial advertising by the Federal Trade Commission in 1929-1930.
The International Offices Series documents the complex relationship between the New York office and the several foreign offices of the company, especially offices in Antwerp, Berlin, Bombay, Bucharest, London, and Mexico City. A primary focus of the series is the legal and financial difficulties JWT faced as it attempted to expand abroad during a time of rising nationalism in many of the countries in which the company had offices. The impact of World War II on JWT especially the Bombay and Paris offices is documented, as well as the impact of the 1947 partition of India on JWT operations in India. The files also document JWT's efforts in the 1930s to develop radio advertising in Mexico, Belgium, and England. The series is divided into the following subseries: JWT International Corporation, Antwerp Office, Berlin Office, Bombay Office, Bucharest Office, London Office, and Mexico City Office.
Chiefly contains the correspondence of JWT Treasurer's Office staff (especially Earle Clark and Luther O. Lemon) with company personnel in other domestic offices, legal counsel, and banking representatives. The series also includes legal documents, memoranda, financial reports, and board meeting minutes. The contents are arranged in alphabetical order by subject, with the subjects falling into three broad categories: files relating to the JWT Advertising Corporation, files relating to JWT domestic offices other than the New York Office, and files relating to general financial matters.
The JWT Advertising Corporation was a subsidiary of the JWT Company established in 1931 at One Wall Street, New York City, New York, at least partly to facilitate the company's work for clients located in Manhattan's financial district. These files include corporate documents such as minutes, office leases, profit and loss sheets, billings, and tax returns.
Treasurer's Office files for offices outside New York relate chiefly to San Francisco and Detroit, with the bulk addressing routine questions relating to office expenditures, overhead charges, and billing procedures. These files also contain a memorandum from W. F. Howard to Norman H. Strouse (8-31-49, in Detroit Office folder) presenting a detailed case for the installation of air conditioning in the Detroit offices. Records for the payment of several thousands of dollars in club fees for Detroit's managerial staff can be found in the Detroit Office file in the years 1947-1948. Several letters discuss how to handle requests for charitable contributions (Luther O. Lemon to Thelma Hardy, 6-13-49, and Luther O. Lemon to Fred Fidler, 6-17-49, both in the San Francisco Office file; W. F. Howard to Henry C. Flower, 5-25-50, and Norman F. Strouse to Luther O. Lemon, 10-17-50, both in the Detroit Office file; see also Subscriptions and Veterans Guidance in Advertising).
Files relating to general financial matters contain documents on a wide variety of topics of interest to the Treasurer's Office. Several folders, for example, are devoted to limiting particular kinds of corporate expenses, such as telegrams and telephone calls. One folder contains information on the New York Disability Benefits Law of 1949 and the company's efforts to comply with the new regulations, while another folder contains documents discussing the Federal Trade Commission's restrictions on the use of testimonials, or personality advertising. Yet another folder, titled Unions, contains a published report from the New York Department of Labor (1942) determining a minimum recommended salary for women employees, along with an itemized budget that supports the Department's recommendations.
Chiefly contains correspondence between JWT officers in New York (especially Donald C. Foote and Earle Clark in the Treasurer's Office; and Sam Meek, Vice President in charge of International Operations, 1930-1964) and the managers of the international offices. The series also includes legal documents, board meeting minutes, and financial reports (such as operating budgets, balance sheets, tax assessments, and cash account audits).
Three broad areas of concern dominate the files: finance, law, and personnel. Financial issues include overdue accounts, currency exchange rates, overhead charges, stock reclassifications, commission rates, conflicts of interest, profits and losses, and tardy expense and revenue reports.
Most legal questions revolve around the incorporation of the parent company, JWT International, and the effort to obtain national charters for the various overseas offices--a move calculated to accommodate local clients' growing preference for doing business with an agency chartered locally. In the cases of the Bucharest and Berlin offices, the local agency was sold to national members of the staff because it was impossible to obtain a national charter without JWT directors in New York losing their controlling interest in the local company. The JWT office managers also reported on tax laws, import restrictions and political changes that might affect advertising revenues.
In the area of personnel, a large portion of correspondence deals with salary and profit-sharing arrangements for high-ranking members of the managerial staff. Also included are disputes regarding expense accounts, Christmas bonuses, transfer requests, home leave, and life insurance. Aside from revealing employee judgments about the fairness of certain company policies, these exchanges also document managers' dissatisfactions with working among people of other ethnic backgrounds and the hardships of life in an alien society (e.g., separation from family, decreased earnings due to unstable currencies, and exposure to tropical illnesses).
Most documents in the JWT International Corporation Subseries date from 1928-1931, and they relate to the formation of a separate company called JWT International. These items appear to make up Treasurer Earle Clark's personal files, complete with handwritten notes and calculations for a variety of possible terms of incorporation and stock classifications. These files contain several drafts of the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the new corporation; correspondence with JWT's New York legal counsel, Breed, Abbot and Morgan; and further correspondence with the various heads of JWT's foreign offices. A 1928 summary of JWT's financial status is also included in the files, apparently because it served as part of the basis for early deliberations about the creation of JWT International.
A few documents in the International Corporation files date much later, from 1945 to 1946. They include itemized lists of billings and profits for foreign offices over the previous ten to fifteen years.
The principal correspondents in Antwerp were Edward E. Pratt, L.R. Deke Coleman, J. H. Cerny, and Rene -P. Jeanneret. The Antwerp file also contains correspondence between Donald Foote and managers of offices in Paris, Amsterdam, and the Hague. Several issues addressed in the correspondence indicate the challenges JWT faced in their overseas operations. For example, an exchange between Donald Foote and J. H. Cerny discusses the financial issues involved in expanding into radio advertising in Antwerp (12-5-34, 1-4-35). Also, Jeanneret commented to Foote (6-25-35) about the objections Catholic papers raised against advertisements--particularly one that depicted women models wearing pants and exposing navel and thighs. During World War II, Jeanneret and Coleman reported to Sam Meek on conditions in occupied France (7-19-40 and 9-10-40).
Fritz Solm served as head of Berlin operations, and the Berlin office files record the communications among Solm (in Berlin), L. R. Coleman and Henry C. Flower (in Paris), Paul Leverkuehn (Berlin legal counsel), Donald Foote (in New York) and F. C. Wallace (representative of Guaranty Trust Company in New York). In 1934 Solm agreed to purchase control of the Berlin office, and the bulk of the material concerns that agreement. Delays in the payment process prompted L.R. Deke Coleman to make some colorful and disparaging remarks about his dealings with Germans (in letters to Foote, 11-7-38 and 11-24-38). The same letters contain vague references to blackmail in Solm's dealings with German tax authorities, and to Solm's fears that unspecified activities in the New York office could land him in prison.
The Bombay office was established in 1929 and this subseries documents its operations beginning that year under Frank R. J. Gerard. From 1930 to 1949, Edward J. Pete Fielden served as senior manager of the Bombay operations, along with its branch offices in Calcutta and New Delhi. Fielden's most prominent assistants were Denys Scott in Bombay and Peter Petroushka de Peterson in Calcutta.
JWT's operations in India were profitable throughout World War II, but not without many hardships, including Japanese air raids, the threat of conscription of key personnel, and low morale due to the postponement of home leave. The political instability surrounding India's post-war partitioning also created unfavorable working conditions for JWT's employees in India. Several of Fielden's letters to New York deal at length with the impact of domestic and international politics upon both advertising interests, and the staff's health and safety (10-28-38, 8-2-40, 10-1-40, 1-7-43, 6-11-46, 9-2-47, 4-4-49, 5-4-49, 6-6-49).
In their salary negotiations, Denys Scott (letter, 6-8-48) and Peter de Peterson (letters, 11-17-40, 2-23-42, 10-15-43) outlined the obstacles European staff members confronted in maintaining a European lifestyle in India. Also, in a dispute about his expense account, Peterson alluded to certain entertainment expenses--which he felt obliged to incur for his guests--related to an arrangement for several young women to attend a business dinner (letter to Fielden, 12-16-48). And in reinstating life insurance for the Indian personnel, management encountered resentment from employees who were unwilling to designate themselves by race as either White or Negro, as the American forms required (Denys Scott to Foote, 9-18-48).
The correspondence chiefly concerns JWT's sale of its Bucharest office to local manager, Hratchia Paniguian. JWT's insistence upon payment in United States dollars complicated the transaction because it entailed the violation of Romanian law concerning currency exchange. Also, one of Paniguian's employees, Andre B. Kalman, was forced to leave Romania because of growing anti-Jewish sentiment, and JWT helped to arrange his safe passage (L.R. Coleman's letter to Foote 1-4-38, and the file titled International Travel, 1940-1941).
The senior staff of the London office consisted of Rae H. Smith, Ed Gordon, L.R. Starkey, and Andrew Sinclair. Because London was JWT's first international office, the company used its arrangements with London to help establish policies for all its overseas operations. Negotiations about profit-sharing and salaries are therefore well-documented.
Several other features make the London Office Files distinctive. They include documents regarding the 1946 suicide of the senior manager of the office, Rae Smith, and the company's efforts to purchase his estate's extensive stock-holdings in JWT. One file, labeled Kodak, 1934-1935, contains a 17-page memo written by a Kodak employee to his superior, attempting to refute allegations that JWT violated the terms of its contract with Kodak. Another file, titled Recordings in Hollywood, 1937-1938, relates to legal problems JWT faced in using radio programs and advertisements recorded in the United States for its London operations. Scattered throughout the London Office Files are at least ten letters written by JWT President Stanley Resor--most of them concerning the letter of terms for advertising clients and profit-sharing policies with key London personnel.
These files record the opening of the Mexico City office in 1943 under the management of John Kuneau. After three consecutive years of financial losses, he was replaced by Donaldson Thorburn. Kuneau's letters to New York include frequent discussions of international clients such as Gillette, Kellogg's, RCA, and Reader's Digest. Two letters to Foote (1-29-44 and 5-10-45) provide profiles of the members of the Mexico City staff, along with comments about economic conditions, client accounts, and advertising strategies (with special attention to radio programs and contests). A letter from Don E. Widlundth to Donaldson Thorburn (5-2-46) discusses an experimental run of six one-minute Reader's Digest films. A small glimpse into JWT's corporate culture may be gained from a handwritten letter by a Mrs. Bill Taylor to Sam Meek (11-22-47), detailing the hardships her family faced when her husband unexpectedly lost his job in Mexico City. Her outcry prompted JWT to send the family four hundred dollars as compensation for some of their expenses.
Materials in this collection include a mixture of formats documenting the aftermath of the Kanto earthquake. A set of 18 postcards, tinted with color in some cases, contain photographs of wrangled railroad systems, destroyed buildings, evacuees, and mass casualties from the earthquake. And additional 120 postcards with similar content, some with Japanese captions, were added in 2016. There is a photo-illustrated pamphlet, which includes black and white images of the devestated areas. Also included is a copy of International Graphic Magazine, which includes reporting in Japanese as well as images from the disaster. This magazine appears to be missing its back cover. Two special issues of Daishinsai Shashin Gaho, from September and October 1923, include photo illustrations of destruction along with early attempts at rescue and recovery. Finally, the collection includes two folded color maps of Tokyo and the affected area, and a scrapbook of newsprint and printed images from after the earthquake. The scrapbook has been bound as a folio, and its news articles are also in Japanese.
The collection contains correspondence, writings and addresses, journals, reports, clippings and assorted print matter. Materials present primarily reflect Kaufman's environmental activism while residing in rural Chatham County, North Carolina and his consulting work with the World Bank and the International City/County Management Association in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. Correspondence mostly documents Kaufman's role with the Conservation Council of North Carolina and the organization's collaboration with other local, regional, and national environmental organizations.
The journals and reports document Kaufman's work in former Soviet nations. They describe Kaufman's day to day activities in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Kazakhstan, and Poland that include descriptions of local customs and geographic regions, the difficulties and challenges inherent in transition from collectivism to privatization, and surveys of local businesses and manufactories. Also present in the collection is material documenting Kaufman's relationship with author Reynolds Price. This material includes mostly correspondence as well as several manuscripts and typescripts. The correspondence touches upon personal matters as well as professional including the activities of mutual friends and acquaintances, travels, and current works in progress.
Autograph manuscript letter with postmarked envelope from the actress and writer Fanny Kemble in London to Miss Patteson in Andover, 10 May, 1889. Kemble thanks Miss Patterson for sending photographs, mentioning that she particularly values one of Bishop Patteson. She says she is "glad Lord Coleridge thought Lenox (Mass.) pretty. It has always seemed to me a charming mountain village."
Collection of 31 black-and-white prints by noted photographer Andr√© Kert√©sz provides a portfolio representing the full range of his compositional styles and topical interests. Taken from 1919 through the 1980s, the end years of his career, the images chiefly feature street scenes from Paris in the 1920s and 1930s and 1980s, with a few street scenes from Budapest (1919 and 1920), and a handful from New York City from his later years in that city, with one from 1939. There are two photographs from the 1930s series "Distortions," featuring female nudes with distortion effects. Several images include cats and dogs. There are a handful of landscapes with no known location, and two still lifes.
The majority of the prints are sized 8x10 inches, with four measuring 11x14 inches. They bear various markings on the backs, including crop marks, dates, and identifying marks by Kert√©sz and others. All but five are marked with the Kert√©sz estate stamp; several bear the photographer's stamp.

The papers of Carl Howie King and of Mary Eskridge King span the dates 1918-1973 and document aspects of Methodism and politics and social movements in North Carolina during the later part of the 20th century. C. H. King was executive secretary of the Methodist Board of Education of the Western North Carolina Conference, 1934-1967.

Collection consists of one untitled holograph manuscript (439 pages) written by Sarah Bowdich Lee discussing African history, exploration, geography, and culture. It appears to date from the 1830s, and was apparently never published. The pages are grouped into loosely bound signatures, with no title page or binding for the text.
Lee's manuscript is an untitled work on Africa that is a survey of European knowledge of the continent as of approximately 1830. It does not appear that Lee saw many of the nations she describes. She writes that she selected many of the "details from the narratives of those whose names alone inspire confidence." The manuscript's watermarks date between 1814 and 1828. Much of Lee's description reflects British white colonialist attitudes and racist or patronizing views of African and Arab people.
The first portion of the manuscript (about pages 1-100) recount African history, exploration, and colonization. The second portion of the text discusses African regions and kingdoms, including Egypt (114, including a description of the ancient pyramids and tombs, and contemporary Muslim inhabitants); Nubia and Sudan (141; includes a description of local wildlife, population, and the trafficking of enslaved people); Abyssinia (165); the Red Sea (180); Darfur and Kordo-far (188; unicorns are mentioned on 194); Cyrenaica (207); Tripoli (216); Fezzan (225); Bornou (240); Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco (283); Senegal (297, includes descriptions of French colonization, the gum trade, Baobob trees, and wildlife); Gambia (306, including descriptions of the British settlement Bathurst); Sierra Leone (322); Ashantee (340); Dahomey (355, including a description of the king and his court); Gabon (381); Congo (388); Portuguese Angola; Cape of Good Hope (399, including a description of Cape Town); and the African islands of Mauritius, Madagascar, Madeira, the Canaries, and others.

Collection consists of three bound diaries kept by Nestia V. Lloyd for the years 1923, 1924, and 1925. The early pages of the diaries include printed matter such as calendars, tips intended for women in the home (regarding cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene and health, fashion), London theaters (including Lloyd's notes about which shows she saw at which theaters), and notes. Lloyd used the diaries regularly and discussed her personal activities, gifts sent and received for various occasions, financial expenses and housekeeping, her work and schooling, her travels and activities through London and Wales, and family news.
The first volume of Lloyd's diary, which chronicles 1923, documents her life within the domicile. Each day, she writes about performing a variety of chores, from dusting entire rooms to washing all the silver in the house. Similarly, she accompanies her mother as she shops daily throughout London. Two of the destinations that they frequent are Kensington and West. Most of the purchases that they make revolve around food and are often times the ingredients for that night's dinner. Throughout the diary, Lloyd also indicates that she maintains a few correspondences over the year. She frequently writes to her friends Ellie Wills and Sytha. She also maintains a constant communication with a man named Russell. They talk on the telephone often, and she has him over for dinner a few times over the year. In April, Lloyd wrote about the Royal Wedding that took place between Prince Albert and Lady Elizabeth. In school, Lloyd is studying both French and Italian. Based on her accounts of each class, French is easier for her to learn, and there are times where she exclaims how well she is picking it up versus how poorly she is understanding Italian. Every week, Lloyd attends church with her mother, and sometimes her Auntie May accompanies them.
The second volume of Lloyd's diary, which chronicles her 1924 year, indicates both a continued presence in the home but also her increasing independence. While she still goes shopping with her mother frequently, Lloyd also begins to do things without her mother's guidance and help. For example, midway through the year (around July), she began to go on daily walks with her sister to Colwyn Bay (Wales) without the company of her mom. Lloyd also picks up both the piano and the violin in her free time, and she becomes an avid reader. On many occasions, she would stay in bed until it was time for dinner because she was so invested in whatever book she was reading at the time. Lloyd also continued the dance lessons that she began the year before. She also appeared to increase her commitment to dance, as she began practicing multiple times per week without fail.
The third volume of Lloyd's diary, which chronicles her 1925 year, again indicates her continued presence within the home as shown by the various chores that she performs daily. However, Lloyd also begins to learn how to type. On one particular day, she is ecstatic after passing one of her typing tests with flying colors after achieving a words-per-minute score of 33. On top of that, Lloyd begins attending weekly lectures about being ladylike; she learns about manners and how to carry herself. She continues to dance and play both the piano and violin, though does so less frequently and with less enthusiasm as she did in 1924.

In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared an unconditional war on poverty in the United States, and nowhere was this war more photographed than Appalachia. A quick Google image search of ‚Äúwar on poverty‚Äù will yield several photographs of President Johnson on the porch of the Fletcher family home in Inez, Kentucky. Many of the War on Poverty photographs, whether intentional or not, became a visual definition of Appalachia. These images have often drawn from the poorest areas and people to gain support for the intended cause, but unjustly came to represent the entirety of the region while simultaneously perpetuating stereotypes.
In an attempt to explore the diversity of Appalachia and establish a visual counter point, the 75 prints in this exhibition collection look at Appalachia fifty years after the declaration of the War on Poverty.
In 2014, the Looking at Appalachia project received more than 2,000 submissions from a 420-county area from southern New York to northeast Mississippi. These submissions resulted in 297 photographs being selected for the online archive. Out of these, a selection of 75 images were chosen for a traveling exhibit, and were digitally printed, 11 in black-and-white, and 64 in color. They were taken by 51 photographers from a wide range of backgrounds and aesthetics, from a hobbyist retired coal miner to a young photojournalist working regularly for The New York Times. Subjects include portraits of people of all ages and backgrounds, rural landscapes, and farm and town life, with social events predominating. Sizes range from 14x23 to 16x20 inches; there are also several 3.25 x 4.25 inch prints.
The prints were first exhibited at the Spartanburg County Public Libraries Headquarters in Spartanburg, South Carolina, May 16-June 26, 2015, and traveled to approximately ten locations in 2015/2016.
Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.

Collection contains primarily correspondence, diary, account books, ledgers, bills, receipts, business records, legal papers, and other material of Hugh MacRae and the MacRae family of North Carolina and Florida.
From the ante-bellum period there are papers of Hugh MacRae's grandfather, Alexander MacRae, concerning the management of plantations in Florida and the second Seminole War; of Archibald MacRae, pertaining to his career in the United States Navy, including a voyage to the Azores and the Mediterranean Sea, 1838, observation of the British attack on Egyptian forces, 1840, participation in the Mexican War in California, voyage to Hawaii, 1847, and descriptions of political and social events in Chile while part of the United States Naval Expedition to the Southern Hemisphere, 1849-1852; of John Colin MacRae and Henry MacRae, relating to the construction and management of railroads in North Carolina and general construction and transportation development in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia, including correspondence concerning quarrels between the Wilmington and Manchester Rail road, headed by Alexander MacRae, and other North Carolina lines; and of John MacRae and Donald MacRae, concerning their general commission business in Wilmington, North Carolina, founded in 1849, the Endor Iron Works (McIver, North Carolina), begun in 1857, and the political activities of John MacRae in Wilmington.
Civil War papers reflecting army life are those of William MacRae, Robert Bruce MacRae, Henry MacRae, and Walter G. MacRae, all of whom served in the Confederate Army, for the most part in North Carolina and Virginia. Their letters describe numerous battles and skirmishes and depict camp life in the 1st, 5th, and 87th North Carolina Regiments and the 2nd North Carolina Regiment, Cavalry. Letters of Donald MacRae, John Colin MacRae, Roderick MacRae, and Alexander MacRae, Jr., concern conditions at home during the war and family business interests, including the sale of cotton, blockade running, operations of an iron works, manufacture of salt, an epidemic of yellow fever in Wilmington, speculation and economic dislocation at the end of the war, and the occupation of Wilmington by Union troops.
Papers for the years after the Civil War are primarily those of Donald MacRae and his son, Hugh MacRae. Papers of Donald MacRae concern the handling of family real estate; settlement of claims on property in Florida; the guano business, particularly the Navassa Guano Company; general business interests, including the development of Linville, North Carolina, as a resort by the Linville Improvement Company and the Western North Carolina Stage Coach Company; and power development, especially the Great Falls Water Power Mining and Iron Company. The papers after 1890 are increasingly those of Hugh MacRae and concern his business interests, including the Wilmington Street Railroad Company, the Consolidated Railways, Light and Power Company, the Central Carolina Power Company in South Carolina, the Tidewater Power Company, and the Investment Trust Company of Wilmington (North Carolina), and his interest in land development and land reclamation, including the formation of farm communities near Wilmington, the promotion of legislation designed to help tenant farmers acquire their own land and to encourage immigration, the creation of the Carolina Trucking Development Company and the Carolina Real Estate Trust Company, and MacRae's work with the National Economy League and the Southern Economic Council in the 1930s.

The papers of William Mahone span the period 1853 to 1895, with the bulk of the material dating from 1876 to 1892. The collection consists of copies of letters written by Mahone to others, incoming letters to Mahone, subject files on a variety of topics, clippings, and scrapbooks, but primarily focuses on Mahone's railroad and political interests. There is a great deal of overlap of topics between the different series in the collection; thus information concerning Mahone's political and railroad interests is repeated in the different series.
Mahone's involvement in the railroad business dates from 1850 when he became the Assistant Engineer of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. While there is information about several of the railroads in which Mahone held positions, including both the Orange and Alexandria and the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroads, the bulk of the material concerning railroads is related to the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad (AMandO). There are both financial and legal papers concerning the AMandO after it ran into financial difficulties in 1873 following the economic panic of that year. Included is correspondence with two Englishmen, John Collinson, who helped Mahone finance a loan to buy the AMandO in 1870, and W. H. Chase, who tried to assist Mahone in saving the railroad. Controversies surrounding the consolidation of railroads in the United States and more particularly in Virginia during the mid to late 19th century are also well documented in the collection.
The bulk of the collection deals with Mahone's political interests and activities. The collection traces the rise of the Readjuster movement in Virginia in the late 1870s, due largely to the efforts of Mahone; Mahone's allegiance to the Republican Party once he was elected to the Senate in 1880; his efforts to build a well organized political machine in Virginia; and finally the loss of support both for Mahone and for the Republican Party in Virginia in the late 1880s.
A central issue in the Readjuster movement was the state's debt, which kept taxes at a high level and almost destroyed the new public school system. The readjusters insisted that the changed conditions of the post-bellum period necessitated the readjustment of the debt. Raising the spectre of class antagonism, Mahone was able to appeal to both poor whites and blacks in order to unite them in a movement of self-interest and reform. This led to the organization of the state-wide Readjuster Party in 1878.
The Readjuster Party won control of the Virginia legislature in 1879 and gained the governorship in 1881 with the election of William E. Cameron. The new party scaled down the debt in the Riddleberger Bill of 1882, enacted laws in social and economic arenas that were of interest to the masses, and, led by Mahone, apportioned governmental offices among the party's leaders. However, in 1883 and thereafter the Readjusters were unable to capture the state legislature or governorship again, although sometimes they lost only narrowly.
Clearly shown through the collection is Mahone's emphasis on organizing the cause of the Readjusters. The focus on organization, including the canvassing of voters before elections, is evident in Mahone's campaigns for the Senate in 1880 and 1886 and for governor of Virginia in 1889. Many of the papers deal with appointing canvassers, creating clubs that would encourage participation in the political process, targeting particular groups to be canvassed such as blacks and "mild" Democrats, making sure political speeches were made in the various precincts, and finding out who had not paid their head-tax and then arranging to have the tax paid. One key element was the Richmond Whig in which Mahone had a financial and editorial interest and which became the official organ of the Readjuster movement.
After Mahone was elected to the United States Senate, he had to choose whether his allegiance would be to the Democrats or Republicans. Once he had aligned himself with the Republicans, Virginia was sometimes viewed as having broken the Solid South, that is, Virginia was seen as one state in the South where Republicans could be elected. Both Virginia and Mahone served as role models for politicians in other southern states who wanted to foster the growth of the Republican Party.
While the collection primarily relates to local and state political matters in Virginia, there are scattered letters in the collection from other areas of the country where the Republican Party was being promoted. There are several letters from William M. Burwell from New Orleans, 1880 to 1884, asking for guidance and giving progress reports on the status of the Republican Party in Louisiana. A letter (1883, March 15) from James T. Beach, Secretary of the Missouri State Republican Committee, relates to his efforts to create a National Cooperative Organization. One of its goals was to secure equal civil and political rights for a free vote.
Mahone was appointed Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture in 1882 and served on the Committee on Naval Affairs, the Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads, and the Committee on Education and Labor. Evidence of his work on these committees is best shown in the Letterbooks, Correspondence, and Subject Files. It is in the appointment of persons to positions, however, where Mahone's influence is most clearly documented. Requests for patronage positions, particularly in the Post Office, dominate the constituent correspondence. Other letters requested that particular post offices be closed or opened.
Other departments to which persons sought appointment included the Government Printing Office, the Norfolk Navy Yard, the Navy Department, the Treasury Department, and the Internal Revenue Service. Included in both the Correspondence and the Subject Files (Politics: Appointments) series are recommendations, requests and petitions for persons seeking positions.
One incident documented in the collection is a riot that occurred in Danville, Va., on November 3, 1883, three days before the Virginia state elections. Under the Readjuster legislature, blacks held a number of governmental offices in Danville. The Democrats opposed the appointment of blacks and dubbed it "Mahoneism." It is difficult today to pinpoint the origin of the violence that occurred or trace its progress, but as a result of it, several blacks and whites died. Readjusters contended the uprising had been provoked by Democrats for campaign purposes. They also blamed their loss of a majority in the state legislature on the Danville Riot. The collection includes eyewitness accounts of the incident which are located in the Subject Files.
The collection also includes much information about voters and voting patterns down to the precinct level in Virginia during the 1880s. The files relating to election frauds, which date from 1882 to 1889, provide yet another perspective on voting concerns. These files contain standardized forms and letters reporting voting irregularities. The majority of the documented frauds are from 1889 when Mahone lost his bid for governor. There were some who believed that had voting irregularities not occurred, Mahone would have been elected governor in 1889.
The collection records the rise and fall of Mahone's political career in the 1880s, as well as developments and controversies within the Republican Party in Virginia during this period. In 1888 the Republican Party split into factions which led to rival state conventions and delegations to the national convention. The Mahone defeat of 1889 brought a check to Republican activity in Virginia and in 1893 the Republicans made no effort even to nominate candidates for the governorship or the legislature.
Political allies Mahone cultivated in Virginia are among the chief correspondents. They include Frank S. Blair, Stith Bolling, William E. Cameron, Abram Fulkerson, William Lamb, John E. Massey, John Paul, Harrison Holt Riddleberger, and John S. Wise.
There is very little personal material relating to Mahone or his family. There are a few letters from his son William Mahone, Jr., and in the Subject Files there are several folders of financial receipts representing items bought for the Mahone family.
A Duke University doctoral dissertation was written about Mahone in 1932 by Nelson Morehouse Blake entitled William Mahone of Virginia: Builder, Soldier and Insurgent. It was published in 1935 with the title William Mahone of Virginia, Soldier and Political Insurgent. There are additional Mahone papers in the Mahone-McGill Collection in the Rubenstein Library at the University of Virginia Library in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Letterpress books containing copies of Mahone's outgoing letters. Relating chiefly to political matters in Virginia, they concern local and state-wide issues, his work in organizing the Virginia Readjuster Party, his gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns, state conventions, the canvassing of voters before elections, and the appointment of personnel to various governmental offices.
Other letters deal with railroad policy. Financial matters related to his own railroad, the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio, are mentioned frequently, as are other financial and business interests of Mahone. There are two gaps in the time period covered: 1879, June 19 to 1882, September 1 and 1885, June 29 to September 3.
Most of the letterbooks contain alphabetical indexes in the front that list the people to whom Mahone was writing. The number beside each name corresponds to the page in the volume where Mahone's letter to that person can be found. In some cases the dates given on the outside of the letterbook are off by a day or so from the dates of letters actually in the letterbook. An effort has been made to specify on the container list the dates of letters actually found in the letterbook, even if they vary slightly from the dates on the cover. Letters are arranged chronologically within each letterbook.
This series consists almost entirely of letters sent to Mahone, although there are a few scattered letters from Mahone to others. The most prominently represented topics relate to local and state political matters in Virginia. Among them are the Virginia state debt; rise of the Readjuster movement; Mahone's gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns; canvassing of voters before elections; requests and recommendations for governmental positions; the use of clubs to encourage involvement in politics; and the schism which developed in the Republican Party in Virginia in the late 1880s.
Other subjects include railroad matters in Virginia, particularly as they concerned the financial issues surrounding the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad; the Richmond Whig; legislation relating to the taxation of various products such as whiskey and tobacco; and several correspondents' interest in having Mahone serve in Benjamin Harrison's cabinet.
Many of the letters are numbered on the back and list the name of the letter writer, the date of the letter, a brief summary of the letter's contents, and the place where the letter was written. This information is also preserved in the correspondence indexes. However, not all the correspondence for these years is covered by these volumes. See the description of the Correspondence Indexes below. The correspondence is arranged chronologically.
Indexes to the incoming correspondence to Mahone. Inside each volume correspondents' last names are listed alphabetically with a number or numbers beside each name. The numbers indicate what pages in the volumes represent that person's letters to Mahone. One of the volumes for 1881 has on the cover "general applications." Letter writers represented in this volume wrote to Mahone with requests for placement in various governmental positions. Another volume for 1881 indexes letters that are unrelated to position requests.
The following information is given about each letter noted by the index: 1) who the letter is from; 2) the date; 3) a number; 4) a brief summary; and 5) the place where the letter was written from. This information also appears on the back of the letters themselves. Some of the correspondence dating before 1879 and after 1888 also have this information, but the only indexes in the collection date from 1879 to 1888. One can therefore move easily between the correspondence indexes and the letters for these years. One of the volumes is undated, except for the month and day the letters were written. Volumes are arranged in chronological order.
The Subject File series is arranged alphabetically and primarily relates to Mahone's political and business interests. Many of the topical headings are further subdivided. Politics comprises the bulk of the series and includes the following major subdivisions:
Appointments, 1870-1890. Includes recommendations, requests, and petitions for people to be assigned to various governmental offices, the most extensive file of which pertains to local post-office positions in Virginia. Other offices and departments represented in this file include the Government Printing Office, the Norfolk Navy Yard and Navy Department, the Treasury Department, the Interior Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and judicial appointments.
Canvassing, 1880-1889. Contains lists of canvassers, groups to be canvassed, the number of registered voters by political party and often by race, the number of people who voted in previous elections, and the number of people who were delinquent in paying their head tax. This information is usually quite detailed and broken down to the precinct level.
Elections, 1879-1889. Includes lists of county and city electoral officials, information about election frauds, and election returns, the majority of the material being from 1889 when Mahone ran for governor.
Financial Papers, 1880-1890. Includes records of campaign expenses for several elections.
Virginia state conventions, lists of delegates to the state, Conservative (1877), Readjuster (1880, 1881) and Republican (1886, 1892) conventions.
Printed Material, 1867-1894. Primarily pamphlets and broadsides. Usually the broadsides relate to a particular candidate, meeting, or campaign issue, while the pamphlets concern a variety of issues. Highlighted in the pamphlets is information about the Republican national, state, and district conventions; tariff duties on various items such as sugar and woolens; the Virginia state debt; and the Readjuster movement.
Another major topic is Railroads. Included is information on several railroads in which Mahone had a financial interest. Among them are the Norfolk and Petersburg, the Orange and Alexandria, and the Virginia and Tennessee railroads. However, the bulk of these files concerns the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio (AMandO) Railroad which Mahone created in 1870. There are extensive files relating to the financial and legal issues surrounding the railroad which suffered an economic setback after the panic of 1873 and went into receivership about 1879. (The railroad was later sold and became known as the Norfolk and Western Railroad.) These files also contain maps of the routes of several railroads and other miscellaneous items pertaining to railroads in general.
Other topics found in the Subject Files include the Civil War (commissary papers from Mahone's Brigade, 1863 Jan. - Dec.); the Danville Riot, 1883; Richmond Whig (financial records, 1875-1885); the Virginia Military Institute, 1865-1881; the Roanoke Navigation Company, 1880-1892; the American Reduction Company, 1887-1888; and the Carolina Oil and Creosote Company, 1886-1890.
Includes specifications for a fountain to be built in Mahone's honor, an obituary for Mahone's nine year old daughter, Elise, social invitations, unidentified photographs, architectural drawings, and a few other items.
Chiefly articles related to political issues and concerns in Virginia including the state debt and the rival political parties the Readjusters and Funders, many from the Richmond Whig. Also articles (1886) about John Goode of Virginia who was rejected by the United States Senate for Solicitor General of the United States and articles concerning Mahone in 1889 when he ran for governor of Virginia.
Forty-one scrapbooks primarily containing clippings but also including circular letters, broadsides, and a few handwritten notes. In the container listing, the dates that have been given on the cover of the scrapbooks are noted. However, the period covered by the scrapbooks does not always match the dates that appear on the scrapbooks' covers. All but three are stored in boxes. The three not in boxes are oversized and shelved immediately after the boxed scrapbooks. Loose items found in the scrapbooks were placed in folders and are filed in the boxes with the scrapbooks.
Topics primarily concern local and state political matters in Virginia, many relating to Mahone. Among the chief topics are the rise of the Readjuster movement and early efforts to organize the Readjusters into a state political party; the state debt; the free school system; Virginia state, district, and county conventions; canvassing voters; Mahone's election to the United States Senate in 1880; the Danville Riot in 1883; support for Mahone to be appointed to a post in Benjamin Harrison's cabinet; Mahone's gubernatorial race in 1889; and the schism which developed in the Virginia Republican Party in the late 1880s. Many of the broadsides announce political speeches.
To a lesser degree, materials about railroads are also included, particularly materials relating to the controversial consolidation of railroads in Virginia and the financial difficulties of the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio Railroad.

The Morris and Dorothy Margolin Film Collection includes 32 home movies that capture the Margolins' travels between 1947 and 1976. Destinations represented in the collection include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, England, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jamaica, Kenya, Majorca, Monaco, Morocco, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Scotland, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. All of the films are in color, and a few include sound.
Also included is a handful of home movies that document family trips and events such as graduations and birthdays, and one film that appears to be a professionally produced documentary about the Soviet Union acquired by the Margolins during their travels.
Particularly notable is the adventurous nature of many of the countries visited, such as the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, and Kenya -- rare destinations for Western travelers in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The films are also noteworthy because Morris often trained his camera on his surroundings, recording everyday life as well as architectural and geographical features of the countries he visited. His wife Dorothy also makes frequent appearances in the films.
The films are complemented by over 4,000 color slides taken in most of these same countries from 1959 to 1982. Of particular interest are images from the former Soviet Union and Israel, both from the mid-1960s, images of South Africa during apartheid, as well as early images of France, Italy, and Thailand.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.
Shotlists were created by Rubenstein Library staff for a number of the films. Contact the Rubenstein Library for further information.

In addition to creating film travelogs, the Margolins took many color photographs in the same countries, and had them formatted into color slides which they would then load into carousel trays and project at special gatherings. The vivid color images feature many kinds of buildings, inhabitants, street scenes, tourist sites, and natural landscapes. Occasionally Dorothy and Morris Margolin, family, and friends make an appearance.
The earliest images were taken in France in 1959, and the latest dates are of a 1982 trip to Italy. Of particular interest are over 200 hundred slides from Russia taken in the 1960s, and many images of Israel from the 1960s and 1971, as well as slides from South Africa during the apartheid era. There are also images from Florence in 1968, showing the consequences of the devastating flood of 1966. Other locations cover most of Europe and England, parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and a few locations in the U.S. and Canada.
The over 4000 slides, arranged in chronological order and then alphabetically by country, were originally in carousel trays; their original projection sequencing has been preserved to the extent possible.

The papers of Eugene Marshall (1832-1919) span 1847-1962 and consist primarily of diaries kept by Marshall during his military service in the Civil and Sioux Wars and correspondence exchanged with his sister, Olive (Mrs. Frederick Trow). The collection is divided into the following series: the Diaries (1851-1895); Correspondence and other documents (1847-1918; 1958-1962); Writings, both printed and manuscript, including poetry, speeches, newspaper articles, and letters to the editor (1863-1918 and undated); Genealogy of Marshall and related families; Volumes and Scrapbooks (1858-1908); Photographs (1858-1913 and undated); and a small folder of miscellaneous material. There is also an oversize folder in the collection, which contains a certificate attesting to Marshall's membership in the Minnesota chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. The collection also includes one of the Indian arrows that wounded Marshall during the campaign of 1864.
This series contains correspondence, largely exchanged with his sister, Olive (Mrs. Frederick Trow); legal and business documents; printed materials (mostly related to veterans' reunions); and newspaper clippings (1858-1915). There is a small folder of miscellaneous material and an oversize certificate attesting to Marshall's membership in the Minnesota chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution.
The diaries, 35 small volumes and related materials, contain information on Marshall's activities in the years 1851-1861, but are primarily devoted to his military service in the Civil and Sioux Wars (1861-1866). A typescript of a portion (1861, Nov. 20-1864, Mar. 14) of the war diary prepared by Marshall's daughter, Ethel, also forms part of the collection.
Diaries have been individually labeled in chronological order. A guide correlating volume numbers to dates has been filed with them. In some instances, wear on the pencil entries has rendered some pages nearly illegible. Some effort has been made to provide reconstruction of the entries. Diary entries after 1866 are few and scattered - clustered around and primarily concerned with the illnesses and deaths of Marshall's wife and eldest daughter.
Writings, both printed and manuscript, include poetry, speeches, newspaper articles, and letters to the editor (1863-1918 and undated).
One of the Indian arrows that wounded Marshall during the campaign of 1864.

The John M. McCalla Family Papers contain correspondence, personal, business, political, financial, military, and legal items, pamphlets, journals, letter books, ledgers, newspaper clippings, various volumes, and a family cook book.
Papers of John Moore McCalla (b. 1793), lawyer, politician, brigadier general of the Kentucky militia, and the second auditor of the United States constitute the bulk of this collection. The papers cover important historical events such as the War of 1812; several presidential elections, including Jackson, Polk, and Lincoln; The Mexican War; the annexation of Texas and Oregon; and the rise of the American Party. Letters dating from the Civil War period include discussions of McCalla Jr.'s work with the Quartermaster General and the Surgeon General's offices; Seminary Military Hospital in Georgetown; the ongoing military campaigns; and McCalla Sr.'s pro-South sympathies.
Volumes included cover several subject areas: financial and estate accounts, weather reports, an index to cases in Congress in the 1850s, and an accounting of property rental and construction; a pamphlet, 1839, with an address given at the fiftieth anniversary of the Lexington Light Infantry; a journal, 1860-1861, of Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr., written while he was an agent for the U. S. government in the return of slaves captured from a slaver, describing his journey to Liberia, the political and social conditions there, and life in Washington, D.C., in 1861; ledgers to the estates left to Helen Varnum (Hill) McCalla (including estates from James M. Varnum, Joseph B. Varnum, and Silas N. Hill); and a book listing gifts received by the family from the 1890s.
Family papers include journals and notes from various McCalla women, including Helen Louise Sargent; documentation of travel, family relationships, and estate business; clippings, including reports of political disputes in Kentucky; and other miscellaneous items.
The Correspondence is arranged chronologically. Correspondence discusses personal and family matters; presidential elections; the Mexican War; the annexation of Texas and Oregon (1845); the activities of McCalla and others in the Democratic and American Parties; the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln and the coming of the Civil War; various business ventures in Kentucky and Washington, D.C.; letters from several former McCalla slaves who settled in Liberia (circa 1834 and 1836); conditions in the Eastern Lunatic Asylum in Lexington, Kentuckey (circa 1826); McCalla's duties as U.S. marshal for the District of Kentucky; and his service as 2nd auditor in the Treasury Department.
Some of the letters in this series discuss personal or financial matters. For example, on Dec. 15, 1818, McCalla writes to Congressman Henry Clay asking his assistance in gaining compensation from the government. There are also 1820s letters between John McCalla and his brother, William Latta McCalla (a controversial Presbyterian minister), discussing personal difficulties, their families, and the Ebenezer Presbytery of Kentucky. Beginning in 1828, and continuing into the 1850s, a personal correspondence develops between John McCalla and Medard Coutre of Frenchtown, Monroe County, Michigan. Both men had participated in the River Basin Campaign of 1812-1813, and Coutre‚Äôs family settled on the site of the battle of Jan. 22, 1813.
The Correspondence also contains a large number of letters discussing political matters and disputes. Letters about the character and affairs of Henry Clay are written by Duff Green (1829), Thomas Patrick Moore (June 24, 1829) and S.H. Laughlin of Nashville (Sept. 2, 1844). John McLean, Supreme Court Justice, writes to congratulate McCalla on his appointment as U.S. Marshal on Feb. 16, 1830. On March 31, 1845, McCalla was appointed second auditor of the U. S. Treasury and immediately moved his family to Washington D.C. His term lasted until 1849. With Taylor's election, General McCalla left the Treasury Department to enter private law practice in Washington. Wm. 0. Butler writes in 1851 on his candidacy for the Presidency. There are details on the second auditor's office as McCalla gathers material for charges against his successor, Philip Clayton. With Franklin Pierce in office, McCalla again sought governmental appointment. In 1853, Pierce received letters from several individuals, all recommending that McCalla be re-appointed as second auditor.
On June 8, 1860, John McCalla's son, Dr. John Moore McCalla, Jr., becomes agent for the United States government in the return of slaves captured from a slaver. Materials related to his work with the American Colonization Society are also present in the Personal Papers series.
Along with business correspondence, McCalla's letter books contain financial accounts, poetry, property rentals, personal correspondence, and construction information. From the 1830s through the 1850s, these letter books contain mostly business correspondence of McCalla to various government officials, including President Andrew Jackson.
Financial Papers include business papers, account books, ledgers, daybooks, household accounts, bills and receipts, and tax records. Financial papers document the names of businesses in Washington, D. C., and include a number of tax assessments in that city. Ledgers chronicle John Moore McCalla‚Äôs time as United State auditor and his duties while in that position. Among the financial items are several books dealing with the account of J. B. Varnum.
Includes tax receipts and other tax accounts for unspecified places, as well as Washington D.C. and Lexington, Kentucky.

This series contains both militia and legal papers, including deeds, wills, claims, leases, contracts, law licenses, indentures, papers dealing with the settlement of estates and McCalla's legal practice, militia rosters, accounts, petitions to sue, and court martial proceedings from the War of 1812. Interesting property involved is from estates of J. M. Varnum whose heirs are Helen V. Hill and Mary Isabel Hill for one part and Joseph B. Varnum on the other. This estate, centered in Washington real estate and securities, continued through the life of Isabel (McCalla) Goldsborough and Helen Hill Goldsborough.
On March 31, 1845, McCalla was appointed second auditor of the U.S. Treasury and immediately relocated to Washington. Many of the papers date from his time in office.
In an affidavit of Sept. 24, 1844, John McKee claims to have seen Henry Clay drinking spirits and using profanity, in Richmond, Kentucky in the fall of 1841. An index refers to cases in Congress during the 1950s and there is an address given at the fiftieth anniversary of the Lexington Light Infantry.
Personal papers contain collected newspaper clippings (pertaining to workers‚Äô rights, especially women and children, religion, and political disputes), hymns, poetry, journals, art books, a cook book, and miscellaneous. McCalla‚Äôs personal writings, including short stories, lectures, articles and poetry, are also filed in this series, along with several journals. Chief among these journals is one from Dr. John M. McCalla, Jr., McCalla‚Äôs son. He documents his journey to Liberia from 1860-1861 when he was appointed as an agent for the U.S. government in the return of slaves captured from a slave ship. The rough draft of a book entitled ‚ÄúSelect Reader Comprising of Choice Extracts, In prose and verse, adapted to the use of the public and private schools,‚Äù by Louisa McCalla is also included.
Hymns; prose and verse; poems; short story; articles; lecturesf
John Moore McCalla, Jr., kept a journal of a trip to Liberia in 1860 which concluded with brief entries on Washington, D.C., in 1861. The McCallas were active members of the American Colonization Society which worked in 1860 with the U.S. government to return to Africa 383 captives seized by a U.S. warship from a slaver. The slaves were brought into Key West, Florida, where the Colonization Society sent two ships, Star of the Union and South Shore, to pick up the Africans and transport them to Liberia. Dr. McCalla was appointed agent of the U.S. government by Secretary of Interior Jacob Thompson, and Dr. J. M. Grymes was named surgeon for the Colonization Society.
Dr. McCalla started on June 13, 1860, from New York by ship for Key West. He describes the town while awaiting the departure of the Star of the Union (p. 18). The Africans were from the Wydah tribe, whose customs are well described by Dr. McCalla. After seasickness and the death of a number of Africans, the ship arrived at Monrovia, Liberia, on Sept. 2, 1860, where the South Shore also docked about the same time. While part of the freed slaves were being landed at Monrovia, Dr. McCalla visited the town and described its houses. He met Judge Wilson and Dr. Joseph Jenkins Hoberts (1809-18?6), the black representatives of the American Colonization Society, as well as President Stephen A. Benson of Liberia and the missionary, the Rev. Alfred F. Russell. Dr.McCalla describes in detail a dinner at the home of the first President of Liberia, Dr. Joseph Roberts, and his wife, Jane (Waring) Roberts.
The Star of the Union sails to Greenville, Liberia, to land the last of the freed slaves. Koontown is described. Comment is made (p. 66) on the two Llberian political parties, True Liberians and Whigs. Dr. McCalla is interested in the native plants he finds and notes the ships which come and go frequently. He begins his return voyage on Sept. 21, 1860, stopping at Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the West Indies to take on a cargo of salt.
This portion of the journal contains a clipping, Apr. 8, 1870, from the New York Herald, reporting the wretched conditions of life in Liberia, the high death rate, and poor schools.
Topics include political news and disputes; letters to editor; press attacking McCalla; his removal as auditor; and a map of Boston's burnt district

The Mary McMillan Papers, 1936-1997 and undated (bulk 1952-1991), consist chiefly of journals and printed material, but also include correspondence, writings and speeches, photographic material, scrapbooks, clippings, videocassettes, audio cassettes, and memorabilia. Arranged in nine series based primarily on the format of the material, the papers illuminate the personal life and professional work of McMillan, a United Methodist missionary and teacher at the Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College in Hiroshima, Japan. In addition to her work as a teacher, the collection documents McMillan's service to the Kyodan, a unifying organization for Christian missionaries in Japan, and to the hibakusha, the survivors of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as her peace activism. Also included are materials related to the Topaz Relocation Center, a Japanese-American internment camp in Utah where McMillan worked in 1943. The papers are mostly in English, but include some Japanese language materials.
The bulk of the collection consists of the Journals Series, whose 43 journals contain almost daily accounts of McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, her involvement with the Ushita Christian Church, and her encounters with friends and other people. Also included are her personal thoughts about world events, particularly those related to peace and nuclear disarmament. Beginning on Aug. 11, 1939 with the final preparations for her initial departure, McMillan records her activities through her first year and a half in Japan. The 1939 and 1940 journals document in depth McMillan's adaptation to life in Japan, including her training in the Japanese language and customs, her first visits to various cities throughout the country, and the difficulties she faced as an American woman in pre-World War II Japan. After she and other American workers in Hiroshima were forcibly evacuated on Feb. 29, 1941, journal entries are scarce; however, the almost-daily entries resume in 1952 and continue until the day of McMillan's death on July 19, 1991.
In addition to the journals, McMillan's professional work as a United Methodist missionary and teacher at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College is well documented through the Correspondence Series, Writings and Speeches Series, and Printed Material Series. The Biographical Material Series includes McMillan's handwritten autobiographical notes, as well as newspaper and magazine clippings and booklets documenting McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, and with the Ushita Christian Church, which McMillan helped found in 1948. McMillan's correspondence also sheds light on her work through "mission letters," mass mailings which she wrote periodically as a way of updating her supporters in the United States on her work in Hiroshima.
McMillan also was a staunch advocate of world peace and nuclear disarmament, and after her retirement from the United Methodist Church in 1980, she spent much of her time writing letters and speaking in churches throughout the United States promoting her cause. McMillan's role as a pacifist is well well documented throughout the entire collection by her correspondence, photographs of demonstrations and marches, printed materials, and items in the Clippings Series. Much of the material in the Writings and Speeches Series and the Printed Material Series is related to peace activism, and covers topics such as the lingering effects of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and that city's fight for peace, the first-hand accounts of bomb survivors, and the United Methodist Church's pacifist stance.
Also contributing to an understanding of McMillan's life, the Photographic Material Series and the Memorabilia Series offer visual and three-dimensional documentation of her activities as a missionary, teacher, and friend to the Japanese.

Many small groups of loose materials were found laid into the beginning or end of the journals; these were removed and placed in a separate folder following the journal; some of these items appear to be unrelated to the journals in which they were found.
Personal and professional correspondence of Mary McMillan, divided into outgoing and incoming subseries and arranged in chronological order. The Outgoing Correspondence primarily contains letters sent by McMillan to churches or individuals in the United States who had supported her work in Japan. These "mission letters" describe McMillan's work at Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College and Ushita Christian Church as well as her beliefs in world peace and disarmament. Some of the Incoming Correspondence, particularly in the early 1980s, is in Japanese. The majority of the letters are to McMillan from friends, missionaries, and former students in Japan after her retirement in 1980. Also included in a small third subseries is other correspondence that was neither to nor from McMillan. Many of these letters were written to Jane Greenwood, McMillan's sister, from individuals and organizations expressing their condolences over McMillan's death. A few pieces of correspondence have photographs clipped to them.
Reports, essays, and other unpublished material, divided into three subseries containing writings by Mary McMillan, writings by other individuals, and audiovisual materials. All items are ordered chronologically within the subseries. The BetaMax and VHS video cassettes in the audiovisual materials subseries require use copies; the audio cassettes have use copies already available.
Primarily handwritten and personal essays documenting peace activism and the nuclear disarmament movements in the United States and Japan.
Contains reports and essays documenting the peace movement, as well as the growth of the Christian Church in Japan and the works of the Kyodan, the organization which unified the missionaries of the various Protestant denominations in Japan. Also included are poems and other creative works written by McMillan's friends that explore peace and Church activism, as well as tributes to McMillan.
Videotapes, audio cassettes, and one phonograph record containing recordings of speeches and debates regarding the future of Japan, the history of Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, and the continued effects in Hiroshima of the atomic bomb. Also included is a video of McMillan's farewell ceremony prior to her retirement, as well as an LP recording of the song A Message for Tomorrow. Arranged in original order. Use copies are available for the audio cassettes. Master audio cassette tapes are filed immediately following the use copies.
Divided into two subseries for photographs and for slides; the material is further organized by subject matter. There are images of the Topaz Relocation Center in Utah, Hiroshima Jo Gakuin College, McMillan's friends, former students and their families. Other images document her travels throughout East Asia, including trips to China and Taiwan. The bulk of the material consists of black-and-white and color casual snapshots of McMillan, her Japanese friends, and her former students with their families. These photographs document Japanese wedding traditions and other ceremonies as well as various marches and activities promoting peace and nuclear disarmament. There are ten images taken at the Topaz Japanese internment camp; most of the photographs were labeled with names and sometimes dates. The slides are in color and consist chiefly of images from McMillan's travels. All materials are arranged in chronological order

The title of this project, Le pido a Dios que no me olviden, translates to "I ask God that you not forget me." It is taken from a letter written to the artist's mother the day she emigrated from Guatemala to the United States in 1982.

Contains Meredith's diary (1868, October-1881, August) which mentions the Sirosis Club, a progressive club for women which held lectures on scientific topics during the late 1870s and early 1880s. The diary also includes information about Meredith's play, Mistress Anne: A Drama of the Seventeenth Century, (ca. 1873) is included. Meredith also wrote magazine articles under the pseudonym of Papillon.
The Frank Baker Collection of Methodist Circuit Plans, 1777-1984 and undated, consists predominantly of circuit plans from the Methodist Church (Great Britain) and the earlier churches that merged to form it in 1907 and 1932: the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the Primitive Methodist Church, the United Methodist Free Churches, and the United Methodist Church (Great Britain). These plans document the history, growth, and organization of the itinerancy, established by John Wesley in the early years of the church when Methodism began to spread into the rural areas of England. The circuit plans feature detailed schedules of where the itinerant preachers, known as circuit riders, were to appear and preach each week.
Items in the 19th Century and Overseas Circuits Series were donated in the 1970s and were organized at the item level and encapsulated in the early 1980s. Items were numbered in the order in which they were encapsulated, which bears no relationship to alphabetical order or circuit organization. They are currently boxed in numerical order in three boxes with the following number ranges: Box 1: items 1-240; Box 2, items 241-390; Box 3: items 391-527. Items in the 20th Century Series, numbering around 800 to 1000 items, were donated in the late 1980s and are organized to the folder level.
Article by Frank Baker, The Circuit Plan, published in Library Notes, no. 49, 1979, Duke University Library.
Photocopies purchased from the collection of John Ellis, Wesley Society, London. Housed in a separate envelope inside folder L3.
Handwritten plan. Removed from Jabez Palmer scrapbook--see Frank Baker Collection of Wesleyana and British Methodism, Volumes Series, Albums and Scrapbooks.
Donated at a later date. Approximately 1500 circuit plans, mainly covering the years from 1944-1959, but with scattered plans from the 1890s and 1900s. Plans are grouped alphabetically by circuit name (or city, if circuit unclear), but are not in order within each letter.
Collection consists of thousands of cigarette, tobacco, tea, and foodstuffs trading cards, arranged by topic or set; hundreds of silks, blankets, and pins also distributed as collectibles through packages of tobacco; and about fifty original packages and tins of tobacco products, dating from the late nineteenth to late twentieth century. Mitchell created and accumulated substantial documentation of the items in this collection; that description has been included when available.
The largest series is the Trading Cards, which largely date from the twentieth century and include both American and international sets. This series also contains a sampling of nineteenth century cards from companies such as Allen and Ginter; W. Duke, Sons and Co.; Kinney Bros.; the American Tobacco Co.; Gail and Ax; P. Lorillard Co.; and others. There is typically one card from a series and they have not been sorted or further described.
The rest of the Trading Card series is arranged by card set, including sets from tobacco companies (including Will's Cigarettes, Ardath, Barratt and Co.; Gallaher Ltd.; Sarony and Co.; John Player and Sons; Turkish Tropies; Hassan; Mills Filtertips; Godfrey Phillips; Stroller's Cigarettes; Carreras; and others), tobacco monopolies (like the Imperial Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd.; American Tobacco Co.; and others), and other trading card sets from other brands and products (such as Brooke Bond Tea; Hoadley's Chocolates; Stamina Clothing; Shell Corp.; Nabisco; Sanitarium Foods; and Arm and Hammer). These came pre-sorted by Mitchell into various topical categories, which have been retained.
The second series encompasses the other formats of tobacco collectibles acquired by Mitchell, and include silks, blankets/flannels, and pins. These are arranged according to their S and B numbers, as initially cataloged by Jefferson Burdick.
The third series contains original Tobacco Tins and Packages, with assorted tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, plug tobacco, and other related products from various brands and companies. These date from both the nineteenth and twentieth century.
The Trading Cards series contains both cigarette and non-cigarette collectible cards acquired and assembled by Terence Mitchell. The earliest cards are from the late nineteenth century; this portion of the series includes assorted miscellaneous cards from various sets and sources. They have not been itemized and are foldered together in the Nineteenth Century Cards subseries. That subseries also contains some examples of cigarette company coupons and prize tickets. The bulk of the series dates from the twentieth century, and includes Mitchell's collectible cards from both the tobacco industry and other products such as tea, chocolate, and oil. Mitchell pursued the entire set when available, and then donated them to Rubenstein pre-sorted into various categories he established. There are no cards from Topic 11: Circus and no cards from Topic 29: Police, so these numbers have been skipped in the ensuing description.
Assorted cards from tobacco companies such as Allen and Ginter; W. Duke, Sons and Co.; Kinney; American Tobacco Co.; G.W. Gail and Ax; P. Lorillard Co.; Goodwin and Co.; and others. Usually 1 example of a card from a set. Wide range of topics and artwork represented, including some real photographs.

This series includes a range of formats also included in tobacco cartons or packaging: blankets (also called flannels); silks; leathers; and pins. Mitchell's book, American Tobacco Cards (published 1999) explains that "silks refers to any issue of cloth material distributed as inserts in tobacco packages or as premiums in exchange for coupons." Silks were intended for sewing together as pillow topis or other display items. Blankets were typically made of flannel but could also be woven fabric. Mitchell writes that most fabric inserts were issued between 1908 and 1915.

The collection documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of the life of an important feminist writer of the twentieth century. It is organized into the following series: Correspondence, Writings, Speeches and Interviews, Subject Files, Personal Files, Teaching Materials, Audio-Visual Materials, Photographic and Visual Materials, and Oversize Material. The largest group of materials consists of documentation on all of Morgan's significant written works: Demon Lover; Depth Perception; Dry Your Smile; Going Too Far; A Hot January; Lady of the Beasts; Saturday's Child; her well-known feminist anthologies, Sisterhood is Powerful and Sisterhood is Global; and other materials on her poems, articles, and other writings. In addition, Morgan's papers hold many items of correspondence with a wide range of individuals, including prominent activists and feminists as well as family members and close friends. There is also a significant amount of correspondence and other material that documents Morgan's role as founder of the Sisterhood is Global Institute, and records related to her role as editor and writer for Ms. magazine.
Seen in a broader context, the collection provides ample documentation for the study of modern feminism. Morgan's subject files (the second largest in the series) are rich in materials related to the feminist movement in the United States and around the world; and materials concerning sexual health, witchcraft, lesbian feminism, and the social, economic, and political position of women in the world (especially in the Middle East, Russia, and South Africa). There are materials on individual figures such as Bella Abzug, Jane Alpert (imprisoned revolutionary), Patty Hearst, Gloria Steinem, and Marilyn Waring. Other series hold additional materials related to Morgan's career as a writer; several of her speeches and interviews; materials from Morgan's courses she gave on feminism; and photographs and audio-visual materials.
The Correspondence Series spans much of Morgan's adult life. It is divided into two subseries: Correspondence by Name and Correspondence by Decade. The Correspondence by Name Subseries chiefly consists of Morgan's correspondence with family members, friends, fellow feminist activists and contemporary authors and critics. The bulk of the items in the Correspondence by Decade Subseries dates from the 1990s and relates to the production of Ms. magazine. The Correspondence Series is restricted: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the materials.
The Writings Series documents Morgan's career as a poet, novelist, essayist and journalist. Of Morgan's eighteen books, ten are represented in individual subseries. Particularly noteworthy is the material related to Sisterhood is Global, which provides an inside view into the production of the anthology. The series also contains some of Morgan's earliest unpublished writings as well as files containing her comments on other writers' work, and single issues of periodicals in which she published her poetry. The Writings Series is also restricted: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Responsibilities and Privacy Rights form before using the materials.
The Speeches and Interviews Series primarily contains peripheral documentation such as contracts, correspondence, and schedules. However, there are drafts of a number of her speeches and interviews.
Materials which Morgan collected over the years concerning American and international feminism are located in the Subject Files Series. The materials cover a number of topics, including women's economic, political, and social status, and feminist action - especially in South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East; rape, abortion, terrorism, female genital mutilation, and pornography; and the first feminist demonstration against the Miss America Pageant. Significant figures represented in the subject files include Marilyn Waring, Patricia Hearst, and Gloria Steinem. Two subseries contain administrative information about Ms. magazine and the Sisterhood is Global Institute. The Subjects Series is restricted: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the materials.
The smaller Personal Files Series offers materials related to Robin Morgan's education, early critical writing, and her many trips overseas. The series also includes material that Morgan requested under the Freedom of Information Act from the FBI and CIA about her own activities.
The documents in the Teaching Materials Series are primarily related to Morgan's academic positions at New College (Sarasota, Fla.) and the University of Denver, and the courses she taught on feminism and writing. The files include both administrative documentation as well as actual course material, but there are also clippings related to feminist protests on campus.
The Audio-Visual Materials Series contains numerous interviews on cassette tapes that Morgan conducted in the Middle East, a recording of her reading of selected poems from A Hot January, and a videotape about the production of Saturday's Child. Permission is not granted to publish interviews conducted in the Middle East; the researcher is responsible for obtaining permission to publish. Original copies of audiovisual materials are not open to use; however, use copies are available to researchers.
The Photographic and Visual Materials Series provides a small visual supplement to the other documents in the collection and includes portrait photographs of Morgan taken by the press and by her close friends, as well as snapshots of social gatherings. This series also includes two painted portraits of Morgan. The series is restricted: patrons must sign an Acknowledgment of Legal Rights and Responsibilities form before using the materials.
Later additions (Accessions 2009-0069, 2010-0176, 2015-0060) have not been fully processed, but boxlists are available in the Detailed Description portion of this finding aid. Some portions are restricted or closed.
For collections related to the Robin Morgan Papers, see the Phyllis Chesler, Merle Hoffman, and Kate Millett Papers, all located in the Duke University David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library. In addition to Robin Morgan's own papers, the Library also holds the records of the Sisterhood is Global Institute, founded by Morgan in 1984.
The series is divided into two subseries: Correspondence by Name and Correspondence by Decade, both of which contain letters to and from Robin Morgan. The Correspondence by Name Subseries is organized alphabetically by last name or place. Prominent correspondents include feminists such as Simone de Beauvoir, Sallie Bingham, Kate Millett, Adrienne Rich, and Gloria Steinem. There are also letters of a personal nature with Morgan's mother, aunts, and close friends, such as Vladimir Urban. Particularly voluminous is the correspondence from Isel Rivero (further documented in the Photographic and Visual Materials Series), with whom Robin Morgan maintained a close relationship during the 1980s, and from Jane Alpert. The latter provides interesting insights into a woman's life in the underground and in prison during the mid-1970s.
While there are several letters in the Correspondence by Decade Subseries that date from the 1950s and 1960s (including a letter from Nehru), the bulk of the correspondence comes from the 1990s. Material from this decade includes letters of both a personal and professional nature; one group of folders contains correspondence pertaining solely to the period during which Morgan was Ms. magazine's editor in chief. In this subseries, the correspondence is arranged in original order, by decade only.
Largest in the collection, the Writings Series contains drafts, notes, manuscripts, reviews, and correspondence (both with editors and readers), as well as other material such as contracts and copyright agreements related to Morgan's novels, anthologies, and poetry. Individual subseries, arranged alphabetically, contain material relating to almost all of Morgan's book-length published works. Within each subseries, documents are in the original order to reflect the publishing process. Materials in the Poems, Other Writings by Morgan, Writings by Others, and Grants subseries are all in chronological order.
The material related to the production of the Sisterhood is Global anthology is particularly extensive. It includes files on individual contributors, which contain ephemeral publications and correspondence providing insights into the lives of women in different parts of the world. Less extensive material on shorter published and unpublished works can be found in the Poems Subseries and Other Writings by Morgan Subseries. Particularly noteworthy in the latter are samples of Morgan's earliest writings, which reveal an acute sense of humour and sensitivity at an early age, and the many folders of Morgan's comments on other women's works. Finally, at the end of the Writings Series, there are a few manuscripts by other authors, including poetry and a dissertation about Morgan's work.
Approximately one third of the series consists of drafts of Morgan's speeches; interviews of Morgan by Dorothy Dinnerstein, Chai Lin and Helen Cooper; and material about her joint poetry tour with Kenneth Pitchford. The remaining two thirds of the material is documents related to Morgan's speeches and interviews (chiefly correspondence, schedules, and contracts). All material is in alphabetical order. Several announcements of Morgan's speeches are located in the Oversize Material at the end of the collection.
The Subject Files Series is organized into five subseries. Apart from the International Feminist Activism and Resources Subseries, which is organized by continents, all material within individual subseries is in alphabetical order. Formats include newspaper clippings, ephemeral publications, short articles, and official letters and documents.
The General Subseries includes documentation about a controversial plagiarism case involving Robin Morgan, as well as material documenting Morgan's service with Hands Across America. The International Feminist Activism and Resources Subseries documents feminist activism all over the world. The most substantial material comes from South Africa and the Middle East, where Morgan spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps. The Ms. Subseries contains minutes and memos from editorial meetings, information about distribution, and some correspondence with readers. A large portion of the subseries comes from the years when Morgan acted as editor-in chief (1989-1993) and re-launched the magazine as an international bimonthly free of advertising. There is also material concerning the 1980 issue of Ms. about Russian women and Soviet feminism. The Sisterhood Is Global Institute Subseries contains some annual reports and other institutional documents. Finally, the U.S. Feminist Activism and Resources Subseries consists of subject files that cover a number of topics, including witchcraft, demonstrations against the Miss America Pageant, women's clinics, and anti-pornography campaigns. There are also several documents about feminist conferences in the United States and some material concerning figures such as Gloria Steinem, Marilyn Waring, and Patricia Hearst. A complete set of issues of Rat magazine was removed from this subseries and is located in the Oversize Materials.
Consists primarily of papers related to Robin Morgan's formal education at Columbia University. Formats include class notes, essays, and rather brief notebooks from her trips to the Middle East, Austria and Egypt, further documented in the Photographic and Visual Materials Series and Subject Files Series. Other material includes FBI and CIA files, which Morgan requested through the Freedom of Information Act in the 1970s. Each of the three categories (Education at Columbia University, Trips, and Other Personal) is arranged in chronological order.
Includes material related to Robin Morgan's position as an adjunct professor at the Union Graduate School; as a visiting chair and guest professor of Women's Studies at New College (Sarasota, Fla.); and as a visiting professor at the University of Denver Graduate School of International Affairs. The bulk comes from the Denver position and includes contracts; course material related both to the courses that Morgan attended and to the courses she taught on feminism; student papers; and teaching-related correspondence. The material is arranged in alphabetical order.
Contains cassette tapes with interviews that Morgan conducted with women in the Middle East during two visits in 1985 and 1989. There is also a recording of Morgan's reading of poems selected from A Hot January as well as a videotape titled, Saturday's Child; A Memoir. The collection is arranged by media type.
This series includes 240 photographs and two painted portraits.
Consists of 240 photographs, 222 of which are color, and 18 black and white. Most of the images are snapshots from Morgan's trip to Egypt; the rest are pictures of Isel Rivero, and some taken by her. The photographs are arranged in their original order.
This subseries includes two large painted portraits of Robin Morgan. One is a formal studio pose, painted on wood and depicting Morgan as a young woman during the time that she was a television and radio personality. The other was painted on canvas by Pat Mainardi (author of Politics of Housework) after Morgan achieved fame as a radical feminist activist and poet.
Contains materials from the Writings Series, the Subject Files Series, and the Speeches and Interviews Series. Poetry broadsides include the poem White Night, dedicated to Morgan and signed by Adrienne Rich. The Subject Files Subseries contains a complete set of issues of the feminist magazine Rat.

Addition (2009-0069) (900 items; 1.5 lin. ft.; 1993-2006) includes Morgan's files on sexual trafficking (2000); a master copy and page proofs of The Burning Time (2005-2006); and email printouts of responses to Letters from Ground Zero, which went viral on the Internet following Sept. 11, 2001.
Accession (2010-0176) (18,450 items; 24.6 lin. ft.; dated 1947-2010) includes Morgan's travel files, correspondence, Ms. editorial files, and materials from her research and publications. General correspondence (dating 1996-2009) consists of email printouts and letters detailing Morgan's activities with various projects, conferences, and boards, including Equality Now and the February Sisters. It also includes her thoughts on the 2008 presidential election, including a re-written version of Goodbye to All That discussing the Hillary Clinton campaign.
The Ms. files (dating 2002-2010) include global dispatches, correspondence, and cover story interviews by Morgan of Madeleine Albright and Jane Fonda. This section also contains files from the Ms. search for editor-in-chief.
A large portion of the accession relates to Morgan's writings, poetry, and published books. These materials consist of drafts, correspondence with publishers, publicity and press, reader reactions, reviews of her work, and rights permissions. Works represented include Monster, which included the poem Arraignment;The Mysteries, a play; Upstairs in the Garden; Going Too Far; The Anatomy of Freedom; The Witch Tales; Sisterhood is Forever; and other poems and articles.

Also represented are supporting materials, mainly clippings and other miscellaneous items, from Morgan's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood that she used for writing her Memoirs. These clippings include coverage of her activities as a child star on the television show Mama, as well as her other performances, radio and television shows, and modelling engagements. Morgan's early activities in the women's liberation movement are also represented in these clippings, such as her protesting the Miss America competition in 1969 and coverage of her book, Sisterhood Is Powerful. The original clippings are extremely fragile and may require Technical Services intervention.
Other materials in the accession include various research and project files, many supporting Morgan's activities or writings. For example, there is a series of folders on clitoredectomy and female genital mutilation, culminating in a draft prepared by Morgan and Gloria Steinem of an article published in the 1970s. Materials from the Women's Media Center are closed due to restrictions. There is also a significant amount of audiovisual material, including film, VHS, reel-to-reel audio, and DVDs.

The Audiovisual materials series contains video and audio tapes as well as photographic material documenting NCHR's work, as well as Haiti and Haitians more generally.
Photos in folders related to the USS Courageous show some of the first Haitian refugees fleeing the 1991 coup d'√©tat, intercepted by the US Coast Guard and brought to the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, Cuba after a federal district judge in Miami ordered a stop to all forced refoulements to Haiti. The judge gave a small delegation led by the Haitian Refugee Center (HRC) 24 hours to prove that it had standing to sue the US government, and that most of these Haitians had legitimate claims to asylum because of fear of persecution if returned. The group included Ira Kuzban, chief counsel to the Haitian Refugee Center, Cheryl Little, Stephen Forrester, Esther Olivera, Jocelyn McCalla and a couple of Haitian translators. McCalla snapped the picture of the Haitians who were still being held aboard a Coast Guard cutter and had not yet been processed so they could be housed in the temporary camps being built for them [note provided by Jocelyn McCalla].

The North Carolina Self-Portrait Collection, 1993-2000, contains paper documents, audio cassettes, contact sheets, slides, negatives, and photographs, all relating to the work of the NCSP project. To build the collection of images of African Americans in the South, project staff visited African American families primarilyy in North Carolina locales, but also in Mississippi, and requested copies of original family photographs created from 1900 to 1990, giving back quality reproductions to the families for their own collections.
The collection is particularly rich in materials related to the private and professional lives of African Americans living in the South during the first half of the 20th century. The images contain subjects typical to family photograph albums, including: candid and formal portraits, weddings, anniversaries, award ceremonies, school pictures, athletic teams, vacations, leisure activities, and other aspects of domestic life. In addition, many of the families whose photographs were copied were active members of religious and social organizations. Some of the distinct and more heavily represented organizations are the Arabian Shriners, New Bern Isiserettes, Eastern Stars, Young Men's Institute in Asheville, the A.M.E. Church, as well as employees of the NC Mutual Insurance Co. The North Carolina portion of this project was primarily conducted in the geographic locations of New Bern, James City, Durham, Asheville, and Southern Pines.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.
Consists of files and records stemming from the project to create the North Carolina and Mississippi Self-Portrait Collection. Includes information sheets for each subject or family; notes from the photography sessions; grant proposals and budgets; correspondence; photocopies of loaned photos; and other project records. Also includes computer disc with information sheets.
This subseries contains paper format materials created when photographing the family albums of North Carolina residents. The material is arranged alphabetically, by the collection's creator, using a three letter code for the last name of the participant family, with some exceptions. Each folder contains an information sheet that provides an itemized description of the photographs that were copied, and may contain notes used when printing the photographs contained in other series in this collection.
Files house records concerning the administration of the NCSP project.
Photographs printed from negatives made by photographing family albums.
This subseries contains photographs made from the albums of families living in North Carolina, and is organized by the same three letter code as the North Carolina Individual Families Subseries located in the Paper Format Series.
Photographs that at the time of processing could not be directly attributed to a specific family; or photographs in a different format than the photographs in the North Carolina Individual Families Subseries.
Contains contact sheets for the projects conducted in North Carolina and Mississippi.
This subseries contains color and black-and-white contact sheets printed from negatives made from the albums of families living in North Carolina, and is organized by the same three letter code as the North Carolina Individual Families Subseries in the Paper Format Series. The color contact sheets are foldered together because they contain images for more than one family. Color images were not made for all of the participant families, if color material exists for a particular family it is noted in the following container list. The Color Contact Master Sheet (located in the Paper Format Series and the color contact sheet folder) is an index of the color contact sheets that can be used locate a corresponding black-and-white image, and to identify the participant family that provided the original image. Because the color contact sheets contain images for more than one family a portion of the contact sheet may be open for research while another portion is closed. The Color Contact Master Sheet can be used to identify the portions of the contact sheets that are closed.
This subseries contains contact sheets made for the project conducted at the University of Mississippi. Contact sheets made from the albums of participant families living in Mississippi, as well as, images of the participant families themselves are included in this subseries. The negatives used to make the contact sheets contained in this subseries are not included in this collection.

Some photographs have been identified as being of South Carolina during the late 19th century-early 20th century, which include portraits, street scenes (in Charleston), sail boats, as well as a few photographs of people of color, including photographs of "Lascar Sailors."Some photographs are of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point during the 1890s. Many of the legal and financial papers were generated by Nathan Carter Newbold's father and grandfather. The bulk of the correspondence relates to Nathan Carter Newbold's role as an administrator for North Carolina public schools and to his tenure as the Director of the Division of Negro Education during segregation and Jim Crow.
Includes personal and professional letters written to and from Eugenia Bradsher Newbold, Nathan Carter Newbold, Mabel Wooten and others. The letters document the courtship between Nathan Carter Newbold and his first wife Mabel Wooten, whom he married in 1900, as well as his later marriage to Eugenia Bradsher. These personal letters reveal the day-to-day experiences of the authors including their affection for one another. Much of the correspondence written to Nathan Carter Newbold is made up of appreciation letters from public school officials who wrote to Newbold upon his retirement. Other correspondence documents Newbold's professional networks (including connections to Trinity College) and depicts his activity within the North Carolina public school system as an administrator.
The bulk of the letters are written to Nathan Carter Newbold during their courtship and after their marriage in 1900 in La Grange, North Carolina.

Additionally, a few of the wills and deeds identify people of color and document the transfer of enslaved people.
Many portraits and some landscape scenes taken of family members and unidentified people. Many of the portraits were taken in studios in North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Texas, and Georgia; and two were taken in the Philippines, perhaps during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Some of the photographs were taken in South Carolina and include street scenes in Charleston, landscapes, and portraits. Some of the photographs are of people of color, including photographs of "Lascar Sailors." Additionally, there are photographs of the United States Military Academy (West Point).

Photographs include portraits, street scenes, sail boats, as well as a few photographs of people of color, including photographs of "Lascar Sailors."

Collection of 143 stereographic images of areas in southeastern China, taken by amateur photographer and American lighting engineer Frederick B. (F.B.) Nightingale from 1920 to 1921 while he traveled on business as a representative of General Electric. Nightingale's collection is of value not only for the image content, which includes many street scenes with individuals in addition to well-known sites and landscapes, but also for his lengthy captions on the back of each card, commenting on food customs, architecture, folklore, commerce, and religious beliefs and practices, as seen from a Westerner's perspective.
The majority of the images were taken in Suzhou (referred to in captions as Soochow, 55 images), Hangzhou (Hangchow, 44), Mount Putuo Island (Pu-tu, 14), and Shanghai, China (13), but there are also a few photographs from other cities (Chang'an, Ningbo, Harinen?), and a set of 11 images taken in Japan. There is also one photograph of overgrown land on Nightingale's Pasadena, California property called "Palawoo." Several images feature Nightingale, and one shows the porter carrying his camera equipment. The majority of the images are crisp with little fading. A few are stamped with small identification numbers.
Subjects include numerous temples, pagodas, monasteries, monuments, tombs, and other historic sites, some of which no longer exist. Nightingale was able to capture some images of temple interiors, and he often noted which religious sites allowed entry to women. There are many photos of street life, river traffic, modes of transportation, and Chinese vendors and pedestrians going about their daily business.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.

Illustrated with sketches.
The Outdoor Advertising Association of America Poster Designs are comprised of black and white poster designs (for billboard or other transit advertising), some printed on cards and some photographed and mounted in volumes, that document the advertising design holdings of several outdoor advertising companies from 1934 through the 1940s and possibly later. The majority of the designs in the collection are stock posters in preliminary sketch form with simple lines, but the collection also includes finished designs with brief information on exhibition and award status. Stock designs were created without actual brand names so more than one advertiser could use them by simply inserting their own brand name or product into the ad. The designs include work created or acquired by the Donaldson Lithographing Co., Foster and Kleiser, General Outdoor Advertising Co., and the AD-VER-TIS-ER, Inc.
These designs provide a snapshot of American consumerism during the interwar years by demonstrating how advertising professionals in the 1930s and 1940s represented products in order to entice shoppers. As well, the designs document the production of commercial art during this time period, in both the artistic process of creating ad artwork for billboards or other transit advertising space, as well as in the relationship between ad agency and client. Proven designs were available to the ad agency as sales tools to prospective clients, and these stock images could be reused, so there was less need to customize advertising campaigns for individual clients. The designs are organized into two series: Printed Poster Designs and Stock Poster Photograph Volumes.
The Printed Poster Designs Series consists of a card file of designs including some more polished billboard images, all arranged into product or service categories. The Stock Poster Photograph Volumes Series consists of twelve volumes of designs, also organized by product or service type.
Closely related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library include the Outdoor Advertising Slide Library; the John E. Brennan Outdoor Advertising Survey Reports; the John Paver Papers; the John Browning Papers; the Duplex Advertising Co. Records; the War Effort Mobilization Campaigns Collection; the Outdoor Advertising Association of America Records; the Garrett Orr Papers; the R.C. Maxwell Company Records; the Howard Scott Papers; and the Strobridge Lithographing Company Photographs.
Consists mainly of black and white printed cards of billboard advertising designs. Most images are in a preliminary stage of design completion, and many are stock designs with no actual brand names appearing. Some, however, are more polished, containing added information about placement in competitions (e.g., Annual Exhibition of Outdoor Advertising Art), the artist, and the outdoor advertising company that presumably produced the design. Foster and Kleiser and General Outdoor Advertising Co. are the two firms most often mentioned on cards. The company Sales Promotional Service is also found. This company may have distributed stock design cards to subscribers, probably outdoor advertising companies, to solicit use of its artwork. The cards were thus used as sales tools--some are printed on the reverse with information directed to clients including pricing. Some General Outdoor Advertising Co. cards appear to have designs stamped in blue ink. This particular group of cards was used in recordkeeping; they contain information about particular clients that used the design such as client name, pricing, contract length, salesman, and type of display.
Organized by product or service type categories. Some categories overlap, and so certain topics appear in more than one category. A few numbered categories contain no cards/designs.
Includes advertising designs for festivals, rodeos, ice shows, county fairs, wrestling events, boxing, hotels and dancing, live orchestra performances, bowling, show clubs, amusement parks, and dance events.

The Garrett Orr Papers document the artistic output and personal files of advertising executive Garrett Orr. Although the collection spans the years circa 1873 to 1994, the bulk of the materials fall within two main periods: the 1890s to 1914, comprising a photographic collection of old poster images; and 1930 to 1965, which approximates the span of Orr's professional life. The collection includes the original drawings, water colors and paintings produced by Orr as designs for the outdoor advertising campaigns of a wide variety of products such as Gillette razors, Ipana toothpaste (Bristol-Myers), Lucky Strikes and Viceroy cigarettes (Brown & Williamson), Mazola corn oil (Corn Products Refining Company), Seagram beverages, Verney fabrics, and White Rose tea. Also included are folders of photographs, slides and negatives of Orr's advertising work for approximately 550 companies (with index). In addition, a collection of almost 200 large-format negatives and photographs document images of 19th- and early 20th-century posters for plays, musicals, minstrel shows, circuses, and hotels. A large set of clippings files contain published examples of the work of over 100 graphic artists and illustrators contemporary with Orr, including Floyd Davis, Ronald McLeod, George Petty, Howard Scott, Ben Stahl, Jon Whitcomb, and J. Walter Wilkinson. The collection is organized into five series--the General Files Series; the Artists and Illustrators Series; the Product Files Series; the Other Photographic Materials Series; and the Sketches Series. Large-format items from the Artists and Illustrators Series and Sketches Series have been relocated to Oversize Materials.
Closely related collections held by the Rubenstein Library include: the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Archives; the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Poster Designs; the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) Slide Library; the Duplex Advertising Company Billboard Images and Records; the Strobridge Lithographing Company Advertisements; the R.C. Maxwell Co. Records; the Howard Scott Papers; and the John Paver Papers.
Consists primarily of clippings, correspondence and obituary notices. Also includes a collection of some of Orr's articles; his personal notes for an outdoor advertising campaign; and announcements of exhibitions and award presentations by professional organizations such as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Art Directors Clubs of New York and New Jersey, and the Society of Illustrators. Arranged alphabetically.
Clippings, tear sheets and photographs of advertisements and periodical illustrations produced by approximately 127 commercial artists. Most materials date between 1935 and 1950, with a particularly strong emphasis on World War II-era illustrations. Dates for some materials could not be readily determined but have been provided where known. Materials are organized into two format-related subseries--Printed Materials and Photographs--to accommodate storage needs, and arranged alphabetically therein by artist name.
Prominent artists featured here include: Peter Arno (best known for his New Yorker illustrations of the 1930s and 1940s); C.C. Beall (illustrator for Collier's magazine in the 1940s); Pierre Brissaud (Wamsutta sheets, 1930s); Dean Cornwell (noted for his World War II action scenes, and his illustrations for General Motors' Fisher Bodies and Philadelphia Whiskey); Floyd Davis (creator of distinctive comic characters for Ten High Whiskey, 1930s); John Gannam (lifestyle vignettes for Pacific Mills and the U.S. Brewers Association); Earl Oliver Hurst (cover illustrations for Collier's magazine 1930s, Jantzen sportswear); Ronald McCleod (cover illustrations for Collier's 1940s, Plymouth and Texaco print advertisements); Al Parker (cover illustrations for Ladies' Home Journal 1940s-1950s); Russell Patterson (noted for his Ballyhoo magazine cover art in the 1930s; his specialty, stylized ink drawings of barely-clad female figures in comic situations, were featured on advertisements for a number of different products); George Petty (a longtime illustrator for Esquire magazine; the Petty Girls drawings were one of the most recognizable styles of pinup art in the 1930s and 1940s); Robert O. Reid (Collier's cover art 1939-40; illustrator for Oldsmobile automobiles and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer); Howard Scott (Saturday Evening Post cover art 1940s; advertisements for Nash automobiles and Esso oil products; researchers interested in Scott's work should also consult the Howard Scott Papers); Ben Stahl (Rogers Bros. silverware; perhaps most famous for his illustrations on the John Hancock insurance company's American Heroes advertising campaign); Jon Whitcomb, who in the 1930s and 1940s was a nearly ubiquitous illustrator for women's and family magazines such as Ladies' Home Companion, Good Housekeeping, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's; and J. Walter Wilkinson (the OAAA campaign Make a Long Story Short, WW II Defense Bonds); original paintings by this artist are contained in Oversize Materials.

Tear sheets, clippings, proofs and photographs of both print-media and outdoor advertising displays, representing around 450 products. Dates for some materials could not be readily determined, but dates have been provided where known. Included for some products are images from the OAI pamphlet series Poster Ideas, which highlighted successful or innovative advertising campaigns along with suggested poster ideas for particular products. Not all of the advertisements included represent work by Orr, and some clippings appear to have been added after Orr's death. Materials have been arranged into two subseries--Print Advertisements and Photographs--to accommodate storage needs. In addition, the Print Advertisements Subseries has been further organized into small- and large-format sizes. There is considerable overlap between the Print Advertisements and Photographs Subseries, and researchers are advised to consult both subseries. Arranged alphabetically by product category, therein by trade name.
Photographs, negatives and slides arranged by Orr into distinct collections that stand apart from photographic items present in other series. The series is organized into two subseries--Historical Poster Images and Modern Poster Images--and therein alphabetically by product category and trade name or title.
Large-format photographs and negatives of posters, billboards, theatre and circus signs and other advertising-related images of goods, services and entertainment events that date from the late 19th-early 20th century. Dates for individual images have been supplied where known, but not every image could be precisely dated. The images are all on modern safety film and negative stock, which suggests that the photographs might have been taken taken during the 1930s-1940s at the earliest, but a more accurate dating of the photographs themselves cannot be determined. Many of the posters bear the logos of various incarnations of the Strobridge Lithographing Company. In addition, some of the photographs have handwritten notes on the back that indicate that those images may have originated with the Chicago Historical Society, while others bear the stamp of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America Library. Anecdotal evidence further suggests that these photographs were once part of, or copies of, a historical advertisement archive maintained by OAI, but that suggestion cannot be verified. Organized into three groups--Photographs, Negatives (photographs available), and Negatives (photographs not available)--and therein alphabetically by subject category, item name, or title.
Many images in this subseries may be in the public domain. However, it is the researcher's responsibility to comply with all copyright and trademark laws.

The collection consists of a single diary kept by Mary Gorham Paine as she traveled twice by ship from Boston to islands near Madagascar. Forty-six manuscript pages provide both a day-by-day account of her trip aboard the Sarah Hobart to Nossi-Be (present day Nosy Be) from December 25, 1879 to May 4, 1880, and a three-page, mid-journey synopsis of the passage with her young son, Allan, to Reunion Island, begun on December 13, 1883. As is made clear by the text, the intent of both voyages was to join her husband, Captain Eben W. Paine, who was probably located in Zanzibar at the time. Newspaper clippings chiefly concerned with literary topics, news and issues relating to Africa, and obituaries for her husband and others are pasted into 18 pages following the narrative portion of the diary together with a photograph of a man and another of a baby, most likely her husband and son. The clippings lack an indication of the year and source except for the Literary Leaves articles which are from the Boston Journal.
The diary provides some insight into the life of a sea captain's wife and a description of long-distance ocean travel aboard a barque such as the Sarah Hobart. Paine initially suffered from sea-sickness, but once recovered, occupied herself with sewing, reading, washing, and baking, as well as socializing and playing cards and Parcheesi with fellow travelers. She often mentioned the activities of her primary companions, Mrs. Crocker and the ship's Captain, who sometimes cooked special meals for his female passengers and was often engaged in washing clothing himself. In addition, Paine unfailingly commented on the weather, foods served at meals, number of miles traveled, number of days at sea, and types of ships sighted. On April 18th, after nearly four months at sea, the ship made port at Tamatave, Madagascar (present day Toamasina). Paine mentioned little about the six days spent ashore and continued with the diary only until arrival at Nossi-Be. The summary description of the second journey centers mainly on Paine's concern with her 20-month old son's well-being and activities aboard ship, her own struggle with sea-sickness and feelings of inadequacy in managing her son, and her appreciation for the assistance of Mrs. Hill and the ship's Captain in caring for him. The final update to the narrative was added on February 4th, 1884, while still en route to their first stop, Reunion Island.
The Nell Irvin Painter Papers span the years 1793-2021, with the bulk of the material dating between 1876 and 2007, and are primarily composed of the extensive correspondence, writing, research, teaching materials, and other professional papers that Painter has produced in her long career as a scholar, teacher, and writer in 19th- and 20th-century American and African American history. The materials document the breadth and depth of Painter's interests and her intellectual and personal influence on a generation of historians. Her varied roles as student, teacher, colleague, and mentor are recorded in a wide variety of formats: correspondence with colleagues, students, family, and friends; syllabi, department memoranda, and meeting minutes from her graduate and faculty positions at Harvard, Princeton, and the Universities of North Carolina and Pennsylvania; materials from many professional organizations in the fields of African American history, Southern history, American studies, and women's studies; and records of her speaking engagements, conferences, and meetings. Painter the historian and author are revealed in the extensive notes, photocopies, recordings, photographs, manuscripts, and proofs produced in writing many articles and five of her major books: Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas after Reconstruction; The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South; Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919; Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol; and Creating Black Americans: African-American History and its Meanings, 1619 to the Present. The portrait is rounded out by the materials in other series: personal files, which include materials from her student years at Harvard and abroad in Ghana and France as well as personal journals; a few papers of Ghanaian writer Ayi Kwei Armah; photographs, including many historical photographs of African Americans as well as many personal snapshots in color and black-and-white; and other non-print media such as audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and computer diskettes.
Painter's research files contain a wealth of information about many topics in American history: biography of African Americans; biography as a literary form; slavery; Reconstruction; the 1870s migration from the South to Kansas; a variety of social reform movements--such as abolition, communism, labor, and women's suffrage--and movers, such as Sojourner Truth and Hosea Hudson; and the history of social conditions and political change in the United States from the early-19th to the mid-20th century, particularly as expressed in race relations, in women's history, and in the South. At the same time, Painter's papers also constitute a contemporary record of many trends in American culture such as career and educational choices and opportunities for academic women and African American professionals. Her correspondence with students, colleagues, and longtime friends such as Nellie Y. McKay, her teaching material and academic files, her papers from an array of historians' organizations, and her personal journals each shed their own light on these themes.
The collection is arranged in these series: Correspondence, Writings and Research, Teaching Materials, Professional Service, Personal Files, Photographic Materials, Audiovisual Materials,Electronic Formats, and a collection of private papers collected by Painter, the Ayi Kwei Armah Papers. The first four series comprise almost eighty percent of the physical extent of the collection and are each divided into several subseries. The Correspondence Series follows Painter's personal life, education, and professional career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s through her retirement from Princeton in 2004.
The Writings and Research Series is arranged in seven subseries, the first five of which are based on five of Painter's major books; the final two subseries are Other Research Topics, which gathers many of Painter's shorter writings, and Writings by Others. With the exception of the last, all the subseries here contain correspondence with colleagues and editors; typescript drafts of works; various stages of proof; extensive photocopies of archival materials and published articles; voluminous notes about her readings and research; and some photographs and recordings, most of which have been removed to their respective series for preservation.
The Teaching Materials Series documents Painter's work with students and academic colleagues at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. It is arranged into two series: Courses Subseries, with syllabi, reading lists, and Painter's notes on the development of her courses that reflect the evolution of women's studies and African American studies in the curriculum; and the Academic Files Subseries, revealing Painter's many different roles over three decades: graduate student, job applicant, junior and tenured faculty member, dissertation advisor, mentor, and department head.
The Professional Service Series, arranged in two subseries, documents Painter's activities in the broader academic community beyond her university of employment and her personal connections through materials from well over one hundred professional organizations, conferences, foundations, committees and task forces, as well as editorial boards of journals and publishers with which Painter has worked during her career. The Engagements Subseries gathers documents relating to addresses, speeches, and awards ceremonies at some three hundred conferences, meetings, and symposia.
Five smaller series and a gathering of oversize material round out the collection. The Personal Files Series contains an assortment of records such as curriculum vitae; documents about her family; and some records of her student years, especially her travel and study in France and Africa. The series includes some three dozen personal journals covering most of the years from 1959-2005 containing entries about her life and career (NOTE: some journals are CLOSED to use; see details in the series note). The Photographic Materials Series contains several hundred photographs, negatives, and slides, predominantly personal and travel snapshots but also including professional portraits of Painter as well as a number of original photographs and reproductions of archival photographs she used in her research and writing. Much of the material in the early years of the Audiovisual Materials Series is related to her research and writing; by the 1990s, the content shifts focus to documenting Painter herself on the occasion of various interviews and addresses. The Electronic Formats Series consists of diskettes containing correspondence and drafts of writings. The Oversize Materials contains items from several series and subseries are gathered. The final series in the collection consists not of Painter's own work but that of a Ghanaian novelist and poet; see the Ayi Kwei Armah Papers (RESTRICTED) series note for further information on the provenance and usage of these materials.
Unprocessed additions to the collection are listed at the end of the collection guide.
Note about date range of materials: The primary material produced by Painter begins around 1959 with her earliest journals. Earlier dates in various series, occurring mainly in Writings and Research, reflect the intellectual content and original publication of the large volume of reproduced research material present in the collection. Contains professional correspondence between Painter and her professors, colleagues, and students over the course of her career; personal letters to and from family, friends, and colleagues; and some administrative and interdepartmental memoranda from each of the universities at which Painter served as professor. Documents Painter's personal life, education, and career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s up through her retirement from Princeton in 2004. Major figures who corresponded with Painter include African-American novelist Toni Morrison; professors of English Houston A. Baker, Jr., Werner Sollors, and Nellie Y. McKay; and historians Darlene Clark Hine and William L. Andrews. Theirs and others' correspondence may appear in either the Chronological Subseries or Alphabetical Subseries. Professional correspondence also includes some letters related to editorial matters, organizations such as the National Endowment for the Humanities, and such publishers as Heinneman of the African Writer's Series. Arranged in four subseries: the Chronological, Alphabetical, Student/Candidate Files, and Nellie Y. McKay (CLOSED).
Materials Retrieval Note: In addition to the material gathered in this series, Painter's extensive correspondence can be found in many other places in the collection. This is particularly true of the Writings and Research Series and the Professional Service Series. In the case of the former, each of the five subseries for Painter's major books contains a Correspondence subgroup within it related to research and publication of the book, and correspondence also appears in various folders throughout the other two subseries. In the Professional Service Series, correspondence appears in both subseries--Organizations and Engagements--though more substantially in the former. Thus in order to be sure of seeing all correspondence that might relate to a particular book, for example, patrons should retrieve not only the correspondence from that book's subseries in the Writings and Research Series, but also any boxes in the Correspondence Series that originate from any applicable time spans or persons in the Chronological and Alphabetical subseries, respectively.
Correspondence between Painter and professors, colleagues, students, friends, and family over the course of her career.
Arranged in chronological order by year, month, and, in some places, day. Where possible, Painter's own system of labeling has been retained, which accounts for some overlap in dates across folders. Materials from the mid to late 1990s and early 2000 often have been divided into the categories professional,business, and personal as Painter saw fit, and the folders containing these materials have been so labeled along with the year and, at times, month. Printed electronic correspondence was largely separated by Painter from traditionally-formatted letters when it first began to appear in the mid-1990s and has been retained in her folders; after a few years, however, she began to treat e-mail as any other correspondence and by 2002 was interfiling items regardless of how they originated.
Processing and retrieval note for 2008 and 2010 accessions: There have been two substantial expansions of this subseries since the collection was originally processed in 2006. Materials from Accession 2008-0016 were integrated into the subseries chronologically but not physically, meaning that newer box numbers will sometimes appear out of strict numerical sequence. Materials from Accession 2010-0116 were processed minimally, and can be found appended at the end of this inventory. Researchers are advised to examine all these points when seeking to retrieve all correspondence from a particular period of time, especially materials dated 1997 or later.
Correspondence between Painter and professors, colleagues, students, friends, and family over the course of her career. Many of the same correspondents may also appear in the Chronological Subseries. Arranged alphabetically, mainly by personal surname but also by names of organizations and topical names assigned by Painter. Correspondence with family and some close friends may appear under their individual names but also under the categories Family, Family and Friends, and Intimates.
Correspondence with current and former students, including some undergraduates but mainly graduate students and masters and doctoral advisees. Contains many attached writings, proposals, resumes, and requests for references. Many of the same correspondents may also appear in the Chronological Subseries. Arranged alphabetically.
Correspondence between Painter and Nellie Y. McKay, who met in 1969 when both were first-year graduate students at Harvard (Painter in history, McKay in English). McKay went on to become a professor of American and African-American Literature and published important works on Toni Morrison and Jean Toomer among other writers. She spent most of her career at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bulk of subseries consists of correspondence from McKay, but several years into the sequence many copies of Painter's letters begin to appear, too. Letters cover the personal and professional lives of both women, enriched by a variety of attachments, including drafts of writings, newspaper clippings about their careers and current events, promotional materials, snapshots, and sometimes copies of correspondence with third parties. Arranged chronologically, although researchers should note that Painter's original labeling on the folders is not always complete. Often the correspondence inside the folders covers a longer span of months than she indicated; this has been amended in pencil, but items were not shifted between or within folders, so contiguous folders should be examined for particular weeks or months.
Writings, research materials, notes, and correspondence that document the genesis of Painter's major books and many articles, essays, and reviews. Contains significant amounts of correspondence with publishers, sources, and colleagues; articles and talks sent by colleagues; and copious notes and numerous photocopies of primary sources, including newspapers and government records. There are also many drafts of Painter's talks and writings, including manuscripts, typescripts, and printer's proofs.
Arranged in eight subseries, the first six of which are based on five of Painter's major books: Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction (1976); The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South (1979); Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol (1996); Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919 (1987); Creating Black Americans: African American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present (2005); and The History of White People (2010). Each subseries is further divided into three subgroups, Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials; see specific subseries notes for further detail about the arrangement and content of these categories for each book. Materials unrelated to these five books--or whose relationship to them could not be established--have been placed in one of the final two subseries, Other Research Topics or Writings by Others. Note that while all the subseries contain writings by other authors, the main criterion for placing materials in Writings by Others is that the folder contains only such writing. If a folder contains Painter's notes and commentary in addition to writings by other authors or contains works by multiple authors that Painter gathered under a topical heading, then they are placed in one of the first five subseries or in Other Research Topics. This subseries, the largest in the Writings and Research Series, is further divided into subgroups by topic; see its subseries note for further details on its arrangement.
Several types of documents that appear in this series are supported by related material in other series. Three are of particular note: correspondence, addresses, and writing by other authors. Much correspondence appears in various subseries in Writings and Research, and it addresses many of the same topics broached in the Correspondence Series; it can be searched alphabetically or chronologically according to the arrangement of the particular subseries. Drafts of Painter's addresses and articles have generally been placed in the Writings and Research Series--especially in the Other Research Topics Subseries--if the folders consist mainly of substantive drafts of the work or research on it; but other versions may also appear in the Engagements Subseries of the Professional Service Series. Finally, a substantial amount of writing by other authors, especially when those authors were current or former students or advisees of Painter's, appears in two other series. Most such material appears as attachments to letters in the Student/Candidate Files Subseries of the Correspondence Series; a smaller amount, in the form of drafts unattached to correspondence, appears at the end of the Teaching Materials Series, Academic Files Subseries.
As mentioned in the Collection Overview, the dating of folder titles is of particular note in this series due to the large volume of photocopies and microform printouts of archival and historical material. If the folder contains Painter's notes or quotations from a primary source, the date corresponds to the time Painter worked on the subject. If the folder contains an original source or photocopy of one (almost always the latter), the date corresponds to when the intellectual content was originally produced or published.
Documents Painter's survey of African American history, which uses black American art to illustrate the narrative. Consists mainly of typescript drafts of several chapters. Arranged alphabetically in the categories of Correspondence and Research, chronologically in Drafts.
Materials have been organized into three subgroups, Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. Correspondence also includes book reviews. The Drafts subgroup consists of typescripts and printer's proofs. Related writings and speeches by Painter are organized with the research materials. The materials in the Correspondence and Research Materials subgroups are arranged alphabetically, while those in the Drafts subgroup are arranged chronologically. Because they lack precise date information, three typescripts and three printer's proofs have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not reflect any chronological ordering among those documents. In the Research Materials subgroup, articles by Painter are indicated by (NIP); writings by others are listed alphabetically by last name. The designations "(d)" and "(w)" she occasionally places after the names of certain newspapers indicate whether it was a daily or weekly publication, respectively.
Drafts of several chapters; also contains a lecture in which Painter addresses her themes and approaches in this work. These previously closed materials are now open following upon the book's publication in 2010.
Contains correspondence, readers' reports, drafts, interview transcripts, and research materials for The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South (1979), as well as related talks and articles by Painter.
Materials have been divided into three subgroups: Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. The Correspondence subgroup largely consists of publication-related materials and correspondence between Painter and Hudson, which began in 1976 and lasted through 1982. Many of Hudson's letters contain newspaper articles that he routinely clipped, typed notes onto, and attached to the letter. Other items of note in the subgroup include readers' reports and Painter's replies to them and a letter of consignment for the Hudson interview tapes, which Painter donated to the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where they are housed in the Southern Historical Collection.
The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of materials used in verifying and annotating the text. Hudson's FBI file is of particular interest. Also contained are several interview transcripts and related articles and talks by Painter, including her talk at UNC, How I Wrote Hosea Hudson.
The materials contained in the Correspondence and Research Materials subgroups have been organized alphabetically. The folder titles for articles or talks by Painter begin with the work's title, followed by (NIP). Folder titles for works by other others are organized by author, last name first. The materials in the Drafts subgroup are organized chronologically.
Contains correspondence, reviews, photos, comments from readers, and research materials for Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol (1996), as well as related talks and articles by Painter. Divided into three subgroups: Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials. The Correspondence subgroup includes materials regarding fellowships Painter received, reviews, photos, answers to questions regarding Sojourner Truth, publication information, and requests for others to review drafts of her chapters. These items have been ordered alphabetically.
Painter sent a number of typescript chapter drafts to other scholars. The Drafts subgroup largely consists of the drafts that these scholars returned, with their comments and suggestions. The majority of the drafts are of the first three chapters, but a few copies of chapters four and five are also included. These items have been organized chronologically.
The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of notes, articles, and photocopies of book chapters and letters. There are also a number of talks and articles by Painter in relation to Sojourner Truth. In particular, there are several folders with materials relating to the chapter Difference, Slavery, and Memory: Sojourner Truth in Feminist Abolitionism, which appeared in Jean Fagan Yellin and John C. Van Horne's The Abolitionist Sisterhood: Women's Political Culture in Antebellum America. At the time the materials in the collection were prepared, the chapter was known only by its subtitle and the book was called An Untrodden Path. Also of interest is an article by Richard Powell, which is related to a chapter in Sojourner Truth on photography and representations of Truth. Other materials relevant to this topic, particularly cartes de visite, are found in the Writings by Others Subseries and the Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. The Research Materials subgroup has been ordered alphabetically.
Consists of correspondence, drafts, related talks and writings, and extensive research materials related to Painter's work on Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919 (1987). Divided into Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials subgroups.
Compared to other subseries, the Standing at Armageddon Subseries contains relatively little correspondence. The existing materials are largely publication-related. The correspondence with the Henry George School of Social Science includes a lesson plan and quiz questions on Standing at Armageddon. Related correspondence perhaps may be found in the Correspondence Series. The Drafts subgroup includes a manuscript, several typescripts, and two master proofs. The Research subgroup materials include photocopies of scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and Congressional records, as well as extensive notes from those materials and books. The subgroup also includes talks, reviews, and articles by Painter.
In addition to materials directly about the book, all materials in the Writings and Research Series involving the issues of labor, gender, and race, as they relate to the economic and political conditions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, have been incorporated into the Standing at Armageddon Subseries. The subseries also includes materials on the South that are relevant to the period addressed by Standing at Armageddon.
The correspondence and research materials are arranged alphabetically, while the drafts are arranged chronologically. Talks or articles by Painter have generally been identified by (NIP) following the work's title. As three typescripts of Standing at Armageddon lack any date information, they have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not reflect any chronological ordering among those typescripts. In addition, inasmuch as their dating is uncertain, those typescripts have been placed after the other typescripts in the subseries.
Consists of eleven subgroups: Black Nationalism, Civil Rights, Civil War, Ella Thomas, Gender and Sexuality, Historiography, Other Materials, Photography, Religion, Southern History (which includes a folder grouping on Reconstruction), and Walter White. The materials contained within these subgroups include photocopies of and notes from books and articles, as well as drafts of Painter's writings. Some related correspondence, as well as three fictional works of unknown origin, are also included. The materials in this subseries have been organized alphabetically.
Consists of materials on Martin Delany and on the various representations of Malcolm X.
Contains drafts and research materials on affirmative action, Jim Crow, the Equal Rights Amendment, Anita Hill and Lani Guinier, and voter fraud.
Beside materials on the Civil War, subgroup also includes materials on Frederick Douglass, slavery, and the Antebellum Period. Among the article drafts and research materials, the subgroup contains several photocopies of photographs.
Painter wrote the introduction for The Secret Eye: The Journal of Ella Gertrude Clanton Thomas, 1848-1889, which was edited by Virginia Burr. The Ella Thomas subgroup contains correspondence with Virginia Burr, book covers, typescripts of the diary, and typescripts and printer's proofs of the book.
The second largest subgroup in the Other Research Topics Subseries. Many of the materials focus on women in the American South, but they also examine abuse, including sexual abuse; the distinctions between one's identity as black, as a woman, and as a black woman; minority women as historians and scholars; and black women in relation to civil rights, voting, and affirmative action.
Materials that examine the practice of writing history, particularly biography, autobiography, social history, and oral history. A related work on how Painter produced the Narrative of Hosea Hudson is found in the Research Materials subgroup of the Hosea Hudson Subseries.
The largest subgroup in the Other Research Topics Subseries. Contains work that either did not fit within one of the other subgroups, or that was equally relevant to several topics. Includes materials that cover the general topics of racism and African-American history, as well as issues surrounding political correctness, race and money, and language. Of particular interest are the materials about the Somerset reunion, a reunion of all the families associated with a former slave plantation in North Carolina, and three fictional works of unknown origin.
Materials may relate to the numerous works on photography in the Other Research Topics Subseries, or to the topic of images in Sojourner Truth.
Materials may relate to the work on religion in either the Exodusters or Sojourner Truth Subseries.
Contains materials on the differences between African-American and Southern history; emancipation; the Ku Klux Klan; identity, blood and race; and Reconstruction. Because of the number of materials on Reconstruction, these have been organized into a group within Southern History. Many of the materials in this subgroup relate to a work on the South and identity that Painter proposed and researched, which she entitled American Views of the South. Although it was not written, some of the themes for this work are addressed in Painter's introductory essay for The Secret Eye, which was reprinted in Southern History Across the Color Line, as well as in Creating Black Americans and other essays in Southern History Across the Color Line.
Materials compiled by Painter while working in the late 1980s with one of her students, Leah Hagedorn, on a reprint edition (never published) of the novels of Walter White, an early 20th century African American author and chief executive of the NAACP from 1929-1935. Subgroup contains copies of correspondence to, from, and about White; copies of his newspapers columns, fiction manuscripts, and other writings; and Painter's original correspondence, drafts, and notes about White's life and work. Arranged alphabetically based on Painter's original folder titles; descriptive words such as "correspondence" and "photocopies" were added as needed to clarify folder contents.
Consists of drafts, published works, and lectures by family members, colleagues, and other individuals. Although Painter probably used these materials for her own research, they have been placed in the Writings by Others Subseries because they were unrelated to, or could not be particularly identified with, any of her major books. Moreover, they have not been included among the materials in the Other Research Topics Subseries, although they frequently include notes or marginalia by Painter, because Painter organized these materials in such a way that the work in each folder is primarily the work of a single author other than herself. Correspondence, including notes from those sending materials to Painter, can be found in some folders, and related material from some authors may also be found in the Correspondence Series.
Significant topics covered in the subseries include feminism, photography, and the history of photography. Other materials on photography are found in the Sojourner Truth Subseries and the Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. Of interest is a work by Painter's mother, Dona Irvin, about the members of Downs Memorial United Methodist Church. The work focuses on the lives of middle-class African-Americans rather than prominent figures or the underprivileged. Here entitled The Downs People, it was published as The Unsung Heart of Black America: A Middle-class Church at Midcentury.
Materials in the Writings by Others Subseries are arranged alphabetically by surname.
Documents Painter's work with students and academic colleagues at Harvard University, Wellesley College, the Universities of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. Arranged in two subseries, Courses and Academic Files.
Contains syllabi, reading lists, class lectures, notes, class readings, notes, and some correspondence and miscellaneous other materials that Painter produced and gathered for courses she taught at Wellesley College, the Universities of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. Copies of class readings include both printed material and typescripts transcribed from archival materials and microfilm; some contain Painter's notes and interpretations in margins or attached pages. Arranged in chronological order by year.
Departmental correspondence and memoranda, meeting minutes, university and department forms and invoices, printed materials, files on students for whom Painter served as advisor or committee member, student writings, and other materials. Arranged alphabetically by institution (Harvard, Princeton, University of North Carolina, University of Pennsylvania, and Wellesley College), then chronologically within those groups. At the end of the series are several folder groups that span Painter's years in various positions, arranged alphabetically by topic. The largest of these are Applications and Job Searches, containing correspondence and other documents relating to various positions and fellowships she sought at different times; and Student Writings, containing various papers, theses, and dissertations written by Painter's students. Note that student files gathered here are mainly writings that were found unattached to correspondence and represent only a fraction of such material; the bulk of her extensive correspondence with her students, including discussion and copies of their research and writing, is in the Correspondence Series.
Documents Painter's activities in the broader academic community beyond her university of employment and her personal connections. Arranged in two subseries, Organizations and Engagements.
Collects materials from more than one hundred professional organizations, conferences, foundations, committees and task forces, and editorial boards of journals and publishers with which Painter has worked during her career. Subseries is particularly rich with information about the work of organizations and publishers in the fields of American and African American history, American studies, Southern history, and women's studies. Materials include chronological files, conference programs, correspondence, e-mail, financial information, meeting minutes, membership lists, panel proposals, printed materials, questionnaires and surveys, and a variety of peer review materials written by Painter and others (the last mainly for UNC Press, but also for other organizations and journals). Arranged alphabetically by organization, then chronologically under each name.
Documents relating to Painter's addresses, speeches, and honors at some three hundred conferences, meetings, and symposia over the course of three decades. Although drafts of some of these presentations appear here, most of the substantive drafts have been placed in the Writings and Research Series. This subseries is more a record of what topics she spoke on, what occasioned the event, and with what organizations she has interacted throughout her career. Arranged chronologically.
Contains information about Painter's personal life and, to a lesser extent, her family and her professional career. Materials include copies of her curricula vitae through the years; awards and honors; biographical citations about her from various reference works; clippings; appointment calendars and telephone logs; information about a number of family members, especially her parents; class notes and other documents from her student years abroad in Ghana and France; and over three dozen of her personal journals. By far, the journals are the most substantive item in the series in both richness and quantity of information. In more than five thousand manuscript pages Painter records details of her personal and professional life and her thoughts about her writing for almost thirty years, up to 1989; there then follows a gap of nine years before the journals resume in 1998, though in considerably less detail. Arranged alphabetically by category in the following folder groups: Biographical, Calendars and Contacts, Family and Friends, Journals, Student Years, and Other Personal Papers. Folders are then arranged chronologically in those categories with the exception of the alphabetical arrangements of Family and Friends and Other Personal Papers.
Journal for 1961 Dec. includes sketchbook. Journal for 1969-1970 includes photographs from 1963 and 1971.
Contains approximately 1000 black-and-white photographs, 1900 color photographs, 170 35mm slides, and several hundred negatives. Predominantly made up of reproductions Painter used as part of her research for various writings and a wide variety of original, personal snapshots. Arranged in three subseries related to major series in the main body of the collection: Writings and Research Images, Professional Service Images, and Personal Photographs and Negatives. In addition, there are also three format groups that have been separated from the three intellectual series and housed separately based on the archival needs of the materials in question: Large Prints,Negatives, and Photograph Albums.
Contains approximately 160 black-and-white photographs, nine color photographs, eight 35mm slides, and a few negatives. There are a few original photographs, most notably a carte-de-visite of Soujourner Truth, but the majority mainly consists of reproductions from various state archives and the Library of Congress that Painter used as part of her research fopr various writings. Much of the material appears to be research for Exodusters and, to a lesser extent, The Narrative of Hosea Hudson, but other writings are also represented. Arranged in chronological order. Prints 8x10 and larger are housed separately in flat boxes and follow the main list in a separate chronological sequence, with negatives for a few of the prints at the end of the subseries.
Processor's note: three contact sheets with no positive identification other than place, but posters of individual Greensboro Five members and the presence of armored vehicles in some photographs indicate that this is likely the funeral for victims of the riot of November 3, 1979. See also possibly related material under "Ku Klux Klan, Greensboro, 1979" in Writings and Research Series, Other Research Topics Subseries, Southern History Subgroup.
Contains approximately eleven black-and-white photographs, 125 color photographs, forty 35mm slides, and a few negatives from various of Painter's speaking engagements, conferences, and other professional trips. Arranged in chronological order. Prints 8x10 and larger are housed separately in flat boxes and follow the main list in a separate chronological sequence, with negatives for some of the snapshots at the end of the subseries.
Contains approximately 830 black-and-white photographs, 1730 color photographs, one hundred twenty-two 35mm slides, and many negatives. Consists mainly of personal snapshots taken by Painter and her family and friends. There are several early photographs of family members, including a 1914 print of her mother's family in Texas. After the late 1970s there are also a number of formal portraits and publicity photographs of Painter (noted as "NIP"). Arranged in two chronological sequences: additions to this subseries received in accession 2008-0016 were so extensive as to render impractical the virtual interfiling technique used throughout the rest of this finding aid. Therefore boxes 229-231 contain the personal photographs received in 2006 and earlier, and boxes 275-278 contain those received in 2008. Note that the more recently received group is not only larger but also covers a longer span of years, beginning earlier and ending later.
Image is adhered to glass; handle with care. Filed at the end of the box of folders.
Prints, mainly 8x10 inches, were separated from the three photographic materials subseries in order to provide flat storage. Some smaller related prints, especially older ones, are housed with these. For more information about intellectual content, consult the respective subseries notes above. Some materials were damaged by water.
Format group consisting of negatives generally related to the three photographic materials subseries. Many of the negatives were housed separately when received and cannot be matched item-for-item to the prints without extensive further work. For more information about intellectual content, consult the respective subseries notes above.
Albums contain images and ephemera documenting the personal lives of Painter and her family and friends. Some albums were disbound for preservation reasons; these are housed upright in the main subseries above, with their album source indicated as part of the folder title.
Audio and video recordings made by or about Painter, including interviews she conducted as part of research and interviews of her on various television programs. Arranged in two subseries by format: Audio Materials and Video Materials. Total running time (TRT) is shown in parentheses if known.
Contains mainly interviews, some conducted by Painter and some from other sources, and a few recordings of Painter's speaking engagements. Recording formats consist of reel to reel tapes, audiocassettes, and compact discs. Arranged chronologically within each format.
Contains tapes of Painter's speaking engagements, interviews of her on programs from C-SPAN and other sources, and various commercial or academic productions with which she was involved. Recording formats consist of VHS videocassettes and digital video discs (DVD). Arranged chronologically within each format.
Digital files, mostly unidentified beyond general categories. It is likely that most of this material is already represented in the collection in printed form. Consists mainly of correspondence and drafts of writings by Painter, including material associated with her books Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919 (1987), Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol (1996), and Creating Black Americans (2005). Arranged in order in which disks were received and numbered; disks 026-142, received in Accession 2008-0016, have been grouped by format, but otherwise arranged as received. Unnumbered diskettes may also appear in Accession 2010-0116, listed at the end of this inventory.
Various items removed from most of the major series in the main body of the collection to be housed separately. Arranged according to original series and subseries.
Awards and honorary degrees from American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Antiquarian Society, Dartmouth College, and others.
Contains correspondence, manuscripts, notebooks, and some photographs of Ghanaian novelist and poet Ayi Kwei Armah.

Collection comprises two letters (1864 January 3 and 1865 October 13) Phebe Ann Palmer wrote to unidentified recipients. Topics include the weather, health of family members, visitors and visiting, the local school teachers, the Clinton County Fair, the Civil War and its related deaths and sacrifices. She added at one point "I have told you all the gossip I know," and she writes at length about her thoughts and feelings regarding other people and situations.
The collection (01-108) (160 items, 1.2 linear feet; dated 1825-1970s) includes the family Bible; correspondence to and from members of the three families; graphic materials; printed material; poetry; and typescripts of essays regarding family members' daily lives and work as missionaries in China, Japan, and Africa. The families mentioned are ancestors of Olive Sherertz Lanham (Duke '43). Includes 2 color prints, 5 black-and-white prints, and 2 albumen prints.
The addition (01-146) (375 items, .6 linear feet; dated 1898-1977) contains letters; reports; diary entries; genealogical information; 1 videocassette; 2 black-and-white photographs, 1 black-and-white print, and 1 albumen print. There are also other items, chiefly relating to the Park, Lambuth, and Sherertz families' life and work in China and Japan.

The collection includes sixteen diaries (1849 Oct. 1 to 1872 Dec. 31) kept by Margaret Paton, beginning seven months after her marriage and continuing with little interruption for twenty-three years. She chiefly records her thoughts and moods, how she spends her days, and various events such as the marriages and deaths of persons she knows. Many entries include information about her husband's activities and to a lesser degree her relationship with him. While sometimes recording events of national significance, she primarily focuses on private life and events at a local level.
The John Paver Papers span the years 1920 through 1979, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1938 through the year 1971. The collection documents Paver's career in the outdoor advertising industry, especially his years as president of the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau (NOAB), and his work writing a textbook on the outdoor advertising medium. Series include the Biographical Files Series; Writings and Speeches Series; NOAB Files Series; Subject Files Series; Personal Files Series; Miscellaneous Files Series; Photographs, Negatives, and Slides Series; and Oversize Materials. Researchers interested in the following subjects may find this collection especially helpful: management in the advertising industry, more specifically the outdoor advertising industry; the outdoor medium itself; and traffic and advertising. Common formats in the collection include paper files such as correspondence, meeting minutes, writings, memoranda, printed materials; and photographic prints and negatives. The Resource for Outdoor Advertising Descriptions (ROAD) database, which holds searchable information about the images in this and other outdoor advertising collections will be available in early 2003.
Paver was instrumental in the establishment of standards for traffic measurement and, later, standards and the quality of billboards, topics all reflected in each of the collection's series, especially the Writings and Speeches Series, the NOAB Files Series, and the Subject Files Series. He pioneered research determining the relationship between traffic or habitual movement and trade activities. This work culminated in the publication, Traffic and Trade (McGraw-Hill, 1935), co-authored with research associate Dr. Miller McClintock, and in the founding of the industry authority for measuring outdoor advertising circulation, the Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB). His contributions in the area of window display (show windows) advertising, and, more generally, the outdoor medium are significant as well; all are documented within the collection. A large part of his career was spent in service to the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau before and after World War II; he led the organization for about seventeen years and became a prominent figure in the outdoor advertising industry. The papers document well Paver's work on an outdoor advertising textbook through draft copies and research materials. Through this activity, Paver grew to become a respected authority on poster and painted display advertising in the United States, and served as a speaker and consultant in the last years of his life. For more detailed information about Paver's life and career, see the Biographical Note above as well as the Biographical Files Series. All collection series are further described within the container list.
At the end of this finding aid is a list of publications removed from the collection and cataloged separately. Closely related collections in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library include the John Brennan Papers, the John Browning Papers, the Duplex Advertising Co. Records, the H.E. Fisk Collection of War Effort Mobilization Campaigns, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America Records, the Outdoor Advertising Poster Design Collection, the Outdoor Advertising Slide Library, the Garrett Orr Papers, the R.C. Maxwell Company Records, the Howard Scott Papers, and the Strobridge Lithography Company Photographs.

The Biographical Files Series (1942-1969) includes narratives typed and printed primarily for publication. Paver apparently wrote and rewrote the information in many different forms to suit individual purposes. Some documents include details of his work and military experience (U.S. Air Force), athletic experience, work performed for NOAB, as well as r√©sum√©s, and letters of congratulation and recommendation, including items from Miller McClintock, J. Walter Thompson advertising executive Norman Strouse, and others. A publicity file holds articles and other printed materials containing various blurbs about Paver.
(See also Legal Size and Oversize Materials)
The Writings and Speeches Series (1923-1972) contains a mix of document formats. Much of the correspondence, memoranda, printed materials, and other non-manuscript items are presumed to relate to the drafts with which they are foldered--probably as research materials. The majority of the items in this series are draft pieces of Paver's planned textbook on the outdoor advertising medium, mostly in holograph (handwritten) or typescript formats, although the book was never published. Book segment titles were distinguished or subjects were assigned to folders wherever possible. The series is divided into two subseries, Writings and Speeches by Paver, and Writings and Speeches by Others. Paver's materials are further subdivided into three groups: (1) files created for his textbook, (2) speeches by Paver, and (3) miscellaneous writings by Paver. Writings and Speeches by Others contains far fewer items, but has similar groupings within it. Photographic materials from this series and all others have been removed to the Photographs, Negatives, and Slides Series. Photocopies of most photographs were left in original order to preserve context.
Paver's textbook files are evidence of his efforts to create a comprehensive introduction and analysis of the outdoor medium. Folders with title- or subject-identified materials make up the initial alphabetical run. These are most often typescripts with holograph edits, but there are some holograph manuscripts as well. Included are long descriptions of both subjects and organizations such as "the advertising agency," the Advertising Council, the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau, the Traffic Audit Bureau, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Advertising Research Foundation, techniques of buying, art creation, writing advertising copy, market coverage, painted displays, public relations, and more general topics such as " Outdoor Advertising in the US."
The next alphabetical run within Paver's textbook files contains items comparable to the alphabetical by subject group, but is ordered by genre/book part. It includes portions Paver labeled as the appendix, illustrations, and more. There are traffic flow graphs and a glossary of industry terms helpful for the novice advertiser. In addition, there are outlines, questionnaire results, and a large number of manuscript fragments. Similar to the previous group, these files describe outdoor advertising in detail, but also highlight its importance in the world with fragments such as one titled, "Posters as a Visual Aid in Projecting America's Image to the World." Paver compared the medium to others, wrote about industry changes and outdoor advertising abroad, and discussed industry research.
Paver's speeches reveal his broad knowledge of the outdoor advertising industry; he spoke on the medium in general as well as on more specific topics like traffic measurement. This group of materials is evidence of his many speaking engagements in his home state of Texas, as well as abroad for the British Poster Advertising Association and the Outdoor Advertising Association of Australia. Paver also presented to organizations such as state outdoor advertising associations, and to smaller groups including a student women's advertising club. A number of the speeches were obviously connected to his work with the National Outdoor Advertising Bureau or were at least given during his employment there.
Miscellaneous writings by Paver, some going back to the beginnings of his advertising career, include files regarding his college thesis on transportation in Chicago, and Traffic and Trade Research Report, a work completed at Harvard, 1934. There is a broader picture of the man in drafts of his World War II experiences and family history.

Paver likely used these materials in his research and writings on the industry. Authors include advertising executives Norman Strouse and Kerwin Fulton. Topics such as advertising leasing, criticism and other problems facing the industry, advertising and war, NOAB, personnel, and European outdoor advertising are discussed. The files are primarily arranged alphabetically by author.
(See also Legal Size and Oversize Materials)
The National Outdoor Advertising Bureau (NOAB), ca. 1919-1970, the organization with which Paver is most closely associated, was created to help advertisers obtain recognition by billboard owners and to handle arrangements for outdoor advertising. These files date from 1925 through 1968. NOAB was a cooperative organization owned exclusively by the advertising agency members and helped them with all phases of an outdoor campaign. Paver assumed leadership of the agency in 1945, and by 1958 it placed over $70 million in contracts for painted displays, billboards, and other outdoor advertising. He directed the organization for about seventeen years, a time span reflected within the collection, but his time working for the NOAB Field Service Office in the late 1930s is also represented. The papers document his years of leadership through a variety of formats including minutes of NOAB's executive committee from 1950 through the time of his retirement. He represented NOAB through correspondence and multiple speaking engagements, serving often as a cheerleader promoting the industry. The series is arranged alphabetically by subject, revealing information about his travels abroad, contract and policy information, the industry's view of NOAB, Paver's specific duties, poster rates and evaluation, and work for Standard Oil. Particular attention is paid to the Traffic Audit Bureau (TAB) which Paver helped to establish and later defend. TAB became the industry's body to measure circulation of outdoor advertising and is still in existence. Included also are several manuals, some printed materials and other items about or related to NOAB.

The Subject Files Series (1920-1972) is arranged alphabetically by topic, proper name, or title, and contains a mix of formats including printed materials, writings, correspondence, and maps. Many folders appear to be collections of research materials for his writing, and all pertain to his professional activities although not always purely outdoor advertising. There are files relating to his window study performed in Allentown, Pa., traffic information for parts of his home state of Texas, auto safety and registration, his writing and publication plans, the "Bull Penn" professional organization, Canadian outdoor advertising, costs, advertising coverage, an international conference, Paver's traffic counting invention (Paver-Sills Traficounter), parking, Paver's work with research associate Leon Quera, awareness of outdoor advertising, regulation of the industry, billboard structure, traffic engineering and safety. Correspondents include the British Poster Advertising Association and other prominent industry figures such as Ben Egan, Karl Eller (Eller Media), and T. Walter Tyrrell.

The Personal Files Series (1943-1979) reveals a wide breadth of activity beyond Paver's professional duties. Materials document relationships with family members as well as connections to such organizations as the Freemasons, Paver's church, and the Chicago Athletic Association. Most prominent is documentation of his time spent raising orchids, including newsletters, photographs, and correspondence with the American Orchid Society.
(See also Legal Size and Oversize Materials)
The Miscellaneous Files Series contains additional materials for all of the previous series including speeches, professional correspondence, personal wartime correspondence, writings, printed materials, and clippings. These originally loose items were placed in unsorted folders for protection, but at the time of processing, resources were unavailable for item-level identification and sorting. Topics include outdoor advertising in the U.S. and abroad; traffic safety, circulation, and engineering; biographical materials; TAB, OAAA, and NOAB; military orders and service during WWII; outdoor advertising construction, product name recall, reach and frequency; costs; the "Bull Penn;" and orchids.
The Photographs, Negatives, and Slides Series (ca. 1920s-1970) contains over 300 items, pulled together from all other parts of the collection. A few photographs are from the 1920s, but the majority appear to have been taken in the 1950s and 1960s.They document a great deal of outdoor advertising mounted in that era, and also provide evidence of other areas of Paver's life such as his garden work. Most are undated (color or black and white) photographs of outdoor advertising, especially billboards, but there are also a large number of portraits of Paver from the 1940s and 1950s. Some photographs show advertising artwork and artists at work on large painted displays, and some seem to form part of an office presentation. Other photograph subjects include office workers demonstrating particular activities; business gatherings of various sorts; advertising in Paris and an Asian city (perhaps in Japan), and a wedding gathering. Around 40 photographs show Paver's pool area, where he worked with and displayed his collection of orchids.
More detailed information about all photographs, slides, and negatives were entered into the Resource for Outdoor Advertising Descriptions (ROAD) database which will be available in early 2003. The database has the following information fields: image number, dates, image type, product category, company, product/brand, headline, advertisement type, posting company, image color, rural or city scene, ethnicity of some individuals, presence of women/children, famous persons, city, state, non-advertisement type, and additional notes.

This collection of heterogeneous material, generally relating to the colonial period of Peru, falls roughly into three groups centering around commerce and industry, literary activity, and religious and social history. Several manuscripts in the first group contain information on the mining of mercury, 1786-1787. Literary materials include the poems of Caviedes in the seventeenth century script useful for correcting errors in the copies published by Ricardo Palma; a copy of iconoclastic and mysterious poems by Antonio de Sol√≠s; one cuaderno of the Documentos hist√≥ricos collected by Manuel de Odriozola; and three Documentos literarios from contemporary publications. Among the Items relating to religion and social history are a compilation of the papers of Peruvian viceroys and others, 1580-1818; an expediente concerning witchcraft and idolatry in Peru; original papers on the modernization of learning which Charles III attempted to impose upon the empire; copy of the proceso of Mariano Tupac Amaru; and a booklet, 1794, describing the founding and development of Quito, Ecuador.
Some of these Items, formerly the property of Manuel de Odriozola, the Peruvian literary historian who brought together this collection, are listed in the C√°talogo de la Biblioteca Peruana Propiedad de Dn. Francisco Perez de Velasco (Lima, 1918). Rub√©n Vargas Ugarte, S. J., describes some of these manuscripts in Manuscritos Peruanos en las Bibliotecas de Am√©rica (Buenos Aires, 1945, pp. 230-243) which is volume IV of his Biblioteca Peruana (Lima, 1935-). John Tate Lanning, James B. Duke Professor of History, also mentioned these manuscripts in his article "The Hispanic Collection" published in Gnomon, Essays for the Dedication of the William R. Perkins Library (Duke Unlversity, April 15 and 16, 1970).
This guide to the collection is the result of extensive recataloging in which, for the first time, considerable attention has been given to analyzing the content of the manuscripts. The descriptions of many of the manuscripts have been enlarged, and, in some cases, author and title information has been changed or refined. Many entries have been added to the card catalog based upon these new descriptions. Copies of these cards have been included in this guide in order to provide additional means of access to the contents of the collection.

A hypothetical dialogue between nature and her son.
Caracas, 1765-1770. 72 pages.
Petition, auto, and testimonials concerning the purity of race (limpieza de sangre) of Francisco Montero Bola√±os de los Reyes. Caracas, 1765-1770.
The purity of race (limpieza de sangre) was documented by testimonials demonstrating that the person was not a descendant of Moors, Jews, heretics, or penitenciados (persons punished by the Inquisition). This documentation was a prerequisite in Spain and its colonies in order to be admitted into a corporation, school or university, to practice a profession, or a trade, and to get married. A law of May 16, 1865, abolished this requirement for marriage and for admission into the public service, and it was definitively abolished by the 27th article of the 1869 Constitution, and the 15th article of the 1876 Constitution (in force).
This manuscript is an important source for the study of social or economic discrimination against racial or ethnic groups in Spain and its colonies till the end of the XIX century.
1787. 19 folios.

Reports appear throughout the year, and a summary of figures for the year is given.

This expediente contains two royal c√©dulas issued by Charles III and Charles IV, kings of Spain and the Indies. One c√©dula was issued on June 25, 1783, at Aranju√©z, and the other, on Oct. 9, 1789, at San Lorenzo del Real. In both c√©dulas, the Bishop of Trujillo in Peru, Don Baltasar J. Martinez Compa√±√≥n, is ordered not to relent on his work of converting the Indians into the Christian faith. This expediente also contains an edict of the Bishop and correspondence between him and others under his jurisdiction in relation to the same matter (ff. 1-10). This manuscript is notable because most of its contents are the original records of a trial for witchcraft and idolatry conducted against Salvador Bautista, Nicol√°s Bautista, Juli√°n Bautista, Margarita Chuquipul (Salvador's wife), Petrona Huilca (Nicol√°s's wife), and Mar√≠a Paysic. Ju√°n de Roxas, priest and vicar of the Doctrina of At√∫n Luya, was the acting judge and Blas de la Encidna was the acting notary (ff. 11-188). The trial began on Feb. 28, 1789, and the last record dated was July 9, 1790. It took place at the asiento of San Ju√°n de Lam√∫d, but the defendants were from San Pedro de Cuemal. Between March 3 and May 11, 1789, 55 witnesses were examined; they were relatives and neighbors of the defendants and almost all of them certified their depositions (ff. 15-120). Confessions were taken from the defendants (ff. 120-150), and the prosecution and the defense presented their petitions (ff. 151-156). The sentence was pronounced on June 3, 1789 (ff. 157-158). The Royal Justice sentenced Salvador and Nicol√°s Bautista and Maria Pays√≠c to be whipped through the streets over a packsaddle, with a coronet on their heads and their backs naked. Petrona Huilca, Margarita Chuquipul, and Juli√°n Bautista were sentenced to be feathered, to wear a coronet on their heads, and to serve as shield-bearers of the other offenders, their punishment being left to the discretion of the executioner. While the sentence was publicly performed, all the idols and instruments used by the defendants in their rites were thrown into a bonfire. Immediately they were expatriated to the Province of Caxamarca, confined to a house of correction in perpetuity, and obliged to do hard work with rations but without salary for a landowner who would provide them with the necessary prisons until their death. Their houses were demolished and exorcised, and great crosses were placed on the lots and on the caves, rocks, and temples they had used for their rites.
The expediente includes the estimates of the cost of the trial (f. 165), the inventory, valuation, and the sale by public auction of the properties of Salvador and Nicol√°s Bautista (ff. 166-184), as well as the accounts of the trustees, with credits and debits (ff. 185-188).
Lima, Per√∫, 1780-1783. 372 folios.
Typescript from the original in a volume of Manuscritos varios desposited in the Archivo Nacional del Per√∫, containing testimonies on the trial for relapse into rebellion, against Mariano Tupac Amaru and Andr√©s Mendigure, son and nephew of Jos√© Gabriel T√∫pac Amaru, leader of the Indian insurrection against the Spaniards in Per√∫ during 1780-1781. These testimonies are not a complete record of the trial. They are divided into six cuadernos and one expediente with a total of 372 consecutive folios. The half title is Rebeli√≥n de T√∫pac Amaro. Tomo. I. The cuadernos contain correspondence between the Viceroy Agust√≠n Jaureaui, the Bishop of Cuzco, members of the T√∫pac Amaru family, and other civilian, military and religious dignataries, in relation to the T√∫pac Amaru Insurrection. The cuadernos also contain depositions of witnesses on the trial against Mariano T√∫pac Amaru and Andr√©s Mendigure. The expediente contains the claims of Jos√© Antonio Escale, Relator de la Real Sala del Crimen, and Clemente Castellanos, Escribano of the same court, requesting to be paid for their work on the trial against Mariano T√∫pac Amaru and Andr√©s Mendigure. T√∫pac Amaru and Mendigure were sentenced to expartiation in Spain, the first died during the trip, and Mendigure perished in a shipwreck off the coast of Portugal. For further information see: La rebeli√≥n de T√∫pac Amaru by Daniel Valc√°rcel Esparza, Mexico, 1947 (p. 167-168).
Lima Per√∫, 1780-1783. 364 p., 249-333 p.

Transcripts of a collection of 19 letters, 1547-1548, written during the rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro in Per√∫ (1546-1548) by Pedro de la Gasca (1493-1567), Gonzalo Pizarro (1502-1548), Philip II (1527-1598) as Prince, Lorenzo de Albana (d. 1571), and Diego Cepeda (d. 1550). These letters were transcribed in a very legible hand and are related to Gonzalo Pizarro's rebellion that ended with his defeat and execution as a traitor to King Charles V by Pedro de la Gasca at Xaquixaguana, Per√∫, on April 10, 1548.
Per√∫, 1849-1857. 103 folios.
Selections of poetry assembled by Odriozola consisting chiefly of sonnets, several lyrics, and some burlesque forms. This volume includes: a sonnet of the Spanish poet Francisco de Miranda y Veng√≥a (d. 1857); some poems published by El Comercio (1845) and signed by Z., apparently the pseudonym of the Peruvian poet Felipe de Pardo y Aliaga (1806-1868); a short story published by La Bolsa (1841) and written by Manuel Ascencio Segura (1805-1871), another Peruvian author; a poem of the famous Colombian poet Rafael Pombo (1833-1912) published at Lima by El Heraldo on Jan. 5, 1856, under the pseudonym Edda, and some other poems written by unknown writers.
Per√∫, 1837. 56 ff., [1] f., index.
This volume also includes: some poems of Felipe Pardo Aliaga (1806-1868); a short poem adapted to music (letrilla) written by Manuel Ascencio Segura (1805-1871); a ballad by an anonymous author; and a poem of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Larriva (1780-1832).
Manuscript 7a does not have Odriozola's name on it. It is attributed to him by Perez de Velasco in his Catalogo de la Biblioteca Peruana (p. 141). In addition, the handwriting of No. 7a is similiar to that in No. 7 and in other manuscripts that have Odriozola's name as their compiler.
Per√∫. ff. 24-54, [1] f., index.
The majority of the poems in this volume were transcribed from the initial issues of El Mercurio Peruano (1791). Included are copies of d√©cimas (a Spanish stanza consisting of ten verses of eight syllables), one octava (a poetical composition of eight lines of eleven syllables) written by the Peruvian poet F. M. Miranda at Trujillo, Per√∫, in Feb., 1836, letters between Heloise and Abelard, and a few poetical works by unknown writers.
Manuscript 7b does not have Odriozola's name on it. It is attributed to him by Perez de Velasco in his Catalogo de la Biblioteca Peruana (p. 141). In addition, the handwriting of No. 7b is similar to that in No. 7 and in other manuscripts that have Odriozola's name as their compiler.

Names of the owners or shippers of the goods, dates of registration, names of the ships, descriptions of the goods, ports of destination, names of the persons to whom the goods are sent, numbers of the invoices and the value of the goods are specified. The first pages include an index by the first name of the shippers. On the last two pages of the volume there is a summary of the invoices included in this book with an estimate of the value of the goods. This manuscript is an important source of information on commerce and shipping in Per√∫ during 1774.
Lima, 1777-1779. 15 folios.
Account book of the payments that D. Pasqual Antonio Monzon made from the funds of Penas de C√°mara to cover the Gastos de Justicia. Penas de C√°mara were the pecuniary penalties or fines imposed by the judges and the courts. These funds were deposited in the Royal Treasury. Gastos de Justicia were the expenditures incurred by the different activities of the Administration of Justice and were paid from the funds of the Penas de C√°mara.
This original manuscript includes the names of the persons who received the payments for services to assist the Administration of Justice and the decrees and sentences that ordered the payments. The records date between Aug., 1777, and Nov., 1779, at Lima, Per√∫.
Per√∫, 1564-1718. Bound, 1821. [19], 283 folios.
This volume contains r√©sum√©s of capellan√≠as in Per√∫ examined since 1680, the year in which the Licenciado Don Francisco de Xauregui was appointed Visitador de Capellan√≠as. The capellan√≠a, or chaplaincy, was capital, the interest of which was required by Spanish law for the support of an ecclesiastic whose duties were to celebrate masses and to perform other pious obligations. The r√©sum√©s include information about the nature, purposes, and duties imposed by the founders of the capellan√≠as, the persons that possessed them in full right or on an interim basis, and the patrons responsible for the appointments. The capellan√≠as described in this prontuario were founded between 1564 (f. 120) and 1683 (f. 211). Notations added to the original r√©sum√©s date as late as 1718 (f. 231).
One of the common watermarks on the paper resembles watermarks illustrated in Edward Heawood, Watermarks Mainly of the 17th and 18th Centuries(Hilversum, Holland, 1957)
, Pl. 114-119. These watermarks date between 1665 and 1766, and it is reasonable to assume that this paper was manufactured and used during this period.
The dates of the capellan√≠as and the notations about them and the dating of the watermarks all indicate that the documents bound in this volume date from the late 17th century and early 18th century.
This volume was ordered to be bound in 1821 by Presbitero Tom√°s Florez, Archivero de la Curia Eclesiastica and Colector del Donativo Eclesiastico Voluntario. This event was apparently provoked by changes in the Spanish law that prohibited the foundation of new capellan√≠as and ordered the incorporation of their properties to the government treasury during 1820 and 1821. This legislation was cancelled in 1823.
Lircay River, near Talca, Chile. Copy, ca. 1814. 3 pages.
The agreement was reached the 3rd of May, 1814, on the banks of the Lircay River near the city of Talca. It was signed by the general in chief of the national army, Brigadier Gabino Gainza and the principal chiefs of the army of the government of Chile, Generals Bernardo O'Higgins and Juan Mackenna. In this agreement Chile offered to send deputies to the Cortes as its representatives, and as an integral part of the Spanish monarchy; to recognize Ferdinand VII as its monarch, and the Regency that approved the Junta of Chile, that will act as interior government with all its power and faculties. Chile would have free commerce with the allied and the neutral nations, especially with Great Britain. The royalist army would evacuate Chilean territory, ending the hostilities; and properties confiscated after February of 1810 would be restored.
Don Jos√© Abascal, Viceroy of Per√∫, disapproved the agreement and sent to Chile another expedition in July, 1814, that undertook the campaign that ended with the Battle of Rancagua, retaining Chile under Spanish domain till 1824.
The paper on which the agreement is written was made in Capellades, Catalonia, Spain, by the Almirall family who produced paper there for a long period of time. Three examples of their work are illustrated and discussed in Oriol Valls I Subir√†, Paper and Watermarks in Catalonia(Amsterdam, 1970)
, Vol. I, plates 2-3, and Vol. II, p. 238. All the examples date during 1804-1824, and those of 1807 and 1809 most closely resemble the watermarks on the manuscript. These facts suggest that the paper on which this copy of the agreement is written and the copy itself are reasonably contemporary with the signing of the agreement in 1814. This copy of the agreement differs from the one published in the second volume of Archivo de don Bernardo O'Higgins (Santiago de Chile, 1947), pp. 156-159. Some words are missing, and others are written with misspellings common in South America during that period, for example the signatures of O'Higgins and Mackenna.
n.p., ca. 1821-1822. [94] pages.
This manuscript was written to be delivered into the hands of Jos√© de San Martin, as is stated in its first page. It is a geographic description of the Department of Lambayeque, Per√∫. It includes information on towns, population, courts, buildings, and describes the political, military, and ecelesiastieal organizations together with the eeonomie conditions of the department.
San Martin proclaimed the independence of Per√∫ on July 28, 1821, assuming the title of Protector. He held the protectorship and military command until September, 1822, when he resigned and relinguished power to the new Peruvian Congress. These facts suggest that this description was written during the period of the protectorship and is either an original or a copy contemporary with the years 1821-1822.

Fr. Manuel Gil was the leader of this Franciscan missionary expedition to Manoa in El Dorado territory where the Indians were revolting during the year 1767. He had a name similar to the eminent Jesuit mathematician and physicist Manuel Gervasio Gil (1745-1807), who, according to information from Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada(Espasa-Calpe, S.A., Madrid, 1925)
 Vol. XXVI, p. 34, was at R√≠o de la Plata and was expelled together with other Jesuits to Italy during 1767. Considering the distance between Lima and R√≠o de la Plata and the fact that one was a Franciscan and the other a Jesuit, it is difficult to believe that it was the same person. The information about the Indians' revolt in Manoa and the difficulties suffered by the members of the missionary expedition, including a list of the missionaries and Christian Indians killed during the revolt make this manuscript copy an important one (see folio [6]).
Madrid, Spain, 1797. Copy, [2] folios.
Manuscript copy of the memorandum sent to Manuel Godoy (1767-1851), Prince of the Peace, and Prime Minister of Spain, on April 25, 1797, by Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon (1754-1818), French Ambassador in Spain. Contains an inquiry relative to a naval engagement between English and Spanish warships, and expresses the opinion of the French Directory censuring the conduct of the Spanish warships for not fighting the English warships during that naval engagement, and requesting the punishment of those responsible.

It includes: sacred vestments, engraved silver, relics, linen, images, bells, books of anthems, precious stones set in gold or silver, and goods and ornaments of the chapels of Santa Ana and Santa Isabel in that church. There is a note at the end explaining that the inventory of the goods and ornaments of the altar of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Antigua is not included because they are the property of the University of San Marcos. The University uses that altar to deliver the major degrees in public ceremony. The inventories were finished on Jan. 20, 1797, and signed by Marcos de Andrade.

The undated original of this typescript is contained in a volume of Manuscritos varios at the Archivo Nacional del Per√∫. There are 104 poems written in serveral forms, including sonnets and ballads.
Sol√≠s, a Spanish dramatist and historian, studied law at Salamanca, and in 1654 was appointed Secretary of State as well as Private Secretary to Philip IV of Spain. Later he obtained the lucrative post of Chronicler of the Indies. His Historia de la Conquista de M√©jico, deservedly ranks as a Spanish prose classic. It was published in 1684; an English translation by Townshend appeared in 1724.
Lima, Per√∫, Feb. 5, 1863. 3 pages.
Typewritten copy of the message sent to the Extraordinary Congress of 1863 by Miguel de San Rom√°n, President of Per√∫, together with the budget proposal submitted to that Congress for its approval on Feb. 5, 1863.

It is a report of his government in the last five years (1845-1850), and an acknowledgement to the Congress of its collaboration. After Per√∫ became a Republic in 1820, Castilla was the first president to complete his first term in government without an insurrection against him. He is considered by historians the most influential political figure in Per√∫ during the 19th century.
Lima, Per√∫, July 28, 1872. 4 pages.

Zevallos, First Vice-President of Per√∫, when by constitutional mandate he became President of Per√∫ following the assassination of President Jos√© Balta Montero (1814-1872).

Siglo XVII. 289 ff.
Ju√°n del Valle y Caviedes was the first satirical poet in Per√∫.
According to the typed memorandum of F. P√©rez de Velasco, dated Lima, March 26, 1908, that is in the front of this volume, Ricardo Palma brought out a later edition of the poetry of Ju√°n del Valle y Caviedes based on a manuscript copy from the library of Cipriano Coronel Zegarra. The manuscript copy, here in the Peruvian Collection, written at the second half of the 17th century, of the poems of Caviedes was very useful for correcting errors in the copies published by Ricardo Palma. It includes more than sixty unpublished sonnets and many other unedited poems of Caviedes. Copies of his poems are preceded by an incomplete poem of an unknown author. The table of contents is incomplete, but there are two typed copies that include all the titles of the poems in the manuscript.
According to a bibliographical note of the Peruvian literary historian Rub√©n Vargas Ugarte on page xxi of vol. I of his collection Clasicos Peruanos entitled Obras de Don Ju√°n del Valle y Caviedes(Lima, 1947)
, this is the oldest ant complete manuscript consulted, and he used it as a guide for the compilation of the complete works of the poet. The watermarks on the paper resemble watermarks illustrated in Edward Heawood, Watermarks Mainly of the 17th and 18th Centuries(Hilversum, Holland, 1975), Pl. 114-119, used on paper manufactured between 1665 and 1766, and it is reasonable to assume, as P√©rez de Velasco did in his typed memorandum, that this manuscript was written at the end of the 17th century.
Caviedes, known as the riverbank poet, (el poeta de la ribera), revealed in his poems a profound rancor against physicians, but his ingenuous and burlesque versification was simple and unaffected, without any trace of " gongorismo," a lofty style of writing commonly used by poets during that period.
A√±os de 1772 a 1773. 1014 pages.
The Concilio Provincial is an assembly of the clergy of an ecclesiastical province gathered to deliberate upon points of doctrine and discipline of the Catholic religion. The decisions approved by these councils are an important source of canon law in the Catholic Church. This manuscript of more than 1,000 pages contains 49 opinions handed down by the consultants that participated in the Concilio Provincial that took place in Lima, Per√∫, during 1772-1773. This was the last Concilio that took place in Lima under the Spanish rule. The Archbishopric of Lima was highly interested in obtaining this manuscript from the owners of the P√©rez de Velasco collection to whom they made a very substantial offer. This manuscript is an excellent source of information for researchers interested in the study of the history of the Catholic Church in Spanish America, and of the treatment given to the Indians by the Catholic Church during the colonial period.
The record of proceedings and resolutions of this Concilio were published by Rub√©n Vargas Ugarte in volume II of Concilios Limenses (1551-1772),Lima, 1952.
 The same author published in 1945, Manuscritos Peruanos en las Bibliotecas Am√©rica in which he describes, in a summary form, the opinions expressed in this manuscript. Also included are the names of the consultants and the subjects treated in the opinions above mentioned. (See pp.237-240).

The newspaper clippings include: a Memoria about the Chilean National Navy read at the University of Chile by Don Antonio Garcia Reyes on Oct. 11, 1846; a royal c√©dula of Sept. 15, 1802, granting royal priviledges to the city of Lima; a biography of General Jos√© de San Martin; a letter from San Martin to Bolivar granting him the direction of the war in Per√∫; and a Letrilla of the Peruvian poet and politician Felipe Pardo y Aliaga (1806-1868). Odriozola assembled this volume between July 27, 1855, and June 1, 1859. An index is included at the end of the volume.

President Obregoso gave the copy as a present to Juan Gualberto Valdivia, a Peruvian priest and historian.
The woodcut of a genealogical tree of an unknown family, also found carved in a piece of wood, was given to Valdivia by Obregoso.
The collection is composed of 33 pocket diaries Parker Pillsbury kept for the years 1864 to 1896. The diaries contain a consistent, uninterrupted record of Pillsbury's life during these years.
Pillsbury wrote daily or nearly daily about the details of his life recording both the mundane and the profound. A typical entry begins with the weather and his location before providing the names of those with whom he met or correspondeded that day, events he attended, lectures he gave, or work he did. Pillsbury writes about his interactions with William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Abby Kelley and Stephen S. Foster, Gerrit Smith, Wendell Phillips, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, the Allcott family, Robert Ingersoll, Charles Sumner, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton and many other leading social reformers of the nineteenth century. His entries are occasionally accompanied by tipped in newspaper clippings about national events.
Due to their consistency and span, the diaries provide a decades' long chronology of Pillsbury's involvement with and importance in the major social reform movements of the late nineteenth century, and in particular, the women's rights movement with which he closely associated during these years. The diaries show him to be a ceaseless traveler, moving up and down the east coast, throughout New England, and through western New York and the Midwest, as he lectured, preached, attended women's suffrage conventions, and otherwise attempted to advance the causes of equal rights for women and African Americans and Free Religion.
The diaries illustrate his close and sustained relationship with major figures in the women's rights movements. He writes of his work as joint editor with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony of the Revolution from 1867 to 1870, and his continued friendship and partnership with Anthony in the following decades. He often visited her in Rochester, they lectured together, and he served as her advisor when she was put on trial in Albany by the State Supreme Court for voting without the right to do so.
Robert C. Poindexter (d. 1885) was a merchant in eastern Yadkin County for many years. His general store at East Bend was listed in Branson's North Carolina Business Directory for 1867, 1869, 1872, and 1884. He and his store are also mentioned in William E. Rutledge, Jr.'s, An Illustrated History of Yadkin County (Yadkinville, 1965) in the section on East Bend. In 1857 Poindexter was listed in D. D. T. Leech's Post Office Directory as the postmaster at Red Plains.
Three account books, 1836-1860, are from Poindexter's mercantile businesses. At least two different partnerships are represented. There are some uncertainties about the exact locations and number of his stores. These ambiguities and the difficulties in identifying the volumes will require some explanation. All of the business activity took place in the eastern section of Yadkin County, the area of East Bend in the northeast, Huntsville in the southeast, and Red Plains in between. Red Plains, a locality no longer in existence, was close to present-day Enon (Rutledge, P. 77).
The earliest account book has two distinct sections. It was first used as Daybook, 1836, for a general store at Huntsville. The entries (135 pp.) date during January 22-September 20, 1836. The ownership of this store is not known. Notable customers included Col. Richard C. Puryear, Isaac Jarratt, and Thomas L. Clingman. The Clingmans, Poindexters, Puryears, and Jarratts were related, and all figure in this collection and also in the Jarratt-Puryear Family Papers. Tyre Glen was a customer, and this department also has a collection of his papers. There was a post office in the store, for there are many entries for postage. At that time Richard C. Puryear was postmaster at Huntsville.
The account book that includes the Daybook, 1836, was subsequently used as the Ledger, 1843-1848 (353 pp.), by the mercantile firm of Poindexter and Martin whose ownership has been identified through various notations. The initials P and M appear on the spine of the volume. An account on pp. 334-335 is labeled Poindexter and Martin Bills. This account was continued from pp. 30-31 where it was labeled R. C. Poindexter and T. S. Martin. The first entry in their account was on Nov. 1, 1843, for a large amount of goods purchased from P and P according to an inventory. The Ledger's accounts begin in Nov., 1843, so that it is clear that Poindexter and Martin began business in that month, probably as the successor of an earlier firm named P and P. A note was given to J. H. P. for a large sum, so one of the earlier owners was probably J. H. Palmer. Various accounts have entries for settlements with P and M (pp. 37, 38) and T. S. M. (pp. 33, 46, etc.). Poindexter worked in the store, for his account (p. 303) contains entries for annual wages.
The location of the general store represented by the Ledger, 1843-1848, is unclear. It was not at Huntsville, for there are too many scattered entries such as cr. by charging on Books at Huntsville, Cr. by Cash at Huntsville, settled at Huntsville, etc. (pp. 117, 148, 178, 184, 195, 218, 244, etc.). These entries also suggest that the firm did have a store at Huntsville. Robert C. Poindexter eventually had a store at East Bend. However, this ledger was not kept at East Bend. That town did not have a post office until 1849, and numerous entries in many accounts show that the store included a post office. There are extensive accounts for Richard C. Puryear, Isaac Jarratt, and Tyre Glen.
Poindexter and Martin opened a new ledger in 1847, for many accounts were noted as continued there (pp. 65, 147, etc.). Some accounts in the Ledger, 1843-1848, remained active into 1848. Thereafter, later entries as late as 1855 were usually settlements of inactive accounts not continued into the later ledger.
The mercantile firm of A. P. and R. C. Poindexter had a general store at Red Plains, a village near Enon. The Daybook, 1857-1858, belonged to that store. Many pages are labeled Red Plains. Identification of the store's and the volume's owners is supplied by a bill of 1856-1857 filed in the Financial Papers. The bill is a statement for purchases made by John D. Hedgcock and William Hedgcock at Red Plains from A. P. and R. C. Poindexter. The transaction for May 2, 1857, on the bill is also entered in the Daybook. The entries (66 pp.) in the Daybook date from April 30, 1857, to March 26, 1858.
On Sept. 26, 1860, the partnership of A. P. and R. C. Poindexter was dissolved, and the Daybook includes an account (4 pp.) for the division of property.
The back pages of the Daybook were used, probably by R. C. Poindexter, to record other financial matters. There are 10 1/2 pages, 1862-1863, of alphabetical lists of names followed by three columns for recording numbers of persons in the family, pounds, and value. These pages also include a short account for the receipt of large quantities of salt. It is apparent that these lists are for the distribution and rationing of salt. Salt was scarce, and the state set up factories, purchased salt, and sold it to the people. These accounts may relate to that effort. Since the number of persons in each family is recorded, these lists serve as a partial census. Unfortunately, many pages are missing. The Financial Papers also include a salt distribution list.
Another list (7 pp.) in the Daybook includes columns for names, acreage, location of acreage, and value. This list was apparently for taxation. The Financial Papers include a notice of March 20, 1863, that R. C. Poindexter and two others were appointed assessors for East Bend District for the listing of lands and slaves. Thus, this list is an informal tax list. Unfortunately, many pages are missing. Presumably this list dates from 1863 or later, and tax lists are unavailable for Yadkin County during 1863-1872 according to Draughon and Johnson's North Carolina Genealogical Reference (p. 452).
The Ledger, 1850-1860 (557 pp.), is identified as belonging to A. P. and R. C. Poindexter, because entries can be traced into it from their Daybook, 1857-1858. An example is a purchase by A. P. Poindexter that was entered in the Daybook on June 2, 1857, and later carried to his account in the Ledger (p. 542). However, the Ledger's account for Poindexter includes many transactions that are not in this Daybook from Red Plains. This circumstance and references in the Ledger to East Bend suggest that the firm had stores in more than one place - Red Plains, East Bend, and perhaps elsewhere. There are numerous references such as: cr. by work at East Bend and here (p. 364); Amount on Book kept by R. C. P. at East Bend (p. 488); cr. by work at East Bend (p. 450); cr. by settlement, this and our East Bend book (p. 541); etc. (pp. 427, 437, 478).
The location at which the Ledger was kept is not certain except that it was not at East Bend. The location may have been Red Plains. R. C. Poindexter was postmaster there in 1857, and his account in the Ledger was quite active then. There are references (p. 542) to transactions at Huntsville and at Yadkinville, so the Ledger was not kept at either of those places. Of course, the Ledger may have been a central one into which the business of more than one store was entered, and that would make its location difficult to determine. Accounts for R. C. Puryear, Isaac Jarratt, and Tyre Glen are not prominent in this volume.
The Ledger, 1850-1860, was begun in 1850 with many accounts continued from an Old Book. Thus, the firm existed before 1850 and had at least one earlier ledger. The accounts indicate that the store's activity ceased by early 1858. Later entries are for settlements of accounts. No accounts were marked as continued in a later ledger. This situation squares with the 1860 account in the Daybook, 1857-1858, for the dissolution of the partnership.
Transactions for postage (pp. 425, 426, 454) are rare unlike the situation in the Ledger, 1843-1848. Either the post office was not in the store, or other books were kept for postal matters.
The nine items, 1856-1871 and undated, in the Financial Papers include stray accounts for the stores, a salt distribution and rationing list of ca. 1862-1863, the notice of R. C. Poindexter's appointment as an assessor, etc.
The Miscellany includes 19 small squares of colored cotton cloth that were found between pages 387-388 of the Ledger, 1850-1860. The fabric was probably of a type used for dresses. There are six different designs. The designs are printed rather than woven. The fabric is in excellent condition. Its age is uncertain.
The Printed Material contains a clipping of 1852 with an advertisement for the Statesville Female Academy.
1 vol. added, 10-28-83. This volume is A. P. and R. C. Poindexter's Ledger, 1848-1850, from their general store. Accounts in this ledger, referred to as the old book, are marked as continued in the new book which is their Ledger, 1850-1860, that was cataloged earlier as part of this collection. Entries can be traced from the older book into the newer one. Since Ledger, 1848-1850 (172 pp.), opens many accounts in Sept., 1848, without any references to an earlier ledger, that date must have been the start of this partnership, the earlier one having been Poindexter and Martin. A. P. and R. C. Poindexter began a new ledger in 1850, but they continued to use the old one for some accounts. For that reason Ledger, 1848-1850, includes some later transactions as well as settlements of accounts. The primary use of the volume, however, occurred during 1848-1850. A. P. and R. C. Poindexter's names appear in this volume (p. 83, page before p. 1, etc.) as recipients of payments. The pages after p. 165 are missing. There are accounts for Isaac Jarratt and Tyre Glen. Postage payments are very scattered. Customers paid their bills not only with money and promissory notes but also with goods and services.
This collection consists of 49 color inkjet prints from the documentary project Test of Faith by photographer Lauren Pond. The images measure approximately 20x14 inches and are unmatted. Between 2011 and 2016, Pond documented the life, death, and West Virginian family of Pentecostal pastor and serpent handler, Mack Wolford, of the Full Gospel Apostolic House of the Lord Jesus in Matoaka, West Virginia. The series includes images of Wolford's death in his family home after he was bitten by the venomous snake.
In an artist's statement, Pond writes: "Serpent handlers, also known as Signs Followers, belong to a small Appalachian Pentecostal Holiness sect that holds a literal interpretation of the King James Bible's Mark 16:17-18. This passage describes the 'signs' of true believers, including the ability to 'take up serpents.' Believing in absolute obedience to God's Word, Signs Followers handle venomous snakes during their worship services. If bitten, they generally do not seek medical treatment, and instead, entrust their fate to God."
"Seeking a deeper understanding of serpent handlers and their faith, in 2011, Lauren traveled to West Virginia and met Mack, who invited her to document both his worship services and daily life. The course of her work changed dramatically in 2012, when she attended a worship service where Mack was fatally bitten by a rattlesnake. Through her images, Lauren illustrates her relationship with Mack and his family, the challenging experiences they have shared, and the insights these have given her into the tenets of the Signs Following faith ‚Äì namely, forgiveness and renewal."

Papers of the Pope and Carter families contain the letters, 1900-1939, of William Rivers Pope, officer in the United States Army, including a few letters dealing with his service in the Philippines, 1900-1901, and a large number of letters concerning his experiences in France in World War I from June, 1918, to June,1919, as commander of the 113th Infantry Regiment in the Meuse-Argonne offensive and commander of the military police in the area of the American Embarcation Center, LeMans, France.
World War I letters comment on the overall war effort, the peace, characteristics of soldiers, the role of the Negro soldier in the war, and the people and countryside of France. Letters, 1919-1939, deal for the most part with personal and family matters and refer to a few events of Pope's later military career, particularly his part in the stratosphere flight sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Army Air Corps, 1934-1935.
The collection also contains letters, 1818-1821, to Dr. Benjamin Carter (1792-1865), a physician in Tennessee, from his brother John Conyers Carter (1793-1828), a lawyer in Camden, South Carolina, concerning family and professional matters, the panic of 1819 and other economic and political issues, internal improvements, and problems of the judicial system in South Carolina; and letters, 1831-1834, from his cousin John Carter, a lawyer and former congressman, pertaining to family affairs and life in Camden. Letters from members of the Clark family in Columbus, Mississippi, to members of the Pope family in Tennessee, 1827-1834, describe working on steamboats on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, mercantile business in Columbus, and trading with the Choctaw Indians.
Correspondence, 1833-1834, between Gustavus Adolphus Pope in Mississippi and his family in Tennessee concerns the agricultural situation, prices for cotton and other crops, public land policy, and attitudes on slavery and religion. Correspondence, 1836-1855, among members of the family of William Rouse Pope, including Lesey Jane (Webster) Pope and William Leonidas Pope, concerns the settling of estates, family matters, and the prospects for settling in Texas, including farming conditions, opportunities for employment, land transfers, and social and religious life, Letters, 1853-1865, of Sarah Myra (Rodes) Rivers Trotter to her daughter, Cynthia (Rivers) Carter, discuss family gossip, travels, homemaking concerns, social events, and the impact of the Civil War. Other Civil War letters include those of Benjamin Franklin Carter to his wife, Cynthia (Rivers) Carter, and the letters of William Leonidas Pope and Gustavus Adolphus Pope.
Writings include a manuscript entitled "Recollections of the [Civil] War," by Cynthia (Rivers) Carter, 1899; "History of the Military Police Corps, American Embarcation Center, A. E. F.," 1919; and "Brief History of the Twenty-Ninth Division, 1921." Legal papers, 1796-1892, pertain mainly to the Carter family and contain land grants, deeds, indentures for land, wills, court decisions, and court authorizations for the sale of slaves.
Financial papers, 1791-1868, relate for the most part to the affairs of the Pope family in the 1820s and 1830s and include accounts, promissory notes, tax receipts, and receipts for purchases. Genealogical material in the collection includes Cynthia (Rivers) Carter's account of the family of her grandfather, Tyree Rodes, and a few items concerning the genealogy of slaves owned by the Carter family. Clippings, 1934-1935, pertain to the military career of William Rivers Pope, as do the newspapers and other printed material.
Volumes include the notebook of Dr. Benjamin Carter, 1827, mainly concerning money owed him; two account books, 1834-1837 and 1836-1845, of William Rouse Pope, and one account book, 1851-1876, of Gustavus A. Pope; diary and memorandum book of James R. Pope, containing an account of his participation in the battle of Shiloh, 1862; anonymous notebook, 1873-1900, containing copies of legal documents; publications; and maps of various areas of France, including LeMans, the MeuseArgonne, and Verdun.
Collection includes family correspondence between Pope, his wife, and extended family, reporting on local news and family health. There is a small amount of financial materials, including receipts, insurance policies, unemployment statements, and other documentation about the Popes' finances. Also includes some official correspondence between Pope and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf from the 1920s and 1930s.
Porter Advertising Billboard Sketches date between the 1950s and 1970s and document the company's poster designs for a wide range of businesses in the region around Richmond, Indiana.

The photographic work of Tom Rankin in this collection consists of 147 black-and-white and color photographs documenting the American South and China. Southern photographs were taken from 1980 to 2007, and focus on religious sites, rituals, and communities in the Mississippi Delta region; these prints form the largest series, "Sacred Space." Another body of work features portraits of Mississippi writer Larry Brown. A third body of work, "Portraits from the American South," offers views of Southern people, cultures, and landscapes in both color and black-and-white.
An additional documentary project from 2016 took Rankin to China, where he photographed semi-rural landscapes, often taken with high-rise buildings in the far distance or adjacent to industrial structures, as well as bridges and rivers, markets and live fish vendors, and a few street scenes.
Print sizes range from 11x14, 13x19, 16x20, and 20x24 inches, with many housed in window mats. Along with these prints, there are also 8x11 inch black-and-white matted contact prints. All titles were created by the photographer.
Selected photographs from this collection have been exhibited at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke and other locations. A selection of Rankin's photographs was published in a book, Sacred Space: Photographs from the Mississippi Delta (1993).
Supporting materials in this collection include a digital audio recording of a talk by Rankin at the exhibit opening of work from the Sacred Space series, "Near the Cross: Photographs from the Mississippi Delta," as well as paper records related to his career and art practice, including book publications and book layouts. Also in the collection are two motion films, Dance Like a River (1985), directed by Barry Dorfeld and Tom Rankin, and Four Women Artists (1977), directed by Bill Ferris.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.

This body of work comprises 62 black-and-white prints that document and reflect on spiritual and religious practices in the rural Mississippi Delta region of the Southern United States, with a focus on churches, pastors and congregations, cemetery sites, and baptisms. Selected images were published in "Sacred Space: Photographs from the Mississippi Delta," and exhibited in 2008 at Duke University as "Near the Cross: Photographs from the Mississippi Delta."
The artist offers his reflection on the project: "No single institution in the Delta region has had a more profound impact on the entire culture of the Mississippi Delta than the countless African-American churches that accent the landscape. The ubiquitous presence of these churches and their adjoining cemeteries and churchyards - these sacred spaces - constitutes a kind of three-dimensional iconography in an otherwise profane agricultural landscape. Landmarks to some, places of spiritual refuge to others, 'home church' to their devoted members, these centers of religious and social life have been planned, built, decorated, and maintained by local communities for heartfelt reasons...Thus the look and life of the church, inside and out, reflect the attitudes, beliefs, aspirations, and realities of the community...The church survives not only as a place of worship, but also as a symbol to the membership of a sacred home where a formal commitment to religion began, where family meets, and where forebears once gathered."
The prints in this series come in many sizes and processes: 11x14 inch unmatted black-and-white gelatin silver prints (box 2); 11x14 gelatin silver prints in 16x20 inch mats (box 7); 16x20 inch unmatted prints (boxes 4-5); and 16x20 inch gelatin silver prints in 20x24 inch mats (box 6). Prints in Box 3 are 8 1/2 x 11 contact prints, with slight variations, in 11x14 inch window mats; there are a few prints in this group that have larger finished print versions in the collection. Within size categories, prints are arranged in order as assigned by the photographer. All titles are original.

Directed by Bill Ferris and produced by Judy Peiser, Center for Southern Folklore, 1977.
Directed and produced by Barry Dorfeld and Tom Rankin, Oboade Institute for African Culture, 1985.
The collection was acquired as Rockett, Burkhead & Winslow (RBW) was closing in Spring of 2009. It consists of posterboards with sample advertisements; videotapes and DVDs of commercials; CDs with advertisements and other client-related materials; USB flash drives with RBW documents (these have been copied to Duke's Electronic Records server); and awards and trophies from various organizations for excellence in advertising.
The R.C. Maxwell Company Records span the years 1891-2001 and include photographs and negatives, videocassettes, ledgers and account books, scrapbooks, correspondence and legal papers relating to the company's operations in outdoor advertising. Photographs and negatives in several formats (film, glass negatives, polaroid prints) document billboard designs for a variety of advertisers as well as depicting billboard and electric sign structures and their location relative to the surrounding environment. Urban locations include Times Square in New York and the Atlantic City, N.J., Boardwalk, where a number of photographs also document the Miss America beauty pageant parade and other parades in which the R.C. Maxwell Company participated. A few photographs document billboard construction and erection; there are also photographs of the Maxwell family and of Maxwell company staff and employees. Scrapbooks contain images of billboards and wall paintings produced by the Maxwell company as well as by David L. Clark, a High Point, N.C. artist and sign painter who was R.C. Maxwell's guardian. Other scrapbooks document primarily Coca-Cola signs of the early 20th century, as well as World War I support efforts including the U.S. Food Administration (under the direction of Herbert Hoover), the U.S. Fuel Administration, and Liberty Bond campaigns. Companies represented in the collection include the Boardwalk Advertising Signs Co., C&B Electric Signs Co., Trenton Advertising Co., and Trenton Poster Advertising Co.
Approximately 15,000 photographs, dating up to around 1952, have been described in the searchable ROAD Database (Resource of Outdoor Advertising Descriptions). The numbered and indexed black-and-white photographs and negatives (along with a limited number of glass negatives) include images of billboard and electric spectacular executions (illuminated billboards); road shots showing the approach views to billboard structures; images of Maxwell advertising structures; and images of urban and rural billboard displays in various states, primarily Pennsylvania and New Jersey, including a number of images of Times Square in New York and the Atlantic City, N.J. boardwalk. Because the majority of photographs show the billboards in their surroundings, the images provide a snapshot of the people and buildings near the billboard.

Boxes DB1-DB3 contain prints made from glass negatives. Many are undated, but are grouped together at the beginning of the series because of their format.
The contents of Boxes DB4-DB6 are arranged according to the numbering systems used by the Maxwell Company between 1916-1920. Maxwell used several different methods for cataloging their photograph collection until around 1918, when the company settled on a single, sequential numbering system. The photographs numbered in this fashion begin in Box DB7. There is thus a chronological overlap among the material in Boxes DB5-DB9. All Maxwell Company numbers are listed immediately under the date of the photographs contained in the box.
In addition to the Maxwell Company number, items in the Photographs Included in the ROAD Database Series have been assigned ROAD database numbers. A database number beginning with an XXG prefix denotes images made from glass negatives; XXH denotes images primarily from the 1940s (World War II era) but also include a few items in the 1930s; and all other Maxwell images in the ROAD database begin with an XXX prefix. All ROAD database numbers are listed after the Maxwell numbers under each box number. The XXH numbers are out of database order, but are in chronological order. This reflects the fact that this set of photographs was processed separately under a slightly different organizational plan.
Where applicable, individual folders have been stamped indicating that a corresponding negative is available in the Negatives Series (Restricted) of this collection.
For items XXX3545-XXX3615, please see box DB45.
For items XXX3616-XXX3692, please see box DB46.
Items XXH0001-XXH0121 are duplicated in later XXH numbers, so are not listed in this finding aid. The duplicate numbers are noted in the ROAD database.

Items in this series have not been included in the ROAD database. There is a slight overlap in dates (1951-1952) with items in the Photographs Included in the ROAD Database Series; however, there is no overlap in actual items between the two series. Photographs are listed in chronological order and according to the Maxwell numbering system.
Where applicable, individual folders have been stamped indicating that a corresponding negative is available in the Negatives Series (Restricted) of this collection.
Negatives from both the Photographs Included in the ROAD Database Series, and the Photographs NOT Included in the ROAD Database Series are found here. The series is divided into Glass Plate Negatives and Film Negatives, and follow a chronological order where possible. In general, boxes NN1-NN43 contain negatives from those photographs included in ROAD, and boxes NN43-NN87 contain negatives from those photographs NOT included in the ROAD database. However, a few negatives in boxes NN-NN43 are missing corresponding photographs for documentation in the ROAD database.

The images in this collection were taken by photographer Ron Reis from the 1950s to 1979 and from 2004 to 2014. The earlier body of work contains 289 black-and-white photographs, accompanied by negatives and contact sheets, and consists of documentary images taken by Reis during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in Connecticut, London, and New York City, with a smaller number from major European cities. The later body of work contains 3,719 laser inkjet prints of black-and-white and color documentary images taken by Reis in the 2000s, with a majority of images dated 2012 to 2013. Most of these images are of New York City street scenes.
An avid amateur street photographer influenced by Cartier-Bresson, Helen Levitt, and Louis Stettner, Reis focused his camera on street scenes in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East during the 1960s, then in the 2000s. Favorite locations chosen by Reis include London's Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, Portobello flea market, and Trafalgar Square; New York's Bryant Park, Greenwich Village, and Washington Square; and market scenes in Connecticut and Jerusalem. Other images portray anti-Vietnam War protests in Bryant Park, gay pride and ethnic festivals and parades, amusement parks, and other street scenes.
The collection is arranged in three series: Photographs, Negatives, and Manuscript and Print Materials.
The Photographs Series is divided into two chronological subseries: 1954-1979 and 2004-2014. The first subseries contains 289 11x14-inch gelatin silver prints, accompanied by negatives and contact sheets. These black-and-white images were taken by Reis during the 1960s and 1970s, primarily in Connecticut, London, and New York City, with a smaller number from Athens, Barcelona, Como, Dublin, Florence, Jerusalem, London, Rome, and Venice. In general, each 8x10-inch contact sheet is followed by selected prints from the same roll. The prints and contacts are organized chronologically.
The second subseries contains 3,719 inkjet prints, both black-and-white and color, the vast majority measuring 11x17 inches. The prints, taken between 2004 and 2014, consist mostly of New York City street scenes as well as photographs from Reis's trips to Canada, Colorado, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina. These photographs are described at the folder level, with folders containing up to 80 prints.
The Manuscript and Print Materials include an early curriculum vita, some correspondence, exhibition fliers, negative sleeves, articles, and photo essays.
The Negatives Series is arranged by year and month, and titles were taken from original notes on the negative envelopes. They overlap with the prints in the collection to some degree, but there are also negatives present for images that are not currently in the collection.
Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.
These exhibit-quality photographs are in black-and-white as well as in color. The earliest are darkroom prints, and are accompanied by contact sheets, while later work (after 2004) is most often in digital color and black-and-white inkjet format. They are printed in a range of sizes, chiefly 11x14 and 11x17 inches, but there are some also as small as 6 3/8 x 9 1/2 inches. The images are arranged by topical or geographical photo shoots, in chronological order, with original titles as assigned by Reis.
Folders house 289 prints and contact sheets. Each contact sheet has an identifier assigned by Reis and derived from the roll number, which notes the month and year plus a letter code (e.g., 6/1962G or 07-1962F). Each print also is identified by the roll id followed by a numeral (6/1962G-01). Print sizes vary from 6 3/8 x 9.5 inches up to 11 x 14 inches. All contact sheets are 8x10 inches. Identification number ranges on each folder represent the prints and contact sheets housed within. Arranged in order by id number.
This later body of work consists of over 3500 digital inkjet prints, both black-and-white and color, the majority of which measure 11x17 inches and are printed on Ilford Galerie Smooth Pearl 290gsm paper. They are arranged roughly in order of geographical location, with original group titles as assigned by Reis. Subjects focus on New York City street scenes, but there are also images from other states Reis visited in New England and in western U.S. (Colorado); there is also a set of images taken in Canada.
93 photographs
128 photographs
Series contains 66 envelopes containing 35 mm negatives and 13 envelopes of 120 mm negatives; each envelope holds one roll of film cut into strips. Images correspond to locales of prints in the collection, including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York City, and various countries in Europe, especially England (London), Greece, and Italy. There are also images from a trip to Jerusalem in the 1970s. Also among the images are Vietnam protest marches and other demonstrations, as well as early street scenes from urban areas and shots taken at an amusement park in Connecticut, "Savin Rock."
The negatives are arranged chronologically by year and month, and within by location and strip letter id, with undated items at the end of the series. Titles are taken from notes on the original envelopes. Some negatives represent images not currently among the prints or contact sheets.
Contains a short biographical narrative; curriculum vitae; correspondence from publishers and a museum; publications featuring Reis's photographic work; and publicity relating to Reis's exhibitions and lectures. Also includes a folder with samples of Reis's original negative envelopes with handwritten titles and dates. Folders arranged alphabetically by title.
The papers of Louisa E. Rhine span the years 1890 to 1983 and include journals, correspondence, writings, genealogical papers, notebooks, pictures, and miscellaneous papers relating principally to her work and research with her husband J.B. Rhine in the field of parapsychology, including the impact of this work on their personal and professional lives.
This impact is shown in Louisa Rhine's journals (1903-1982). The journal entries while not routinely made are nevertheless often lengthy, descriptive, and self-revealing. They document her school days at the University of Chicago, and her courtship, marriage, and relationship with J.B. Rhine. Parts of four journals describe their struggle to understand and to formulate a personal religious philosophy. Others describe their family life and incidents relating to the rearing of their four children. Their work in the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke, as well as the Laboratory's relationship with the Duke administration are described. The journals include passages from some of J.B. Rhine's letters, interspersed with notes relating to some of Louisa Rhine's studies. Another journal includes excerpts from the other journals.
Correspondence forms the bulk of the collection, and is divided into four categories: personal, special, parapsychological, and business. The most voluminous is personal correspondence primarily from two of the Rhine's children, Sara (Rhine) Feather and Rosemary Rhine. Also included, however, are letters from other family members and friends.
The special correspondence consists of selected correspondence files arranged alphabetically by the correspondent's last name. The correspondents include: Ella (Long) Weckesser, Louisa Rhine's mother; Sylvia (Weckesser) Newcombe and Miriam (Weckesser) Whaley, sisters of Louisa Rhine; and Barry S. Siegal and William R. Birge, friends of the Rhines, who were officers during World War II.
The parapsychology correspondence includes letters from people in the United States and other countries who wrote to Louisa Rhine relating psychic phenomena either they or someone they knew had experienced. Some of these experiences were reported by Dr. Rhine in her publications.
Business correspondence is chiefly from other scientists in the field of psychical research, information relating to the work and funding of the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man, and information concerning the publication and translation of some of Louisa Rhine's works.
The personal and business correspondence, reflects the Rhine's concerns about how psychical research would be carried out in the future. They wanted to make sure that an accurate accounting of the work that had begun at Duke under J.B. Rhine's guidance be told. To that end, Louisa Rhine worked during the last years of her life to finish the work recounting as she said J.B.'s attempt to find the 'something lost behind the ranges.' Her efforts resulted in Something Hidden which was published posthumously in 1983.
The business correspondence also describes the strained relationship between Duke University and the Rhines' work both at the Parapsychology Laboratory, when it was officially a part of Duke University, and later when the Laboratory was transferred into the Institute of Parapsychology under the auspices of the Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man.
The writings series contains both parapsychological and other works. The parapsychological writings include a chronological listing of J.B. and Louisa Rhine's works and of critiques and reviews of works by and about them. Also included is information about the Anpsi Project (psychic abilities in animals); miscellaneous notes kept by Louisa and J.B. Rhine; an index to articles in the Journal of Parapsychology (1937-1967); transcripts of interviews with J.B. Rhine; miscellaneous speeches, lectures, and articles relating to the work of the Rhines and others in the parapsychology field; and articles and memorials to honor J.B. Rhine after his death.
Other writings include short stories and poetry by Louisa and J.B. Rhine; anecdotes relating to the Rhines and their children; and attempts by the Rhines to write a work about Our Life Together. There are some fragments of short stories by Louisa Rhine, some giving the author's name as Louise Long a pseudonym adopted when they lived in Massachusetts. One of them "In the Crucible of Life" is apparently a true story about Louisa and J.B. Rhine, although their names have been changed in the story. A note in this section by the Rhine's daughter, Sara (Rhine) Feather (denoted by SRF) tells something about her mother's writings.
Louisa Rhine's journals overlap each other in terms of the time period covered; two are undated. There are gaps from one to several years in the entries.
Divided into four subseries: personal, special, parapsychological, and business. The personal correspondence is primarily from the Rhines' children, but also includes letters from other family members and friends. It is arranged chronologically. The special correspondence is arranged alphabetically by the correspondent's last name and chronologically within those files. Correspondents' letters in the parapsychological category are divided into two sub-categories: 1) case studies, arranged by the correspondents' last name and 2) miscellany, arranged chronologically. The business correspondence is arranged chronologically.
Divided into two categories: parapsychological and other writings. Within that arrangement, the papers are broken down into sub-categories that are chronologically and topically arranged. Included is information about the Rhines' writings and those of others.
Research about the Long and Weckesser families to whom Louisa Rhine was related, dating from 1702. Includes information about two works regarding the Weckesser family. Chronologically arranged.
Divided into two categories: 1) information relating to the Rhines' work and civic interests and 2) Louisa Rhine's psychical research notebooks and address books. Both categories are arranged chronologically.
Mainly Rhine family photographs, including those of J.B. Rhine, Louisa Rhine, and their children.

Collection documents John Ridlon's medical career and consists of medical case files, casebooks, articles and papers, correspondence, photographic materials, diplomas and ephemera, and medical illustrations relating to Ridlon's research and writings on orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include tubercular infection of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal arthritis), and limb or joint injuries. There are hundreds of medical illustrations in the form of photographs mounted on card stock, photographic prints of early X-rays, and printed illustrations on loose sheets that show patients, symptoms or deformities, and treatments such as surgery, braces and casts; many of them were used by Ridlon in his published works.
Among the bound volumes are six casebooks (1889-1892); four letterbooks (1873-1903); an autograph manuscript, "Some comments on the principles and practice of Hugh Owen Thomas" (undated); a scrapbook of figures and illustrations (undated); three volumes composed of reprint clippings and manuscript notes (undated); and a bound volume of 88 reprints (1888-1923). There are also many diplomas and certificates received by Ridlon from various educational institutions.
Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E. Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, H. Cushing. In addition to discussing medical cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the Country Home for Convalescent Children.
Accompanying the professional papers is a set of 118 black-and-white photographs taken during Ridlon's service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. The photos were taken by several photographers at a medico-military training camp in Plattsburgh, N.Y., around 1916. Ridlon reported on these experiences at a medical conference in 1917 and used a set of 67 glass lantern slides to illustrate the lecture, 49 of which survive in the collection; a reprint of this paper is also available in the collection.
In the same series there is a set of 30 glass plate negatives and still image nitrate film negatives (restricted); these materials are closed to use but contain duplicate or similar images found in the print photographs. Finally, there are several portraits of Ridlon, chiefly photographs taken in his office and examination room, taken in 1911. A glass plate negative with a bust portrait of Ridlon rounds out the photographic series.
The collection also contains several folders of ephemera, early professional diplomas and certificates, letters of recommendation for Ridlon's Chicago appointment in 1892, and his obituary.
Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University.
Bound holograph manuscripts containing case notes on orthopedic patients with a variety of complaints, including descriptions of each case and patient data such as name, age, sex, address, dates of consultations, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. Includes several one-page manuscripts laid in as well as outlines made of patient body parts showing measurements of the actual curvature and size of affected areas. There are many other patient case studies in folders housed in the Patient Case Files Series. Medical records are open for research use.
Contains correspondence, as well as associated account sheets, contracts, meeting minutes, deeds, loan agreements, bylaws, printed material, bills and receipts, reports, some photographs, reprints, clippings, and typed manuscripts. Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E. Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, H. Cushing. Letters also document Ridlon's involvement with two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children and the Country Home for Convalescent Children.
Bound outgoing correspondence in both typed and holograph scripts, containing transcriptions of correspondence by Ridlon concerning financial and professional matters.
Bound outgoing correspondence written in both typed and holograph scripts, containing transcriptions of correspondence by Ridlon concerning financial and professional matters.
Contains several hundred black-and-white images taking the form of photographs (mounted on cardstock), early X-rays, and printed illustrations, all relating to Ridlon's case studies and research on orthopedics. Many were used in his publications from the 1880s to the 1920s. The photographer may have been John Ridlon or an assistant. These historic medical images are open to use.
Images show unidentified patients with deformities and abnormalities, treatments (including braces, casts, and sometimes surgery), and outcomes. Many are pediatric patients. Original folder titles have been retained.
Other photographs in the collection are found in the Photographs Materials series and are related to Ridlon's medical training at a military base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., in 1916; also includes portraits of John Ridlon.
Includes one reproduction of early chest/shoulders X-ray. Also includes set of hand-inked reproductions of 16th-century treatments. All undated except 1911 illustration. Originally part of the Trent Manuscripts Collection, John Ridlon papers.
Includes photo prints of early X-rays.
Bound scrapbook containing illustrations of braces and other tools for treating patients with orthopedic complaints, diagrams illustrating the use of these tools, and photographs and drawings of affected persons. Images were probably used in Ridlon's published writings.
Folders of case summaries maintained by Dr. Ridlon, most of them dating from 1900 to 1915. At least half are pediatric cases. Cases include Pott's disease (tuberculosis of the spine), spondylitis, scoliosis (congenital and idiopathic), tubercular infection of the joints, other joint diseases and injuries, and congenital deformities.
Case summaries are typically one to two pages long, and include patient names, ages, residence, family history, symptoms, measurements, treatment, and outcome. Occasionally other documents such as referral letters and records of tests such as urinalyses are attached. These historic medical records are open to research.
Originally part of the Trent Manuscripts Collection, John Ridlon papers.

The Printed Material series contains many of Scitovsky's reprinted articles and may prove to be the most useful series for researchers interested in his work.
Primarily routine professional correspondence to Scitovsky from academic institutions, publishers, colleagues, and friends. Many concern publications or invitations to events. There are a number of brief but interesting exchanges with other economists, including Moses Abramovitz, Benjamin M. Friedman, Paul Samuelson, Stanley K. Sheinbaum, and Robert Solow.
Consists primarily of routine professional correspondence to Scitovsky from academic institutions, publishers, colleagues, and friends. Many concern publications or invitations to events. There are several brief but interesting exchanges with other economists, including Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard, Moses Abramovitzof Stanford, Stanley Sheinbaum of Stanford, Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson of MIT, Louise Keely of Oxford, and H. W. Arndt, a specialist in economic development in the Pacific region; topics range from publications, economics issues, to wartime history and political events in the United States and Europe. There are also several short memoirs on life in New York City in the 1930s, and essays on financial capitalism, written and collected by Sheinbaum. Only in a handful of cases are the letters from Scitovsky himself. Included in this series is a set of undated correspondence on boredom, one of his later research topics, but other than that, his writings and research topics are rarely referenced in the correspondence; this information is best documented in the printed materials. Arranged in chronological order by year.
Financial materials include only four items consisting of royalty statements, subscription notices, and accounting services. Arranged in chronological order.
Personal materials include Scitovsky's birth certificates and documentation, curriculum vitae and honorary degrees, photocopied obituaries and articles on various topics, programs, and bibliographies. Arranged in original order.
The first group of files represents Scitovsky's last work on violence and its connection to social boredom. Other files contain drafts, lectures, clippings, articles, and notes for earlier research topics: consumer and human satisfaction; the US economy and social conditions; market economies; the problems of affluence; growth and stagnation; and inflation. Another grouping contains notes, drafts, and photographs that contributed to his memoirs, published in part under the title "A Proud Hungarian." The bulk of the material represents his research dating from the 1980s-2000; earlier works are best represented in their final published form in the Printed Material series. Materials within subgroupings are arranged in original order as received.
A selection of reprints of Scitovsky's articles. In the early years, his research focused on economic theory, international finance and monopoly and competition. He progressed to prices under monopoly and competition, the theory of balance of payments adjustment, and economic welfare. Later writings analyzed growth in an affluent society, the US savings rate, the welfare of nations, and the benefits of asymmetric markets. In the years before his death, his focus shifted to violence, and in particular, boredom as the cause of violence. He referred to boredom as an "overlooked disease." Arranged chronologically.

The Shields Family Papers consist of correspondence, legal papers, and photographs created by three generations of a missionary family. The correspondence documents the experiences of a missionary family in Angola (Luanda and Malange) and Zimbabwe (including the Umtali region) in the early twentieth century. In 1903, Louise Shields brought her children to live in London and gave birth to Helen there; much of the correspondence is between Louise and Robert during this period of separation. Leaving her children in England to return to Angola, Louise received additional correspondence from the woman who took care of the children in her absence. Also included in the correspondence is a series of letters written by Greta Gazeley to her mother Wilhelmina Taylor Shields Gazeley in the 1950s. The legal papers in the collection consist of marriage certificates, copies of birth certificates, an immigration visa for Robert Shields, and US Army discharge papers for Robert Dodson Shields. In addition, the collection includes a handwritten memoir by Robert Shields, a biographical account of Louise Raven Shield's life compiled by her daughter, Irene Withey Shields, and various writings by Irene Withey Shields and Wilhelmina Taylor Shields on their experiences in Africa. Also included are Irene's and Wilhelmina's diplomas from the University of Cape Town.
The extensive collection of photographs, dating from the early 1900s to the 1960s, provide a portrait of the lives of missionaries in Africa. The majority are portraits and snapshots of the Shields family and other groups both European, American, and African, as well as photographs of groups of schoolchildren, mission buildings, and various scenes of African life and landscapes. Several of the family portraits were taken during the family's time in England. The collection contains one photograph of Bishop William Taylor and a young African boy. Also included are a number of picture postcards. With the exception of three photograph albums, the photographs are unsorted and the majority are undated.

The materials in the Alix Kates Shulman Papers span the dates 1892 to 2000, with the bulk of materials dating from 1968 to 2000. These materials include: manuscripts, notes, clippings, published books, correspondence, photographs, audio and videotapes, microfilm, address and date books, family and business records. The primary focus of the collection is Shulman's writing and literary career. The secondary focus is the women's liberation and feminist movements, in which Shulman was and continues to be very active (from 1968 to the present). However, feminism and feminist activism are inextricably intertwined with Shulman's writing career, and her 1972 novel Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen is regarded by many as the first novel to come out of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Other topics covered by the collection include: her teaching and other academic work; her public speaking and conference activities; and her involvement in political activities besides feminism. This collection sheds valuable light on the concerns and tensions within the women's liberation and second-wave feminist movements. In particular, the materials document debates and disagreements among those active in the movement with regard to sexuality, marriage and domestic relations, women's financial situation and careers, health care, civil rights and cultural expression. Many of these issues are raised in Shulman's own work, including her novels, essays, short fiction, personal letters and her teaching materials.
The collection is divided into seven series. The Personal Papers Series contains Shulman's family history papers, photographs, biographical papers, and her personal correspondence (with writers, academics, political activists and family members). Notable correspondents include Ros Baxandall, Jay Bolotin, Kay Boyle, Rita Mae Brown, Phyllis Chesler, Judy Chicago, Andrea Dworkin, Candace Falk, Marilyn French, Lori Ginzberg, Hannah Green, Erica Jong, Kate Millett, Honor Moore, Robin Morgan, Tillie Olson, Lillian Rubin, Sue Standing, and Meredith Tax.

The correspondence between Martha and Paul D. Simpson, an African American couple from Virginia, spans their time spent earning teaching degrees (1948-1952) and details not only their personal lives, but also discusses work, religion, race, and their education. The couple eventually married. The letters document daily life, their relationship, and their struggles in school, life and on the job market. Paul sometimes refers to Martha as "Booker" or "Cherie." Martha often calls Paul "Button."
The correspondence between Martha Booker and Paul Simpson begins in May of 1948 with a letter from Martha expressing her love for Paul and hoping she can show "both of you" (presumably Paul and his son, Paul Jr.) this love soon. This portion of the correspondence contains only Martha's letters to Paul and details her daily life, her job search, gifts purchased for Paul Jr., her experience as the only "colored person present" at Mass, and her love for Paul.
This portion of the correspondence contains only letters from Martha to Paul and runs from September to December of 1949. The letters detail her dorm life, church activities, and student life while attending Elizabeth City Teachers College. They discuss her plans to come home and hopefully visit Paul.
This portion of the correspondence covers the entirety of 1950 and includes letters from both Martha and Paul. Martha details her life at school and her interest in another man should Paul choose not to want her anymore. Her letters are very critical of herself, her looks, and her thoughts and feelings. Paul's letters describe the student life at Virginia State College, his feelings, his financial support of Martha, his coursework in physics, and his photography. Their correspondence from March mentions the book "Two Flappers in Paris," which Martha describes as "the story of love-making [] put in plain every day English" that had been passed around the dorm for new techniques and what she has learned about their own sexual relationship from it. Paul asks to borrow it so he can glean from it as well. Martha also mentions an affair Paul had with Edith and her feelings about that. Paul writes about a trip to Washington for the meeting of the American Physical Society and how he and his professor were the "only Negroes there and there were no other persons of color present with the exception of one Japanese individual." In July, Martha attends summer school at the Winston-Salem Teachers College, before returning to Elizabeth City in the fall. In a letter dated October 17th, Martha details a new program for the colleges of North Carolina and mentions that it is meant to raise the standards of all colleges, to compete scholastically with any school, "negro or white." Paul responds by explaining this is due to not wanting integrated colleges, so "the Negro schools must be better than they were." Martha also notes a "short-lived" pregnancy in November.
The correspondence from 1951 contains letters from both Martha and Paul, and further details their academic endeavors, Paul's desire to finally get divorced and marry Martha, their sex life, a brief mention of Paul Jr., Paul's job search after his graduation and new job teaching at Phenix High School in Hampton, Virginia, and Martha's time at Warren County Training School in Wise, North Carolina.
The 1952 correspondence between Martha and Paul covers their feelings about their engagement and their plans for marriage in May of that year, the final months of Martha's schooling, and dreams for the future (a room together, then an apartment and maybe a house).
Various undated correspondence between Paul and Martha. One lengthy letter notes her love for education and Paul, as well as her job search in Washington D.C., where she was asked for sexual favors in exchange for help obtaining a government job.
Miscellaneous letters to Paul Simpson from February 1949-February 1952, including a letter and math assignment from his son.
Includes Paul's graduation announcement with a personal note to Martha, a nude photograph of Martha, a lock of her hair, and several other miscellaneous documents.
Correspondence, financial records, legal documents, clippings, account books, commissions, addresses and speeches, and a diploma. Correspondence concerns chiefly cotton growing, trade and prices; slaves who worked in cotton fields; financial matters; Washington, D.C. politics, with references to Henry Clay and John Calhoun; state and national politics; descriptions of newly settled areas of Mississippi and California; and a cholera outbreak in Charleston (1832). Civil War letters detail problems at Fort Sumter (1861), and often refer to economic difficulties and shortages in South Carolina. Other Civil War letters are also written from Manassas, Alabama, and Mississippi. One letter from Mississippi details the desperation of women left alone and unable to flee before the advancing Union Army. Post-war letters reveal the problems of Reconstruction in South Carolina. Many of the letters are to Sims' wife Jane Emily Sims (Farnandis).
Includes an autobiographical letter from J. K. Paulding, author and statesman, and an essay by the same, entitled "The history of Uncle Sam and his boys." Some of Sims' addresses and one of the legal documents concern Nullification, which Sims' strongly supported. Other documents include an obituary for Franklin H. Elmore, plantation and general account books, and some material on Sims' student days at South Carolina College (ca. 1817-1819), which includes a letter to his brother in 1819 "in defence of General Jackson," and his "treatment of the Indians."

All the Presidents' Men combines photographs made in presidential museums and historic sites across the United States with images from my father and grandfather's homes. In 1959, after a spontaneous all-night road trip, my 18-year-old father met former president Harry Truman out for a morning walk on the streets of Independence, Missouri. He doesn't remember what they talked about, only the thrill of meeting a "powerful," yet "unassuming" man. Nearly 50 years later, I visited Truman's presidential museum and noticed there was little evidence of the restlessness and uncertainty that have shaped my father's generation and characterized Truman's legacy.
I am intrigued by photography's increasing role within history museums, where historical narratives intersect with the complexities of photographs, replicas, and ephemera, and are interpreted through the viewer's imagination and personal experiences. In particular, I see presidential museums as archives of a particular version of American masculinity, informed by American dreams, fictional narratives, and political rhetoric. Presidential power is reified and celebrated within the history museum while aspects of presidential identities that are more revealing of their complexity, individual struggles or humanity are only rarely or subtly articulated. These "preferred" heroic narratives have their own blind spots that are also absorbed into our political and personal lives despite the tenuous grasp they hold on the complexities of history and the multifaceted lives of men.

The Florence Moss Smith Papers span the period 1916 to 1973 and consist almost entirely of correspondence. The bulk of the collection consists of letters exchanged between Florence and Frank Smith during their courtship and after their marriage between 1942 and 1945 when Frank Smith was serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. While this World War II correspondence forms the crux of the collection, the papers also chronicle Florence Smith's life from her undergraduate days at Duke University until the marriage of her children more than three decades later. One of the greatest research values of the collection, is its depiction of the impact World War II had upon families.
A theme running throughout Frank and Florence Smith's correspondence from 1942 to 1945 was that of forced separation brought on by the war. Their letters document the difficulties presented to both Florence Smith, who is without "masculine support", and her husband, who was far removed from the circle of family and the births and rearing of their two sons, Frank Jr. and Howard. In addition, one sees the importance of the letter as the principal, often sole, method of communication during the war which made the waiting endurable.
Frank Smith trained at the U.S. Naval Training School (Indoctrination) at the University of Arizona in Tucson and also near Boston, before being assigned to overseas duty. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and served primarily in the South Pacific, the Philippines, and Japan, before he returned to the states after the war in late 1945. There is a lengthy letter from him dated Sept. 28, 1945, describing how his ship took occupation troops into Japan. He described the port city of Wakayama, his opinion of the Japanese people, and the effects of the B-29 bombings on the area.
Two of Florence's brothers, Howard and John Moss, also served in World War II. Howard Moss, who was in the Army, was stationed in the European theater and John Moss, a doctor in the U.S. Navy, served in a military hospital on Guam in 1945. Several of their letters, chiefly to their parents, are included in the collection.
The legacy of war shadowed the next generation of Florence Smith's family after her son Howard joined the U.S. Army. Eventually obtaining the rank of captain, he served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971. There are similarities in the war experiences of both generations of the family. A letter dated Aug. 15, 1968, from Frank Smith to his son Howard, who is grieving over the death of a friend killed in action in the Vietnam War, relates a similar experience during World War II when a friend of his was killed.
The early correspondence, 1928-1941, consists chiefly of exchanges between Florence Smith and her parents while she was an undergraduate at Duke University and later while she was employed at Duke. Her correspondence with Frank Ferrell Smith, also a Duke graduate, began around 1938 while he was working for the Soil Conservation Service in Arkansas. The letters became more frequent and intimate after their engagement, particularly between April and May of 1941 shortly before their marriage.
There is a gap in the correspondence from 1949 to 1958. In 1960, soon after the correspondence begins again, there are several letters of sympathy to Frank and Florence Smith. The letters were occasioned by the death of the Smith's eldest son, Frank, in an automobile accident in March 1960. The later correspondence is mostly among Florence and Frank Smith, their parents, their two other sons, and their daughters-in-law.
While correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection, there are also a few miscellaneous items, including a small group of unidentified photographs and a few printed materials.
Business papers of Joseph Belknap Smith relating to his investments in copper mines in Michigan and Tennessee, gold mines in Georgia, the New York Bay Cemetery Company, a lumber company and a cotton and land company in England, a project to build a railroad and telegraph from Caracas to La Guaira, Venezuela, a grain mill, sawmills, and salt mines and lands in Georgia.

There are also letters, 1857-1860, from Eliza Annie Dunston concerning her experiences as a teacher in Illinois and Mississippi, her travels, and her social life; scattered family correspondence; reports of the Columbia Mine post office in account with both the Federal and Confederate governments; petition of a number of Wilkes County, Georgia, citizens requesting a military exemption for Smith, miller and postmaster; circulars of Alabama Central Female College and Thomson (Georgia) High School; letters from Herschel V. Johnson and Company, agents for those who had cotton tax claims against the United States government; address of Jacob R. Davis to black voters of the 18th district of Georgia; and correspondence, 1860s, containing references to a ball to be given in New York City in honor of the Japanese emissaries, secession sentiment in Georgia, enlistment of volunteers, camp life and rumors in the Confederate Army, marketing of scrap iron, production of salt, raising of hogs for the Confederate government, commodity prices, the siege of Petersburg and the performance of African American troops there, the use of buildings at Emory and Henry College (Emory, Virginia) as army hospitals, Sherman's march to the sea, the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, the difficulty of securing freedmen to work on the farms in Georgia, and elections in Georgia in 1868.

The Stirewalt Family Papers, 1828-1993 (bulk 1850-1947), are comprised of the personal papers of individuals from four successive generations of the Stirewalt family. The correspondence, writings, diaries, legal/financial documents, photographs, and other miscellaneous papers found in this collection document the Stirewalt Family's personal lives and involvement in the Lutheran Church as ministers, educators and missionaries. The collection is divided into four primary series which reflect the individuals whose papers make up this collection: Jacob Stirewalt, Jerome Paul Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt, and Catherine A. Stirewalt. The arrangement of the collection is primarily chronological, following the lineage of the Stirewalt family. Subsections within each major series are determined by the type of materials found within the collection and are arranged either chronologically, as in the case of the Diaries and Correspondence Subseries, or alphabetically and thereunder chronologically, as in the case of the Writings Subseries.
The Stirewalt family is descended from Jacob Stirewalt, a minister and member of the Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Jacob Stirewalt was primarily active in and around New Market, Va. and Rowan and Shenandoah counties in Virginia. The Subseries related to Jacob Stirewalt includes Correspondence from 1828-1858, Writings (primarily sermons and sermon outlines in German and English) from the 1830s to the 1860s, and Diaries, which includes a Memorandum book where he recorded financial transactions and other records of his career as a minister from 1834 to his death in 1869.
Jerome Paul Stirewalt, the son of Jacob Stirewalt, was also a minister and a leader of the Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. He served as a minister in several pastorates in Virginia and North Carolina and several terms as president, secretary, and treasurer of the Tennessee Synod in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His papers are primarily composed of Correspondence, 1870-1933, with other ministers, relating to the business of the Tennessee Synod, and with family members. The collection also includes Jerome Paul Stirewalt's Writings, primarily sermons and sermon outlines, and other miscellaneous financial and legal papers. The Diaries Subseries is primarily memorandum books which list the date and location of religious services performed and the topic or title of sermons delivered by J.P. Stirewalt. These books serve to provide a record of Stirewalt's work as a Lutheran minister.
Martin Luther Stirewalt, the son of Jerome Paul Stirewalt, was also a Lutheran minister and educator at Lutheran schools and colleges in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Chicago, Ill. This series includes correspondence, diaries, writings and clippings which provide a picture of Stirewalt's theological education, activities as a minister and educator, and insights into his personal life and familial relationships.
The papers of Catherine A Stirewalt, Martin Luther Stirewalt's daughter, are primarily correspondence written while she was a Lutheran Missionary in China from 1939-1949. This correspondence provides documentation of the Lutheran Church's activities in China prior to and after World War II. Catherine Stirewalt's letters provide a great deal of detail about the daily lives of missionaries in China and some information about the lives of the Chinese people working as instructors or attending the mission school. There is no correspondence from the period of the first two years of World War II when she was interned in the Weihsien concentration camp near Tsingtao, China. Other miscellaneous clippings, photographs, and writings in this series provide further documentation of her experiences in China.
The papers of Jacob Stirewalt, 1828-1869,are divided into six Subseries: Correspondence, Writings, Diaries, Financial Papers, Legal Papers, and Miscellaneous Papers.

The Correspondence Subseries, 1870-1933,is arranged chronologically to the item level. The bulk of Stirewalt's correspondence spans from 1870-1900.There is a gap in the continuity of this subseries after1902,with no letters from1903to1911and very few letters from1911to1933.The letters are primarily correspondence with other ministers concerning administrative activities of the Tennessee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Many of the letters seem to refer to the solicitation of funds for special projects being undertaken by the Synod and to financial compensations being provided by the Synod to member ministers. The collection also includes some personal correspondence, business correspondence not related to the activities of the Tennessee Synod, and several drafts of letters written by Stirewalt between1911and1912.Also included is a small amount of correspondence received by William J.

The letters from her second stay in China provide a detailed picture of the difficult living conditions for the Chinese people following WWII. She discusses how inflation and scarcity of food and other supplies affected the region of China where she had been working. She also discusses the difficult living conditions of the missionaries and the problems they had performing their work. Her letters in1949discuss the political situation in China, her struggles with making a decision to stay in China, and the day to day lives of the missionaries with whom she is working. There is a gap in correspondence from May of1949until1987when the correspondence series continues with letters Miss Stirewalt received from her friends and former students in China.
The Clippings Subseries includes news clippings of articles relating to Catherine Stirewalt's missionary activities during the1930sand1940sand copies of two1985articles from the journal East Asia Millions about the Weihsien concentration camp. Also included is a photocopy of the title page and title page verso of Langdon Gilkey's 1966book Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure.
The Miscellaneous Papers Subseries includes a copy of Catherine Stirewalt's travel itinerary for her journey to China in1939;two essays by other Lutheran Missionaries in China; a postcard view of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Tsingtao China; two essays written by Stirewalt while in China; an 11 page memoir of her time spent in China, including her experiences in Weihsien concentration camp, written by Miss Stirewalt in1993;and 15 photographs of a1940cornerstone laying ceremony and of the Tsimo School Compound near Tsingtao.

Historical clippings and ephemera relating to the Stirewalt family and the history of the church.
Collection comprises a letter Stokes wrote to dramatist Benjamin Butler Davenport regarding her plan to attend his play "The Silent Assertion" with her husband. Includes enclosure.
Most of this collection is comprised of Stolper's files and notes from his work in Nigeria, Tunisia, and other missions to Africa. These work files document his career as a practitioner--literally working "in the field"--of development economics.
The Nigeria Series, the first and largest, contains his work files from his job as head of the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Federal Ministry of Economic Development in Lagos, Nigeria from 1961-62 (sent there under the auspices of the Ford Foundation). As head of the EPU, Stolper co-authored the first ever National Development Plan, (1962-68) for the Federation of Nigeria. As such, his papers present an extensive and thorough picture of the Nigerian economy at that time. Once top secret files, they include detailed statistical data on each industry, industrialization plans, reports on marketing board policies, maps, and demographics data. Of great interest to researchers on the Nigerian economy might be Stolper's personal diary, a 393-page typewritten account of his two years in Nigeria.
The next two series pertain to his work in Tunisia (1972) and other economic missions to Africa, including Dahomey (now Benin) and Togo (1967), Benin (1983), and Malawi (1981). He was sent to these countries under the auspices of USAID, the UN, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, also known as the World Bank). The files from these three series alone make up eight of the fourteen storage boxes that house the entire collection. Also in the collection are some notes, papers and drafts of Professor Stolper's work pertaining to Joseph Schumpeter.
Stolper's name is perhaps most recognizable for the theoretical piece written with Paul Samuelson on what has come to be known as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem (see "Protection and Real Wages," Review of Economic Studies, November 1941). This theorem, one of the core results of the Hecksher-Ohlin model of international trade, essentially states that an increase in the relative domestic price of a good (for example, via the imposition of a tariff) unambiguously raises the real return to the factor of production used intensively in producing that good (and lowers the real return to the other factor). This paper analyzed precisely for the first time the effect of trade or protection on real wages. At present, there is nothing (aside from reprints of the article) in this collection of papers dealing with the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem.
The fourth series, Writings, contains notes, drafts, manuscripts and reprints of any articles found in the collection but excluding those related to Joseph Schumpeter. Some highlights include drafts of "Investments in Africa South of the Sahara," notes and drafts of his book Planning Without Facts: Lessons in Resource Allocation from Nigeria's Development, and articles on smuggling in Africa.
The fifth series, Speeches, Lectures and Conferences, contains material (excluding those pertaining to Schumpeter) from public speaking engagements and conferences attended by Professor Stolper. One item that might be of interest is a speech recorded on magnetic tape titled "Problems of our Foreign Aid Program" that dates from around the 1950s.
Another of Professor Stolper's research interests is the history of economic thought, and this collection's Schumpeter series contains some notes, papers and drafts of Professor Stolper's work pertaining to Joseph Alois Schumpeter. Stolper was afforded a unique and personal relationship with Schumpeter, studying under him first at the University of Bonn and then at Harvard, and also through Schumpeter's position as a close friend of Gustav and Toni Stolper (Wolfgang's father and stepmother, respectively). Included in this series is a book (in German) that Professor Stolper co-wrote with Horst Claus Recktenwald and Frederic M. Scherer titled Uber Schumpeters ¬ªTheorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung¬´ (1988).
Stolper's work files from his job as head of the Economic Planning Unit for the Federal Ministry of Economic Development in Lagos. Sent there under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, one of his accomplishments was to help coordinate and write the first-ever National Development Plan for Nigeria. The files, after the diary, are arranged alphabetically. Highlights include his personal diary; drafts of an article titled "The Development of Nigeria" commissioned and published by Scientific American; detailed information and data on all aspects of the Nigerian economy; and various letters which are dispersed throughout the series.
The bulk of this series is made up of work files from Stolper's 1963-1965 economic mission in Tunis, but it also contains material (notes, data, and drafts) for a paper he cowrote with Jacob G. Kleve in 1973 titled "Investments, Employment and Productivity in the Tunisian Economy, 1961-1971," and a book titled Investments, Employment and Output Per Man in the Tunisian Economy, 1961-1971 (University of Michigan Center for Research on Economic Development), written in 1974. Arranged alphabetically, with the book at the end of the series.
Files from Stolper's economic missions to Togo and Dahomey (now Benin; 1967), Nigeria (1970), Malawi (1981), and Benin (1983). Includes correspondence with the missions' sponsoring organizations, memoranda, and background reading (economic briefing reports, maps, etc.) on each country. Arranged chronologically.
Notes, drafts, manuscripts, and reprints of articles, excluding those pertaining to Joseph A. Schumpeter. Arranged alphabetically.
Files related to Stolper's public speaking engagements and activities at conferences, excluding those pertaining to Joseph A. Schumpter. Arranged chronologically.
Stolper's drafts, manuscripts, and notes for articles and books pertaining to the Austrian economist Joseph A. Schumpeter. Arranged alphabetically.
The file titled "Course Outlines on Economic Development" contains different syllabi and reading lists compiled by a friend of Stolper's. The "Doctoral Committees" file contains paperwork pertaining to PhD committees that he sat on at the University of Michigan. Finally, the "Workload Records" folder contains paperwork listing the classes that Professor Stolper taught each semester at Michigan. Arranged chronologically.
A couple of letters that were found loose.
Correspondence with colleagues, including Paul Samuelson, Gottfried Haberler, and other prominent economists; class lectures (1930s); as well as writings about J. A. Schumpeter, economic development, and other topics. Also writings, reports, diaries, and other documents (mainly 1960s) about the economies of Nigeria, Tunisia, Liberia, Togo, and the Ivory Coast. In addition, there are 12 black-and-white and 18 color photographs, one x-ray, and 16 electronic files.
Text files; transcriptions of correspondence and diaries from 1960-1962.
The Chuck Stone Papers span the years 1931 to 2007. The collection consists of clippings and other print materials, correspondence, writings, scrapbooks, photographs, a videotape, research files, and diplomas and certificates pertaining to the life and career of Chuck Stone. Of the subject areas documented here are Stone's career as a prominent African-American journalist, his political career and relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. (including Powell's time as head of the Congressional Committee on Education and Labor), his role as a mediator between suspects and the criminal justice system, and his involvement in civil rights struggles in the United States. Also represented, but to a much lesser extent, is his teaching career at the University of Delaware and UNC-Chapel Hill. The collection is divided into nine series, each described below. Of these, the largest by far are the Clippings and the Subject Files series, which document respectively Stone's journalistic writings (especially during his time at the Philadelphia Daily News) and his research interests over the years, including racial politics in the U.S., African-Americans in the media, the criminal justice system, censorship and free speech, and standardized testing. The collection was acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African-American Documentation.
The Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series documents Stone's time as press secretary and special assistant to Powell. It contains office and business correspondence both to and from Stone; clippings and other printed materials about Powell or the Committee on Education and Labor; office files on individual members of congress (notably Florida Democrat Sam Gibbons, partly responsible for the campaign to remove Powell from his position as head of the Committee); files related to the workings of the Committee; press releases written by Stone; and a number of papers relating to Powell's exclusion from Congress in 1967. This series should be useful both for those interested in the career of Powell, since Stone worked for him during a pivotal time in his career, and for those interested in the workings of the Committee on Education and Labor during that time.
The Clippings Series is made up predominantly of Stone's columns from the Philadelphia Daily News and the NEA Viewpoint (a Newspaper Enterprise Association column syndicated by United Media), as well as articles about Stone from various newspapers, and some writings by Stone appearing in other newspapers. Topics addressed by Stone in his columns include racial politics in the U.S., Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's issues and feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized testing. Researchers interested in Stone's journalism career prior to 1972 will find some earlier clippings here, but should consult the Scrapbooks Series for more extensive materials and clippings from that period.
The Correspondence Series contains correspondence to and from Stone relating to business and personal matters. The majority of this series is made up of general correspondence or correspondence relating to Stone's position as editor and columnist of the Philadelphia Daily News. The remainder of the series comprises topical folders of correspondence, such as the correspondence between Stone and Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at Graterford Prison. Other such correspondence can be found in the "Criminal justice system" subsection of the Subject Files Series.
The Other Writings Series houses Stone's writings not contained in the Clippings Series, such as speeches, sermons, and television transcripts; business documents and research files pertaining to different projects on which Stone worked, such as his attempts to develop his own life or his writings on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. into a movie, or various uncompleted book projects; and a small subset of writings by others, including an autobiography of Corinne Huff on which Stone worked. It is divided into three subseries to accommodate the restriction on the collection: the Published Writings by Stone Subseries, the Unpublished Writings by Stone Subseries, and the Writings by Others Subseries. Notably absent from this series are manuscripts of Stone's books. Instead, the series contains either shorter published materials, such as publicly delivered speeches, or working documents assembled for the creation of larger works.
The Scrapbooks Series houses the contents of four scrapbooks assembled by Stone during the 1950s and 1960s. They contain a number of clippings, programs, and some correspondence pertaining to his time at the New York Age, the Washington Afro-American, the Chicago Defender, and working for Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. The series is especially useful for documenting Stone's early career and his position as an outspoken African-American journalist and defender of civil rights. Researchers interested in this period in Stone's life should also consult the Clippings Series for more materials from the period in question that are not present in the scrapbooks.
The St. Louis Series is a small series housing clippings and correspondence related to Stone's brief position as ombudsman for the St. Louis Post-Disptach, overseeing their coverage of the 1997 mayoral election. The series is divided into a Published Materials Subseries, which houses clippings from the Post-Dispatch and related newspapers, and an Unpublished Materials Subseries, in which can be found correspondence, business documents, and responses to several readers polls conducted by Stone.
In the Subject Files Series can be found Stone's research files on different subject areas, arranged alphabetically. The files contain primarily clippings, but also some correspondence and notes. Several subcategories that are heavily represented and should be mentioned are the files on censorship and the first amendment, on the criminal justice system, on standardized testing, and on materials relating to his time at UNC-Chapel Hill. There are also numerous files related to racial politics in the U.S., but these files are less discrete than the categories described above and are to be found throughout the series rather than under a specific subheading.
The Teaching Materials Series contains a small amount of material pertaining to Stone's teaching career. The bulk of this series comes from his time at UNC-Chapel Hill, and includes syllabi, exams, assignments, student papers, and other teaching paperwork. Most heavily represented in this regard is Stone's popular class on censorship, for which there are multiple syllabi and exams from different years and semesters.
Finally, the Audiovisual Materials Series collects photographs touching on all aspects of Stone's life, from press photos of Stone and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. to family portraits. Also included in this series are a videotape of a documentary about Powell, press passes and identification badges, and an election pin kept by Stone.
Unprocessed Addition 2009-0009 (50 items; .2 lin. ft.; dated 1963-2005) comprises primarily photographs, but also contains a few letters, clippings, awards, and a dvd-r. The original DVD-R is closed to patron use; however, the information on the disk has been migrated to the electronic records server.
Addition 2012-0099 has been processed and included in the original collection's description as boxes 64-66. Some parts of this addition have been interfiled into existing boxes. This series documents Stone's activities as special assistant to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. between 1965 and 1967, and includes speeches, press releases, correspondence between Powell and Stone, correspondence to and from other political figures and other members of Powell's staff, files on specific figures and organizations, clippings about Powell, and several folders of correspondence, clippings, and business documents specific to Powell's role as chair of the Committee on Education and Labor. The folders are labelled by topic and arranged alphabetically by title.
Series is comprised of clippings kept by Stone. The bulk of these are Stone's columns in the Philadelphia Daily News (1972-1991) and NEA Viewpoint (1987-1995), which deal with topics such as racial politics in the U.S., Philadelphia politics, the media, Ireland, Stone's travels in Africa, women's issues and feminism, the criminal justice system, and standardized testing, among others. Also included are materials documenting Stone's early journalism career from the New York Age, New York Citizen-Call, Chicago Daily Defender, and Washington Afro-American; clippings from various sources documenting Stone's interests and research; and articles about Stone from various publications. Of interest may also be the selection of clippings from 1972-1974 from the Philadelphia Daily News that Stone made, apparently for a planned sequel to Tell it Like it Is, his 1967 book of selected columns from the Washington Afro-American. These can be found at the end of the clippings from the Daily News, under the subheading " Tellin' it Like it Oughta Be columns."
Contains Stone's correspondence from the 1960s to 2005. In keeping with Stone's original arrangement, some folders are categorized by topic, while others simply house general correspondence within a particular span of years.
Of particular interest in the topical folders is the correspondence relating to black political power in America (the topic, not only Stone's book of the same title) and the correspondence with Edward M. Ryder, an inmate at the State Correctional Facility at Graterford, PA from 1973-1993. Also to be found are two folders of correspondence from a number of individuals related to Stone's role as negotiator in the hostage crisis at Graterford in 1981.
The bulk of the remainder of the series is made up of two categories. One is simply general correspondence. These folders contain correspondence from such figures as Martin Luther King, Jr., Jackie Robinson, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Barry Goldwater, LeRoi Jones, Edward Kennedy, and others, along with family correspondence and business correspondence both to and from Stone from the 1960s to the 2000s. The other is correspondence specific to Stone's position as editor and columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News, which includes internal memos and letters with other staff members, letters from readers, and business letters relevant to his position at the newspaper. Researchers should be aware that these appear to be rough categorizations on Stone's part, and that there are a few letters specific to his role at the Philadelphia Daily News in the general correspondence folders, and some general business correspondence in the Philadelphia Daily News folders.
It should also be noted that correspondence on particular topics can also be found in relevant series. For instance, correspondence with or relating to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. is to be found in that series. Researchers interested in Stone's role with the Graterford crisis and his correspondence with prison inmates should also consult the Criminal justice system files in the Subject Files Series.
Comprised of materials relating to writing and other media projects beyond the columns found in the Clippings Series. It is divided into three subseries: Published Writings by Stone, Unpublished Writings by Stone, and Writings by Others. Detailed series descriptions follow below.
Contains speeches, sermons, and transcripts of television broadcasts (on WCIU Chicago) by Stone.
Houses unpublished writings by Stone, such as an introduction written for the unpublished volume The Poetry of the Black Revolution, as well as documentation of other projects undertaken by Stone, ranging from book and syndication contracts to research files set aside for use in several uncompleted works, such as Free Speech and Jealous Mistresses and, with Dennis Jackson, Mass Communication Law in Delaware. Also found here are manuscripts of various movie or stage adaptations of Stone's novelization of his time with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as business documents relating to his attempts to secure a movie deal.
Comprises a graduate student's dissertation manuscript from 2001, and two folders of materials related to the unpublished autobiography of Corinne Huff, former Miss America and mistress to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Stone assisted Huff in the planning and possibly also the composition of the autobiography, and the files document that process of collaboration.
Series houses the contents of four scrapbooks kept by Stone, disbound for preservation purposes and housed in archival folders. The materials document Stone's media appearances, journalism career, and public relationship with Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. from the 1950s to the end of the 1960s. Each scrapbook deals with a different period of Stone's life, as designated by the bulk dates for each scrapbook, and has been supplied by the archivist with an appropriate name. The first houses clippings, mostly from the New York Age, documenting Stone's time with that newspaper. The second includes clippings, programs, and correspondence collected while Stone was correspondent for and editor of the Washington Afro-American. It also contains several columns by Stone in the New York Citizen-Call, letters by Stone that appeared in the New York Times and The Washington, D.C. Evening Star, and a number of clippings about Stone from various Washington and national newspapers. The third scrapbook houses clippings, programs, leaflets, and a small amount of correspondence documenting Stone's time in Chicago, where he was columnist for and editor of the Chicago Defender and, later, television commentator for WCIU Chicago. The Powell scrapbook documents Stone's activities as press secretary and special assistant to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. and contains clippings, correspondence, programs, leaflets, and flyers, as well as a folder of miscellaneous articles and media appearances by Stone spanning from the 1960s to 1990.
Folders contain materials related to Stone's position as Readers' Advocate for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, where he was hired to oversee their coverage of the mayoral campaign. The series is divided into two subseries, Published Materials and Unpublished Materials, in accordance with the restriction placed on the collection.
Includes clippings from St. Louis newspapers, primarily the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, as well as wire service printouts from the time during and immediately preceding Stone's term as ombudsman.
Includes unpublished documents and correspondence pertaining to Stone's position as Reader's Advocate for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
Houses Stone's extensive files in many different subject areas, consisting primarily of clippings, but also containing notes on the topics and some minimal correspondence. The folders have been preserved as closely to their original order as possible, and Stone's titles have been retained. The exception to this is a set of subheadings that were added to four groups of folders that were physically and topically associated by Stone, and which are of particular interest. These are his files on censorship and the first amendment, on which he intended to write a book (Free Speech and Jealous Mistresses, unpublished) and taught regularly throughout the 1990s; on the criminal justice system, focused around issues of racism within that system and on Stone's activities as a mediator between the police and inmates or suspected criminals; on the politics and racial bias of standardized testing, an issue with which he became involved while working with the Education and Labor Committee under Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.; and files relating to his academic career, activities, and institutional politics at the University of North Carolina. These can be found under the subheadings Censorship,Criminal justice system,Standardized testing, and UNC respectively. The files on censorship are especially numerous (filling six archival boxes) and contain extensive information on censorship law, types of censorship, and individual instances of censorship. Other topics in this series include black political power in the U.S., minority journalists, women's issues and feminism, affirmative action, religion, electoral politics in the U.S., journalism, multiculturalism and political correctness, higher education, gay and lesbian issues, Philadelphia politics and politicians, and racial politics more generally. There are also significant files on such figures as Mumia Abu Jamal, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Camille Paglia, Colin Powell, and Clarence Thomas. Subject files relating specifically to Stone's duties as special assistant to Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. can be found in the Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Congressional Series.
Contains documents Stone created or collected relating to his teaching career at the University of Delaware and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. It is made up of syllabi, exams, assignments, and notes on pedagogy and academic subject areas related to journalism.

Doane Stott relating to his missionary work in Japan and ministry in North Carolina, as well as his lecture notes reflecting his time spent at Trinity College and Duke University. Papers also include items relating to Mr. Stott's involvement with CROP (Christian Rural Overseas Program), the Greensboro Urban Ministry, as well as the Lion's Club.
The Correspondence Series, featuring material mainly from friends and churches, contains references for Mr. Stott from various North Carolina politicians and businessmen and church invitations asking him to conduct services.
Although most of the Writings and Speeches Series consists of sermons, class assignments, or debates, there is some printed material included if the items contained handwritten notes. The Brotherhood folder contains sermons and other items relating to race relations, mostly within the context of the Methodist church and its relationship with African Americans. The Sermons and Notes folder include several eulogies and many prayers by Mr. Stott and other ministers, which cover a wide range of topics from the scriptures. Some of these sermons have been transliterated into Japanese.
The Printed Material Series includes pamphlets, bulletins, church programs, maps, loose printed pages, as well as journals and books. Most of this material is on either church- or missionary-related topics. There are also a few Duke University alumni publications included.
The Miscellaneous Series contains many songs and poems, a photograph of a class at Kagawa Central Gospel School in Japan, as well as items relating to Japan and Greensboro, North Carolina.
Collection comprises an introduction and a letter written by Harriet Beecher Stowe, along with a carte de visite of her. There is an undated introduction she wrote for the second edition of Narrative of Sojourner Truth. Stowe's statement appears as an introduction in some copies of the 1853 edition. In the introduction, Stowe discusses the African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist, remarking on her mental energy and revelatory powers as a Christian, and attests to Truth's character. She then mentions that the sales of the work will "secure a home for [Truth in] her old age ..." There is an undated letter Stowe wrote from Northampton Depot on Aug. 10 to Mr. Ward, informing him that although she is disposed to support his request, she is under pressures that limit her use of the pen. The carte de visite features a textured surface, and was created by the Howell studio in New York.

The Deena Stryker Photographs collection spans the dates 1963-1964 and contains photographs and related material from Stryker's time in Cuba as a journalist for Paris Match. During her stay, she interviewed and photographed Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro as well as other male and female leaders in the Cuban Revolution, including Ernesto Ch√© Guevara, Juan Almeida, Luis Crespo, Armando Acosta, Armando Hart D√°valos, Efigenio Ameijeiras Delgado, Faustino P√©rez, Manuel Fajardo Sotomayor, C√©sar Escalante, Jesus Montane, Antonio N√∫√±ez J√≠menez, Guillermo Garc√≠a Fr√≠as, Celia S√°nchez, Ramiro Valdes Menendez, and Ren√© Vallejo.
The Photographic Materials Series contains Stryker's contact sheets, prints, and negatives created during the one-year period; all the photographic material processed by Alberto Korda, Fidel Castro's personal photographer. Topics and photographic subjects include key members of the revolutionary government, male and female, at work and relaxing with family members; life in Havana, including neighborhood and street scenes, and post-revolution housing projects; political rallies and meetings; and daily life and work in rural Cuba, particularly farms, agricultural workers, development projects, and schools. There are also images of Afro Cubans, religious life, and photos of major events such as the Havana trial of accused Batista collaborator Marcos Alfonso in March 1964, and the capture of Cuban fishing vessels by the U.S. Coast Guard in Feb. 1964.
The Correspondence Series contains letters of introduction to Fidel Castro from Stryker as well as one written by S√°nchez and a diagram drawn by Ra√∫l Castro. Stryker's analysis of the complexities of nascent post-revolution Cuba is captured in an Italian manuscript draft of the book she prepared for publication in Italy, housed in the Manuscript Materials Series.
An addition to the collection consists of prints produced from the original negatives by documentary photographer Cedric Chatterley for a 2010 exhibit on Deena Stryker's work, with a few other prints used in the exhibit created by Alberto Korda in the 1960s.
All of Stryker's negatives have been digitized and these images are available in their digital form. There are some prints and contact sheet images not represented digitally. Digital images and captions created by the photographer have been transferred to a library server.
Acquired by the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.

Other photographs chronicle life in Havana, including Carnaval, as well as the Cuban countryside, particularly the Sierra Madre and Isla de Turiguan√≥, Bayamo, Camag√ºey, and Guam√°. Two rolls of film document the damage to cane fields and villages in rural Cuba in the aftermath of Hurricane Flora in late 1963. Many of the contact sheets are annotated. Negatives, contact sheets, and prints are organized sequentially by film roll; uncategorized prints and prints without negatives appear at the end of the series. All of Stryker's negatives have been digitized and these images are available in their digital form. There are a few prints and contact sheets not represented digitally.
Most of these black-and-white gelatin silver prints were produced by documentary photographer Cedric Chatterley expressly for a 2010 exhibit on Stryker's work. The prints were derived from Stryker's original negatives housed in this collection; others were derived from prints produced earlier by Alberto Korda. The prints in the first set (boxes 3-4) are in window mats and were the final selection chosen for hanging in the 2010 exhibit. The rest of the prints (Box 5) are unmatted. In this box there is one set of 10 prints produced by Chatterley, with two duplicate sets; plus, The number of duplicates for an image is noted in parentheses following the original exhibit print.
The 22 black-and-white prints in boxes 3 and 4 measure 7x10.5 in. and are mounted in 16x22 mats. One set of 22 duplicate unmatted prints are located in box 5.

Carlos Rafael Rodriguez was a writer, economist and political protagonist whose activism crossed multiple phases of Cuban history. He participated in the overthrow of dictator Gerardo Machado in the 1930s; served as a Cabinet Minister under Fulgencio Batista in the 1940s and in 1958 negotiated an agreement between the Cuban Communist Party, of which he was a prominent member, and Fidel Castro in support of the overthrow of Batista. After 1959 he held various senior positions in the revolutionary government. Author Tad Szulc called him, "A most affable man of considerable learning and sophistication as well as a prolific writer, he has been Fidel's most valuable collaborator, politically and intellectually, since the 1959 victory."

The Walter Lee Sutton Papers span the period 1811 to 1947 with the bulk dating from 1883 to 1939. Three generations of the interrelated Anderson, Danforth, Sutton, and Wynn families are represented in the collection. While the collection primarily focuses on Sutton, many of the earlier papers relate to his wife's family, the Wynns and Danforths, her paternal and maternal relatives respectively.
The majority of the collection consists of courtship letters between Walter Sutton and Harriet (Hattie) L. Wynn (1883-1886), and ledgers and daybooks of the general merchandising businesses Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton. Therefore, the major strengths of the collection include its delineation of courtship customs in the 1880s and its depiction over a thirty-five period of a small general merchandising firm. While the correspondence spans the period 1811 to 1936, there are very few letters that date between 1814 and 1830, thereby leaving several years virtually uncovered in the collection.
The general merchandising businesses of Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton sold a variety of items including farm implements, wagons, buggies, hardware, groceries, dynamite, oil, gas, clothing, and dry goods. Because of the time period covered by these accounting records, one can readily see the transition from ‚Äúhorse and buggy days‚Äù to the increasing influence of the automobile. Besides business records, the account books also contain a few domestic accounting records for the Sutton family. Regular customers include members of the Anderson, Sutton, and Heard families. In some there are details about employees, including the number of days they have worked or days missed. Other volumes include an estimate of the amount of lumber sold, the amount of hay cut, or which fields were used for cotton picking.
Sutton's cashbook, 1907-1909, not only delineates the cash received and paid out, but also identifies several products Sutton sold. Some of these entries also include names of companies or persons from whom he received products. While there are separate account books for ice (1909 June-1910 Oct.) and cotton ginning (1908 Oct.-Feb. 1912), ice and cotton ginning accounts are also included in some of the other W. L. Sutton Company ledger and daybooks for other years.
The daybooks commonly itemize lists of goods received. Volume 17 includes a list of bank deposits for the years 1922 to 1927, while in later years 1932 to 1939, bank deposits are typically recorded in the daybooks for the period covered by the daybooks. Also in volume 17, for the years 1923 and 1924, deposits are listed for merchandisers' accounts.
In one instance, the ledger for the W. L. Sutton Company had been used earlier for another purpose. Volume 34 contains a list of debts and credits for merchandisers' accounts for the period January 1, 1936 to March 31, 1937, while at the front of the volume there are records for the Danburg Baptist Church Women's Missionary Society, 1910 to 1921.
Volume 37, ‚ÄúCotton Accounting Book‚Äù (1920-1927) includes Sutton's accounting records for his work as a cotton merchant. The accounting records indicate that Sutton shipped cotton to various companies including: Barnett and Company, Athens, Ga.; Georgia Cotton Growers Co-op Association; Rowland Company, Athens, Ga.; Washington Warehouse Company, Washington, Ga.; and George W. Wright, Augusta, Ga.
Loose materials, chiefly business receipts, were laid into several accounting books. Included are receipts from merchandisers who provided goods to the W. L. Sutton Company and from various warehouses and companies where cotton was shipped. There is also a contract for ice between W. L. Sutton and Pope Manufacturing Company indicating that Pope will sell ice to the W. L. Sutton Company.
Other Sutton accounting records indicate that he sold lumber, kept accounts for the Dansburg School District Board of Education, maintained records for the buying and use of livestock, and kept a record of personal expenses.
Additional financial records include a blacksmith account book kept by Samuel Danforth (1836-1838) and one for a boarding house in Washington, Ga. maintained by Harriet Brown Danforth (1857-1860). Promissory notes and a statement of receipts and disbursements for the estates of Samuel K. Wynn (Hattie's father) and Walter L. Sutton are among the other financial papers.
Among the earliest letters is a series that begins during the War of 1812 and continues to 1814 between George Reab in New York and others concerning his military service. (Reab married Almira S. Brown in 1816 and is a great aunt of Hattie Wynn.) Letters concern whether Reab could be asked to bear arms against the British again since he had been held as a prisoner of war by them and had later been released on parole. Reab stated that he should not be asked to bear arms, invoking the French parole d'honneur as the reason, which is a pledge or oath under which a prisoner of war is released with the understanding that he will not again bear arms until exchanged. It is unclear from the correspondence whether Reab was successful. By April 1813 he had been appointed 3rd lieutenant in the United States 13th Infantry Regiment and by 1816 he had retired from military service. The collection contains a list of officers, including George Reab, Jr. in the 13th Infantry Regiment of the United States Army, which is dated July 31, 1812.
Correspondence from Almira B. Reab during the 1840s to family and friends in New York and Vermont describe how she adjusted to life in the south. Originally from New York, she lived with her sister Harriet B. Danforth and her family in Danburg, Ga. at the time these letters were written.
The collection contains three diaries, one kept by Harriet Brown Danforth and her daughter Emma. Harriet's entries (1858, Jan. 3-1859, Nov. 30) primarily denote when she attended church and in some instances the Biblical scriptures which were read, while Emma's entries (1860? Aug. 26-Dec. 13) concern teaching school. The other two diaries were kept by Walter (1885, Aug. 15-Dec. 23). Several entries relate to Hattie Sutton, while others concern the ‚Äúliquor issue.‚Äù Miscellaneous financial information is found in them as well.
Other items in the collection include minutes and bylaws of debating societies, 1853-1855, including the Pine Grove Polemic Society, Philomathian Society, and the Sandtown (Sandtown was formerly known as Hyde) Polemic Society; an undated handwritten arithmetic book; miscellaneous poetry (1816, 1846 and undated); school notes; minutes of the Willis A. Sutton P.T.A. in Danburg, Ga.; Walter Sutton's Sunday School superintendent record book for 1891; obituaries for various Sutton and Wynn family members; several printed graduation exercise programs from Danburg High School; other miscellaneous writings; and a few photographs.
Papers in the collection indicate that Walter Sutton was having financial difficulties in the late 1890s and early 1900s. In 1897 and later in the 1920s, he was reminded by his creditors that he had outstanding debts. Legal papers from the 1930s also indicate he was suffering from monetary adversities. A petition filed by the American Agricultural Chemical Society for non-payment of debts (1934, Jan. 12) was apparently paid off later that year by selling some of Sutton's land. The agricultural depression during this period was probably a factor in his economic downturn.
Includes one diary maintained by Harriet T. Danforth (1858 Jan.3-1859 Nov. 30?) and her daughter Emma Danforth Wynn (1860? Aug. 26-Dec. 13), and two of Walter Sutton's. Sutton's notations include financial information.
Chiefly personal letters from members of the Danforth, Wynn, and Sutton families, primarily containing news about family members, friends, and social activities. A series of letters from 1812 to 1814 concern George Reab, Jr. The bulk of the correspondence (1883-1886) is courtship letters between Walter L. Sutton and Hattie L. Wynn before their marriage in 1886.
Contracts, bonds, indentures, and deeds primarily relating to members of the Wynn and Danforth families. Papers dating about 1926 to 1936 pertain chiefly to to Walter L. Sutton.
Account books, including ledgers, daybooks, and a cashbook; personal and business receipts; and promissory notes. The W. L. Sutton Company ledgers and daybooks spanning the years 1907 to 1939 comprise the bulk of the financial papers (40 volumes). There are also three volumes containing records for the Heard and Sutton Company in which Sutton was a partner with his brother-in-law Thomas V. Heard. Each of the 43 Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton Company account books has been arbitrarily numbered. Therefore volume numbers given below refer to those numbers. Loose materials laid into these volumes have been removed and placed in folders.
There are four miscellaneous account books, 1884-1919, in which Sutton maintained a variety of financial data for different products. For example, one of these which reads ‚ÄúLumber Book, 1915‚Äù on the outside also contains accounting records for other products. Some of these account books include information pertaining to both business and personal expenses.
The series includes Samuel Danforth's ledger (1836-1838), one maintained by Harriet Brown Danforth (1857-1860), and one pertaining to the estate of Samuel K. Wynn (1907)
The unbound financial papers, with the exception of the laid in materials from the W. L. Sutton Company account books, have been placed in chronological order at the beginning of the Financial Papers series. The account books that do not relate to Heard and Sutton and the W. L. Sutton Company are filed next. The Heard and Sutton and W. L. Sutton Company account books that will fit into boxes have been arranged primarily in chronological order. Loose papers from several of these volumes have been placed in folders next to the boxed account books. The volumes which would not fit into boxes are located at the end of the boxed papers.
A handwritten arithmetic book, debating society minutes and bylaws, poetry, school notes, minutes of the Willis A. Sutton P.T.A. in Danburg, Ga. (part of this volume also contains the receipts and disbursements to the W. L. Sutton estate), W. L. Sutton's Sunday school superintendent record book, and a few obituaries of Sutton family members.
Chiefly closing exercise programs for Danburg High School. Includes information relating to events at Shorter College, Rome, Ga., and a pocket size almanac.
This collection contains family, personal, literary, and business correspondence of Louis Augustin Thomas Taveau (1790-ca. 1857), planter; of his wife, Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball Taveau (d. 1847); of their son, Augustin Louis Taveau (1828-1886), planter and author; of the latter's wife, Delphine (Sprague) Taveau (1832-ca. 1909); and of relatives and friends.
Papers prior to 1829 consist of a copy of the will of William Swinton made in 1741 and letters between the Swinton and Girardeau families recording Charleston events, the marriage settlement of Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball and Louis Augustin Thomas Taveau, and a copy of the will of Caroline Olivia (Ball) Laurens, daughter of Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball Taveau by her first marriage. Beginning in June 1829, and continuing for more than a year, the collection contains letters to Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball Taveau from her husband, Louis Augustin Thomas Taveau, while he was in France endeavoring to settle his father's estate.
In 1838 the papers begin to center around Augustin Louis Taveau (1828-1886), while in school at Mt. Zion Academy, Winnsboro, South Carolina and while later studying law and dabbling in poetry while living in or near Charleston, South Carolina and touring Europe from 1852 to 1854. From 1855 until 1860, the papers contain correspondence with the publisher of Taveau's book of poems, The Magic Word and Other Poems (Boston, 1855), published under the pseudonym of 'Alton,' correspondence with the Sprague family in an effort to obtain the remainder of Delphine (Sprague) Taveau's patrimony, papers relative to a mortgage on Oaks Plantation held by Robert Hume, letters relative to the failure of Simons Brothers in Charleston in 1857 and the consequent loss of Oaks Plantation, letters of Taveau describing a trip to New Orleans (Louisiana), with his slaves and their sale, letters of Taveau to his wife describing various plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana, and a series of letters in 1860 to and from Taveau, Ralph Elliott, and Clifford Simons regarding a supposedly slighting remark involving Taveau's credit.
Late in 1861 Taveau settled on a farm near Abbeville, South Carolina, but soon afterwards joined the Confederate Army. His career in the army continued until 1865. Letters to his wife during the war period, include Taveau's accounts of his efforts as a soldier, descriptions of Charleston during the war, copy of a letter evidently intended for a newspaper, protesting that gentlemen of birth and education could get no commissions in the army while sons of tinkers could; accounts of his duties as guard at the "SubTreasury" in Charleston; papers relating to an effort to permit Delphine (Sprague) Taveau and her three children to sail for Europe in December, 1864; and oaths of allegiance and passports issued to Taveau and his wife and children, March 3, 1865, for going to Boston, Massachusetts.
Immediately after the war, the papers contain letters and copies of letters published in the New York Tribune by Taveau under the title of A Voice from South Carolina, stating that former Southern leaders could not be trusted and condemning them for having allowed conscription. Included also are drafts of letters from Taveau to Horace Greeley and William Aiken; letters relative to Taveau's efforts to get the position of collector of the customs at Charleston; accounts of an interview of Taveau with Greeley and with President Andrew Johnson; letter of June 25, 1865, describing conditions in Charleston and Columbia, South Carolina; a copy of a petition signed by Henry L. Benbow, A. R. Chisholm, William Gregg, and Taveau begging President Johnson to appoint a provisional governor for South Carolina; several letters to and from William Aiken; and letters written by Taveau to his wife in the autumn of 1865 from various points in Virginia including areas near Richmond, Alexandria, and Warrenton, where he had gone in search of a farm.
Taveau and his family finally settled in 1866 on a farm near Chaptico in St. Mary's County, Maryland. From 1866 until 1881, the correspondence is concerned with efforts to obtain patents and money for developing a revolving harrow and a steam plow invented by Taveau; efforts to obtain money for meeting the annual interest on the sum owed for the farm near Chaptico; and accounts of Taveau's literary activities. There are letters and papers bearing on Taveau's efforts to interest the Ames Plow Company, as well as manufacturers of farm machinery in Dayton, Ohio, in his inventions and drawings and circulars relative to the inventions. From 1878 until Taveau's death, his papers contain manuscripts of his poems and correspondence with many leading publishing houses regarding the publication of Montezuma (published in New York in 1883 and again in 1931). Thereafter much of his correspondence consists of letters of thanks from various relatives, friends, and well-known literary figures for copies of Montezuma sent them by Taveau; and letters to newspapers and magazines submitting his poems and usually followed by letters of rejection.
Throughout the collection there are many letters from the mother and sisters of Delphine (Sprague) Taveau, usually in French. Letters of her brothers, however, were generally in English. Among the correspondents are William Aiken, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Johnston Pettigrew, William Gilmore Simms, Joseph Smith, and John R. Thompson. Also included are some Unpublished Letters of John R. Thompson and Augustin Louis Taveau, William and Mary College Quarterly, XVI (April 1936), 206-221; Letters of Georgia Editors and a Correspondent, Georgia Historical Quarterly, XXIII (June, 1939), [170-176.]
This collection consists of personal papers; prison and legal materials; post-prison materials; organizational papers; business flyers; community and campaign ephemera; creative works and writings by Taylor; correspondence; and news clippings.
Taylor's Personal Papers consist of items like his birth certificate, school diplomas, and certificates. These are the only materials in the collection that date from his childhood and youth. The Prison and Legal Materials Series includes items such as police reports and accounts of Taylor's burglary in 1967, San Quentin Inmate Advisory Council certificates, and grades from his classes at the prison's school. Though this is a small series, it offers insight into Taylor's activities while at the San Quentin and Folsom prisons from 1968-1973.
Post-Prison Materials include information about Taylor's activities following parole in 1973. His work for the Thresholds program is documented through letters of thanks from Oakland officials and school districts, as well as booklets about the program itself. Other materials include items from Taylor's post-prison job search, such as his work for KDIA radio. Later materials offer insight into Taylor's passions following his parole. There are several flyers and other promotional material for Taylor's record store, Oldies But Goodies, as well as documentation of a business loan. The series also documents the political scene of San Francisco in the 1970s, including rosters and candidate lists, materials from the Black Book business directory, and flyers from Taylor's run for the Oakland Community Action Agency's administrative board. This series also has the only portion of the collection dealing with Taylor's life post-1981; travel documents suggest that he was at least visiting the Caribbean in 1999-2000. Finally, there are some miscellaneous materials in this series, including flyers, leaflets, and other general materials that document life in the San Francisco area but do not relate specifically to Taylor's activities.
Materials in the Organizational Papers derive from the Sisters of Motivation, started by Taylor while in prison, and Community Concern for Prisoners, which he appears to have founded after his release from jail. This series includes sign-up sheets, letters of support from public officials and community members, and general information about the organizations. It also contains flyers and bulletins from the CCP's various events, including one with Maya Angelou and other prominent San Francisco artists and writers.
Taylor's Writings and Creative Works include a wide range of materials, beginning with poems and songs and ending with political reflections and essays on black culture. Common themes are the oppression that he faced in prison, the beauty of black women, and the struggle of African Americans for justice. Some of these materials were published as letters to the editor or as poems in black newspapers; others were simply compiled by Taylor into booklets.
The Correspondence Series comprises the largest part of the collection. The original order, based on the writer and recipient of the letter, has been retained. Most of the correspondence dates from Taylor's time in prison from 1968-1973, but there are letters from both before and after. The outgoing correspondence from his time in prison is divided into four parts. The first is Taylor's general correspondence with family, friends, community organizations, politicians, and potential employers. The other three groups consist of Taylor's letters to three girlfriends: Barbara Cheatem, Carolyn Kitson, and Alice/Betty Jo (her full name is not clear).
The incoming correspondence makes up the majority of the Correspondence series. Incoming letters are divided into: general correspondence; the Black Scholar organization; Bill and Ella Carter; Barbara Cheatem; Patricia Dickens; family members (including his parents and his children); Doris Johnson; Carlyn Kitson; his lawyers; public officials; Verdia Rhone; Allyna Robinson; Dorothy Rodgers; Jesse and Dottie Taylor (Taylor's sister and brother-in-law); Marie Taylor (Taylor's wife); and Joni Wetzcher. The "General" incoming file includes materials about Taylor's job search, his parole hearings, requests for help in getting divorced, and other materials about his health and well-being in prison. Topics of note in the letters from his lawyers and public officials include references to Taylor's protest against censorship of black newspapers and the invasion of prisoner privacy in the mail screening procedures, especially at Folsom Prison. The majority of women writing to Taylor pen pals from the Sisters of Motivation program.
The collection is rounded out by the News Clippings Series, most of which dates from Taylor's post-prison life. Some of the clippings are of Taylor's published letters to the editor or his poems; several are general black culture and society articles that do not appear to relate specifically to Taylor. The remainder of the clippings are coverage of the Stinky Rapist case, both from mainstream and black newspapers.
Acquired as part of the Human Rights Archive at Duke University.
Includes forms and materials from the prison, such as Taylor's grade reports and San Quentin Inmate Advisory Council certificates, as well as police reports and accounts of the burglary that resulted in his being sent to prison in 1968.
Contains letters and program materials about the Thresholds juvenile delinquency program that Taylor worked for following parole. Also includes some job search materials; business flyers from his music store, Oldies But Goodies; and materials from his interest in political and community activism.
Includes sign-in sheets, membership rosters, and other materials from the Sisters of Motivation and the Community Concern for Prisoners organization. Taylor claims to have founded both programs and appears to have worked for them for a while following parole.
Materials in the correspondence series discuss all facets of Walter Taylor's life while in prison. It has been divided into incoming and outgoing correspondence, and then further divided by either subject or correspondent. Outgoing correspondence consists of carbon copies of letters. Incoming correspondence is a much larger sub-series. Correspondents are largely friends, girlfriends, and family members of Taylor. Subjects covered by these letters include Taylor's children and other family, activities by both parties, and Taylor's health. Several of the correspondents write of intimate feelings for Taylor, and he reciprocates in his outgoing letters. Many of the relationships appeared to have ended once he left prison.

Some articles were written by Tepe, but most are third-party scholarly journals, mainstream publications, or medical reports on the physical, mental, and emotional effects of abortion.
This collection consists principally of the apparently complete business papers and records, 1850-1863, of James Thomas, Jr. (1806-1882), one of the largest of antebellum tobacco manufacturers. In addition to an extensive business correspondence, numerous orders for tobacco from Maine, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Georgia, the Netherlands, England, and Australia are included, as well as prices current bulletins from firms throughout the world. The collection not only gives a detailed history of Thomas's enterprises, but affords much information on the tobacco industry in general and on other phases of the economic life of Virginia in the 1850s. Some of Thomas's private correspondence is also in the collection, including an occasional letter from such men as J. L. M. Curry and George Frederick Holmes. Some information is given on Thomas's aid to Basil Manly in his work with the Virginia Baptist Seminary (later the Univesity of Richmond), and on his financial assistance, which made it possible for the institution to remain open after the Civil War.
This collection houses the papers of William Tilghman (1756-1824), lawyer and chief justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania. They relate chiefly to his law practice in Maryland, 1783-1793, and to his service in the Maryland general assembly, 1788-1793, and include legal papers dealing with litigation, land sales, the collection of debts, notes, the settlement of estates, and other legal matters. Included are deeds, indentures, wills, estate records, court records, and other legal papers relating chiefly to Cecil, Kent, and Queen Anne counties, a roster, 1818-1819, of the citizens of Charles County, scattered papers pertaining to the Church of England in Maryland, occasional references to personal matters, and legal and business papers concerning the family, including papers dealing with loan transactions and with the settlement of the estate of William Tilghman.
The collection also has scattered papers of Tilghman's father, James Tilghman, a lawyer, several bills and accounts of St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland, and Charlotte Hall School, Charlotte Hall, Maryland, petitions and acts relating to Tilghman's career in the general assembly chiefly dealing with the settlement of local affairs, including the disposal of reserved lands, an evaluation of land in various counties, and an estimate of the cost of building a turnpike between Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D. C., and other papers dealing with legal and business matters.
The volumes are a digest, 1747-1760, of cases at law in which James Tilghman was an attorney, a System of Law concerning Estates by Richard Tilghman IV, legal notes kept by William Tilghman as a young man, and dockets of William Tilghman in the Kent County court for the March 1794 term.
The collection consists of genealogical information, correspondence, photographs, diaries, notebooks, and a manuscript autobiography relating to the Townsend family of Felchville, Vermont. The bulk of the correspondence between a large group of family members falls between 1830 and 1939; topics include family matters and spiritualism. One group of letters and a diary were written by a Union soldier, Francis Torrey Townsend, and relate to his experiences in Mississippi and Tennessee as a soldier with Company K, 13th Iowa Infantry. Other materials concern Bessie Meachum's teaching experiences with African-American children at the Beach Institute, Savannah, Ga., at the Lincoln Normal School, Marion, Ala., and at the Rio Grande Industrial School in Albuquerque, N.M.; some of this work was done through the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church. Some photographs also depict Tougaloo College in Miss., and Le Moyne College in Tenn. Other volumes include the early 20th century diaries of Torrey Townsend and his autobiography; an 1870 diary of Elisa Townsend; a 1892 diary of Mary Meachum; and several diaries and notebooks of Bessie Meachum.
Merchants' accounts, including daybooks, 1803-1806, and a record of cotton storage, 1825-1827, of William Trahern; and daybooks, 1806-1822, and an index of James Trahern.

They contain the autographs of the most eminent professors of the day: i.e., Samuel Gross, Franklin Bache, Benjamin Rush, Austin Flint, Samuel Jackson, S. Weir Mitchell, J. K. Mitchell, Charles D. and James A Meigs, John Barclay Biddle, et al. The St. Bartholomew's Hospital card is signed by Ludford Harvey, John P. Vicent, and John Abernethy, the latter (1764-1831) being an eminent English surgeon and founder of the Medical School of St Bartholomew's. The "Order of Lecture" cards from Jefferson Medical College and the University of Pennsylvania list curricula, faculty and their residences, schedules of lectures and texts.
Admittance cards, 1850-1853, are for courses at the Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia. They include two matriculation cards for William D. Watson of Chatham County, N.

The second letter, October 11, 1855, reports favorably on a book by Arthur de Gobineau on the inequalities between races (published by Lippincott in 1855), a work that advanced the notion of the superiority of the Aryan race and thus claimed that slavery was a moral and just system.

The Arlin Turner Papers, 1927-1980, span Turner's entire career as a scholar of American literature, from his undergraduate education at West Texas State University in 1927 to his death in 1980, when he was an instructor at Southwest Texas State University. The Turner Papers are comprised primarily of personal and professional correspondence with scholars and publishers of American literature. The correspondence includes letters, printed matter, reports, and minutes that Turner collected as a member or officer of organizations to which many of these literary scholars belonged. These materials, in addition to the clippings, printed materials and other writings Turner collected, provide insight into the development of the profession of American literary scholarship in the 1920s and 1930s; demonstrate the major concerns, issues, conflicts, and interests of its practitioners over the following four decades; and record research advancements and contributions to scholarship on the literary figures of most interest to Turner. The Turner Papers also document the development of high school, collegiate, and graduate level instruction in American literature through the organizational records and course materials, the latter of which include Turner's personal writings and research notes, subject files he collected, clippings, lecture notes, and other printed materials on various authors or genres of American literature. Finally, this collection provides glimpses into Turner's personal career and scholarly thought through the writings which are included, both those he presented orally as speeches or lectures, or those he published as articles or books. The Turner Papers are organized into five series: Correspondence, Course Materials, Organizations, Printed Material, and Writings and Speeches.
A student of the first generation of American literature scholars in the 1920s, Turner played an important role in the network of scholarly exchange that was vital to the emergence of the discipline in the decades following. Turner kept in contact with numerous colleagues in colleges and universities across the United States and throughout the world, including many former graduate students who later became influential literary scholars and critics themselves. The Correspondence Series, 1930-1980, documents Turner's role in this network of scholarly exchange. The Individuals Subseries, 1930-1980, includes Turner's most voluminous correspondents: American literature specialists and authors Gay Wilson Allen, John Q. Anderson, Louis Budd, Robert Cantwell, James B. Colvert, Eddie Gay Cone, Benjamin Franklin Fisher, Albert Mordell, Norman Holmes Pearson, William Stafford, and Edmund Wilson. The Publications Subseries, 1934-1979, contains portions of Turner's communications with editors, publishers, and presses primarily regarding article reviews or manuscript evaluations of others' work. This subseries also contains some information concerning Turner's own articles, manuscripts, and various published works. Correspondence, brochures, press releases, reports, and contractual information concerning Turner's speaking engagements or attendance at professional meetings is collected in the Conferences, Speeches, and Lectures Subseries, 1961-1978 (bulk 1961-1964). Miscellaneous materials comprised primarily of letters arranged by subject are assembled in the Other Correspondence Subseries, 1948-1979 and undated This subseries also contains research notes, memos, and printed material. These papers document Turner's visiting professor appointments and awards, as well as his interest in topics such as the Duke University Library, the Huntington Library, George W. Cable primary sources, and international scholars of American Literature.
The Course Materials Series, undated, is comprised of information Turner collected to aid in composing classroom lectures, and other teaching materials. He maintained an extensive set of files on American authors, which can be found in the Lecture Notes, By Author Subseries, undated Most files contain a brief biography of the author and list of his major compositions, but may also include copies of their works, a typescript of Turner's lecture on the author, and related materials such as clippings or Turner's handwritten research notes. Turner also collected files on genres of literature, delineated both by region, such as Louisiana or British literature, or by style, such as Short Stories or Recent Fiction. These can be found in the Lecture Notes, By Subject Subseries, undated The Class Files Subseries, undated, contains Turner's teaching materials including syllabi, quizes, and exams. These files pertain to courses Turner taught (or in a few early instances, took) in subjects including American Literature before the Civil War, Post-Civil War Literature, Hawthorne and Melville, American Humor, and Southern Literature. Specific course numbers and titles have been provided wherever possible.
Arlin Turner was an active leader and participant in many of the organizations associated with his profession and interests, which are chronicled in the Organizations Series, 1929-1979 (bulk 1936-1979). These scholarly groups developed policies, conducted studies, and otherwise governed the profession. Thus, Turner's influential positions in most of these associations render his thorough collection of organizational records both valuable and useful. Folders in this series primarily contain correspondence, minutes, memoranda, reports, and printed matter such as newsletters, brochures, and clippings. Most notable is Turner's work with the Modern Language Association (MLA), whose American Literature Section members are primarily responsible for the spread of American Studies programs across the globe. Turner's records also document his work with the South Atlantic Modern Language Association (SAMLA), the American Studies Association (ASA), and the Southeastern American Studies Association (SEASA). This series likewise chronicles Turner's leadership roles in the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).
Turner was also a member of the Committee for American Studies, the advisory group for the Conference Board of Associated Research Councils' (CBC) Committee for International Exchange of Persons (CIEP). The Organizations Series also includes files on the selection of Fulbright Scholars that he collected as a member of that committee. In addition, Turner served as chairman of this committee during the period in which the Loewenberg controversy consumed the CIEP's affairs. When Prof. Bert J. Loewenberg was denied a Fulbright Award in 1959 despite the committee's recommendation, its members threatened to resign in protest against allegations that Loewenberg's past political activity was to blame. Thus, significant amounts of correspondence from fellow committee members Ray Billington, John Hope Franklin, Harvey Wish, and Charles Barker regarding the controversy is found in this series.
Arlin Turner accumulated a significant number of clippings, newsletters, pamphlets, reprints, and publications related to American Literature. These are collected in the Printed Material Series, undated Included in this series are materials from the Educational Testing Service (ETS), memorabilia from Turner's time at the University of Hull in England, literary magazines, and miscellaneous clippings primarily regarding Southern writers (especially North Carolina authors), William Faulkner, and the New Critics (a.k.a. The Fugitives).
The Writings and Speeches Series, 1938-1980 and undated (bulk 1964-1977), contains copies of Turner's significant oral presentations and other written work, both published and unpublished, in addition to some writings of other authors he accumulated. Files from Turner's speaking engagements include both correspondence and typed copies of his presentations. This series also contains unidentified speech notes and writings, in addition to a bound typescript with handwritten edits of Turner's Nathaniel Hawthorne: A biography . Writings about Turner, including obituaries, tributes, his curriculum vita and the like, are also found in the Writings and Speeches Series.
The Correspondence Series has been organized into four subseries: Individuals; Publications; Conferences, Speeches, Lectures; and Other Correspondence. Only the first of these retains Turner's arrangement.
The Individuals Subseries is comprised of correspondence between Turner and other scholars in American literature, students and former students, and editors and publishers. Chief topics in the letters include recent research, manuscript evaluations, speaking engagements and conference attendance, personal updates, and occasional recommendations and peer reviews (SENSITIVE). To preserve original order, this subseries has been maintained as a discrete unit--arranged alphabetically by the correspondent's last name in the same way Turner kept the files. Consequently, there may be significant overlap with other correspondence subseries. For example, correspondence with a publisher may be filed by an editor or publisher's last name in this subseries or by the publication title or the press that produced it in the Publications Subseries.
The Publications Subseries is comprised of Turner's correspondence to publishers, editors, and presses regarding publications. Included are reviews of books for multiple journals, multiple reviews written for single journals, manuscript evaluations for various university presses, and correspondence regarding some of Turner's own publications. Arranged alphabetically by publication title or press name.
Correspondence regarding Turner's speaking engagements and attendance at professional gatherings is collected in the Conferences, Speeches, and Lectures Subseries. This subseries is arranged chronologically.
Miscellaneous files that contain primarily correspondence can be found in the Other Correspondence Subseries. Many of these files relate either to Duke University or to universities at which Turner served as a visiting professor. These are organized by the subject or addressee of the correspondence and arranged alphabetically, with correspondence from international scholars in American literature filed at the end.
The Course Materials Series is divided into three subseries. The first two subseries are comprised of Lecture Notes, arranged by Author and Subject. The last contains Class Files. Only the first of these subseries preserves Turner's original arrangement.
Each folder in the Lecture Notes, By Author Subseries contains the materials on various literary figures that Turner appears to have collected for classroom use. Almost all of these include a brief typed page containing the author's birth and death dates and significant writings. Most are also accompanied by a brief typed biography and summary of the author's contribution to literature. Some folders may also contain copies of an author's works, especially poetry, or newspaper clippings about them, in addition to Turner's personal research. These are arranged alphabetically in the same order that Turner filed them.
The Lecture Notes, By Subject Subseries contain Turner's collected notes or clippings on general subjects in literature, delineated either by geographic region or genre. This subseries also includes files on a few non-American writers (specifically William Shakespeare, John Milton, and Edmund Spenser). The Minor Southern Authors folder, although it contains unfinished notes pages for individual authors, was not originally filed in the Lecture Notes By Author subseries and therefore is filed by subject in this subseries.

The Desarrolla Records span 2014-2016 and include founding documents, organization information, records of the marketing and networking teams, and brand image materials. Founding documents consist of iterations of the organization's constitution and by-laws. Organizational records include organizational charts, a vision and recruitment video, and a year-end presentation describing progress made. Records of the marketing and networking teams include marketing metrics, survey results, and materials used to promote the organization and its mission.
The Duke Human Rights Center at Franklin Humanities Institute records include promotional and other event-related materials, project information, grant materials, and other administrative materials. Included are posters, DVDs, correspondence, and other materials. Most materials are publicly-distributed promotional materials.
Collection consists of a scrapbook and several issues of the Belvoir Castle pertaining to the amateur athletic career of Dick Groat with inclusive dates 1948-1955. The scrapbook contains clippings pertaining to Groat's career at Duke University while a two-sport student-athlete in baseball and basketball, although a majority of the material pertains to his basketball career. The clippings document athletic contests including baseball and basketball tournaments, the numerous awards and honors received by Groat while at Duke, and his social life. Issues of the Belvoir Castle, the newsletter of the Engineer Center of the United States Army located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, contain articles pertaining to Groat's two years in several armed service baseball and basketball leagues while in the United States Army from 1953-1955. The actual creator of the collection is unknown.
A report and presentation slide regarding social and gender relations among undergraduates. The report was released in April 2014.
Contains negatives and some matching prints of University-related subjects, including people (i.e. faculty, trustees, students, etc.), buildings, construction, schools and departments. While dates range from 1855-1995, it is necessary to note that the majority of the negatives are copy negatives, rather than originals. While a good number of original negatives are included in this collection, the user should be aware that some of the corresponding dates refer to when the copy negative was made, not when the original picture was taken. In most cases, it is noted on the negative sleeve if the negative is a copy or an original. Furthermore, users should be aware that some negatives are of published material. For instance, several pages from the Chanticleer and the Chronicle were photographed and the negatives were kept. On some of the sleeves, users will find notes presumably made by the photographer regarding print quality.
An attempt was made to bring a cohesiveness to the negative collection for easier patron and staff access. The negatives are arranged in the following series: Subject Negatives, General Negatives, Building Negatives, Construction Negatives, Faculty Negatives, Medical Center Negatives, and Numbered Negatives. The Numbered Negatives are copy negatives pulled from the larger University Archives Photograph Collection. Any future additions to the negative collection will follow the numbering format.
The collection includes photographs taken for the creation of the book Duke Chapel Illuminated as well as some materials related to the production of the book. The majority of the photographs are of the stained glass windows, statues, and carvings in, and views of the chapel; also included are photographs of events in and around the chapel, as well as images from the Duke University Archives of people, events, and scenes from the history of the Chapel. A small amount of material related to the layout and production of the book Duke Chapel Illuminated is also included.
The book The Architecture of Duke University by William Blackburn, 1939, was used to number and identify the stained glass windows, as well as provide information on the location of statues and carvings. A digital copy of this book is available via HathiTrust.
This series includes images of the stained glass windows in the Chapel. Images are grouped by window, and arranged numerically by window number as assigned and described in the Architecture of Duke University, Appendix A.
Melchizedek, David, St. Longinus, Gideon, Hezekiah, Joshua, Judas Maccabeus, Jehoshaphat
Windows behind preacher's desk, St. Mark (winged lion), St. Lucas (winged ox)
This series includes images of statues and carvings in and just outside the Chapel's entrance as well as views and objects in the Chapel's interior. Images are primarily grouped according to the subject's location within the Chapel, as described in the Architecture of Duke University and Duke Chapel Illuminated.

The collection includes many of the photographs taken by Duke Photography in the course of its work as the official photographic service of Duke University. Photographs include images of administrators, students, faculty, staff, visiting speakers, artists, and celebrities, campus and classroom scenes, athletic events, buildings and construction on campus, theatrical and other performances, members of the Board of Trustees, parties and events, and many other subjects.
Photographs include both analog and digital formats; the majority of the analog photographs are on 35-mm, 120-mm, and 4x5 film, although other photographic mediums may be present. Most jobs include all or most of the original images and may or may not indicate which images were selected for use. Some indication of which images were selected for use were written on the original storage envelopes, which have not been kept as part of the collection. These notes may be indicated in the scope and contents note for that job number. Also included are notes when it is known there are missing items, instances of mislabeled photographs, and any additional materials included with the job number.
Job numbers may contain images from multiple events. Multiple job numbers are listed in the finding aid but only the first listing of each job contains a physical description of what is included in the folder. Some folders may contain multiple job numbers. It may not be indicated which images are from which event.
The description for images included in this finding aid was provided by Duke Photography in the course of their record-keeping and is incomplete. Broad subject categories divised by Duke Photography were often applied to jobs, but this categorization was not always applied or consistent. The vast majority of job numbers have some description indicating the topic, event, or individuals featured, but does not include identification of every individual, event, or date. Some job numbers do not have any description provided.

Frank Clyde Brown was the supervisor of construction of the new buildings on the West Campus of Duke University from 1925-1930, as well as a literature professor at Duke. The files in this series pertain mainly to planning the construction of new buildings on the Duke Campus. The biographical note in for the Frank Clyde Brown Papers (located in the Duke University Archives) notes:
"Between 1924 and 1930, Brown was deeply absorbed in the expansion of Trinity College into Duke University, serving as a member of the Building Committee of the Board of Trustees and as the first comptroller of the University. As comptroller, he acted as the liaison for architects, contractors, suppliers, administrators, and faculty in the designing, construction, and equipping of the redesigned East Campus, which became the Woman's College, and of the completely new West Campus. Brown is credited with contributing many original ideas to the building plans, foremost of which was the discovery of the nearby Hillsborough, N.C. stone and the recommendation that this material be utilized in the construction of the Gothic West Campus. He also served as university marshal, planning all major formal celebrations and entertaining numerous distinguished visitors to the new university."
Brown's files in this series mainly contain correspondence, plans, contracts, some architectural drawings, and other materials related to construction. Several files have more relation to his interest in literature and his position as professor. Researchers should be aware that the materials in this series and the materials in the Frank Clyde Brown Papers are very closely related, and both collections may need to be examined.

The Duke Construction Company was formed in 1927 on the advisement of the Building Committee of the Duke Endowment. In a letter to Duke president R.L. Flowers, N.A. Cocke, Assistant Secretary of the Duke Endowment, wrote:
"It is hardly practicable to conduct the operations in the name of the trustees of The Duke Endowment for the reason that The Duke Endowment has no separate entity apart from the trustees, it not being a corporation. On the other hand while the title to the property is in Duke University the Will and Trust Indenture contemplate that the trustees shall erect the buildings for Duke University and turn same over when completed. With the idea, therefore, of establishing some medium for the purpose of carrying on this construction, it has occured to us that it would be wise to form a corporation, known as the "Duke Construction Company" for the sole purpose of constructing these buildings, with a nominal capital stock so that it will clearly appear that this corporation is merely an agency for carrying out this work."
The Duke Construction Company series consists mainly of financial and corporate records, such as articles of incorporation, tax reports, and a large invoice register. Actual construction plans can be found in the Frank C. Brown Files series and the S.W. Myatt Files series.
The Duke Construction Company was active in the 1930s and into the 1940s, but it then became dormant and was officially dissolved in 1957.

The files consist of correspondence, memoranda, minutes, proposals, reports, clippings, reference material, speeches, and other records.
The Subject files document Sanford's role as President of Duke, and also his continued interest in many fields including education, politics, and the arts.
The records of the Sanford administration record the policies and actions of the University in academic planning, athletics, campus planning and the physical growth of the university, development and alumni affairs, student life, and the University's interaction with Durham and North Carolina during the 1970s and 1980s. Among the more notable academic planning matters documented are the early years of both the Fuqua School of Business and the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs, now the Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy.

The material concerns the progress of the Epoch Campaign and other fundraising efforts, such as the Loyalty Fund, 1979-1980.
Sanford's commitment to the arts can be seen in the files on the American Musical Theater Center, 1977-1980 and the American Dance Festival, 1977-1985. The recruitment and arrival of the Festival at Duke in 1977 began a long relationship that has continued for over 20 year.
The records also document student life, but to a lesser extent than other topics. Issues related to student activism of the early 1970s are found within Student Unrest files. These records include clippings and a scrapbook documenting the student takeover the Allen Building in February 1969, before Sanford's presidency. Material from May 1970 largely concerns student actions on campus in response to the Kent State shootings. Letters of approval or disapproval from alumni and student parents on these and other topics are included as well. The records also document another aspect of student life that Sanford faced: the use of illegal drugs. In 1971 Sanford rejected a proposal from the Associated Students of Duke University calling for a relaxed stance by the administration on the use of drugs, particularly marijuana.
Student conduct at athletic events is also documented. On January 17, 1984 Uncle Terry Sanford sent An Avuncular Letter to students chiding them for their inappropriate behavior during a home basketball game with the University of Maryland. The file contains the original letter, many newspaper articles detailing the behavior, letters to Sanford from concerned parents and alumni, and Sanford's response to each.
The major change in residential life during Sanford's tenure was the 1972 merger of the Woman's College with Trinity College for Men to create the present Trinity College of Arts and Sciences. While the school had long been co-educational, the merger completed the switch to co-residency. Included are correspondence from alumni, administrators, and other institutions regarding the pros and cons of the merger. There is also some correspondence regarding the future of the Woman's College administrators.
Sanford's interest in all levels of education is found throughout the files as well. During the 1960s and 1970s he served on the Board of Directors of the Learning Institute of North Carolina (LINC), a non-profit agency dedicated to improving education through experimentation and research. The LINC records, dating from 1965-1979, consist of correspondence, minutes, reports, and reference material.
The records also illustrate how national and international issues played out on campus. Among these are investment policies in South Africa, in which students, faculty, and the administration began questioning Duke's support of U.S. businesses with investments in South Africa. Regarding the Panama Canal Treaty (1977-1978), Sanford attempted to put together a panel debate with Jesse Helms, Henry Kissinger, and others participating. Correspondence is included with these two, President Jimmy Carter, and others.
Among the other major issues of the Sanford administration were the Nixon Library Controversy, 1981-1982, (3.5 boxes). These files concern the debate over whether Duke should house Richard Nixon's presidential library. Sanford argued in favor of the library as a valuable archival repository. Letters of support and disapproval from faculty, alumni, and other sources in and out of the University community are included. Correspondence dates from as early as 1971.
In 1981 Duke co-sponsored and Sanford a this public series of speeches and debates by a bipartisan group of political leaders concerned with reforming the process of nominating presidential candidates (Duke University Forum on Presidential Nominations).

Jordan, and Robert Strauss.
Soviet-American Track Meet files consist of correspondence, minutes of meetings, committee lists, schedules, and planning for the twelfth annual event held the first week in July 1974.

Sanford assisted in founding the Education Commission of the States in 1965/66. Headquartered in Denver, Col., the Commission provides research and advice to assist states and school systems in long-range planning and decision-making.
As Governor, Sanford was instrumental in the founding and early years of the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, N.C. Included is correspondence related to the Sanford Scholarships, a program begun in 1975 awarding four full-tuition scholarships named in his honor. Sanford also served on the Advisory Board of the State Zoo Authority in the early 1970s during the planning of the North Carolina Zoological Park (Asheboro). The files include correspondence regarding proposed site locations.
Among Sanford's correspondents were Walter Cronkite, Doris Duke, James E. Holshouser, Hubert H. Humphrey, James B. Hunt, James G. Martin III, George McGovern, Richard Nixon, and Robert W. Scott

Files are included on courses Sanford taught within the Public Policy Studies Department at Duke from 1993-1997, most notably a course titled "Creativity in State Government". Syllabi, handouts, lists of students, and some correspondence are included. These files contain student identifiable data, and are subject to federal privacy legislation.
The records show Sanford's continued interest in and opinions on various issues, including political ones. Examples include the Nicaraguan Canal project, poverty, and racism. Within the Racism file is a 1997 memo from Sanford to John Hope Franklin, Professor Emeritus of History at Duke University and chair of President Clinton's National Advisory Panel on Race, outlining his plans to begin an association to help promote improved race relations. Sanford mentioned National Good Neighbor Council as a possible title.
Sanford's day-to-day activities during the 1990s are documented throughout these files. Folders labeled Journal contain loose-leaf paper with daily appointments and schedules detailing meetings, dinners, travel plans, and leisure activities. Often, Sanford would write notes on the particular meeting/event (wrote before and/or after). In 1993 Sanford kept a bound journal for a week in February. Other files documenting Sanford's daily activities include folders of telephone messages and two rolodexes of addresses and business cards.
Other significant records include Sanford's Cyber Bookstore project. This was intended to create a means of purchasing publications over the World Wide Web similar to the Amazon.com. There are also reports, drafts, and proposals from the Ethics Review Commission of the United States Senate, 1993-1994, and files on his support for the Airborne and Special Operations Museum project in Fayetteville, N.C.
Correspondents include President Bill Clinton, to whom Sanford voiced his opinion or expressed his support; and Howard Covington, Sanford's biographer. Sanford sent Covington thoughts or remembrances that he felt should be included in the biography, or he would write in response to Covington's questions. Among the recollections include a detailed account of Sanford's decision to endorse John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign.
Two of the three boxes of writings consist of hand-written and typed drafts, research notes, a synopsis, and bibliographical material for Sanford's unfinished historical novel, Top of the World. Sanford worked on the novel from 1994-1998 and drafts of the first six chapters at the time of his death are included. According to an article in the Raleigh News and Observer (Jan. 10, 1994, p.3-A), Sanford did not think it would be completed until the 21st century. The third box contains drafts, notes, and additional material on three Sanford manuscripts. They include the unfinished works The Lasting Lyndon (1991) on the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, and Out of the Valley, (1975), surveying public policies; Sanford referred to the latter work as "an autobiographical political platform". The file also includes the manuscript of Outlive Your Enemies: (Commack, N.Y.: Nova Sciences Publishers, 1996), Sanford's study on aging and growing old gracefully.
A final box labeled Miscellaneous contains primarily Democratic Party-related material from the 1980s and a note to incorporate them into the records.
The personal and political papers of Terry Sanford consist of correspondence, memoranda, manuscripts, newspaper clippings, reference material, printed matter, audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and a scrapbook that document his personal and public life. Also present are correspondence, memoranda, clippings, speeches, statements, drafts, press releases, and printed matter documenting Terry Sanford's campaigns for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972 and 1976, including a large set of film recordings used for the 1972 campaign created by Drew Associates. Records documenting Sanford's study of the future role of state governments in society and in the federal system are present as is material concerning the Legislative Library Project. Sanford's work with the Democratic Charter Commission is also included.
The personal and political papers of Terry Sanford consist of correspondence, memoranda, manuscripts, newspaper clippings, reference material, printed matter, audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and a scrapbook.

Correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports, printed matter and other material concerning the Legislative Library Project of Legis 50 / The Center for Legislative Improvement.
Formed in 1966 as the Citizens Conference on State Legislatures, the organization examined state legislatures and prepared strategies to enhance their effectiveness. Terry Sanford served on the Board of Trustees in the late 1960s and later as an honorary Board member. Initiated in 1976, the Library Project attempted to develop a series of publications addressing the history and operation of American State governments in order to raise public interest in legislative reform. Sanford chaired the project committee and was named editor-in-chief of the series. Originally, Duke University Press was to play a major role in the publication. The Library Project struggled to get off the ground due to a number of factors including decisions on authors and publication, and financial concerns. The project folded in 1980 as Legis 50 filed for bankruptcy.
Earlier material in these records, 1966-1975, consists of correspondence, memoranda, agendas, minutes, and annual reports while Sanford served on the Board of Trustees. Material from 1976-1980 concerns the Library Project and includes grant proposals and correspondence with Legis 50 staff and potential authors. Also included is a memo for the record concerning the content and importance of the files.

The Commission was established by the 1972 Democratic Convention to draft a charter for the Democratic Party, the first in the party's history. The Charter established national structures and guidelines for the party on issues such as leadership, membership, and education. It was approved during the midterm convention of December 1974 and went into effect in 1980.
The records, though largely unorganized, document Sanford and the Commission's efforts from 1972-1974. Includes folders on individual states, which often contain lists of delegates and material on individual state conferences or hearings (including agendas, discussions, and summaries of proceedings) held to discuss the proposed Charter. Sanford usually attended these state conferences and delivered the opening and/or closing remarks. Other material consists of Commission member lists, questionnaires on party structure and charter proposals, and Commission-related newspaper clippings. The correspondence is not foldered together, but spread throughout the records. Correspondents include President Jimmy Carter, then Governor of Georgia; Robert Strauss, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee; members of the Commission; and Democratic members of Congress.
Included among the approximately 20 original reel to reel films and audiotapes and 20 audiocassettes are session recordings from Commission conferences (in Colorado, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington D.C., and Wisconsin); and interviews with members of the Commission for a proposed public relations project in 1974 (not completed). Most films and cassettes are labeled and in fair condition.
The photographs and negatives span Sanford's career. Photographs are arranged and foldered by subject, though some subjects are vague (people and political for example). Others include: Duke University Activities, Functions; 1972 Presidential Campaign; FBI; Gubernatorial Years; and University of North Carolina Law School. Among the individuals: Jimmy Carter, Andy Griffith, J. Edgar Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Soviet Premier Kosygin, Carl Sandburg, Strom Thurmond, Harry S. Truman, John Wayne, and Sanford's family and friends. For additional photographs see the general photograph collection in the Duke University Archives.

The records of the Commission on University Governance span the years 1969 to 1971, with most of the material dating from 1969-1970 academic year. The collection is organized into two series: materials created by the Commission, and materials collected by the Commission.
The records generated by the Commission on University Governance consist primarily of minutes and transcripts of its official meetings, including supplementary materials distributed for discussion at these meetings. Typed transcript drafts exist for meetings 1 through 19, and this series contains minutes for all 34 meetings. Also included in this series are two copies of each of the Commission's three Interim Reports (Board of Trustees, Central Administration, and Departmental Governance), as well as drafts of these reports. Other official Commission records include information on the Commission's members and clippings from the Chronicle, Durham Morning Herald, and Durham Sun dated September 30, 1969 to April 16, 1970 concerning the work of the Commission. Correspondence not included with Commission minutes is divided into two folders: 1) letters dated April to September 1969, all regarding the establishment of the Commission, and 2) official correspondence dated after that time, including a January 1970 introduction to the Commission's activities for new Duke President Terry Sanford and a January 1971 response to the Commission's Interim Reports from the Provost.
The Commission on University Governance amassed a significant collection of reference materials for use in formulating its reports, which are roughly arranged into subseries. It appears that members of the Commission twice attempted to catalog and collate these materials, as two indexes entitled "Materials on Hand" and "Table of Contents" are a part of this series. However, neither index is accompanied by a complete set of the materials listed on it. To preserve original order, the sections of listed materials that are present have been identified and retained, even when they duplicate each other. Printed matter that was not a part of either of these subseries falls into two categories: reports and other matter from Duke committees, schools, and organizations, and printed matter that was created by other universities and organizations. This series also contains several bibliographies, arranged both by subject and by format, as well as periodical abstracts, alphabetized by author, donated to the Commission from the Special Committee on Student Residential Life. Also present in this series are the complete minutes of the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, known as the Committee of Twelve, which met nineteen times between October 1969 and March 1970, when it was disbanded.
University Archives also has catalogued copies of the Commission's three Interim Reports:

Much of the collection is made up of folders Woodhall labeled memorabilia, grouped by month, which include correspondence, copies of newsclippings, Office of Information Services releases, invitations, programs, and other materials. For each month, Woodhall wrote a brief summary of the events and activities that occurred, which sometimes includes commentary or reflection, usually succinct. Most of these events and activities are represented to some degree in the folder.
1969 folders include materials about student protests, including the Allen Building Takeover, and administrative activities around Woodhall's appointmentment as the first Chancellor in the wake of President Knight's announcement of retirement. These folders also include a large number of newsclippings from around the county related to student protests, student involvement in academia, and administrative activities at Duke and elsewhere. 1969 and 1970 folders include some materials about the retirement of Douglas Knight and the selection of Terry Sanford as President of Duke University.

The bulk of the memorabilia is made up of news releases and newsclippings. Much of the original material is related to the Medical Center. A smaller portion is related to Woodhall's activities as the Special Assistant to the President and then as Chancellor Pro Tem of the University.

Collection comprises a photograph album maintained by an unidentified wealthy, possibly British, family; handwritten captions appear in several different hands. The 159 photographs either document family travel as souvenirs, or document both their travel and photograph collecting, because many of the photographs are albumen prints by famous late-19th-century photographers, including Bonfils, Zangaki, Samuel Bourne, Francis Frith, and others not identified except by the presence of their negative numbers and captions on the photograph.
From these photographers there are images of Israel; Syria; Palestine; Jerusalem; Athens, Greece; and Agra, India, along with photographs of statues and other artifacts recovered in archaeological digs. Other photographs in the album were probably taken by family members, first in Venice, then in various places, including Scotland, England, and Jamaica. Among these photographs are albumen and cyanotype prints. Photographs in the album date somewhere between 1850 and 1897, and range in size from 1.5 x 2-inches to 8.5 x 11.5 inches. Acquired as part of the Archive of Documentary Arts.
Pages 138-186 of the album contain family photographs, incuding 46 albumen and 30 cyanotype photographs of individuals, groups, and animals, as well as a few photographs taken in Jamaica, Scotland, England, and other locations. The majority of these prints are 3.5x4.5-inches, although a few are 1.5 x 2-inches and up to 8x10-inches. The photographs are often accompanied by handwritten captions, and are dated between 1892-1897. A few photographs and captions have been removed from this section of the album. A photograph list has been housed with the item.
Collection comprises forty gelatin silver exhibit prints and two vintage prints of images taken by photographer James Van Der Zee, known for his portraits and documentation of daily life in Harlem, N.Y., especially during the Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s). There are views of parades, athletic teams, a Baptist group, a first-grade Harlem classroom, and the interior of Van Der Zee's studio, as well as fictionalized settings and poses conveying hopes, dreams, and humorous situations. Included is a self-portrait of the photographer playing the violin, circa 1930. Other subjects include an elegant couple in raccoon coats; a 1923 soldier; the New York Black Giants baseball team; a female impersonator; a man in an open funeral casket with a superimposed poem extolling fatherhood; a group of African American Hebrews in front of the Moorish Zionist Temple; Marcus Garvey in regalia during a parade; a Garveyite with his son; entrepreneurs Madam C.J. Walker and her daughter A'Lelia in their "Dark Tower" salon with a large group of friends; boxer Jack Johnson; and a double exposure portrait of entertainer Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.

The exhibit prints were created from original negatives chiefly from 1981-1983, under the supervision of James Van Der Zee until his passing in 1983. Others were printed around 1987 by his widow Donna Mussenden Van Der Zee. All prints bear titles, dates, edition information, and copyright on verso.

The H.

Waters aimed to film as many residents in each community as possible, often setting up his camera at the main intersection in town to capture community members walking downtown. Waters also typically filmed school children entering or leaving school and workers arriving to or departing from mills, plants, and factories. Waters often included trick shots to engage his audience, such as trains moving backwards or children jumping in reverse. Although the films are dominated by shots of crowds and individual faces, Waters also captured a wide variety of activities, like school recitals, sports, mechanics at work, and manufacturing processes in factories. Waters also regularly filmed in Black communities within the towns he visited, and in the case of Chapel Hill, filmed exclusively in the Black community.
The H. Lee Waters Film Collection dates from 1936 to 2005 and is comprised primarily of 16mm black-and-white and color reversal original motion picture films created by Waters during the filming of the Movies of Local People series.

The majority of films represented in the collection are silent, black and white, and were filmed in North Carolina. The collection includes a small number of color films and one film with sound. Where reels containing mixed black-and-white and color footage were preserved to 16mm film, they were separated into two reels based on picture characteristic during the preservation process.
The collection also contains a small number of papers and physical objects related to Waters, including: photocopied and original advertisements for screenings of Waters' films; photocopies of Waters' notes, receipts, and correspondence concerning film sales; related ephemera; VHS copies of a news report and a film on Waters; a copy of the master's thesis written on the films of H. Lee Waters by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student Martin Johnson in 2005; home movies created by Waters from the 1930s to the 1950s; and oral histories with Mary Waters Spaulding and Tom Waters, the children of H.

The papers of James King Wilkerson (1842-1919) and his family date from 1820 to 1929, and consist of Civil War correspondence, a number of almanacs used as diaries, copybooks belonging to James when he was 16 and 17, and a few other miscellaneous papers, including a genealogical sketch. There is correspondence by Lillie Wilkerson (1877-1955) and Luther Wilkerson (1874-1942), James' children, discussing social life and customs, illnesses and hospitals, employment, and personal matters; and several letters from a soldier in France during World War I. There are also two early issues of the Berea, N.C. Gazette, one from 1876, with comments on the Hayes-Tilden election, and one from shortly thereafter.
The Civil War letters were all or nearly all written by James Wilkerson, who served in the Confederate Army, 55th North Carolina Regiment, Company K, from Aug. 1861 through spring of 1865. His letters to his family are significant for their references to the ironclad C.S.S. Virginia (the former U.S.S. Merrimac); detailed descriptions of marches, including references to orders dealing with men who couldn't keep up or fell during the march; comments on the condition of crops as he moved to different locales; and references to his Civil War service around Petersburg, Va. late in the war, and his stay in the General Hospital at Greensboro, N.C. in 1865. The collection is rounded out by a copy of The Spirit of Prayer (Nathaniel Vincent, 1840), owned by James K. Wilkerson during the Civil War.
The largest section in this collection is the correspondence, 1816-1876. It covers such subjects as the naval cruises of Charles Wilkes and his son, John; the Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842, in terms of preliminary planning, the voyage itself and detailed descriptions of places visited, and publishing the results of the expedition; gold mining and milling in North Carolina; the Civil War; and Wilkes family business ventures in North Carolina. There are many letters written by prominent persons, including a particularly rich section containing letters of scientists in 1848 and 1849. Also there is a lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) and Charles Wilkes correspondence. Other groups of papers are the clippings, financial papers, legal papers, miscellany, printed material, writings, and volumes.
The correspondence covers a sixty-year span, 1816-1876, with the majority of the letters being addressed to Charles Wilkes. The letters commence with one from John Wilkes about obtaining a warrant as a midshipman for his son Charles. Most of the early letters to 1818 are those of John to Charles concerning the son's early naval career and the father's advice pertaining to it.
In the 1820s begin letters from Charles Wilkes while on naval voyages, 1822-1823, describing Rio de Janeiro; Valparaiso; and the earthquake, burial customs, and clothing in Peru. The bulk of the letters for this period fall in 1825, while Wilkes was in Washington, D. C., waiting to take a naval examination for promotion to lieutenant. His letters concern social occasions, visiting friends, and prominent personages, including President and Mrs. John Quincy Adams and a dinner they gave, Mrs. Calhoun, and Prince Achille Napoleon Murat. Wilkes evidently made a conscious effort to contact and get to know the right people, pertly to further his career. Other Wilkes letters refer to the court-martial of Commodore Charles Stewart, at which Wilkes was called to testify; two French generals in Washington, Generals Lafayette and Simon Bernard; and steamboat and stagecoach travel.
Letters to Wilkes in 1825 and 1826 relate news about the trade situation in Chile, Simon Bolivar, politics and government in Peru, and U. S. Navy commissions. A lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters begins in 1828 and continues to 1854. Renwick was an engineer and educator, professor of natural philosophy and chemistry at Columbia, and an authority in every branch of engineering of his day. The letters, which were written primarily to Wilkes and to Jane Wilkes, Renwick's sister, relate to scientific and family matters Letters of Renwick's sons, Henry and Edward, eminent engineers, and James (1818-1895), a noted architect also appear in the papers.
In 1828 and 1829 letters begin in reference to preliminary plans for an exploring expedition. Particularly, Captain Thomas Ap Catesby Jones wrote a lengthy letter on Jan. 2, 1829, about the proposed expedition. President Jackson had given him command of the exploring squadron but later eased him out of command. On May 7 Wilkes wrote to Secretary of Navy John Branch about instruments and charts for the planned expedition.
In the 1820s there begin series of letters among Wilkes family members that continue in varying degrees throughout the collection. Those included in addition to Charles are his brothers John ("Jack''), who resided on a plantation outside Charleston; Henry, a lawyer in New York; and Edmund, also a lawyer in New York; and a sister Eliza (Wilkes) Henry in Albany, N. Y. There is an extended correspondence between Charles and his wife Jane, which runs from 1825 to 1848.
From July, 1830, to May, 1831, Charles Wilkes was on an extended Mediterranean cruise. As a result the collection for this period contains many lengthy letters he wrote to his wife that are replete with detailed descriptions of such locations as Gibraltar, Port Mahon, Algiers, Tunis, Naples, Florence, and Marseilles. In particular there is an especially good account in September, 1830, of a visit Wilkes made to meet the Bey of Tunis and the prime minister at the palace. Also there is information about the French expedition to Algiers and the reaction to the French troops. Wilkes also demonstrated his interest in cultural and social life through his careful descriptions in Oct., 1830, of the National Museum, the San Carlo Opera, and churches in Naples. He also participated in much social life while visiting France in Dec., 1830.
The letters for 1832 and 1833 fill only a portion of one folder. Of note is a letter, July 28, 1833, by Charles Wilkes's brother John about the South Carolina militia, states rights, Governor Hayne, and politics in South Carolina
A long series of letters from Henry Wilkes in New York to his brother Charles in Washington, D C., appears from 1834 through the 1840s. The topics are primarily business and financial matters, sale and management of property, rental houses, and the Jackson City Association. Henry also wrote concerning elections in New York, riots there, and his attitude toward blacks. Of additional interest are letters in Dec., 1834, one that Charles Wilkes wrote to Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson about measurements of the eclipse, and one from James Renwick to Wilkes in reference to the U. S. Coast Survey.
By mid-1836, some correspondence begins to appear concerning preparations for the coming Exploring Expedition. For example, Wilkes wrote to John Boyle, Acting Secretary of the Navy, in July about instruments he needed for the voyage and requesting funds to purchase charts, books, and instruments. In August Wilkes journeyed to England and Europe to obtain scientific instruments for the expedition. In 1837 he wrote to Navy Secretary Dickerson about his dealings with Edward John Dent, a chronometer maker in London, and later about the disposition of instruments purchased for the expedition. Other letters in 1838 discuss the organization of the expedition, who will command it, speculation as to whether or not Wilkes will go, and plans and preparations for staffing and equipment. On June 3, 1838, Mary Somerville, an English scientific writer and astronomer, wrote to Wilkec about various aspects of oceanography which were still possible topics for inquiry on an exploring expedition. In the last half of 1837 are letters about Wilkes's surveying efforts and a report by Mrs. Wilkes on a visit from Dolley Madison.
From August, 1838, to June, 1842, Charles Wilkes was the commander of the U. S. Exploring Expedition. Writing from the U. S. Ship Vincennes to his wife, his letters are generally lengthy and marvelously detailed. Although little information is included about the specifics of the scientific experiments and specimen gathering, there is a wealth of information about the people and places visited. It is possible to include in this sketch only the highlights of information in the letters. Please consult the subjects listed in this Guide for further information. In 1838 and 1839, the voyagers went to Madeira; Brazil; Valparaiso, Chile; Callao, Peru; the Society Islands; and Sydney, Australia. Included is information about the homes, plants, and wine-making in Madeira; the President of Chile; travels to various small islands in the Pacific Ocean; natives; and social occasions. Also Wilkes referred to discipline problems on board ship, the officers in the squadron, the spirit of overall harmony on the expedition, and an apparent lack of support for the expedition by the U. S. government.
In 1840, Wilkes noted his sighting of the Antarctic Continent and then the trip to the Fiji Islands. This latter stop was particularly poignant for Wilkes because his nephew, Wilkes Henry, and a Lt. Underwood were murdered by natives who sometimes practiced cannibalism. The voyage was marred by several personnel problems. Wilkes suspended and sent home Dr. Gilchrist, a surgeon assigned to the expedition, and had difficulties with Joseph P. Couthuoy, a member of the scientific corps whom Wilkes dismissed. Wilkes's use of strict discipline was to result later in a court-martial.
In late 1840 and early 1841, the ships were docked in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), where he wrote a detailed account of an adventurous trip to explore the volcanic mountain, Mauna Loa, and of missionaries in Hawaii, In May, 1841, he noted a stop in Oregon and the Columbia River.
Letters in 1842 concern Wilkes's promotion and court-martial. His name was omitted from the list of promotions in the Navy, and he was not promoted to commander until 1843. The court-martial charges were primarily the result of his supposed use of harsh discipline on the expedition. As mentioned previously he was sentenced to be publicly reprimanded.
There begins in the late 1830s and 1840s correspondence between Charles Wilkes and his children, and among the children, which will continue throughout the collection. The children with whom he communicated were John (Jack) (1827-1908); Jane (1829-[18--?]); Edmund (1833-[18--?]), an engineer; and Eliza (1838-[18--?]). Other family letters include several from Anne de Ponthieu to her cousin Charles Wilkes in the 1830s, and a long series between Henry Wilkes and his sister-in-law Jane Wilkes in the 1840s.
The family correspondence for the remainder of the 1840s during the post Exploring Expedition period includes many letters of Henry Wilkes, brother of Charles, particularly in 1846 and 1847. They concern business and financial matters, coal property in Pennsylvania, and the sale of the Jackson City property.
During this period John Wilkes (1827-1908) wrote from the U.S.S. Mississippi, which was on a cruise to Pensacola, Vera Cruz, and other ports. Contained in his letters is a brief report of Slidell's mission to Mexico, Several of his letters are from Annapolis where John was a midshipman at the U. S. Naval Academy in early 1847. The others were written from the U. S. S. Albany, which he was on board for a surveying cruise to Mexico and the western coasts of Central and South America. While on the cruise in late 1847 and 1848, he wrote to his father descriptions of various stopping places such as the Island of St. Thomas, Cura√ßao, and Caracas, Venezuela. In 1848 John was appointed Acting Master of the Albany. The next year John's letters to his father consist of those he wrote while on board the U. S. S. Marion, and while attached to his father's Exploring Expedition publication work for which he traveled to Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, D. C.
John's younger brother, Edmund, wrote several letters to his family while he was in school in Philadelphia in 1846 to 1847. The bulk of his letters during this period, though, date from August, 1848, through 1849, from Charlotte, N. C. As a teenager, Edmund was given the responsibility of going to Charlotte to oversee some mining and milling property there. This extensive correspondence consists basically of reports by Edmund to his father and instructions from Charles to his son; as a consequence, much information is revealed about mining and milling efforts in the Charlotte area at this time. Specifically Edmund gave accounts of grinding ore at the Charlotte and Capps Mines, Capps Mine preparations, comments about amalgamation problems, milling ore, and working stamp, grist, and saw mills at St. Catherine's Mills Charles Wilkes owned at least a one-quarter share of the Capps Gold Mine, and also had a share in a co-partnership for the mine called the Capps Company. It was his intention to obtain possession of the engine at the Capps Mine and to provide facilities for others to use it either for shares or by a tribute system. He also wished to make St. Catherine's Mills a business place for grinding all sorts of ores, but none of his ventures in Charlotte was ever very successful or profitable.
In the summer of 1848 Jane Wilkes, the wife of Charles, took a vacation in Newport, Rhode Island, a fashionable summer resort area. Her letters in July describe the people and activities there. Mrs. Wilkes had suffered a leg injury in June, which worsened over the summer. She died in August in Newport while her husband was on a trip to South Carolina and also to Charlotte to inspect family property.
As previously noted there is a series of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters in this collection. The correspondence is particularly heavy for the 1843 to 1849 period. The letters concern reviewing of the manuscript of the Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition and his calculations made from measurements made during magnetic observations on the expedition. Renwick also wrote about his attempt to be appointed to the U. S. Boundary Commission, which failed, and the beginning careers of his three cons.
The period, 1848 to 1849, is an especially rich one for this collection in terms of the correspondence of prominent persons it contains. From 1843 to 1861, Charles Wilkes was assigned to special service, chiefly in Washington, D, C., preparing for publication and publishing the information collected on the Exploring Expedition. Much of his correspondence during 1848 to 1849 deals with describing and cataloging the specimens, such as lichens, collected on the expedition; work on preparing charts; writing, editing, and publishing of volumes; and paying the bills for this work.
In the course of this work Wilkes received letters from many prominent scientists, naval officers, senators and congressmen, and statesmen. Please consult the List of Selected Persons in this Guide for an extensive listing of correspondents. Of particular interest are four series of letters: 1. Asa Gray, botanist, to Wilkes from 1849 to 1859, writing about work on the botany of the Exploring Expedition; 2. Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz, zoologist, corresponding to Wilkes from 1849 to 1861, concerning drawings of fish and echinoderm specimens from the expedition; 3. Joseph Henry, scientist and first director of the Smithsonian Institution, writing, 1849 to 1875, about loans of Exploring Expedition specimens; and 4. John R. Bartlett (1805-1886), state official and bibliographer, writing in 1849 about the sales of the Narrative and the publication of a spurious abridgment of the work. Other scientists who corresponded include Isaac Lea, James D. Dana (1813-1895), William D. Brackenridge, Titian Ramsay Peale, William S. Sullivant, and Edward Tuckerman.
The correspondence for the 1850s continues two important themes of the collection: the continuing work concerning the Exploring Expedition, and gold mining and milling in North Carolina. Throughout, there are letters referring to various aspects of the Exploring Expedition work, such as descriptions being made of specimens, appropriations and bills, as well as letters from many prominent scientists. Examples of such letters are Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz writing about the classification and drawings of fish specimens, Asa Gray about his work describing the botany of the expedition and William Sullivant's drawings of mosses, Spencer F. Baird about his report on the reptiles, William Sullivant about the engraving of drawings and publication of his work on mosses, and Charles Pickering about his report on the geographical distribution of plants and animals.
Many other prominent persons who were not scientists also corresponded with Wilkes during the 1850s, Of interest is a letter dated April 9, 1851, from President Millard Fillmore to Wilkes thanking him for sending a copy of his work on meteorology.
A very long series of letters between Charles Wilkes and his younger son Edmund continues from the 1840s through the 1850s, Most of the early letters concern the mills at St, Catherine's Mills near Charlotte, N. C.; financial matters; and the fact that the mills are not proving to be a very successful venture, In the summer of 1850, Edmund returned home and then in September began attending the Laurence Scientific School at Harvard to train to be an engineer, The remainder of his letters for this period primarily concern his work as an engineer on railroads in Ohio, particularly in Zanesville. His letters describe hits work, operations of the Central Ohio Railroad, and the many accidents on this railroad in 1858.
The very long series of letters from John to his father Charles Wilkes continues in 1850 until 1852 while John is on board the U.S.S. Marion on a cruise continuing to places such as Rio de Janeiro, China, and Manila Bay. He wrote very lengthy descriptive letters on this cruise. In the summer of 1852 he was working on the calculations for observations of the Exploring Expedition and also corresponded while on trips to Pennsylvania and Ohio.
The remainder of the correspondence of John Wilkes as well as that of some others pertains to mining and milling operations in the Charlotte area. In 1853 John went to North Carolina to be superintendent of the Capps mining operations and presumably to continue work begun by his brother Edmund earlier. John wrote about the condition of various mines, such as the Capps, McGinn, and Dunn mines; mining operations, such as pumping water out of the Capps mine shaft; his brief tenure as agent of the Capps Mining Company; problems with the Capps Company; and continual financial problems. By August, 1855, the Capps Mine was defunct. Charles Wilkes had been President of the St. Catherine's Mining Company. John also became involved in milling operations and sent back reports about the work, progress, and machinery repairs at the St. Catherine's Mills; stamp mills; flour and corn milling; and questions about Wilkes's ownership of St. Catherine's Mills. In 1858 John turned his attention to the Mecklenburg Flour Mills, which he purchased with William R. Myers. Other correspondence concerns a proposed St. Catherine Gold Mining Company, which would have been formed to sell a newly invented machine for reducing metallic ores.
There is considerably less bulk for the 1860s and 1870s than for earlier years, there being one box of material for each of these decades. Certain letters in 1860 begin to mention the possibility of secession. Throughout the Civil War period are references to various battles, ships, naval and army officers, and views on the war. On November 8, 1861, Charles Wilkes commanded that the British mail steamer Trent halt and be boarded. He then searched the vessel, arrested the Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, and removed them to the U.S. Ship San Jacinto. Wilkes's primary error was in searching a neutral vessel and seizing the agents on board, rather than bringing the ship into port. His actions became quite controversial both in the United States and in Europe. Although the British people were outraged by the events, a majority of Lincoln's cabinet applauded the act. The matter was finally resolved, though, when Secretary of State Seward released the prisoners, realizing that the alternative was war with England. Two letters in 1862, written by Michele Costi, a publicist living in Venice, address this affair. He wrote a strong defense of Wilkes's actions in the Trent affair. A copy of Costi's, In difesa del San Giacinto, is contained in the writings. There is no firsthand account by Wilkes of this affair in the collection.
In July and August, 1862, there is a series of letters from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to Charles Wilkes, who was co landing the James River Flotilla at that time. Also in 1862 are various orders about ships, crews, and discharges, as well as letters concerning aspects of the U. S. Navy, such as health, medical care, surgeons, liquor, and deserters. Many of the letters in 1862 and 1863 comment on General George Brinton McClellan, particularly after his removal as commander-in-chief of the U. S. Army; the Wilkes family favored him. In late 1862 and early 1863 letters refer to the fact that Wilkes was passed over for promotion to rear admiral and to his reputation as an officer. His wife Mary had much correspondence attempting to secure the promotion. Wilkes was not promoted to rear admiral on the retired list until 1866. On June 1, 1863, he was detached from the West India Squadron and recalled home. Unfortunately his letters for this period at sea, 1861-1863, are not included in this collection. Only a handful of letters exist for 1864; two of them are from Wilkes to Gideon Welles concerning Wilkes's court-martial.
Family letters during the Civil War are concentrated mainly in 1862 and 1863, while Wilkes was at sea. His wife and two older daughters remained in Washington, D. C., and in their letters they discuss prominent citizens of the city, army generals, naval officers, and activities there. Many letters refer to business and financial matters.
At the conclusion of the Civil War, John Wilkes's letters from Charlotte to his father resume. John was at this time serving as the first president of the First National Bank of Charlotte and had resumed operations at the Mecklenburg Iron Works which he owned. His letters relate to business and economic conditions in North Carolina and the South during Reconstruction, making a start again after the Civil War, and business and financial matters. Wilkes was in a partnership that owned the Rock Island Manufacturing Company; letters refer to its financial problems. In about 1866, Charles Wilkes moved to Gaston County, North Carolina, where he had purchased the High Shoals Iron Works. He had a contract of sale, but no deed, so protracted legal battles ensued. The Iron Works continued to produce batches of pig iron and manufacture nails. Letters in the collection pertain to the Iron Works and its production. Only a few letters exist for 1868 and 1869.
The correspondence for the 1870s consists primarily of family letters, mostly written by John Wilkes to his father. Letters continue about the problems of the Rock Island Manufacturing Company, which had failed in about 1869. Other letters concern the Mecklenburg Iron Works, which was at one time called the Mecklenburg Foundry and Machine Shops, of which he was proprietor. He also referred to the continued question of ownership of the High Shoals Iron Works and the appropriation for the work of the Exploring Expedition in 1870. A few other letters were written by Mary and Edmund Wilkes, who went to live in Salt Lake City in 1871, but returned to New York later.
Other letters for the 1870s pertain to the Exploring Expedition. Charles Wilkes wrote to Lot M. Morrill about publishing the volumes of the work of the expedition. There are letters from Frederick D. Stuart, assistant to Wilkes, concerning funds to finish the publication of the Exploring Expedition volumes. It was difficult in the later years to obtain this funding from Congress.
The two clippings are a picture of Charles Wilkes and an article, 1862, concerning publication of the results of the Exploring Expedition.
The financial papers, 1830-1875, include such items as financial statements, Exploring Expedition statements, bills, receipts, cost estimate, and a bond.
In the legal papers, which span the years 1827-1865, are indentures, many of which are signed by Charles Wilkes and Richard B. Mason, among other parties. Also included are articles of association and other papers for the Jackson City Association, a signed approval by Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey of a summons to Wilkes for a trial, and undated plats. There are court documents, such as agreements, summons, a complaint, and a memorandum. Some of these items pertain to litigation concerning a Lynch vs. Wilkes family real estate dispute.
The miscellany consists of papers, 1825-1875. Exploring Expedition items include a memo in 1838 concerning the acting appointments as commanders of Charles Wilkes and William H. Hudson, magnetic measurements, and in 1858 a few items about revisions to various maps and publications of the expedition. Three depositions occur in this section in 1862 concerning fortifications at Drewry's Bluff. They are written by a deserter from the Confederate Navy, a former Confederate soldier, and a New York soldier who had been behind Confederate lines. Other Civil War papers in 1863 and 1864 relate to the court-martial of Wilkes.
The printed material spans the years 1849 to 1874. Included is a broadside that General John James Peck penned on September 20, 1864, entitled, Siege of Suffolk-Chancellorsville. The purpose of the paper was to debunk the idea that any significant portion of Longstreet's army was transferred to Chancellorsville. In the printed material also is Report on the High Shoals Property in Gaston County, North Carolina by F. Winter. This is a proof of the pamphlet written in 1873 concerning the geology of High Shoals. Other titles are Working the Gold Mines in New Granada, Prospectus of the American Review, and Map of the City of Zanesville.
While the writings cover the two years, 1862 to 1863, most of them are undated. Included is a copy in Italian of In difesa del San Giacinto, 1862, by Michele Costi. This was a defense of Wilkes's actions in the Trent affair. An English translation of this item was published as a pamphlet under the title, Memoir on the Trent Affair. A copy is housed in the Rare Book Room. Related items are The Surrender of Mason and Slidell written in Wilkes's hand and another article, both of which defend his actions in the Trent affair. Copies of Naval Reform and Abuses in the Navy, 1862, are also included. Two folders contain the sixteen-chapter manuscript Trip to the Far West by Charles Wilkes in 1863. The narrative is comprised of descriptions of the localities visited, including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Milwaukee, the Mississippi River, St. Paul, Iowa (especially Dubuque), St. Louis, Cincinnati, Erie, New York--Buffalo and Niagara Falls, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York City. Canal Trip in Peru is listed as being included with the manuscript but is not a part of this collection. Other undated writings describe various aspects of New York City, iron-clad vessels, New Jersey, and Baltimore.
The volumes, 1823-1847, include account books of Charles Wilkes, a notebook owned by Edmund Wilkes, and Notes related to Fejee [sic] Islands. There is an account book for the ship O'Cain, 1823, maintained while Wilkes was on a trip to ports in the South Atlantic on a sealing voyage. Wilkes was in command of the ship, which was fitted out by its owner, Mr. Winship. Other financial records of Charles Wilkes are in three Daybooks of Receipts and Expenses, 1828-1829, 1829-1832, and 1833-1835. Edmund Wilkes kept the notebook in 1847 while he was a student in Philadelphia. Evidently it was from a chemistry course. Charles Wilkes wrote Notes related to Fejee [sic] Islands from July 15 to August 7, 1840, while on the Exploring Expedition.
Two oversize items are in oversize storage: Map of the World shewing [sic] the Extent and Direction of the Wind and the Route To Be Followed in a Circumnavigation of the Globe by Charles Wilkes, 1856, and a broadside, including a plat of several lots of Charles Wilkes's land in Washington, D. C. for sale, May 12, 1874.
Collection comprises four letters written by Helen Maria Williams, two to her nephew, Athanase Laurent Charles Coquerel, one to Mrs. Joel [Ruth] Barlow, and one to an unidentified recipient. Williams provided aid for fellow republican radicals. On 22 August 1798, she wrote to her American expatriate friend Ruth Barlow. Williams hoped that Ruth's husband, the diplomat Joel Barlow, would assist James Wollstonecraft (Mary's brother), who was then in prison in Paris as a suspected spy. The letter notes Thomas Payne's [Paine's] ineffective efforts on James' behalf. Other topics in the letters include Coquerel's position, her income, the health and situation of friends and family members, and an unnamed woman she wishes to avoid. Three letters are accompanied by partial or full transcription.
Topic is mainly the the imprisonment of James Wol[l]stonecraft and Thomas Payne's [Paine's] efforts on his behalf. Full transcript provided.

Collection consists mainly of letters Willis wrote to his wife, Altona Grinnel, but also includes letters to him and between other family members. They frequently wrote to one another in code; a key to the code is with the collection. His letters pertain to the Geological Survey as well as family, travels, the Appalachians and other prominent geologists such as Raphael Pumpelly. A few sketches are also included.
Entries describe the social life and travel of a British woman living in India with General Craigie, his wife, and daughters. They left England in November 1854, traveled by ship with stops in Egypt, and arrived in Madras in January 1855. The group lived in Madras but journeyed to other cities in southern India, including Bangalore, Mysore, and Vellore. There are references to the Sepoy Rebellion, 1856-1858, before Wilson departed India in 1860.
Collection comprises a letter E. C. Wines wrote to G. F. Thayer (1848 January 24) regarding his thoughts on the superintendent of schools in Boston. Wines mentions Alexander Dallas Bache, who served as superintendent of schools in Philadelphia. Also includes two unrelated newspaper clippings regarding Wines' participation in prison reform congresses, with dates penciled in as 1871 and 1872.

Some significant personalities mentioned are Senator Metcalf, Montana Governor Aronson, Senator Anderson, and Lyndon Johnson. Wolf closes with a brief overview of the Disaster Relief Act of 1965. 19pp
Wolf tells the tale of the "Sweet Swap," a nearly scandalous land exchange in Oregon involving the BLM and a timberman named Sweet from California. Senator Metcalf had previously prevented J. Neils Lumber Co. from getting legislation authorizing land exchanges (of federal and private lands). Secretary of Interior Wirth subsequently slipped land exchange language into Pt. Reyes legislation. The resultant attempted land exchange in Oregon involved negotiations that affected Oregon, the BLM, the Department of the Interior, and Mr. Sweet. 22 pp.
Wolf examines public land law from several perspectives. The first involved the initially poorly regulated "withdrawal" of public lands by the the military and resulted in the Engalls Act to standardize regulation. The next involved regulating abuses of mining claims. Perhaps the largest impact revolves around the connection between the Public Land Law revision and the Wilderness Act which were passed in the same time period. Wolf explains the relationship and how the personalities involved shaped those changes. Finally, he looks at the BLM land management process. 18 pp
McLeod and Wolf each lay out some of the history of federal government support of road construction with Wolf making the connection between logging national forests and road construction.

He includes the roles played by Senators Gore, Church, and Dworshak. 19 pp
Wolf discusses the post World War II problem of Forest Service employees which involved inadequate field housing and the difficulties of retaining the new kind of employees. He explains the l957 resolution of the problem which involved political manipulation in the House. He adds a brief history of the BLM and their housing situation. 13 pp
Wolf focuses on past attempts at reorganizing the Forest Service and BLM. During tlie Nixon administration this involved an attempt to readjust regional Forest Service Boundaries to align with a proposed 10 region reorganization of many departments. Mansfield, Bible, and Talmadge held key roles in preventing changes. During the Carter administration there was an attempt to form a Department of Natural Resources that also met with senatorial opposition. Wolf also discusses Senator Mike Mansfield's priorities on a broader scale. (see also OH 227-50) 17 pp
Wolf recalls the 1959 controversy over the Kern Plateau in the Sequoia National Forest in California. In this situation, recreationists and the Sierra Club opposed the timber sales proposed by business groups on the Kern Plateau. Wolf was sent West to investigate. He describes the trip and his subsequent recommendation against the timber sales that the Forest Service ignored. He ends with a brief discussion of land use altetanatives. 17 pp (see also OH 227-48)
This tape begins with McQuillan laying out the history of the Quinalt Indian Reservation from the beginning through the difficulties with timber sales and logging contracts of BIA mismanagement. Wolf takes over with additional background on the Quinalt tribe and then discusses the hearings, his role as forest consultant, the incompetence of the BIA, the impact on Quinalt lands, and the BIA defense of their actions. 28 pp and 16 pp
Wolf describes the events surrounding the federal government bail-out of the timber industry between l982 and l988. President Reagan signed a law providing dollar relief for timber contracts. Unfortunately this came in the wake of Western timber companies bidding above advertised prices between 1978 and 1981 in an attempt to corner the timber market so from Wolfs perspective, the relief rewarded bad beliavior. He describes the political process, the role of Senator Hatfield, and the role of greed. 26 pp
Wolf explains how the 1950s change in the Siskiyou National Forest Boundary was accomplished. It is particularly interesting that the act, which increased the size of this national forest, passed through congress quickly and with almost no controversy despite a widespread disapproval of any government land acquisitions at the time. 7 pp
Wolf recalls how the 1958 program of "road-building as an anti-recession measure" had the secondary result of providing funds for building more roads in national forests despite some agencies' insistence that timber companies should build these roads as part of their contractual responsibilities. 12pp
While reviewing 1958 government concern over timber sales in national forests, Wolf reviews forest budgets, forest service budgeting processes and timber sales in the 1950s before moving forward to a brief discussion of timber sales in 1990. 10pp
Wolf discusses the significance of lumber trade with Canada in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. timber interests, and President Kennedy's trade policies in regard to the passage of the Trade Act of 1962. Wolf also describes the Tariff Commission hearings over the timber industry grievances. 22 pp
Wolf describes the Forest Service bidding practices for timber sales from the 1940s to the present, problems with the system, collusion in oral bidding, and differences in Forest Service and Justice Department views on bidding practices. He explains the process of the passage of the Oral-Sealed Bid Amendment of 1978 and its effectiveness. 14 pp
Wolf explains the Attorney General's (Robert Kennedy's) opinion of 1962 regarding access to public lands. He also lays out the opposing viewpoints of federal agencies and the problems with accessing public lands. 19 pp
In describing the start of softwood lumber standards, Wolf discusses standardization of lumber products and the reactions of the industry and government officials. 15 pp
Wolf recalls the 1959 controversy over the Kern Plateau in the Sequoia National Forest in California. In this situation, recreationists and the Sierra Club opposed the timber sales proposed by business groups on the Kern Plateau. Wolf was sent West to investigate. He describes the trip and his subsequent recommendation against the timber sales that the Forest Service ignored. Finally, he considers the value of the Kern Plateau as a case study. (see also OH 227-37) 21 pp
Wolf discusses the short-lived 1960 Program for the National Forests from the Forest Service's difficulties in promoting it to legislative maneuverings and the lessons learned. 12 pp
Wolf outlines government reorganization plans by the Nixon and Carter administrations. He focuses on tlie Nixon plan to divide the country into ten regions in relation to the Forest Service as well as the broader impact. The Carter attempt to create a Department of Natural Resources differed and related more specifically to the Forest Service and the BLM. Wolf also recalls legislative response to both plans. (see also OH 227-36) 18 pp

Collection consists of a nearly complete lecture set of 48 hand-colored glass lantern slides published in England. The original printed booklet accompanying the set bears the full title, "Woman: the world over. A lecture to accompany a series of 54 photographic transparencies for the optical lantern." The price appearing on the booklet is sixpence.
The booklet lists 53 slides in this set, and contains detailed lecture-format captions which would be read aloud as the slides were projected. The series is incomplete: numbers 28, 47, 48, 51, 53, and 54 are not present. Titles are also printed along the mount edges of each slide but are obscured in a few cases by black repair tape. All titles are original, as is the slide order. The titles and lecture script contain historical terms and language that may be offensive to modern-day audiences. The slides measure 3 1/4 inches square (83 x 83 mm).
The slides and lecture notes were originally arranged in six series, retained in this description: Woman in Society; The Domestic Woman; Woman in Subjection; Emancipated Woman; Woman the Breadwinner; and Angelic Woman.
The women in the portraits represent races, cultures and nations around the world, among which British Guiana, China, Iceland, India, Japan, Netherlands, the Philippines, Russia, Switzerland, Tonga, Tunisia, and the U.S. There are portraits of women with high social status, married women, and women in courtship; there are women depicted in their homes, women with children, and in roles of subjugation which the lecture suggests are little more than slaves. A few images include men.
The series "Woman the Breadwinner" includes agricultural, craft, and industrial scenes, and a slide of women nurses attending to patients. The "Emancipated Woman" series includes an actress, a group of nurses, and women mountaineering. There is one slide of the Women's Temple in Chigago, headquarters for the Women's Christian Temperance Union from 1892 to 1926. Titles are present on the edges of most of the glass slide mounts, and are listed in full in the booklet.
The booklet's lecture notes refer to problematic social conditions for women, particularly regarding marriage, as well as changing social norms as the 20th century begins. The series ends with romantic images of ideal women, chiefly through the lens of courtship and beauty. Most of the missing slides are from this group.
The set held by the Rubenstein is numbered 1239 in the lecture booklet. There is no date on either the slides or the booklet, but the Women's Temple in Chigago, completed in 1892, provides the earliest date. A slide entitled "Wife of the Khedive" helps provide the latest date: the Egyptian title "Khedive" was last used in 1914. The Lucerna Magic Lantern Web Resource (viewed online November 8 2017) gives the publisher as the Riley Brothers of Bradford, Yorkshire, England, and the publication date as 1901.
Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture and the Lisa Unger Baskin Collection at Duke University.
All titles are original, as is the slide order.

The adjective "Kaffir" was widely used in 19th and 20th century South Africa as a pejorative term for black Africans, particularly Bantu people. The term was also used for a Sri Lankan population brought to the island by the Portuguese in the 16th century. In this case the term was and still is used as a non-derogatory, self-identifying ethnic term.

Collection comprises primarily 81 letters from 29 members of the Women's Guild of Arts between 1902 and 1949. There are 7 additional documents, including draft resolutions, certificates, lists, and notes. Three letters predate the founding of the organization in 1907. The primary topic of the letters is the crisis within the Guild regarding its women-only status, an argument regarding how restrictive the Guild should be. Pamela Colman Smith wrote to May Morris (22 January 1913) that the reason she joined the Guild was that it made a point of asking its members not to exhibit at women-only shows, as it lowered the standard of work and that the Guild was never intended to be a purely woman's affair. Other letters on the subject come from Evelyn de Morgan, Feodora Gleichen, and Ethel Sandell. Gleichen's letter was circulated to members, and the collection contains a list of those who agreed with her; several letters are marked up to indicate a position on the matter. There is also a draft resolution welcoming any move to widen the scope of the Guild "such as stimulating and interesting lectures not only from our own members but from men and women outside...It is with this in view that we supported the resolution passed at the recent Annual Meeting, inviting as Honorary Associates a few people with whose work we are in sympathy..." (22 January 1913). Other topics in the letters include the role of the president, exhibitions, lectures, and the work of the organization, along with the William Morris Centenary Commemoration in 1934.
Includes draft resolution dated 1913 January 22.
