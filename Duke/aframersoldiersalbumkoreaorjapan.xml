        color photographs mounted in a black-leaf photograph album, bound in Japanese-style
        lacquered covers. The photographer may be an African American soldier named Tommy, who
        served in the U.S. Army's 511th Operation and Maintenance Service (OM SVC) Company during
        the Korean War. It is unclear whether the photographs are from Japan or from Korea. The
        images depict soldiers at work and enjoying recreational time. Many photographs depict both
        white and African American soldiers together. Other subjects include local women and
        children; women with servicemen; the countryside and Japanese-style buildings; and family
        members and others back home. Collection includes an early 20th century 10 1/2 x 14 inch
        portrait of four African American children. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin
        Research Center for African and African American History and Culture at Duke
        University.</abstract>

      <head>Content Description</head>
      <p>Album contains 106 black-and-white and color photographs carefully arranged and mounted in
        a black-leaf photograph album, bound in Japanese-style lacquered covers inlaid with
        mother-of-pearl. Photographer may be an African American soldier named Tommy, who served in
        the U.S. Army's 511th Operation and Maintenance Service (OM SVC) Company during the Korean
        War. It is unclear whether the photographs are from Japan or Korea, as the latter was
        strongly influenced by Japanese culture until the end of World War II. </p>
      <p>The images depict soldiers in and out of uniform and often engaged in recreational
        pursuits. Many photographs depict both white and African American soldiers together. Other
        subjects include local women and children; women with servicemen; the countryside and
        Japanese-style buildings; and family members and others back home. Included with the album
        is an early 20th century 10 1/2 x 14 inch portrait of four African American children. </p>
      <p>Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and African American
