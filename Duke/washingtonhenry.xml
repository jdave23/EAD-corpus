      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection comprises an African-American family photograph album maintained by Henry
        Washington between approximately 1940-1982. The album features 261 prints, including 204
        black-and-white and 57 color prints, ranging in size from 1x1 inches to 8x10 inches. The
        photographs present the Washington family and its social networks in detail, with a focus on
        Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. A few images reflect the service members with whom Washington
        served during World War II or the military service of family members. The majority of the
        photographs are uncaptioned. A family member has identified several photographs of Henry
        Washington. Four additional photographs were laid in, including a photograph of a clipping
        regarding Washington's birth, along with two sets of laminated newspaper clippings dating
        from 1877. Acquired as part of the John Hope Franklin Research Center for African and
        African American History and Culture.</p>
