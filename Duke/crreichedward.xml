      <p>Consumer Reports is a product testing and consumer advocacy nonprofit organization based in
        Yonkers, N.Y., founded in 1936. Edward Reich was an educator and consumer advocate who
        served as director of the New York City Board of Education's Consumer Education Office and
        as Vice President (1958-1961) and Treasurer (1961-1973) of Consumers Union. </p>
      <p>Edward Reich was born in 1903 in New York. He was educated at City College of New York (AB
        1922, MSBA 1923), Columbia University (MA 1924), and New York University (PhD approximately
        1927). He served on the Consumers Union Board of Directors (1943-1947) and held positions of
        Vice President (1958-1961) and Treasurer (1961-1972) with the organization. Reich was
        co-founder of the Consumer Education Association and editor of its journal during the early
        1940s. Reich served as Director (1942-1947) and Chairman (1947-1961) of the New York City
        Board of Education's Consumer Education Office. He was author of two books: Consumer Goods:
        How to Know Them and Use Them (with Carlton John Siegler, 1937), and Selling to the Consumer
        (1949). Edward Reich retired from Consumers Union in 1973 and died in 1983 in New York.</p>
