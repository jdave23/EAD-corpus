      <abstract id="aspace_0afcaf5a2e1ed96df75af415b38f7f66">David Mamet, b. 30 Nov., 1947, Chicago;
        was a writer, director, producer, and actor; sometimes credited as Richard Weisz. Collection
        comprises the bound typescript of Mamet's 1999 play Boston Marriage, which
        uncharacteristically focused on female leads, and was set at the turn of the 20th century.
        The manuscript is 137 pages, printed on rectos only, bound in printed yellow cardstock with
        the Rosentone Wender Agency address in NY. Inscribed by Mamet: "To Gwen. For a loyal friend
        of the A.R.T. [American Repertory Theater] -- some merchandise for your loyalty. May it
        amuse you, provoke your ire, shim up a chair, or start a fire. Love - David Mamet." With an
        additional doodle (of the author wearing an A.R.T. baseball cap) and his Mamet stamp, which
        also appears on the front cover. The script has a print date of December 1998, more than six
        months before the play premiered. The inscription has a date of June 3, 1999, about two
        weeks before the June 16 premiere at A.R.T. The recipient was on the Advisory Board of the
        theater and also a major donor to it. In a folding chemise and custom clamshell
        case.</abstract>
