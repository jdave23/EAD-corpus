      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Dorothea Lynde Dix (1802-1887) was an American author, teacher, and reformer who advocated
        for improving treatment and facilities for mental health care. She also served as a
        superintendent for nurses during the American Civil War. </p>
      <p>Dix was originally from Hampden, Maine and attended school in Boston, Mass. She became
        interested in mental healthcare while living abroad in Europe, and returned to the United
        States to tour American facilities. She publicly advocated for the cause, lobbying
        healthcare officers and politicians, and raising funds through state allocations and private
        contributions to improve hospitals and medical treatment of mental health patients
        throughout the country. Her work led to the establishment of state asylums in North
        Carolina, New Jersey, and Illinois.</p>
      <p>During the American Civil War, Dix was designated as Superintendent of Army Nurses for the
        Union Army. She sought formal training and opportunities for women in nursing, and over the
        course of the war appointed over 3000 nurses. She later fundraised for a national monument
        for deceased soldiers, now standing at Fort Monroe, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Dix had recurring health problems throughout her life, and spent later years as a resident
        of the New Jersey State Hospital in Trenton.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection consists of assembled and acquired examples of correspondence and poetry
        written by Dorothea Dix. Some materials date from the 1860s. In one note, dated May 1862,
        Dix lists recommendations for promotions in the US Army hospital administration. This bears
        an autograph note, signed by Abraham Lincoln, forwarding the list for consideration to
        Secretary of War Stanton. </p>
      <p>Other letters date from the 1870s and 1880s and relate friends of Dix or to Dix's own care
        and health, particularly regarding her residency at a State Hospital in Trenton, near
        Philadelphia. Dix occasionally references her work for mentally ill patients.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains two poems; one signed D.L.D. and another attributed to
        Dix.</p>

          <p>Dix thanks Mrs. Page for her letter, and writes about her current poor health and
            situation as a resident at the State Hospital. She praises her useful nurse: "I think
            your experience will have realized how very few are to be found who are real nurses -
            many have acquired by teaching what supplies 'certificates' of ability - but no
            certificate represents the truly reliable nurse." Dix continues the letter on May 4 with
            details about her diagnosis: "Ossification of the lining membranes of the arteries." She
            writes that she feels ill but that her reason was "at no time threatened." A typed
            transcription of this letter is also included in the folder.</p>
