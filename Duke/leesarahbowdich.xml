      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of one untitled holograph manuscript (439 pages) written by Sarah
        Bowdich Lee discussing African history, exploration, geography, and culture. It appears to
        date from the 1830s, and was apparently never published. The pages are grouped into loosely
        bound signatures, with no title page or binding for the text. </p>
      <p>Lee's manuscript is an untitled work on Africa that is a survey of European knowledge of
        the continent as of approximately 1830. It does not appear that Lee saw many of the nations
        she describes. She writes that she selected many of the "details from the narratives of
        those whose names alone inspire confidence." The manuscript's watermarks date between 1814
        and 1828. Much of Lee's description reflects British white colonialist attitudes and racist
        or patronizing views of African and Arab people.</p>
      <p>The first portion of the manuscript (about pages 1-100) recount African history,
        exploration, and colonization. The second portion of the text discusses African regions and
        kingdoms, including Egypt (114, including a description of the ancient pyramids and tombs,
        and contemporary Muslim inhabitants); Nubia and Sudan (141; includes a description of local
        wildlife, population, and the trafficking of enslaved people); Abyssinia (165); the Red Sea
        (180); Darfur and Kordo-far (188; unicorns are mentioned on 194); Cyrenaica (207); Tripoli
        (216); Fezzan (225); Bornou (240); Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco (283); Senegal (297, includes
        descriptions of French colonization, the gum trade, Baobob trees, and wildlife); Gambia
        (306, including descriptions of the British settlement Bathurst); Sierra Leone (322);
        Ashantee (340); Dahomey (355, including a description of the king and his court); Gabon
        (381); Congo (388); Portuguese Angola; Cape of Good Hope (399, including a description of
        Cape Town); and the African islands of Mauritius, Madagascar, Madeira, the Canaries, and
        others.</p>
