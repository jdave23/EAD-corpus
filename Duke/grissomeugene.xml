      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection consists of four volumes connected with Dr. Eugene Grissom, related to his
        superintendentship of the North Carolina Insane Asylum in Raleigh. </p>
      <p>Volume 1 is a register of admissions, 1883-1887, including information about white patients
        admitted to the Raleigh Insane Asylum including names, NC county of residence, and
        occasionally the outcome of their admission (typically either their cause of death or the
        note that they had left the hospital, cured). This register tracked only admissions for the
        Eastern Division of white patients in North Carolina; patients residing in the Western
        Division were treated at an insane asylum in Morganton. </p>
      <p>The other three volumes are scrapbooks, largely consisting of clippings about Grissom or
        the asylum. All of these scrapbooks include coverage of Grissom's medical lectures and
        papers on the treatment of the insane, his roles in various medical organizations, the work
        of the insane asylum as a progressive institution, and the political turmoil Grissom
        occasionally faced. </p>
      <p>In addition to clippings relating to Grissom's medical career and his work at the Insane
        Asylum, Volume 2 (a scrapbook dated 1875-1877) includes clippings from various newspapers
        covering a controversy about whether Grissom (a Republican) should be removed from his
        position as superintendent during the fallout of the 1877 election in North Carolina. </p>
      <p>Volume 3 is a scrapbook assembled by A. Watkins Verith (sp?) on Grissom's behalf, dating
        from circa 1877-1880. It includes clippings and notations (by Verith) about Grissom's
        political career, including debates about his potential run for North Carolina governor in
        1879; coverage of a controversy with Dr. William A. Hammond over Grissom's treatment methods
        (including Grissom's proponency of mechanical restraints for violent patients, such as
        handcuffs and straightjackets); his expert testimony in a Danville murder case that the
        accused, Justin Thomas Dejarnette, was clinically insane; as well as public notices about
        his various lectures and appearances.</p>
      <p>Volume 4 (1877-1880) contains clippings and some annotations about Grissom's service as
        superintendent for the Insane Asylum, including a published letter from Dorothea Dix
        praising the work of the hospital. There are additional clippings covering the Dejarnette
        murder case (1880), Grissom's involvement in Masonic ceremonies in 1880, and Grissom's
        potential runs for governor.</p>
