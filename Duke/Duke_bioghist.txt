<p>Charles Laban Abernethy, Sr., was born in Burke County, North Carolina in 1872. Educated at
UNC-Chapel Hill, he practiced law in Beaufort and New Bern, N.C., then was elected as a
Democratic U.S. Congressman representing eastern N.C., serving from 1922 to 1935. He became
known especially for his efforts to establish the Intracoastal Waterway in N.C. Charles
Laban Abernethy, Jr., his son (1899-1968), was also a lawyer. In the early 20th century, the
family resided in Beaufort, then moved to New Bern around 1913. The senior Abernethy
suffered from mental illness late in life, and was committed to state institutions. His son
became his legal guardian until the elder's death in 1955.</p>

<p>Joe Nash (1919-2005) was a self-taught dancer and prominent historian of African-American
dance history. Growing up in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, Nash was inspired
by the black arts movement. After returning from his World War II military service, he
immersed himself in a self-directed study of dance literature and photography. In the late
1940s and '50s, Nash performed on Broadway and toured with influential modern dance artists
such as Pearl Primus and Donald McKayle. He also began teaching and lecturing on dance
history in Philadelphia and New York. Nash was a consultant and lecturer at the American
Dance Festival from the 1990s until his death in 2005. He was widely considered one of the
leading experts on the role of African-Americans in the development of modern dance. During
his life, Nash donated materials from his vast archival collection to the New York Public
Library, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, The Arthur Hall
Collection in Philadelphia, Florida A&amp;M University, the American Dance Festival, and the
National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Ohio.</p>

<p>Motion picture films have been created in the United States, primarily in southern
California, since the very early 20th century. </p>
<p>The Norman Film Manufacturing Company was created in the late 1910s by Richard Norman and
produced films with all-Black casts, known at the time as "race films". Race films were
those movies made specifically for African American audiences and with African American
casts. The studio produced silent films including The Green-Eyed Monster (1919), The Love
Bug (1919), The Bull Dogger (1921), Crimson Skull (1921), Regeneration (1923), The Flying
Ace (1926), and Black Gold (1928). The company and studio was located in Jacksonville, FL,
along with a number of other studios in the 1910s and 1920s, but when the film industry
adopted talking films and shifted to Hollywood, CA, the Norman Film Manufacturing Company
moved to distributing films, then exhibiting films, before shutting down in the 1940s. The
only surviving film is the Flying Ace, which was restored by the Library of Congress and is
available for viewing online.</p>
<p>Pressbooks were marketing and promotional tools created by film distributors and sent to
movie theaters. Pressbooks usually included images of posters, lobby cards, and other
advertising materials available to promote the film, as well as suggestions or guides for
advertising and promotion. Pressbooks came in a wide variety of sizes and could also include
additional information about the film and cast itself. Pressbooks were commonly produced by
major film studios from the 1910s onward.</p>

<p>Americans for Immigrant Justice (formerly Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC)) is a
not-for-profit legal assistance organization dedicated to protecting and promoting the basic
human rights of immigrants of all nationalities. </p>
<p>Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC) was founded in 1996 because of pending
restrictions and funding cuts to Legal Services Corporation (LSC) funded agencies, which
prevented many organizations in the state of Florida from serving the immigrant population.
Sweeping changes in immigration law and welfare reform also increased the demand for
services from FIAC. In 2011 After 15 years of helping immigrants obtain legal status,
successfully litigating their unjust treatment and pressing for constructive immigration
laws and policy, the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center (FIAC) became Americans for Immigrant
Justice (AI Justice for short and Americanos Por Justicia Inmigrante in Spanish) to better
reflect the national focus and depth of their work.</p>

<p>Susan B. Anthony was born February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. She was brought up in
a Quaker family with long activist traditions. Early in her life she developed a sense of
justice and moral zeal. After teaching for fifteen years, she became active in temperance.
Because she was a woman, she was not allowed to speak at temperance rallies. This
experience, and her acquaintance with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, led her to join the women's
rights movement in 1852. Soon after, she dedicated her life to woman suffrage. Ignoring
opposition and abuse, Anthony traveled, lectured, and canvassed across the nation for the
vote. She also campaigned for the abolition of slavery, the right for women to own their own
property and retain their earnings, and she advocated for women's labor organizations. In
1900, Anthony persuaded the University of Rochester to admit women. Anthony, who never
married, was aggressive and compassionate by nature. She had a keen mind and a great ability
to inspire. She remained active until her death on March 13, 1906.</p>

<p>Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825) was an English writer, teacher, and editor who
published poetry, works for children, literary criticism, and essays. She was a
successful writer at a time when women professional writers were an anomaly. Her first
book of poems (1773) established her literary reputation in England, and her later
essays were compared to Samuel Johnson. Along with her husband, Barbauld ran the boy's
school Palgrave Academy for 11 years, during which time she established herself as a
writer of children's pedagogical texts, as well as poetry for children. She is credited
with establishing children's literature as a legitimate genre, and her editorial works,
particularly The British Novelists series, helped establish the British literary canon.
Barbauld was an abolitionist and was also against the Napoleonic Wars, two subjects she
addressed in her political writing. Both her poetry and her political essays were
occasionally subject to harsh contemporary criticism, which eventually caused her to
retreat from the public eye. She lived in Stoke Newington from 1802 until her death in
1825. Barbauld's literary legacy was largely forgotten until the rise of feminist
literary criticism in the late 20th century, which helped resurrect her place in
history. </p>
<p>William Allen (1770-1843) was an English Quaker abolitionist, scientist, educator, and
philanthropist who was active in various social reform movements of early 19th century
England. He was trained as a chemist, and his pharmaceutical company, Allen &amp;
Hanburys, grew into one of the UK's largest drug companies. One year after this poem was
written, he founded the Newington Academy for Girls, a progressive school in Stoke
Newington. Although Barbauld was near the end of her life at the time of this writing,
is it evidence that she and Allen maintained at least an epistolatory friendship based
on their common interests.</p>

<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Raymond C. Battalio (1938-2004) and John B. Van Huyck (1956-2014) were both white American
academic economists who spent their entire careers at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU;
1969-2004 and 1984-2014, respectively).</p>
<p>Battalio earned a BS in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1966 and a
MS and PhD from Purdue University in 1968 and 1970, respectively, where he was supervised by
Robert Basmann. He was one of the 12 founders of the Economic Science Association (ESA) in
1986 and served as its third president from 1988-1989, and he and Van Huyck founded the
Economic Research Laboratory in 1997. He was married to Nancy Battalio, had three sons
(Robert, Joe, and Eric Battalio), and was a US Navy veteran.</p>
<p>Van Huyck was the Rex B. Grey Professor of Economics at TAMU. He earned a BA in economics
from the University of Virginia in 1979 and an MA and PhD from Brown University in 1982 and
1986, respectively, where he was supervised by Herschel Grossman. He was also active in the
ESA and served as a board member. He was married to Patsy Johnson, had three sons (Carl
Phillips, Don Ashfield, and Bjorn Bennett Van Huyck), and was a Cub Scout den leader.</p>
<p>Battalio began designing experiments in the 1970s to test consumer demand theory in token
economies with John Kagel, and he also studied individual choice behavior in pigeons, rats,
and humans; this work had broad appeal and was widely published in economics and psychology
journals.</p>
<p>Van Huyck's early work was on sovereign debt and macroeconomics with Herschel Grossman, and
it led him to develop an interest in coordination failures and studying these specifically
through experiments with Battalio.</p>
<p>They are primarily known for their lab work on the problem of multiple equilibria in game
theory. Along with Richard Biel, they carried out a series of experiments on coordination
that began with the minimum-effort coordination game in 1990. Among their other experiments
were ones on the emergence of conventions, chaotic dynamics, decentralized allocation, and
average opinion and peasant-dictator games.</p>

<p>In 1872, William Bell, a photographer from Philadelphia, found employment on a survey
team established by the Army and formally titled: "U.S. Geographical and Geological
Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th Meridian, under the command of Lieutenant
George M. Wheeler." Bell had been hired by Wheeler to replace Timothy O'Sullivan,
another expeditionary photographer, who participated in the Wheeler survey of 1871 and
returned in 1873.</p>
<p>Perhaps because William Bell participated in only one expedition, a limited amount of
biographical information has been recorded for him, and that information is often vague.
William Bell has most often been confused with another photographer Dr. William A. Bell
(1841-1920) who served on the Palmer Expedition of 1867 for which William Jackson Palmer
surveyed a route through the southwest for the Kansas Pacific Railroad. </p>
<p>William Bell may have fought in the US-Mexican War and for the Union in the Civil War. </p>
<p>Some sources have also indicated that William Bell was appointed chief photographer of
the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., where he may have made photographs of
soldiers wounded in the Civil War. </p>

<p>Mainly comprised of German and Eastern European immigrants as well as Russian-Jewish
cigarette rollers, the Durham Hebrew Congregation organized in 1887 and rented a hall on
Main Street. James B. Duke had formed a contract with Ukrainian immigrant Moses Gladstein to
bring over a hundred workers from New York to roll cigarettes in Duke's tobacco factories.
Duke automated the factory in 1884 and dismissed the Jewish workers. Most returned north,
but several, including Gladstein, chose to remain and opened stores in Durham. As the
population continued to slowly grow, the congregation formally chartered in 1892 and hired a
rabbi. In 1905 they purchased a small, wood-framed church on Liberty Street, which became
Durham's first synagogue. By 1910 the Jewish population in the area had reached
approximately 305. </p>
<p>After the First World War, the congregation built a large, cathedral-style synagogue
downtown at the intersection of Holloway and Queen Streets. Upon its dedication in 1921,
they took the name Beth El Congregation. The congregation remained Orthodox throughout the
1930s and 1940s, but in 1948 hired a rabbi who was a member of the conservative movement.
Despite significant internal tensions, the congregation shed its dominant orthodoxy by the
mid 1950s. The congregation broke ground on a new, contemporary "American" synagogue on
Watts and Markham Streets in 1957; the old structure became the Bethel Baptist Church with a
primarily African American congregation. Durham took over and demolished the building in the
late 1960s for urban renewal. The location is now the northwest corner of WTVD, the local
ABC news affiliate for Durham. </p>
<p>By its centennial year, 1987, the congregation was known as Beth El Synagogue, and had not
only successfully created a strategy to accommodate both its modern leanings and orthodox
heritage but also helped create other Jewish congregations such as Judea Reform. Beth El had
also embraced women as ritual and lay leaders in the 1970s, and the creation of the adjacent
Freedman Center in 1987 allowed the congregation to further expand its community service and
social action programs. Today, as part of a Jewish population of approximately 8,000 in the
Durham-Chapel Hill community, Beth El defines itself as "a vibrant, dynamic community led by
a volunteer board, enriched with the teachings of many dedicated community members." </p>

<p>Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher, emigrated to the United States from
England in 1832, with his wife Hannah (Lane), eight children, and a governess. Their
youngest child was born in New York City; they moved to Newark, N.J., then to Cincinnati,
Ohio. Of the nine children, three are represented in this collection, Anna Blackwell, the
poet, translator, and journalist; Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910), the pioneering physician;
and Henry B. Blackwell (1825-1909), an editor, journalist, and businessman. Also represented
is his wife, suffragist Lucy Stone, and their daughter, Alice Stone Blackwell. In addition,
there are materials from Lucy's niece, Emma Stone Lawrence, who eventually married George
Washington Blackwell, another of the nine children of Samuel and Hannah Blackwell. There are
items from their daughter, Anna M. Blackwell, who went on to marry Charles Belden, librarian
of the Massachusetts State Library, in 1908, as well as from Helen Thomas Blackwell, who
married Anna’s brother, Howard.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Félix Bonfils (1831-1885) was a French-born photographer who migrated to Beirut, Lebanon
around 1867, where he opened a studio named "Maison Bonfils" together with his wife, Lydie
Bonfils (1837-1918), who was also a photographer. They changed the name to Bonfils et Cie in
1878. Studio assistants included the Bonfils's son Adrien (1860-1929), who in 1878 took over
the photographic work while his parents ran the studios, and the Syrian brothers Georges and
Louis Saboungi.</p>
<p>The studio produced photographic views of Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Greece, totaling an
estimated 15,000 single prints; they were also sold as stereographic views and in albums.
They became much sought after by tourists and publishers, and in the wake of this success,
other Bonfils studios opened in Alexandria, Cairo, and in Alés, France, where Félix Bonfils
died in 1885. His son Adrien and wife Lydie continued to operate the studios; Adrien quit
the business sometime around 1900, but Lydie continued to manage it until World War I forced
her to flee Beirut in 1916, taking many of the Bonfils plates and prints with her.</p>

<p>Herbert Clarence Bradshaw (1908-1976) was born on 7 November 1908 in Rice, Virginia. He
graduated with a BA from Hampden-Sydney College in 1930, an MA in classical languages from
the University of Virginia in 1933, and a LittD degree from Hampden-Sydney in 1967.</p>
<p>For twenty years, he taught and served as a principal in Virginia, and he later taught
journalism at North Carolina State University. He became a full-time journalist circa 1949
as Sunday Feature Editor of the <title render="italic">Durham Morning Herald</title> and was
Editorial Page Leader from 1964 until retiring in December 1973. After, he served as
Contributing Editor of the <title render="italic">Winston-Salem Journal</title> and as a
member of the Durham Redevelopment Commission. He was also a member of the Board of
Directors of the Human Betterment League of NC, which promoted eugenics, and was President
at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Bradshaw was killed on 22 December 1976 while helping his wife (Mildred Elizabeth
Cunningham) wash dishes in their Durham home. James Willie Grace, a Durham native and
convicted felon who was likely dealing with untreated schizophrenia, carried out a series of
random shootings around Durham from December 10-22 (one other man was killed). He was
arrested on 28 December and later convicted on three charges of felonious assault with
intent to kill.</p>
<p>Bradshaw is the author of <title render="italic">The History of Prince Edward County,
Virginia</title> (1955), <title render="italic">History of Hampden-Sydney College, vol.
I</title> (1976), <title render="italic">History of Farmville, VA</title> (1948), <title render="italic">Toward the Dawn: History of the First Quarter-Century of the NC State
Association for the Blind, 1934-1960</title> (1961), and fifty articles from 1935-1976 on

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The minister who authored these sermons was undoubtedly a member of the Methodist Church
South, and from church appointment records he is almost certainly John Luke Bray.
According to Bray's obituary in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Virginia
Conference Annual</title> (1938), he was born in 1871 in Gloucester County, Virginia
to John and Sarah Luke Bray, and entered the Methodist ministry in the Virginia
Conference at the age of 18. He was at Randolph-Macon College for an unspecified period
but did not graduate. At some point he was reportedly Superintendent of the Masonic
Orphanage in Richmond. He married Pauline Clements of Gloucester, Virginia early in his
career. In 1901 he left for the West, and seems to have been minister of the Methodist
Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma (then Indian territory) in 1906. He returned to Virginia in
1907; a year later Taylor University in Indiana had conferred on him the Divinity
Degree. Going by the sermons that survive in this collection, by 1911 he was preaching
in Virginia. His first appointment may have been in Lambert's Point, Virginia (near
Norfolk). He then was appointed to various large congregations in Richmond and the
Norfolk area, then migrated to smaller churches in Southern Virginia. He died in 1938,
perhaps in Crewe, Virginia, a small community where he held his last appointment, and is
buried in Richmond.</p>

<p>Earl Ivan Brown, civil engineer, was born at County Line, Georgia, on 13 October 1874 and
graduated 6th in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1898. As a member of
the Corps of Engineers, Brown served in both the Philippines and Cuba during and after the
Spanish-American War. He participated in the Philippine Insurrection and the Moro Expedition
before traveling to the Caribbean for the Cuban Pacification in 1906. During World War I,
Brown was the 92nd Division Engineer in the American Expeditionary Forces. Throughout his
career Brown developed river and harbor improvements in the United States. He worked
principally on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and on the Ohio River. Brown also worked on the
Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and finished his career in 1938 as the Division Engineer of
the South Atlantic Division. </p>
<p>Colonel Earl I. Brown died on 25 June 1963 in Durham, North Carolina at age 88. He is
buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Brown was the son of William F. and Emily Absilla
(Hagen) Brown. He was married to Annie Thompson who died in 1953, and then to Marylily
Fisher. His nephew, Earl Ivan Brown, II, was a professor of Civil Engineering at Duke
University from 1960 to 1982.</p>

<p>Frank Clyde Brown (1870-1943) served as a Professor of English at Trinity College, Duke
University, from 1909 until his death. A native of Virginia, he received his Ph.D. at the
University of Chicago in 1908. While at Duke University he served in many capacities,
including chairman of his department, University Marshal, and Comptroller of the University
during its initial construction. These aspects of his life are chronicled in his papers held
by the <extref xlink:href="http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uabrownfc/">Duke
University Archives</extref>.</p>
<p>This collection of materials, however, is concerned with activities to which he devoted
equal time and energy, the organization of the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913 and
his personal effort to gather and record the nuances and culture of "folk" of North Carolina
and its near neighbors, which occupied him from 1912 until his death. Under the impetus of a
1912 mailing from John A. Lomax, then President of the American Folklore Society, Brown as
well as other faculty members and other citizens in North Carolina, became interested in
folklore and organized the North Carolina Folklore Society in 1913, with Brown as
secretary-treasurer. As secretary-treasurer of this organization from its inception until
his death, he provided the organizational impetus behind the Society. </p>
<p>Through his course in folklore at Duke, he also sent class after class out to gather the
folklore of their locales, both during their studies and afterward. And virtually every
summer he could be found in the most remote parts of the state, with notebook and recorder
-- first a dictaphone employing cylinders, and later a machine employing aluminum discs
provided for his use by the University. The result, by 1943, was a vast collection of field
notes, hundreds of musical scores, thousands of audio recordings, and numerous magazine
articles, student theses, books, lists, and other items related to this study. The majority
of the material originated in North Carolina, with the rest from 20 other states and Canada,
and came from the efforts of 650 other contributors besides Brown himself.</p>
<p>Although Brown promised the Society on an almost yearly basis to publish at least part of
this collection to which its members were contributing, he never took more than a few
tentative steps toward doing so. Thus, at Brown's death in 1943, Newman Ivey White, also a
Professor of English at Duke University, close colleague of Brown's, and charged by Brown
with continuing the work, inherited the dual confusion of the folklore collection, which was
piled in Brown's attic office at home, and the conflicting claims of ownership of the
collection of Mrs. Brown, the North Carolina Folklore Society, and Duke University. When it
became apparent that all were amenable to seeing the collection in print, White assumed the
post of general editor, which passed to Paull Franklin Baum, also a Professor of English and
Director of the Duke Press, after White's death in 1948.</p>

<p>Born in Union, Maine, John Emory Bryant (1836-1900) was an abolitionist, teacher, Union
officer with the 8th Maine Volunteers, agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, newspaper editor and
publisher, lawyer, and Republican politician in Georgia. During the American Civil War
Bryant served in the Department of the South, in the Sea Island of Georgia and South
Carolina. There he worked with General Rufus Saxton and commanded African-American troops,
leading raids to free slaves from nearby plantations. In 1864 Bryant married Emma Frances
Spaulding (1844-1901), who was born in Buckfield, Maine. They had two children together, a
son who died in infancy and a daughter Alice. After the war, Bryant returned to Georgia and
was heavily involved in Georgian Republican politics, serving as a congressman for one term
and as state party chairman from 1876-1880. Bryant was involved in many organizations
including the Georgia Equal Rights Association, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Southern
Advance Association, and the Sons of Temperance.</p>
<p>William Anderson Pledger (1852-1904) was an editor of the Atlanta Blade newspaper, teacher,
prominent Black Republican politician in Georgia, and friend of John Emory Bryant. In 1880
Pledger was elected chairman of the Republican state committee in Georgia, the first Black
man to serve in that office. Pledger helped organize the Afro-American League (which later
became the Afro-American Council) in 1890 in Chicago and served as vice president in
1898.</p>

<p>Materials in this collection largely deal with the years 1991-1996 as the U.S. coped with
large numbers of Haitian and Cuban rafters who were held in Guantánamo Bay refugee camps.
Beginning in 1991, the U.S. naval base was designated as a receiving point for Haitian
migrants who had been intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard in the Caribbean Sea. Guantánamo
Bay was outfitted with semi-permanent camps for the refugees while they waited for a
decision from U.S. Immigration on whether they would be returned to Haiti or allowed to
enter the United States. This program was expanded in 1994, when Cuban president Fidel
Castro retired his Frontier Guards, resulting in a wave of Cuban rafters who were also
intercepted by the Coast Guard and brought to Guantaánamo Bay. Between 1994 and 1996 about
50,000 people lived in the Guantánamo Bay camps. Cuban refugees in the camps were granted
admission to the United States in 1995-1996, while most Haitian refugees were eventually
returned to Haiti.</p>

<p>King Charles II of England (1630-1685) did not have any official heirs. He did, though,
have many children by a number of mistresses. Historians believe the number of children
is somewhere between 10 and fifteen. The use of 'armes' or titles of nobility and the
privileges that came with it was one way the King acknowledged that these were his
children. The most children attributed to a relationship is that between King Charles
and Barbara née Villiers (1641–1709), the Duchess of Cleveland, five, all of whom are
named in this collection.</p>

<p>Charles E. Cobb, Jr., was born in Washington D.C. in 1943. He became active in the Civil
Rights Movement while studying at Howard University, and in 1962 traveled to Mississippi,
where he was a field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1963,
Cobb advocated for Freedom Schools as a way to develop political awareness and involvement
by African Americans in Mississippi. After leaving Mississippi in 1967, Cobb helped found
the Washington D.C. bookstore Drum and Spear, continued his efforts in African American
education with the Center for Black Education, and began a long career in journalism,
working for WHUR Radio, National Public Radio, Frontline, and National Geographic. Cobb has
been a visiting professor of Africana studies at Brown University, an analyst for
allAfrica.com, and is a founding member, and hall of fame inductee, of the National
Association of Black Journalists.</p>

<p>Produced mostly by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio of China, documentary
films and newsreels were two of the major mass media and communication channels in China
from the 1950s through 1970s. They covered all aspects of social activities, though the
emphasis was on developments and achievements in the building of a socialist country. In
order to reach even broader public audiences, government agents produced and printed the
transcripts and shot lists for the films and sent them to cities and rural areas. Few of
these printed materials have survived due to the poor quality of the paper upon which they
were printed. The material in this collection was found in a cinema company office in Henan
province, China.</p>

<p>Dr. Jane Clarke-Owen was born in 1854 in Warsaw, Indiana, where her mother, Dr. Marie Parks
Furlong, practiced medicine. She married Thaddeus L. "Tom" Clarke in 1875 and had two
daughters with him, Laura (b. 1877) and Therese (b. 1878). After divorcing her husband in
1884, she enrolled at Women's Medical College in Chicago. She studied there from 1885 to
1889. She lived apart from her daughters for much of her schooling and early career. After
1890, Clarke-Owen practiced medicine in Boston and elsewhere on the east coast. In order to
support herself and her daughters, she also took on various odd jobs, including writing,
working for Charles Hughes's presidential campaign, and operating a convalescent home. She
was married briefly for a second time to a railroad worker named Ole Owen. She died in
1917.</p>
<p>Laura Clarke, Dr. Clarke-Owen's oldest daughter, lived on and off with her mother while she
worked as a book canvasser, department store products demonstrator, and shop assistant in
Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. Therese Clarke became an actress
under the stage name Maguerite Urquhart and toured with various stock companies in the south
and midwest. In 1904 she married a fellow actor, Will Dougherty, known on the stage as
William H. Dupont, and converted to Roman Catholicism. She had two sons with Dougherty,
Richard and Edwin, before their marriage ended.</p>

<p>Carl V. Corley was a white author and illustrator of a variety of materials such as gay
pulp fiction, comic books, physique art, utopian science fiction, Louisiana history
(especially on Cajun folkways), and also books on religious themes.</p>
<p>Corley was born in Florence, Mississippi in 1921. He graduated from Florence High School
and served in the U.S. Marine Corps in the South Pacific in World War II. After the war,
Corley worked as an illustrator for the Highway Department in Mississippi (1947-1961) and
Louisiana (1961-1981). In his official capacities, he designed and drew tourist guides,
manuals, pamphlets, road maps, and traffic surveys. In the 1970s and early 1980s, he
contributed an illustrated strip on Louisiana folklore to the Eunice News. Corley passed
away on November 3, 2016, in Jackson, Louisiana.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Corley made a name for himself as a "physique artist," as he contributed
drawings of scantily clad men to fitness magazines--a genre that has been identified by
cultural historians as early homoerotica. Between 1966 and 1971, he published twenty-two
paper back novels of gay male pulp fiction.</p>
<p>Sabina Allred Allen was born on June 21, 1922, to Robert and Mamie Allred in Mississippi.
She married Bobby Arnold in September 1946, shortly after she and Corley ended their
relationship. Sabina and Bobby divorced in May 1949, and then she married Dempsey Allen in
June 1949. Sabina Allred Allen passed away on December 7, 2008, in Pearl, Mississippi.</p>

<p>Consumer Reports is a product testing and consumer advocacy nonprofit organization based in
Yonkers, N.Y., founded in 1936. The National Association of Consumers was a consumer
advocacy and lobbying organization founded in 1946 and active until around 1957-1958.</p>
<p>The National Association of Consumers (NAC) formed in 1946 as a private-sector initiative
to continue the consumer advocacy work of the Office of Price Administration's Consumers
Advisory Committee when the government agency was disbanded after World War II. Helen Hall,
vice chairperson of the Consumer Advisory Committee and director of the Henry Street
Settlement, was named president of the NAC. Membership in the organization consisted of both
individuals and local chapters, made up of existing consumer organizations as well as newly
formed organizations. Originally headquartered in Washington, D.C., the NAC moved to the
Henry Street Settlement in New York and later to Amherst, Mass. The NAC was a registered
lobbyist that advocated for a wide range of issues, including food standards, product
labeling, rent control, milk prices as well as for the creation of Cabinet-level consumer
protection agencies. The NAC's status as a lobby eventually restricted its ability to secure
private-sector funding and its viability declined through the 1950s. In 1955 the NAC
reorganized as an educational corporation and pursued a merger with the Council on Consumer
Information, which never materialized. Dr. William Haller, an economist at Dickinson
College, took on the role of executive secretary in 1955, but NAC operations stalled and the
organization was effectively inactive around 1957. </p>

<p>Griffith J. Davis, known as "Griff," was born in Atlanta, Georgia on April 18, 1923. He was
introduced to photography during high school. After serving in World War II, Davis returned
to Atlanta where his photojournalism career flourished as he worked while at Morehouse
College for the <title render="italic">Atlanta Daily World</title>, <title render="italic">Time</title>, and <title render="italic">Ebony</title>, who authorized him to do a
photojournalism spread on his sister's high school, the Palmer Memorial Institute, a private
boarding school in North Carolina. </p>
<p>Griff Davis' journalistic career introduced him to many political and cultural players of
the time, including Langston Hughes, who was one of his earliest mentors. Davis received his
M.A. in journalism from Columbia in 1949, the only Black student in the program. As a
journalist for the Black Star photo agency, <title render="italic">New York Times</title>,
<title render="italic">Ebony</title>, and many other publications, Davis traveled in the
United States, Africa, and Europe during the forties and fifties. In 1952 the Republic of
Liberia sponsored Davis' one-man show "Liberia, 1952," at the American Museum of Natural
History, and in the years that followed he produced three documentary films, including one
narrated by the then-unknown actor Sidney Poitier. </p>
<p>In 1952 Davis joined the U.S. Foreign Service, spending most of his time advancing Truman's
Point Four program for foreign aid (later USAID), chiefly in Liberia. He also served in
Tunisia and Nigeria, and retired in 1985. In 1993, Morehouse College awarded Davis the
Bennie Trailblazer Award, named for his former mentor and president of Morehouse, Benjamin
Mays, for personal and professional achievements. Griff Davis passed away in 1993 in
Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 70.</p>

<p>The founder of Palmer Memorial Institute, Charlotte Hawkins Brown (1883–1961) was
born in Henderson, North Carolina, and raised and educated in Massachusetts. Brown
named the Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute (PMI) in Sedalia, North Carolina,
after her mentor and benefactor, the second woman president of Wellesley College.
Brown raised funds to expand campus facilities and worked to strengthen PMI's artistic
and scholarly offerings, and through her efforts, the school evolved from an
agricultural and manual training facility to a fully accredited, nationally recognized
African American preparatory school for junior and senior high school students. In
1987 the Charlotte Hawkins Brown Museum opened on the PMI grounds as North Carolina's
first African American state historic site. </p>

<p>Charles Alston and Hale Woodruff were 20th century African American artists. Although
they were known for their commissioned mural works, they also created paintings,
sculptures, and other artworks.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s Alston and Woodruff began work on a mural project commissioned by
Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, which asked the artists to illustrate
African American contributions to the settling of California. Alston worked with
Woodruff on the murals in a large studio space in New York; they used ladders to reach
the upper parts of the canvas. The mural consists of two panels: "Exploration and
Colonization" by Alston and "Settlement and Development" by Woodruff. The murals were
unveiled in 1949 at the Golden State Mutual Headquarters in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Decentralization Conference-Seminars are funded by a grant from the National Science
Foundation (NSF) and administered through the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
The CEME, Conferences on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics, was created to form
several series of standing national seminars on various topics. Both the General Equilibrium
and Decentralization conference series were formed out of the mathematical economics side of
the organization. The Decentralization Conference was first coordinated by Roy Radner. The
conference is traditionally held once a year, but occasionally more often. The first
Decentralization Conference was held at UC Berkeley in 1971. </p>
<p>The term decentralization refers to the starting point of many of the problems addressed in
the series: the necessary information starts in a decentralized state. Much of the
conference series has focused on questions of design and of various systems for production
and allocation of goods, services, and information. These range from understanding voting
systems to markets to the organization of the internal lines of communication and assignment
of tasks within a firm. Topics covered at past conferences include: mechanism and market
design, recourse allocation, matching, team theory, contracting, organization of the firm,
communication, computation, and processing of information. Currently, the Decentralization
conference series includes the design of any institutions, contracts, organizations, or
relationships in which information and/or incentives play a role.</p>

U.S. newspapers. Its predecessor, also titled the <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic Digest</title>, was published by the Women's Division of the Democratic
National Committee from 1933-1953. The <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic
Digest</title> was continued in 1961 as <title type="simple" render="italic">The

<p>The chief editor during the time represented by this collection was Clayton Fritchey
(1904-2001), a journalist who was also assistant to the Secretary of Defense and
assistant to President Trumann; he also had close relations with Adlai Stevenson in
various capacities. The managing editor was Samuel C. Brightman (1911-1992), noted
Washington correspondent and Democratic Party public relations manager. Serving as
senior editor was Philip Stern (1926-1992), also director of research for the Democratic
National Committee (1953-1956); and deputy assistant to the Secretary of State for
Public Affairs (1961-1962). The <title type="simple" render="italic">Democratic

<p>The Dismal Swamp Land Company was founded by George Washington, Thomas Walker, William
Nelson, Thomas Nelson, Robert Burwell, John Robinson, Fielding Lewis, Anthony Bacon, John
Lyme, Samuel Gist, Robert Tucker, and William Waters. The number of shareholders grew as
original owners divested their interests and family inherited stakes. The Company operated
between 1763-1879 and was originally interested in agricultural pursuits (including rice
cultivation), but the sale of cypress shingles and staves proved more profitable. The
company went under as a result of post-Civil War economic conditions and concurrent decrease
in the shingle trade.</p>

<p>Dorsey and Whitney LLP is a business law firm which was founded in 1912 in Minneapolis, MN,
where its headquarters are still located, to provide legal counseling to the First Bank of
Minneapolis. A team of three lawyers, Mark S. Sullivan, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and
Christopher G. Karagheuzoff, from the New York Office of the firm took on the cases of
Bahraini Guantánamo detainees <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph> in 2004. These lawyers
represented the Bahraini detainees until the release and repatriation of all of them by
2008. Sullivan, Colangelo-Bryan and Karagheuzoff did not only follow the legal cases of
their Bahraini detainees but also got involved in public activities in order to raise
awareness about the human rights situation and abuses at the military detention center in
Guantánamo Naval Base. They also initiated negotiations with Bahraini diplomats and
officials regarding the release and repatriation of their clients. The team of Dorsey &amp;
Whitney lawyers also paid a visit to Bahrain to meet with the relatives of their
clients.</p>
<p>Jumah Al-Dossari is a joint citizen of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia detained in December 2001
in Pakistan, kept under arrest by the U.S. military in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and
transferred to Camp Delta military detention center in January 2002 and eventually released
without facing any charges in 2007. He suffered severe psychological and physical abuse both
in Kandahar and Guantánamo. Al-Dossari attempted suicide thirteen times and went on hunger
strikes at least twice while under extra-judicial detention at Guantánamo. His case became
an emblematic example of the abuse and torture at Guantánamo naval base and detrimental
consequences of long term solitary confinement. Al-Dossari was represented by the Dorsey
&amp; Whitney LLP lawyer Joshua Colangelo-Bryan and he was repatriated to Saudi Arabia in
2007.</p>
<p>Joshua Colangelo-Bryan is a Senior Attorney at the New York office of Dorsey &amp; Whitney
LLP. He gained his law degree in 1999 from the University of Washington School Of Law. Prior
to working for Dorsey, Joshua served with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, where he
participated in the prosecution of criminal cases involving war crimes and terrorism. He
also has participated in post-conflict humanitarian aid work in the Balkans. He practices in
the areas of complex civil litigation, employment law, and securities fraud. He also
represents individuals and entities before federal and state agencies. He devotes a
substantial portion of his practice to <title type="simple" render="italic">pro bono</title>
cases, including the representation of Guantánamo Bay detainees.</p>

<p>Born on November 22, 1912, Doris Duke was the only child of James Buchanan (J.B.) Duke, a
founder of the American Tobacco Company and Duke Energy Company and a benefactor of Duke
University, and Nanaline Holt Duke. Inheriting a bulk of her father's estate in 1925, which
included Duke Farms in New Jersey, Rough Point in Newport, R.I., and a mansion in New York
City, Doris was soon dubbed by the press as "the richest girl in the world." Although Doris
did her best to live a private life, she carried on the Duke family's pattern of
philanthropy by contributing to a number of public causes such as the arts, historic
preservation, and the environment. Doris Duke died in October 1993 at the age of 80. In her
will she left the majority of her estate to the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

<p>Crystal Eastman (June 25, 1881-July 8, 1928) was an American lawyer, antimilitarist,
feminist, socialist, and journalist. She attended Vassar College and Columbia University,
and obtained her law degree from New York University (1907). Her first job as an attorney
was to investigate labor conditions for the Russell Sage Foundation. Her pioneering report,
Work Accidents and the Law (1910), led New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to appoint her
the first woman on New York State's Commission on Employers' Liability and Causes of
Industrial Accidents, Unemployment and Lack of Farm Labor. As a member of that commission,
Eastman drafted the country's first workers' compensation law. During Woodrow Wilson's
administration, Eastman became investigating attorney for the United States Commission on
Industrial Relations. Meanwhile, Eastman also struggled to further women's rights--first
suffrage and later equal rights--as co-author of the first Equal Rights Amendment. During
World War I, she was a leader of the peace movement, working with Carrie Chapman Catt to
organize the Carnegie Hall meeting that led to the founding of the Woman's Peace Party of
New York--later renamed the Women's International League of Peace and Freedom--the oldest
women's peace organization. Eastman became Executive Secretary of the Women's Peace Party. A
leading advocate for civil liberties and the rights of conscientious objectors during World
War I, she joined Norman Thomas and Roger Baldwin in founding the American Civil Liberties
Union. </p>
<p>In 1910 Eastman married Wallace Benedict; the marriage ended in divorce in 1915. As a
statement of financial and personal independence, Eastman refused to accept alimony, stating
that to accept her former husband's money would be to betray herself as both a woman and a
feminist. In 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist Walter Fuller; the
couple had two children, Jeffrey and Annis.</p>

<p>Eclipse Enterprises, also known as Eclipse Comics, was an independent American comic book
publisher during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1978, it published the first graphic novel
intended for specialty comic stores; it also was one of the first companies to offer
royalties and creator ownership of rights. It was also one of the early comic book
publishers to produce trading cards.</p>
<p>Eclipse Enterprises was founded by brothers Jan and Dean Mullaney in 1977; it eventually
settled and operated in Sonoma County, California. Due to the controversial products it
distributed (which led to several lawsuits), as well as a devestating flood in 1986, Eclipse
suffered ongoing financial hardships and eventually ceased operations in 1994. The owners
filed for bankruptcy in 1995.</p>

<p>His papers consist of large numbers of sermons, articles (he wrote regularly for the
Christian Century in the 1960s and 1970s), and columns as well as some correspondence. He
began speaking out on racial justice in 1942 with a sermon attacking the biological idea of
race that got him barred from the pulpit of Washington Street Methodist Church in Columbia.
In the early 1970s, before Roe v. Wade, he was active in the Clergy Consultation on
Abortion, an abortion referral network, and he wrote a number of sermons and columns on gay
rights, drawing on the experience of having a lesbian sister.</p>

<p>Margaret Fishback Antolini was an advertising copywriter and author of light verse and
prose. She was known for her wry, cynical attitudes towards domesticity, and her marriage to
Alberto Gastone Antolini in 1935 prompted headlines such as <title render="doublequote">Sneerer at Love Engaged to Wed</title> ( <title render="italic">The New York
American</title>, 17 April 1935). The couple had one son, Tony. Fishback lived in several
New York City neighborhoods, settling in Murray Hill in 1941, where she would remain until
at least 1976. She spent most summers in Thomaston, Maine.</p>
<p>Fishback contributed light verse and prose to a number of national publications, including
<title render="italic">Collier's</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Cosmopolitan</title>, <title render="italic">Glamour</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Good Housekeeping</title>, <title render="italic">Harper's Bazaar</title>,
<title render="italic">Look</title>, <title render="italic">Mademoiselle</title>, <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, <title render="italic">Reader's Digest</title>,
<title render="italic">Saturday Evening Post</title>, and <title render="italic">Woman's
Day</title>. She authored several compilations of light verse, an etiquette book called
<title render="italic">Safe Conduct: When to Behave--and Why</title>, and two children's
books. Common themes in Fishback's work include New York City, womanhood, marriage, and
career. Fishback also frequently based her writings on stories and advertisements in
newspapers. She published primarily under her maiden name, but also occasionally under her
married name and the pseudonyms <emph render="doublequote">Marne</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">Marnie.</emph>
</p>
<p>Fishback was described in a 1932 New York newspaper article as <emph render="doublequote">the highest-paid advertising woman in the world</emph>. In addition to her advertising
work for Macy's and various advertising agencies, she also did extensive freelance work.
Fishback contributed to advertising campaigns for Arrow Shirts, Borden's, Chef Boy-Ar-Dee,
Clairol, DuPont, Gimbels, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P), Hanes Hosiery,
Martex, Norsk, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Seagram's, Simmons Beautyrest, and Wrigley, among several
others. She was also a member of the professional society Advertising Women of New York
(AWNY).</p>

<p>Bruno Foa (1905-1999) was a white Italian-born, Jewish economist, lawyer, consultant, and
professor. Educated in Italy as an economist and lawyer, he became Italy's youngest full
professor of economics at age 28. In 1937, he married Lisa Haimann, a refugee from Munich,
and they moved to London in 1938. While in London, he worked for the British Broadcasting
Company, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and guest lectured at the
London School of Economics.</p>
<p>In 1940, Foa moved his family to the United States. He began work at Princeton University
on a Rockefeller Foundation Grant and later moved to Washington, DC, where he worked for the
Rockefeller Foundation, the Office of Inter-American Affairs, the Bureau of Latin American
Affairs and the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>In 1945, Foa settled in New York City and became an economic consultant focusing on Italian
reconstruction and economic development after World War II. During this time, he published
his book on Italian monetary reconstruction and wrote many articles in both American and
Italian journals about financial development. He taught at Yale University and the
University of Pennsylvania, among many other guest lecturer positions.</p>
<p>Foa's work afforded him the opportunity to travel many times to Europe, especially Italy,
and other destinations around the globe, including Jerusalem, Somalia, and South America. In
Europe and America, he encountered, knew, and worked with a variety of people from a wide
range of professions: economists, writers, architects, businessmen, politicians, labor
leaders, and Zionists.</p>

<head>The Farm Security Administration Project</head>
<p>The Farm Security Administration (FSA) was created in 1937 under the Department of
Agriculture, as part of the U.S. Federal government "New Deal" recovery programs following
the Great Depression. Its main purpose was to minister to the needs of and improve the dire
situation of impoverished rural people across the U.S. </p>
<p>In support of this effort, the FSA hired noted photographers and oral history interviewers
to promote FSA programs and to document economic and social conditions and natural
landscapes of the U.S. and its territories, as well as to illustrate the still-present
vitality of the United States in the aftermath of the Depression. Led by
economist/photographer Roy Stryker, the project ran until 1942, when the FSA was dissolved
and subsumed under the Office of War Information (OWI). Many of the photographers hired for
the FSA continued their work under the OWI.</p>
<p>Between 1937 and 1946, FSA/OWI photographers created over 175,000 black-and-white images,
and only about 1600 color images using Kodachrome chromogenic film, at that time a
relatively new technology. Among the FSA photographers were Jack Delano, Russell Lee, and
Marion Post Wolcott, whose color images form this collection. </p>

<p>Alberta Bassett (Stith Jones Gillingham was the daughter of Dr. Nicholas Long Bolling
Stith, who graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1829 and who
lived in Halifax County and then in Raleigh. He had at least two other children, Anna
Guion and Fred H. Stith. Dr. Stith and his brother, A.B. Stith, bought 1000 shares of
stock in the Ward gold mine in 1854, one of the largest mines in the Cid mining district
of Davidson County, N.C. Mrs. Gillingham inherited at least part of the properties which
she came to hold in the Cid mining district. It appears from the papers that her mining
interests included gold, silver, copper, sulphur, and zinc. One of the mines she came to
own was the Ward mine. Her first marriage in 1881 was to J. Howard Jones, also a mine
owner, who died in 1884. She also became involved with a lawyer from Charlotte, William
H. Bailey. She married her second husband, Captain H.R. Gillingham, in 1905. By then,
Alberta and her brother and sister had become estranged, and a long legal battle ensued
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries over the ownership of the mines.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Hamilton (1763-1829) was likely born in Scotland, and emigrated to the United
States in 1784. He established a business in Charleston, South Carolina, as a shipping
merchant associated with Edward Mortimer &amp; Co. of Charleston, David McCredie of
Charleston and Savannah, and Henry Bethune &amp; Co. of London. In 1800 he established a
cotton plantation on St. Simons Island, Ga., with about 300 slaves, and later jointly
owned (with John Couper) a second plantation property, a rice plantation with 450
slaves, Hopeton, on the Altamaha River near Darien, Georgia. He also acquired two
substantial town homes, No.13 Broad Street in Charleston, and No. 260 Walnut Street in
Philadelphia. His wife was Nancy Isabella Steedman (1780-c.1818) of London. They had two
children, Agnes Rebecca, and George (b.1806). </p>
<p>At his death in April 1829 in Philadelphia, Hamilton owned four coastal Georgia
plantations, and a total of 662 slaves, and was a very rich man. He devised his entire
estate in trust to his grandchildren, of whom only one, Isabella Hamilton Corbin
(b.1827), was alive in 1829. The other two legatees were Elizabeth T. Corbin (b.1831),
and Richard Washington Corbin (1837-1922). Each heir was to receive a full one-third
share upon reaching the age of 21 years. After his death the executors invested heavily
in 5% bonds of the State of Pennsylvania, and during and after the Civil War in U.S.
Treasury bonds. After the 1827 marriage of Agnes Rebecca Hamilton to Francis Porteus
Corbin (1801-1876), a lawyer from Virginia, the Corbins lived in France. The other
child, George, never married and later lived in Liverpool. Collateral relations included
his wife's niece Isabella Bethune (1804), his wife's cousin Margerat (Mrs. Daniel)
Kennedy (1805), his nephew Robert Wilson and grand-nephew James Hamilton Wilson, both of
Liverpool, and his niece Janet Wilson of Philadelphia and Scotland. </p>
<p>In 1848, after two decades of the administration of Hamilton's estate, principally the
Georgia slave plantations and the Pennsylvania state bonds and other financial
investments, the estate was valuated at over $1 million, including 764 slaves. </p>
<p>As directed, from 1848-1858 the estate was successively divided among the three heirs,
with Francis P. Corbin as trustee for the shares of Isabella H. (1848) and Elizabeth T.
(1852), and with annuities funded principally by Pennsylvania and U.S. bonds exempted
from the estate division, continuing to Agnes Corbin and George Hamilton through at
least 1867.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Muriel W. Henderson was born on June 20, 1920 in Tacoma, Washington, and died on June 9,
2009 in Chapel Hill, NC. Her family and friends knew her as Ki. She lived a full and
active life with a wonderful will to experience as much as possible. She spent 22 years
as a missionary in Angola with her husband Larry, leaving there in 1969 when the
colonial war for independence made it hard to continue the work. She and Larry moved to
New Jersey where he worked for the mission board in New York and she worked in social
services. She loved working with African students at the Africa-America Institute. Ki
and Larry finished their careers in Florida, first in Leisure City and then at Sun City
Center. From 1985 to 1991 they lived in Portugal, where they had first gone in 1947 to
learn Portuguese for their work in Angola. Ki helped Larry research in Portuguese
archives for his book on the church in Angola. While there, they reconnected with many
old friends from Angola. In 1991 they moved to Durham, NC and became active in the life
of Pilgrim United Church of Christ. Ki was a life-long letter writer and corresponded
with friends and colleagues all over the world.</p>

<p>William Woods Holden (1818-1892) was a journalist and Republican governor of North Carolina
from Raleigh (Wake Co.) N.C.. He was owner and editor of the North Carolina Standard
newspaper from 1843 to 1860, during which time he was a member of the Democratic Party. He
served as a N.C. delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Charleston, S.C., in
1860. As the Civil War progressed, Holden criticized the Confederate government and became a
leader of the North Carolina peace movement. In May 1865 President Andrew Johnson appointed
him provisional governor of North Carolina, serving until December 1865. In 1868 he ran and
won as the Republican candidate for governor. In an effort to combat the Ku Klux Klan,
Holden suspended habeas corpus and imposed martial law on Alamance and Caswell counties. He
was impeached in 1870 by the Democratic state legislature on eight charges related to the
rough treatment of North Carolina citizens due to his efforts to combat the Ku Klux Klan. He
was convicted of six of the eight charges and removed from office in 1871. Following his
removal from office, Holden moved to Washington, D.C. and resumed a career in journalism. In
1873, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him postmaster, a position he held in Raleigh
until 1881.</p>
<p>Holden was married twice: first to Ann Augusta Young, who died in 1852 and with whom he had
four children. He married Louisa Virginia Harrison, a widow with four children of her own,
in 1854. He died in Raleigh in 1892. </p>
<p>Holden was sued by a rival newspaperman, Josiah Turner, in 1885, following Turner's arrest
by Holden during his term as governor. The suit continued into the 1890s, despite Holden's
being incapacitated by poor health. His wife, Louisa Virginia Holden, acted in his place and
the suit was continued against her after Holden's death in 1892. Turner lost the suit in
1894.</p>

<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Edward Jenner, (born May 17, 1749, Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England—died January 26,
1823, Berkeley), was an English surgeon and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox
vaccine, the world's first vaccine. </p>
<p>Jenner was a country youth, the son of a clergyman. Because Edward was only five when his
father died, he was brought up by an older brother, who was also a clergyman. Edward
acquired a love of nature that remained with him all his life. He attended grammar school
and at the age of 13 was apprenticed to a nearby surgeon. In the following eight years
Jenner acquired a sound knowledge of medical and surgical practice. On completing his
apprenticeship at the age of 21, he went to London and became the house pupil of John
Hunter, who was on the staff of St. George’s Hospital and was one of the most prominent
surgeons in London. Even more important, however, he was an anatomist, biologist, and
experimentalist of the first rank; not only did he collect biological specimens, but he also
concerned himself with problems of physiology and function.</p>
<p>In addition to his training and experience in biology, Jenner made progress in clinical
surgery. After studying in London from 1770 to 1773, he returned to country practice in
Berkeley and enjoyed substantial success. In addition to practicing medicine, he joined two
medical groups for the promotion of medical knowledge and wrote occasional medical papers.
He played the violin in a musical club, wrote light verse, and, as a naturalist, made many
observations, particularly on the nesting habits of the cuckoo and on bird migration.</p>
<p>Smallpox was widespread in the 18th century, and occasional outbreaks of special intensity
resulted in a very high death rate. Jenner had been impressed by the fact that a person who
had suffered an attack of cowpox—a relatively harmless disease that could be contracted from
cattle—could not take the smallpox—i.e., could not become infected whether by accidental or
intentional exposure to smallpox. Pondering this phenomenon, Jenner concluded that cowpox
not only protected against smallpox but could be transmitted from one person to another as a
deliberate mechanism of protection. In May 1796 Jenner found a young dairymaid, Sarah
Nelmes, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hand. On May 14, using matter from Sarah’s
lesions, he inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, who had never had smallpox.
Phipps became slightly ill over the course of the next 9 days but was well on the 10th. On
July 1 Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with smallpox matter. No disease
developed; protection was complete. In 1798 Jenner, having added further cases, published
privately a slender book entitled An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae
Vaccinae.</p>
<p>Early reactions to the Inquiry from the medical community and the general public were
mixed. Members of the medical community, especially those with investments in the practice
of variolation, tried to discredit Jenner’s discovery or stake their own claim to it. Jenner
had especially acrimonious feuds with two London physicians, Dr. George Pearson and Dr.
William Woodville. Pearson even gave evidence against Jenner’s 1802 petition to the House of
Commons for recognition of his work on vaccination.</p>
<p>Despite some people’s doubts about the safety and efficacy of Jenner’s smallpox vaccine,
there was great demand for cowpox samples to conduct vaccinations in England and abroad.
Jenner and other practitioners in England sent dried cowpox specimens sandwiched between
glass to Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>Originally from Garland, North Carolina, Jefferson D. Johnson, Jr., attended Garland
High School and Trinity Park School in Durham before enrolling in Trinity College in
1919. He served as a private in World War I before returning to college and graduating
with a B.A. in 1923. Johnson was an active member of Trinity's Sigma Chi fraternity and
also played semi-professional baseball. After teaching for a year, he returned to
Trinity and earned a law degree in 1926. In 1935, he married Frances Faison. The couple
eventually had three children. </p>
<p>Johnson became the Town Attorney for Clinton, N.C., and served from 1928-1941. He also
successfully ran for State Senator of the 9th District in 1937 and 1941. In 1941, he was
appointed Special Superior Court Judge, where he served until 1945. He managed the
successful U.S. Senate campaign of J. Melville Broughton in 1948, as well as the
unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign of Franklin P. Graham in 1950. The 1950 campaign was
extremely controversial, with Graham's opponent, Willis Smith, using racist language and
personal attacks on Graham to gather the support of white voters afraid of
desegregation. </p>
<p>In that same year, 1950, Johnson was elected Associate Justice of the State Supreme
Court. He served until forced to retire from illness in 1959. He died shortly afterward
in 1960.</p>

<p>James A. Joseph is a Louisiana native who graduated from Southern University, Baton
Rouge, and from Yale Divinity School. He is an ordained minister and is currently
Professor of the Practice of Public Policy Studies and Leader-in-Residence at the Hart
Leadership Program at Duke University. He is also responsible for launching the
U.S.-Southern Africa Center for Leadership and Public Values.</p>
<p>Joseph has taught at Yale Divinity School and at Clairemont Colleges, where he served as
chaplain. He was also active in the Louisiana Civil Rights movement during the 1960s.
From 1971-1976 he worked as vice president of the Cummins Engine Co. and was president
of the Cummins Engine Foundation. In 1977, he was appointed by President Carter to be
the undersecretary of the Interior, where he served until 1981. He was also chairman of
the presidentially appointed Commission on the Northern Mariannas under President
Carter; a member of the Advisory Committee to the Agency for International Development
under President Reagan; and an incorporating director of the Points of Light Foundation
and a member of the Presidential Commission on Historically Black Colleges under
President Bush. He is also a former president and CEO of the Council on Foundations,
1982-1995.</p>
<p>Joseph served as ambassador to South Africa from January 1996 to November 1999, and was
the first and only U.S. ambassador to present his credentials to President Nelson
Mandela. In recognition of Joseph's contributions, South African President Thabo Mbeki
awarded him the Order of Good Hope, the highest honor the Republic of South Africa
bestows on a citizen of another country. Before serving in South Africa, Joseph was the
first chairman of the board of directors of President Clinton's Corporation for National
Service.</p>

<p>The J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT), founded in 1864, is one of the largest and oldest
enduring advertising agencies in the United States. The Diamond Information Center (DIC)
operates as the public relations division of the diamond marketing group at J. Walter

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Beginning in 1919 the New York Office of the J. Walter Thompson Company began to
systematically retain the advertisements it had created. The Statistical and Information
Department, renamed the Information and Records Department in the 1920s, arranged the
advertisements in scrapbooks. Initially, most of the advertisements preserved were tear
sheets, the actual advertisements clipped from newspapers and magazines. By the 1930s,
however, the department retained the final printers' proofs for magazine advertisements. The
scrapbooks therefore began to be called <emph render="doublequote">proof books.</emph>
</p>
<p>In the 1950s the responsibility for creating proof books fell to individual account groups.
In addition to the account group proof books, a file clerk under the supervision of the
Traffic Department maintained proofs. When no longer of current use, the file clerk
transferred the proofs to a storeroom or records center. Throughout these years, individuals
who helped create campaigns or who managed an account sometimes would maintain personal
proof books.</p>
<p>In 1977 the New York Office established a Creative Library. Its responsibilities included
the preservation on microfilm of all print advertisements, which was done for most of the
1980s. Imprints are located in the JWT Microfilm Collection; the originals were apparently
destroyed after microfilming. The Creative Library has made an effort to create files of
work from all major U.S. offices, so work from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, and Washington, D.C., is better represented in the collection from the late 1970s
and after. Where known, the office that created the advertisements is noted in the container
list. In addition, JWT subsidiaries such as Brouillard Communications or Lord Geller
Federico and Einstein (LGFE) are noted where their work has been identified. </p>

<p>The Information Center was founded by the J. Walter Thompson Company New York Office in
1918. The records contain several folders detailing efforts to reorganize and expand the
Center's services in the mid-1950s. Included are reports describing the purpose of the
Center personnel recruitment efforts, and readings about ways to organize office files.
In 1980, some of these records were transferred to the J. Walter Thompson Company
Archives, which was established in New York in 1979. Some of the files remained active
in the Archives until the records were transferred to Duke University in 1987.</p>

<p>The Great Kanto earthquake struck the Japanese island of Honshu at 11:58 a.m. on September
1, 1923. With a magnitude of 8.3 on the Richter scale, the earthquake leveled Tokyo and the
surrounding areas of Yokohama, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizouka. Along with the destruction of
buildings and land, the earthquake resulted in widespread fires, as many people had been
cooking their lunch around the time that the earthquake struck. A simultaneous typhoon in
Northern Japan led to high winds that caused firestorms in cities across the region. </p>
<p>Estimated casualties from the earthquake and the resulting fires range from 100,000 to
150,000 people. About 2 million people were left homeless. Over the next several years,
Tokyo was rebuilt with stricter safety standards, and more parks were added to offer open
spaces as refuges. In 1960, the Japanese government declared September 1 to be Disaster
Prevention Day. </p>

<p>Wallace Vickers Kaufman was born April 10th, 1939 in Queens, New York . Kaufman came to
Duke University to study English in 1957, taking his A.B. in 1961. He also studied at
Merton College at Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar from 1961-1963.</p>
<p>Along with fellow classmates and writers Fred Chappel and Anne Tyler, Kaufman's writing
was fosterd under the direction of William Blackburn. Also while at Duke Kaufman
developed a close student-mentor relationship with author Reynolds Price. Kaufman and
Price continued to correspond well into Kaufman's own professional career. After
graduating, Kaufman taught high school sciences courses, middle school English, and
writing courses at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
While a resident of Chatham County, Kaufman developed an interest in land development
projects that included caveats for environmental protection. An extension of this
interest led to involvment with, among otehr regional and national environmental
organizations, the Conservation Council of North Carolina (CCNC), an organization that
Kaufman eventually chaired. Kaufman also served on several local and state boards of
realtors, the North Carolina Land Stewardship Council, and Conservation Fund, North
Carolina. At this time, Kaufman also travelled extensively in Latin America. During his
travels Kaufman promoted indigenous writers, particularly Guatemalan writer Victor
Dinoicio Montejo.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s Kaufman began consulting work for the World Bank and the International
City/County Management Association in nations of the former Soviet Union and Eastern
Bloc, including Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Kazakhstan, the final Soviet
Republic to declare independence. This work encompassed a broad scope of work including
advising local residents on land and housing reform, teaching property valuation,
investigating the effectiveness of aid projects, economic surveys, and some work
training local journalists. In 2001 Kaufman relocated to western Oregon where he began a
career in arbitration and mediation.</p>

<p>Frances Anne "Fanny" Kemble was a British actress, writer, and abolitionist. She was born
into a theater family; her acting career spanned the years 1829-1868. Kemble acted to
support herself, but she was most passionate about writing, and was an accomplished
playwright, poet, and diarist. She married Pierce Mease Butler, an American who subsequently
inherited his family's plantations. After spending time in Georgia, Kemble became an
abolitionist and later divorced her husband. In 1863, Kemble published her anti-slavery
memoir, Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, which is said to have
influenced the British against supporting the Confederacy in the Civil War. Kemble's own
family was divided on that issue, as her elder daughter sided with her mother, while her
younger daughter returned to Georgia with her father. Frances Butler Leigh published Ten
Years on a Georgia Plantation Since the War (1883) as a rebuttal to her mother's memoir.
Kemble's success as a Shakespearean actress enabled her to buy a cottage in Lenox, Mass. Her
correspondent, Miss Patteson, is the daughter of Frances Duke Patteson, a niece of the poet
Samuel Coleridge Taylor; the Lord Coleridge mentioned in the letter is John Duke Coleridge
(1820-1894), the 2nd Lord Chief Justice of England. Bishop Patteson refers to Miss
Patteson's sister, John Patteson (1827-1871), who became an Anglican martyr after being
killed doing mission work in the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>Born in Hungary, André Kertész (1894-1985) was known for his mastery of composition with
light, his experimental photography, and for his street photography and portraiture.
After living in Paris for a decade and developing his style as a photographer and
photojournalist, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1936, where he continued his work. After
World War II, Kertész became a naturalized U.S. citizen, returning in subsequent years
to France and other places around the world to take photographs. </p>
<p>After practicing as a photojournalist in Europe and in the United States for a good part
of his career, in the early 1960s he pulled away from this type of work for good, and
enjoyed a period of growing and widespread acknowledgment of the quality of his work. He
died in 1985 in New York City.</p>

name from nearby Baptist Church; comprised of families and individuals who worked
collectively on the dairy, agricultural, forestry, and woodworking projects which

conscientious objectors who had served prison sentences, joined the cooperative bringing
an emphasis on pacifism; last stages of cooperative lasted from 1953-1957 when members
of group explored the possibility of merging with the religious community known as the

in Minnesota and Iowa, and his retirement years in Manchester, Tennessee. While on his
travels in and out of uniform, he recorded a wealth of observations concerning the events,
people, and environments in each area. Marshall supplemented his observations with accounts
of his own participation in politics and economic endeavors, as well as commentary on
national figures and events. His experiences in the Midwest and the South are complemented

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>John B. McFerrin was a professor of finance at the University of Florida, as well as a
past president of the Southern Economic Association. His Ph.D. was from the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with his dissertation on Caldwell and Company.
McFerrin's book, <title type="simple" render="italic">Caldwell and Company: A Southern
Financial Empire</title>, was first published in 1939 and updated in 1969.</p>
<p>Caldwell and Company was founded in Nashville in 1917 by Rogers C. Caldwell. Originally
a municipal bonds distributor, the company grew rapidly--first selling real estate bonds
and industrial securities, and later acquiring ownership and interests in banks
(including the Bank of Tennessee), newspapers, and other ventures, including Nashville's
professional baseball team. By 1929, it was the largest investment banking house in the
south.</p>
<p>All was not well with the company's finances, however. Rogers Caldwell charged his
personal expenses to the company, securities were substituted unethically, and the
business had inadequate cash reserves to legally cover its investments. Caldwell and
Company also became involved in state politics, financially backing Colonel Luke Lea and
his interests. (Lea was also from Nashville, a former United States Senator, and a
newspaper publisher.) Lea's influence with the state government, including Governor
Henry Horton, led to significant deposits of Tennessee money into Caldwell banks,
bypassing competitive bidding for state-funded projects. In September 1930, bank
examiners discovered the low cash reserves, and on November 7 the Bank of Tennessee was
declared insolvent. The collapse of Caldwell and Company immediately followed, including
runs on other company-owned banks across the South. On November 14, 1930, the company
went into receivership.</p>

<p>John Sidney (1913-1999) and Doris (1918-1998) McGee were appointed on April 11th, 1945 by the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention to Nigeria, where they served eight consecutive terms. Their primary role was that of "missionary advisors," or "field evangelism" for church development. They served at the Baptist College of Iwo from 1945-1948, and then at the Baptist Mission in Igede-Ekiti (Western Nigeria) and Ikogosi from 1949-1977. In 1956, they helped establish the sixth Baptist high school in Nigeria: the Ekiti Baptist High School, in Igede. In 1957, they were made "Chief Gbaiyegun of Igede," by the Onigede and Chiefs of Igede-Ekiti. In 1961, they were made paramount chief by the Ewi of Ado, on behalf of the Ekiti Baptist Association. In 1977, they were made "Chief Akorewolu of Ikogosi" by Loja and Chiefs of Ikogosi-Ekiti. The couple retired in 1978 after thirty-three years of missionary service.</p>
<p>John Sidney and Doris had two sons, John David (b. 1943) and Sidney (b. 1948). The McGees' children stayed with them in Nigeria until John David returned to the US for high school in 1958, where he stayed with a foster family. Much of the correspondence between family members takes place when the McGee children are in the United States to finish their education.</p>

<p>Robert P. Mosteller (b. 1948) is the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor
of Law at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was born in North Carolina
and earned graduate degrees from both Yale and Harvard before working for the
Washington, D.C. Public Defender Service as Director of Training and Chief of the Trial
Division. Mosteller taught at Duke Law School from 1983 to 2008. He is particularly
interested the death penalty, and served as co-reported for the Death Penalty Initiative
of the Constitution Project and as president of the North Carolina Center for Death
Penalty Litigation.</p>
<p>Mosteller was also an attorney for John Wesley Oliver, a former death row inmate whose
case file represents the content in this collection.</p>
<p>In May 1979, John Wesley Oliver and co-defendant George Moore, Jr., were convicted of
murdering Allen Watts and Dayton Hodge in an armed robbery of a gas station in Robeson
County, North Carolina. Oliver was sentenced to death for both murders, while Moore was
sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge. On appeal, the Supreme Court of North
Carolina affirmed the defendants' convictions, but vacated the death sentences and
remanded the cases for re-sentencing. </p>
<p>In January 1982, Oliver was re-sentenced to death for the murder of Dayton Hodge, and
both defendants were sentenced to death for the murder of Allen Watts. The case was
appealed, and the death penalty for Watts' murder was overturned, but Oliver's second
death sentence for the murder of Dayton Hodge was affirmed.</p>
<p>In April 1994, following a hearing on Oliver's Motion for Appropriate Relief, the court
vacated Oliver's death sentence when the Superior Court judge found that the prosecution
had withheld from the defense important information that would have cast doubt on
eyewitnesses' identification of Oliver as the person responsible for the death of Dayton
Hodge. The judge ordered a new sentencing hearing regarding Hodge's murder. In a 2009
article, Mosteller writes that "a combination of processes resulted in the exclusion of
all African Americans in a jurisdiction where approximately one-fourth of the population
was African American from a jury that in 1982 recommended death sentences for two
African American defendents [Oliver and Moore] charged with the murder of two white
men.... The death sentence was vacated on the basis of a violation of the defendant's
due process rights under <title type="simple" render="italic">Brady v. Maryland</title>"
(Kotch and Mosteller: "The Racial Justice Act and the Long Struggle with Race and the
Death Penalty in North Carolina"). </p>
<p>The cases came before the court in November 2001 for re-sentencing, and the State of
North Carolina elected not to seek the death penalty. Oliver was sentenced to life
imprisonment for both murders, while Moore was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
murder of Dayton Hodge. </p>

<p>The Munford and Ellis families were connected through the marriage of George Wythe Munford
and Elizabeth Throwgood Ellis in 1838. The earliest papers from the Munford family center
around William Munford (1775-1825) of the first generation, George Wythe Munford (1803-1882)
of the second generation, and the children of George Wythe Munford, notably Thomas Taylor
Munford (1831-1918), Sallie Radford (Munford) Talbott (1841-1930), Lucy Munford and Fannie
Ellis Munford. Papers of the Ellis family begin with those of Charles Ellis, Sr.
(1772-1840), Richmond merchant; his wife, Margaret (Nimmo) Ellis (1790-1877); and his
brother, Powhatan Ellis (1790-1863), jurist, U.S. senator, and diplomat. Later materials
include letters from Thomas Harding Ellis (1814-1898), son of Charles and Margaret Ellis, as

<p>The National Coalition for Haitian Rights (NCHR) was founded to advocate on behalf of
Haitian citizens, immigrants, and refugees, both in the United States and regionally.</p>
<p>In December 1981, major civil rights organizations joined with Haitian community groups and
advocates to March on Washington to protest President Reagan's new policy of interdiction at
sea of Haitian refugees and indefinite detention of Haitian asylum-seekers. The march was
organized under the banner of an umbrella organization called the Committee for the Defense
of Haitian Refugees (CODEHR). A few months later in February 1982, these organizations
decide to transform CODEHR into the National Emergency Coalition for Haitian Refugees,
appoint an executive director, form a board and raise operational funds from member
organizations. In addition to Haitian advocacy organizations (the Haitian Refugee Center,
Haitian Fathers, Haitian Centers Council) it included major civil rights groups (NAACP,
National Urban League, Southern Christian Leadership Conference), and major denominations
(the US Catholic Conference of Bishops, the Episcopal Church, the National Council of
Churches, Church World Service, and Lutheran Refugee Service) and human rights groups
(Americas Watch, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights), in all about 44 organizations. Bishop
Anthony Bevilacqua and Bayard Rustin as Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, provided
leadership. Susan Buchanan was the first Executive Director. Another key leader was Ira
Gollobin who founded the National Lawyers Guild, headed the National Committee for the
Protection of the Foreign Born, and litigated several key immigration and refugee cases.</p>
<p>Around August/September 1982, the organization eliminated "Emergency" from its title and
became the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. Around this time, Michael S. Hooper
(research director for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights) becomes the new Executive
Director. Jocelyn "Juny" McCalla succeeded him in 1988.</p>
<p>By 1994, after President Clinton's historic decision to deploy 20,000 troops to Haiti to
restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to elected office, NCHR had expanded its scope of
work from refugee rights to civil and international human rights, taking advantage of a
paradigm shift in US-Haiti relations that put the US more on the side of democracy in Haiti.
To reflect this the organization changed its name to the National Coalition for Haitian
Rights in 1995.</p>
<p>From 1995 until 2006, when the organization shut down, NCHR focused on two key goals.
First, it worked to equip Haiti with its own professional human rights group, by grooming
the field office, which it had established in Port-au-Prince in 1992 to become an
independent national group with field offices throughout Haiti. Second, NCHR set its sights
on strengthening the capacity of Haitians to exercise greater political power and influence
over US policy towards Haitian communities and Haiti. In 2004, NCHR-Haiti became the
National Network for the Defense of Human Rights.</p>
<p>During its twenty-four years of operation, NCHR tackled a wide variety of issues faced by
Haitians in Haiti and the US and the Caribbean. These included US immigration policy,
treatment of Haitian immigrants (including such categories as "boat people", migrant
workers, and refugees), documenting conditions at US detention centers such as Guantanamo
and Krome, HIV/AIDS in the Haitian community, human rights abuses and accountability in
Haiti under the Duvalier regime and post-Duvalier governments, police corruption and abuse
both in Haiti and in New York City, and electoral and judicial reform in Haiti. [Source:

<p><emph render="bold">Special Note On Immigration and Legalization in the NCHR
records</emph></p>
<p>Immigration and legalization are a common thread throughout NCHR's existence and in its
historical records.</p>
<p>In June 1982 Judge Eugene Spellman ruled against the Reagan Administration's broad Haitian
detention order, freeing the 3,500 Haitian held in detention centers throughout the country.
Spellman addressed the Administration's concern that, once released, Haitian asylum-seekers
would just disappear into the ether by giving NCHR the responsibility to a) report to the
court on a regular basis whether the Immigration courts complied with the ruling (hearings
could not proceed if the Haitian asylum-seekers did not have legal representation) and b)
secure legal assistance nationwide for the Haitian asylum-seekers. NCHR was uniquely
situated to do so, because its membership consisted of voluntary agencies (USCC, LIRS, CWS,
etc.) that agreed to resettle the released asylum-seekers. Accordingly, NCHR worked with
these groups as well as law firms and legal groups (ACLU, National Lawyers Guild, etc.) to
coordinate legal representation efforts, train pro bono lawyers in the art of Haitian asylum
issues and representation, and communicate with immigration courts around the country on
hearings. Spellman's 1982 ruling was crucial to NCHR's evolution and led to NCHR eliminating
"emergency" from its name.</p>
<p>The aforementioned programs and activities lasted until 1986. In that year, Congress passed
and President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). The legislation
had four provisions, one of which was called Cuban-Haitian Adjustment (CHA), which was in
fact more Haitian than Cuban. This was a far-reaching provision that was adopted primarily
thanks to NCHR. CHA granted Haitian asylum-seekers in the USA since before January 1, 1982
permanent residence (green cards) and made the status retroactive to January 1, 1982. In
other words, any Haitian who qualified for this provision could obtain a green card in 1987,
and immediately fulfill the 5-year residency requirement that made him or her eligible for
US citizenship through naturalization. An estimated 40,000 Haitian refugees benefited from
the legislation. At this point NCHR switched to training lawyers and advocates on the law's
provisions and successful representation.</p>
<p>While these laws and reforms were being enacted in the US, Haitians kept fleeing the
despotic regimes that succeeded the Duvaliers. Thus NCHR's investigating and reporting on
human rights conditions, educating the US Congress and the Administration in order to
influence policymaking and lawmaking continued apace. In 1988, NCHR extended human rights
monitoring to the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas, and initiated a monthly bulletin,
Haiti Insight. The human rights reporting was key to providing substantive support to
Haitian asylum claims. Over time, the bulletin became required reading for US asylum
adjudicators. In 1992, the Haitian military took power through a coup d'état and exiled
President Aristide. Shortly afterwards, thousands of Haitians took to the high seas and were
intercepted by the US Coast Guard and warehoused in the US naval military base at
Guantanamo, Cuba (GTMO). Once again, NCHR was at the forefront of advocating for Haitian
asylum-seekers. The official records of the litigation undertaken on behalf of the Haitian
refugees will not direct the public's attention to NCHR's key role in this effort, but it
was substantial. For strategic and practical reasons, the groups involved in the litigation
chose a member organization -- the Haitian Centers Council – as the lead organization
because it was headquartered in Brooklyn where NCHR and the Yale Law School filed suit on
behalf of the Haitians held in GTMO. By 1994, NCHR had secured the release of about 11,000
Haitian refugees and the right for them to seek asylum on U.S. soil. About 3 years later,
NCHR secured legislation granting them and thousands of others (an estimated 50,000) legal
permanent residence (green cards). NCHR challenged the U.S. Interdiction-at-sea policy all
the way to the Supreme Court, which unfortunately decided that the President had
quasi-absolute powers outside of U.S. borders.</p>
<p>It is important to note that for purposes of immigration enforcement, the U.S. border
steadily receded from 12 miles to 3 miles (under Reagan), from 3 miles to sure footing on
land (under Clinton), whereas a slot machine or a detainee in GTMO is not in US territory
unless in the 12-mile limit. Note also that Customs and Border Patrol has a 100-mile wide
authority to patrol on each side of the border, i.e. for purposes of immigration
enforcement. All of New York City (its 8 million + residents) is within the border.</p>
<p>In short, NCHR's legalization and immigration efforts, activities, and programs may have
shifted focus and administrative and programmatic location over the years, but they always
were part of NCHR's DNA. [source: Jocelyn "Juny" McCalla]</p>

Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1895 and went on to work in education at schools
across North Carolina first as a teacher, principal, and superintendent, and then as the
Director of the Division of Negro Education in Raleigh during segregation and Jim Crow. He
was a founding member of the North Carolina Commission for Interracial Cooperation and
served as director of the Division of Cooperation in Education and Race Relations. </p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Parker Pillsbury (September 22, 1809 – July 7, 1898) was an American minister, lecturer,
newspaper editor, and advocate for abolition and women's rights. He was born in
Hamilton, Massachusetts, the son of Oliver Pillsbury, a blacksmith and farmer, and Anna
(Smith) Pillsbury. He was a descendant of William Pillsbury who came to Massachusetts
circa 1640. Parker’s parents moved to Henniker, New Hampshire in 1814. He was educated
in the district school and worked on farms in New Hampshire and as a wagoner in
Massachusetts. From 1835 to 1838, he studied at the Gilmanton Theological Seminary, and
then for a year at the more conservative Andover Theological Seminary. By the time
Pillsbury left Andover he was a devout Abolitionist. He briefly held a parish position
at the Congregational Church at Loudon, New Hampshire, however his Congregational
license to preach was revoked in 1840 because of his use of the pulpit to denounce
slavery. Though he held no regular pastorate, he continued to preach for free religious
societies in Toledo, Ohio, Battle Creek, Michigan, Rochester, New York and elsewhere. On
January 1, 1840, he married fellow abolitionist Sarah H. Sargent of Concord, New
Hampshire.</p>
<p>Pillsbury was an abolitionist of the Garrisonian type, and from 1840 until the
emancipation of the slaves was lecture agent for the New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and
American anti-slavery societies. An admirer of John Brown, he spoke at a demonstration
meeting in Rochester, New York following Brown’s execution. In 1840 and again in 1845-46
he edited the Herald of Freedom, at Concord, New Hampshire, and from January to May 1866
the National Anti-Slavery Standard, in New York City. After the Civil War he was active
in efforts to procure the right of suffrage for African Americans believing that the
right to vote was necessary for their protection. He was also interested in temperance,
political reform, international peace, and women’s rights. </p>
<p>Pillsbury was one of the earliest and most devoted advocates women's rights in the
nineteenth century. He severed his connection with the Standard when its managers showed
themselves more favorable toward extending the right to vote to African Americans than
to women. He was a long time vice-president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage
Association and helped draft the constitution of the American Equal Rights Association.
From 1868 to 1870, he was joint editor with Elizabeth Cady Stanton of the Revolution, a
radical weekly. In addition to contributions to these newspapers, he wrote the Acts of
the Anti-Slavery Apostles (1883), a history of the abolition movement in New
England.</p>

County, Virginia, then moved to Frederick County near Winchester in 1834. He never
married. He appears in Confederate Army rolls as a private, 2nd regiment, Virginia
Infantry, but he may have been a supporter of the Union. He is quoted in the Southern
Claims Commission records as being harshly treated by Confederates in 1864, but his
claim was not approved. According to a history of the county, John Purcell, Mordecai's
brother, was in California for the gold rush but it is not known if the materials refer

<p>R.C. Maxwell Company of Trenton, N.J., was one of the earliest enduring outdoor advertising
companies. Founded in 1894 by Robert Chester Maxwell (1873-1954), the business followed
burgeoning industry trends, beginning with a variety of outdoor advertising signage along
New Jersey and New York roadways as well as at tourist destinations like Atlantic City,
N.J., and New York's Times Square. With the commercial development of the incandescent bulb
after World War I, the company began creating electric advertising signs in 1919. Maxwell
saw great potential in these <emph render="doublequote">spectacular</emph> signs and
established the Electric Sign Manufacturing Plant in Atlantic City, N.J. in the 1920s. This
subsidiary created such giant ads as a 50-foot Colgate thermometer that was placed atop a
building on the Atlantic City Boardwalk in 1922. The billboards and spectaculars themselves
served as a form of advertising for the company, which displayed slogans such as <emph render="doublequote">Maxwell Did It</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">Maxwell
Hits</emph> alongside its client's signs. R.C. Maxwell owned numerous billboards in
Atlantic City, N.J., and a large number of pictures in this collection are located on the
Atlantic City boardwalk.</p>

<p>Ron (Ronald E.) Reis began taking photographs as a child with an Argus A2. He shot sports
photography in junior high school with an Argus C-3 and an Ansco Reflex. He continued
photographing sports, acquiring cameras, and developing his darkroom skills throughout high
school. When he moved to Philadelphia in 1953 to attend the University of Pennsylvania, Reis
turned his 35mm Leica from the sports fields to the streets.</p>
<p>Influenced by the work of Helen Levitt, Louis Stettner, and Cartier-Bresson, Reis became a
passionate street photographer, honing his ability to compose and capture photographs on the
fly. This decisive quality is reflected in his contacts sheets filled with single exposures.
Reis primarily photographed in New York, Connecticut and Europe during the 1960s. The
collection captures the look and feel of the 1960s, especially in the cities of New York
City and London. </p>
<p>Reis's photographic work has been exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum, Dartmouth College,
the A.T. Gallery in New Haven Connecticut, the New Britain Museum of American Art, the E.
Leitz Gallery in New York, and the Image Gallery in New York. In addition, several of his
prints were exhibited, as the only amateur photographer, in a Christmas show at the Witkin
Gallery in New York City as well as in a one-man show at Parents Magazine Gallery in New
York City. His work has been published in <title type="simple" render="italic">Camera

<p>Roberts was active while a student at Duke University and in many Triangle
(Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill) theater groups: East Durham Community Players, Durham Theater
Guild, Duke University Singing and Dancing Choruses, Duke Players, Hoof 'n' Horn, Carolina
Playmakers (the precursor to the PlayMakers Repertory Company), Carriage House Theater,
Allied Arts Follies, Durham Star Professional Playhouse, and the New Triangle Players (the
original name for the Triangle Repertory Theater).</p>
<p>Roberts first organized the Durham Star Playhouse in the late 1950s. He founded the
Triangle Summer Theater in 1963 which became a professional theater the next year and then
blossomed in to the Triangle Repertory Theater.</p>
<p>Many of the clippings and one of the scrapbooks concern the Triangle Repertory Theater,
where many of Roberts’ plays were produced. Roberts co-directed this theater along with
Wesley Van Tassel and attempted to establish it as a permanent professional theater in
Durham, N.C. in 1964 and 1965. </p>
<p>Perhaps Roberts’ most famous play is The Dukes, produced in 1964. The play concerns the
collaboration between James Buchanan Duke and Dr. William Preston Few which resulted in the
creation of Duke University. The script begins with several pages of historical background
regarding the time period (early to mid 1920s).</p>

<p>Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. was a cigar manufacturing company located in Suffield,
Connecticut, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Suffield was the
site of the country's first cigar factory, which opened in 1810 after its owners hired a
Cuban to teach its workers how to roll tobacco. The town became home to numerous
factories that used local crops and sold a variety of cigars throughout the eastern
United States. Not much is known about Sauer, Farrell, &amp; Co. in particular, but its
involvement in cigar manufacturing and selling appear to reflect the general activities
of Suffield cigar factories during this time.</p>
<p>Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer was a lithography company that created box labels for cigar
manufacturers to paste on the inside lid of a box of cigars. Sample books like the one
in this collection were distributed to local cigar manufacturers, who could then order
the labels by their designated number. Frederick Heppenheimer, from New York City, was
one of the earliest and most prolific commerical lithographers. He later partnered with
Louis Maurer, another well-regarded artist, to create Heppenheimer &amp; Maurer in 1872.
Maurer was one of the few cigar label lithographers who regularly signed his work. The
company was one of dozens of lithography companies from this period whose art reflected
everyday life in the United States.</p>

<p>Larry Schwarm studied photography and received his MFA and BFA in photography and
sculpture from the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Recognizing the fascination that
all human beings have with fire, he began photographing the annual midwestern prairie
fires in the early 1990s and has continued with this work until 2015. Other recent
bodies of work document the F-5 tornado that hit his hometown, Greensburg, Kansas, in
2007; the lives of Kansas farmers, as part of the "Biofuels and Climate Change: Farmers'
Land Use Decisions project," funded in part by the National Science Foundation; and life
and society in Cuba, 2010. In 2013â€“2014, Schwarm was one of eighty artists featured in
the exhibit "A Democracy of Images: Photographs from the Smithsonian American Art
Museum." His works are held by many museums and galleries in the United States,
including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Library of Congress. He is currently Distinguished

<p>Reverend Robert Shields, his wife Louise Shields, and members of their family were
Methodist missionaries in Angola between the 1890s and the 1960s. Members of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, Robert and Louise Shields went to Africa from Ireland and
the United States, respectively, in the 1880s and 1890s as part of Bishop William
Taylor's self-supporting missions. They worked as missionaries in Angola until 1936, and
their children and grandchildren remained in Angola and Zimbabwe. Robert Shields, born
in Ireland in 1866, moved to Angola as a missionary in 1887. There he married Lizzie
Whiteside of Newry, Ireland in 1891. Lizzie died in 1895, and their son Wesley died at a
young age. Shields remarried in 1895, to Louise Raven, who had moved from Chicago to
join the mission in Angola. They worked in Quessua, Angola until 1902, when they moved
to Luanda, Angola. Robert and Louise had five living children: Robert Dodson (born
1896), Irene Withey (born 1899), Margaret Louise (born 1902), Helen Augusta (born 1903),
and Wilhelmina Taylor (born 1905). They also had a daughter, Suzanna, who died at three
months from malaria.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Alix Kates Shulman (given name Alix Audrey Kates) was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1932 to
Dorothy Davis Kates and Samuel Kates. Raised in suburban Cleveland Heights, she graduated
from Case Western Reserve University in 1953 with a degree in English and History. She moved
to New York City after college and began graduate studies at Columbia University where she
met and married fellow graduate student Marcus Klein in 1954. After marriage she began a
series of research, editorial and writing jobs. She and Klein were divorced in 1958, and she
then married Martin Shulman in 1959. She gave birth to her son Ted in 1961 and to her
daughter Polly in 1963. </p>
<p>Shulman became involved in the early women's liberation movement groups in New York City in
the late 1960s. She participated in the famed Miss America Pageant Protest in Atlantic City
in 1968, was an early member of the groups <emph render="doublequote">Redstockings</emph>
and <emph render="doublequote">WITCH</emph> in 1969, and joined the <emph render="doublequote">New York Radical Women</emph> in 1970. At approximately the same time
she became active in the women's liberation movement, Shulman began her literary career,
publishing articles in both feminist and mainstream periodicals, and publishing a number of
children's books and non-fiction books about Emma Goldman. She and Martin Shulman drafted a
<title type="simple" render="doublequote">Marriage Agreement</title> which was published
in the feminist journal <title type="simple" render="italic">Up From Under</title> in 1970.
The <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Agreement</title> was re-printed with
accompanying articles in <title type="simple" render="italic">Redbook</title> (in 1971) and
then in <title type="simple" render="italic">Life</title> (1972). Due to these re-printings,
the <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Agreement</title> received much press and
raised much controversy. It was attacked by, among others, Norman Mailer and Russell Baker.
Also in 1972, Shulman published her first major (and semi-autobiographical) novel, <title type="simple" render="italic">Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen.</title><title type="simple" render="italic">Memoirs</title> became a national best seller, raised much debate about
the growing feminist movement and the situation of women in U.S. society, and launched
Shulman's writing career on a national level. </p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Shulman continued to work as a feminist activist,
to write essays and short stories for a wide variety of journals and newspapers, to teach
and present speeches and conference papers, and to publish novels and memoirs. She divorced
Martin Shulman in 1985 and married former Cleveland Heights High School classmate Scott York
in 1989. Her two most recently published books are <title type="simple" render="italic">Drinking the Rain</title> (1995), an account of her solitary, non-technological life on a
Maine island, and <title type="simple" render="italic">A Good Enough Daughter</title>
(1999), a memoir focusing on her relationships with her late parents. She received an
honorary doctorate of Humane Letters from Case Western Reserve University in 2001.</p>

on tenor saxophone as a sideman, including stints in bands led by Jimmy Heath, Dizzy
Gillespie, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk. By the early 1960s, Coltrane was leading
his own ensembles, including an influential quartet with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison,
and Elvin Jones. As a saxophonist, he brought renewed attention to the soprano saxophone
in the 1960s, and as a composer and an improviser, Coltrane contributed to a number of
harmonic and melodic innovations in jazz.</p>

<p>Florence Moss Smith was born in 1911. While she was an undergraduate student at Duke
University from 1928 to 1932, her parents, Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Moss, lived in Mobile,
Ala. As an undergraduate at Duke, she was active in the Y.W.C.A., took part in the
Woman's Athletic Association, and belonged to the White Duchy.</p>
<p>Receiving her undergraduate degree in 1932, she returned to Duke periodically to pursue
graduate studies. She worked at the Duke University Press from 1937 to 1938 and on Oct.
1, 1938, was appointed general personnel worker and counselor-at-large in the Woman's
College at Duke University. The Woman's College Student Handbook indicates that by 1939
she held the position of Director of Religious Activities. She held this position until
1941 when she married Frank Ferrell Smith, also a Duke alumnus, who was with the U.S.
Soil Conservation Service at that time. From the time her husband joined the U.S. Navy
in 1942 until his discharge in 1945, Smith stayed with her parents who still resided in
Mobile, Ala. During the war she was the primary person responsible for rearing their two
sons, Frank Jr., born in 1942, and Howard, born in 1944.</p>
<p>After World War II, the Smith family settled in Alabama. By 1959, they were living in
Loxley, Ala., and a third son James (Jim) had been born.</p>
<p>Three generations of Florence Moss Smith's family are represented in the collection,
which ends in 1973. At that time, her son Jim had just competed law school at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, and Howard, having completed a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1971,
was just getting out of the U.S. Army. By 1973, both of them had married. Frank Smith,
Jr. died in March of 1960. When Ms. Smith gave the collection to the Rubenstein Library,
she was living in Elberta, Ala.</p>

<p>Peter Storey (b. 1938) was schooled in Cape Town, South Africa, spent some time in the South African Navy, and then trained for the Methodist ministry at Rhodes University. Storey pastored churches in Cape Town, and later served as a chaplain to Robben Island prison, where he ministered to Nelson Mandela. After two years in Australia, Storey returned to District Six, a <emph render="doublequote">coloured</emph> community in Cape Town whose people faced forced removal under apartheid law. Storey was prominent in the fight against these removals, at the same time launching a number of ministries, including The Carpenter's House, Cape Town's first non-racial community center, and founded <title type="simple" render="italic">Dimension</title>, the national newspaper of the Methodist Church, which took an uncompromising anti-apartheid stance under his nine-year editorship. </p><p>He was appointed to Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church in 1976, the year of the Soweto uprising, and immediately questioned the all-white nature of the congregation. The following years saw the loss of some 200 white members, but also the creation of the first fully integrated Methodist church in the land. The Central Methodist Mission--as it became known--was a center of protest action against apartheid, often being surrounded and sometimes invaded by government Security Forces. </p><p>During this period Storey became Vice President of the South African Council of Churches (SACC) and was elected President of this body in 1981. In this position, he and Bishop Desmond Tutu, who was then General Secretary, steered the SACC through its most controversial and embattled era of anti-apartheid action. This included facing the notorious Eloff Commission of Inquiry into the SACC. His testimony to the Commission has been published under the title <title type="simple" render="italic">Here We Stand</title>. </p><p>In 1984 Storey was elected President of the Methodist Church and co-lead an ecumenical delegation to the United Nations and Europe to urge international pressure against the South African Government's forced removal policy. He then became Bishop of the Central District, including Johannesburg and Soweto. He also headed up the Journey to the New Land transformation process, which has redesigned the Methodist Church for its mission in the new South Africa. </p><p>Committed to peacemaking, he co-chaired the Wits-Vaal Peace Secretariat, responsible for keeping the peace in the Johannesburg region in the run-up to the first democratic elections and became Patron of the Methodist Order of Peacemakers, which focused on non-violence. He was first chairperson of the Gunfree South Africa movement, and he was a member of President Mandela's Selection Committee for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </p><p>Storey has received honorary Doctor of Divinity and Doctor of Law degrees. His international ministry has included frequent preaching and lecturing journeys to the United States, Europe, and Australia, and he has addressed many conferences related to the situation in South Africa, the truth and reconciliation process, and world peace. </p><p>[Biographical Note adapted from: <title type="simple" render="doublequote">February 11, 1999 - Rev.

<p>Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe (1811 June 14-1896 July 1) was an American
abolitionist and author. Her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin(1852) was a depiction of life
for African Americans under slavery; it reached millions as a novel and play, and
became influential in the United States and United Kingdom. It energized
anti-slavery forces in the American North, while provoking widespread anger in the
South. She wrote more than 20 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and
collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and
her public stands on social issues of the day.</p>

<p>すごろく, or sugoroku, are Japanese games similar to "snakes and ladders". These types of games
typically involve numbered squares, which players navigate from bottom to top using dice,
and where there may be "ladders" allowing a climb ahead or "snakes" causing a fall behind.
Sugoroku may vary in structure and game play, and often include instructions on how to play.
In the Meiji, Taisho, and early Showa periods (1890s-1940s and later), sugoroku games were
sometimes included as inserts in newspapers and children's magazines.</p>

<p>Walter Lee Sutton was born in 1863 in Wilkes County, Georgia. In 1886, he married
Harriet (Hattie) Louise Wynn, also from Wilkes County, and they had ten children, two of
whom died at an early age.</p>
<p>Sutton attended school in Danburg, Ga., and in the early 1880s went to business college
in Atlanta. Before he ran his own business he worked in the general merchandising
business Sutton and Anderson, which was run by his father and uncle, and delivered the
<title type="simple" render="italic"> Atlanta Constitution</title> to families in the
area. From about 1888 to 1907, he was a partner with his brother-in-law, Thomas V.
Heard, in the general merchandising business, Heard and Sutton, in Danburg. When this
firm was dissolved about 1907, Sutton maintained the firm which continued as a general
merchandising business under the name W. L. Sutton Company. Sutton was also a planter,
cotton merchant, director of the National Banks of Wilkes, and a director of Pope
Manufacturing Company of Washington, Ga.</p>
<p>In addition, Sutton was a member of the Danburg Baptist Church, where he served on the
Board of Deacons and as Superintendent of the Sunday school. He donated land for the
consolidated school built in Danburg in the early 1920s, served as a trustee of the
school, and chairman of the Board of Education of Wilkes County. He was active in the
Democratic Party, member of the Woodmen of the World, and the Wilkes County Farmers
Club. Sutton died in 1947.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Augustin Louis Taveau (1828-1886), was a planter and author born and raised in South
Carolina. He was the son of Louis Augustin Thomas Taveau (1790-ca. 1857), planter; and
his wife, Martha Caroline (Swinton) Ball Taveau (d. 1847). He attended school at Mt.
Zion Academy, Winnsboro, South Carolina starting in 1838. From 1848 until 1854 Taveau
lived usually in or near Charleston studying law while also developing an interest in
poetry. During this time he took a two year trip to Europe largely financed through his
father's estate. In 1855 Taveau had a book of his poems, "The Magic Word and Other
Poems" (Boston, 1855), published under the pseudonym of Alton. </p>
<p>Late in 1861 Taveau settled on a farm near Abbeville, South Carolina, but soon
afterwards joined the Confederate Army. His career in the army continued until 1865.
Immediately after the war, papers containing letters and copies of letters were
published in the New York Tribune by Taveau under the title of A Voice from South
Carolina. In the letters he stated that former Southern leaders could not be trusted and
condemning them for having allowed conscription. After searching for a place to live
after leaving the army, Taveau and his family finally settled in 1866 on a farm near
Chaptico in St. Mary's County, Maryland. From 1866 until his death he continued to write
poems and other literary works, worked to get patents for several inventions and oversaw
work on his farm. </p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Walter J. Taylor was born on September 4, 1934, and was educated as a mechanic in the
San Francisco area. He was convicted several times for burglary, robbery, and other
crimes, and was sent to San Quentin prison in 1968 following a string of burglaries in
Berkeley, California. While in prison he attended classes, read and wrote about African
Americans' struggle for justice and civil rights, and served on the San Quentin Inmate
Advisory Council. He was later transferred to Folsom Prison. Many of his letters from
jail mention his campaigns for prisoner rights, including a right to privacy in prisoner
correspondence and his protesting of the censorship of Black newspapers for
prisoners.</p>
<p>While in prison, Taylor maintained an active correspondence with his family and friends.
This was supplemented through prolific correspondence to pen pals that he met through
Sisters of Motivation, an organization that he founded to enable communication between
women and black male prisoners. Although the Sisters of Motivation literature claimed
that it was not a dating service, Taylor's correspondence reveals that he had
relationships with several women that he appears to have met through the
organization.</p>
<p>Although he was up for parole several times previously, Taylor was eventually granted
parole in 1973. He remained in the Oakland area as a counselor for Thresholds, a
community advocacy group targeted at juvenile delinquents. He also served as a
collections agent for KDIA Radio, and opened his own record store, Oldies But Goodies.
Taylor remained an activist for prisoner rights, running at one point for the Oakland
Community Action Agency's administrative board. He also founded the Community Concern
for Prisoners organization to help African American men in prison. Throughout his life,
Taylor appears to have been actively writing articles, essays, poems, and songs, and
this activity continued as well. </p>
<p>In October 1978, Taylor was arrested and held for four days as a suspect in the Stinky
Rapist case. The Stinky Rapist was a serial rapist in Berkeley and Oakland, California,
who police believe raped at least 62 women, beginning in 1973 and lasting for five
years. The rapist was deemed <emph render="doublequote">stinky</emph> because many of
the women reported him having a foul smell. None of the victims were able to see their
attacker, making it impossible to identify him. Taylor was suspected due to his being in
the vicinity in several of the cases, as well as his reported sexual fetishes, his
peculiar behavior, and his known contact with some of the victims, two of whom were
members of the Sisters of Motivation. The evidence being circumstantial, however, led
police to release him without charging him. Taylor subsequently reported severe
repercussions for his business and his job. The rapes stopped shortly afterward, and the
statute of limitations ran out in 1981.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Taylor's life following the Stinky Rapist suspicions. He is
believed to have died in 2007.</p>

<p>Dorothea Lynde Dix (1802-1887) was an American author, teacher, and reformer who advocated
for improving treatment and facilities for mental health care. She also served as a
superintendent for nurses during the American Civil War. </p>
<p>Dix was originally from Hampden, Maine and attended school in Boston, Mass. She became
interested in mental healthcare while living abroad in Europe, and returned to the United
States to tour American facilities. She publicly advocated for the cause, lobbying
healthcare officers and politicians, and raising funds through state allocations and private
contributions to improve hospitals and medical treatment of mental health patients
throughout the country. Her work led to the establishment of state asylums in North
Carolina, New Jersey, and Illinois.</p>
<p>During the American Civil War, Dix was designated as Superintendent of Army Nurses for the
Union Army. She sought formal training and opportunities for women in nursing, and over the
course of the war appointed over 3000 nurses. She later fundraised for a national monument
for deceased soldiers, now standing at Fort Monroe, Virginia.</p>
<p>Dix had recurring health problems throughout her life, and spent later years as a resident
of the New Jersey State Hospital in Trenton.</p>

<p>From http://www.duke.edu/aiesec/</p>
<p> The Duke University chapter of AIESEC was founded around 1966. AIESEC is an international,
non-political, non-profit, student-run, independent, educational foundation. It is comprised
of students and recent graduates of institutions of higher education who are interested in
professional careers in economics and management. AIESEC provides companies with highly
qualified, cost-effective temporary workers from many countries. These students and recent
graduates provide insight into foreign markets and bring an international perspective to
management. Internationally, AIESEC arranges the details to place more than 6,000 business
graduates each year. In the United States, AIESEC provides traineeships with companies such
as IBM, AT&amp;T, Arthur Andersen, and General Electric. </p>
<p> The Duke University chapter was responsible for locating companies in North Carolina
interested in sponsoring an international student for a short traineeship exchange, and for
hosting foreign students. The Duke University chapter also worked with the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill chapter to provide orientation, entertainment, and guidance
for students who came to the Raleigh-Durham, N.C. area on an AIESEC traineeship exchange.
The Duke University chapter organized the exchange of many students during the late 1960s;
the majority of students traveled to work in western European offices. </p>
<p> As of 2003, AIESEC is active at Duke University. </p>

<p>Alpha Kappa Psi was the first professional business fraternity in the United States. The
fraternity was founded October 5, 1904 at New York University and is headquartered in
Indianapolis, Indiana. Alpha Kappa Psi's objectives are to further the individual welfare of
its members, foster scientific research in the fields of commerce, accounts, and finance, to
educate the public, and to promote courses leading to degrees in business administration. </p>
<p> The Beta Eta chapter at Duke University was chartered on December 7, 1929 in the School of
Business Administration. There were 20 original members. Carroll Cunnin was the first
president. Semi-monthly meetings were held on campus in the Union Ballroom. They included
discussions of current topics in business and featured local businesspeople as speakers.
Members of the fraternity also visited industrial organizations, assisted professors with
business-related presentations, and corresponded with large organizations on business
questions. The fraternity dissolved sometime after 1963. </p>

<p>The Duke Amandla Chorus is Duke University's first African chorus, and performs traditional
music from various countries in Africa in the respective languages. The chorus shares
stories about the culture and people and incorporates dancing and African instruments.
"Amandla" is a Zulu and Xhosa word that means "power," and the Chorus uses music as an
avenue to teach the Duke and Durham community about the multiplicity of African culture,
history, and values.</p>

<p>The following brief history appears on the Lambda Nu website:
http://www.duke.edu/apo/</p>
<p>Lambda Nu Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was founded at Duke University in 1955 by Thomas R.
Neese. Encouraged by area Boy Scout representative Bill Roth, Neese recruited Robert M.
Graper and Joseph Griffin, fellow brothers of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity. Together,
they organized the first pledge class with assistance from Rho Chapter of UNC-Chapel
Hill. Sixteen men comprised this initial group, which first met in February of 1955.
Potential service projects were discussed at this meeting, and the future Brothers
choose a project blazing a nature trail at the Durham Children's Museum (now the Museum
of Life and Science). This first project, which preceded the chartering of Lambda Nu,
has been a regular project of the Chapter ever since.</p>
<p> The Chapter grew in prestige during the 1960s, despite a membership which hovered
around twenty men during most of this period, and a need to establish itself among
larger service organizations at Duke. APO appeared successful, expanding its service
program to include a diverse range of projects.</p>
<p> In 1974, Lambda Nu began accepting women, a full two years before the National
fraternity went co-ed. The Chapter was able to do this by submitting membership lists to
the National office that included only first initials and last names. Soon afterwards,
however, the Chapter began to drift apart, with its last active member deactivating
around 1978.</p>
<p> In the Spring of 1979, Duke sophomore Bob McMahan learned about APO from friends who
were Brothers at the Iota Lambda Chapter at North Carolina State. McMahan spent the fall
1979 semester researching the history of Lambda Nu and recruiting interested people. By
April of 1980, Lambda Nu was reborn, initiating nineteen pledges.</p>
<p> As Duke grew during the 1980s, so did Lambda Nu. Alpha Phi Omega celebrated the opening
of the Bryan Center in 1982 helping the Duke University Union raise money to buy the
baby grand piano that now sits in the Center's Schaefer Mall. By the end of the 1980s,
the Chapter was annually performing thousands of hours of service for the Durham
community, working for groups like the Eno River State Park, Lenox Baker Children's
Hospital, Genesis Home, Duke Rescue Mission, and many local hospitals, schools and
shelters. In addition, the chapter's fundraising efforts grew to a donation approaching
ten thousand dollars each year to a local charity. </p>

<p>The Office of Ordnance Research (OOR), U.S. Army, a Class II military institution,
established offices on the Duke University campus in June 1951. Marcus E. Hobbs, Chairman of
the Department of Chemistry, served as acting chief scientist until Tomas J. Killian took
over in a permanent capacity. Hobbs was instrumental in developing the "skeleton of the
organization" which continued throughout the life of the organization with only minor
adjustments. The organization was divided into four main divisions chemistry, mathematics,

<p> OOR first occupied the Hanes Mansion, but after 6 years, the burgeoning Office had
outgrown the available space. In December 1958, OOR moved into a new building that was built
for them on the Duke campus north of the School of Engineering. The OOR entered a lease
arrangement with the University for the space helping to cover the cost of construction. </p>
<p> On January 16, 1961 the OOR ceased to exist and was instead re-designated as the Army
Research Office-Durham (AROD) under the command of the Chief, Research and Development. </p>
<p> The 1960s and 1970s saw a weakening in the working relationship between the military and
the scientific communities. In the spring of 1975 ARO left the Duke campus and moved to the

<p>In an effort to bring all the revenue producing branches of the Business and Finance
Division under one office in the early 1960s a Business Auxiliaries department was
organized. It included Administrative Data Processing, Dining Halls, Housing Management and
University Stores, and later, the Computation Center. From 1976 to 1980 a Campus Services
department oversaw a number of activities that had been previously administered by the
Physical Plant Department. These included custodial services, grounds maintenance, studio
productions, office equipment, transportation, and mail. In 1980 the Auxiliary Services
Division was created to replace Business Auxiliaries and Campus Services. In 2009, it was
responsible for the operations of food services, special events and conference services,
transportation and parking, housekeeping, housing management, office services, and the

<p>John Saeger Bradway (1890-1985) taught law at Duke University School of Law from 1931 to
1959, where Nixon was one of his students. Bradway taught in California until his retirement
in 1970. Bradway was married to Mary Henderson in 1921. He died on January 2, 1985 in
Eureka, California.</p>
<p>Richard Milhous Nixon (1913-1994) attended the Duke University School of Law from 1934 to
1937, graduating number three in a class of twenty-six. During his three years at Duke,
Nixon was active in the Duke Bar Association and was elected President in his senior year.
Following school, Nixon began a political career. He was a Senator for California
(1950-1953), the nation's 36th vice president (1953 to 1961), and was elected the 37th
president of the United States, serving from 1969 until his resignation in 1974.</p>
<p>Nixon was the first U.S. president, since Andrew Johnson in 1868, to be the subject of
formal impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. The impeachment process
began on October 30, 1973, following a series of staff firings and resignations known as the
Saturday Night Massacre prompted by the Nixon administration's attempt to cover-up its
involvement with the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the
Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>On May 9, 1974, formal hearings in the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon began,
culminating July 27â€“30, 1974, when the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee approved three
articles of impeachment charging the president with obstruction of justice; injury to the
constitutional rights of citizens; and the abuse of power. Once Nixon was told his that both
his impeachment and his conviction were inevitable he resigned the presidency on August 9,
1974, before the House could vote on the articles of impeachment.</p>

<p>When James B. Duke selected the site for Duke University's West Campus, in 1925, he chose
to locate the Chapel on the site's highest ridge. The Chapel was the first building planned
for the new campus, but the last one to be completed. Construction started in 1930, was
completed in 1935, and cost nearly $2.3 million. The Chapel began to be used before its
stained-glass windows and other details were finished; commencement was held in the Chapel
in 1932. </p>
<p>Although the Chapel was inspired by other buildings, including English cathedrals and the
chapels of other American universities, it is not a copy of any other specific building. The
architect was Julian Abele, chief designer with the Horace Trumbauer firm, of Philadelphia.
America's first black architect of renown, Abele was educated at the University of
Pennsylvania and in France. In addition to Duke's original West Campus, he designed the
Georgian buildings on Duke's East Campus. Abele's other designs include the Philadelphia
Museum of Art, Harvard's Widener Library, and mansions for James B. Duke.</p>

He earned his A.B. in 1895 from Columbia University. After graduation, he studied stage
dancing at Daly's Theater and with several private instructors. He spent one year in
Philadelphia selling office equipment before returning to Columbia University and earning
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 1898 and 1903, respectively. He subsequently taught English at
the University of Indiana, the University of Louisville, and the University of Bordeaux in
France. In 1910, he made a research trip to London, where an old acquaintance suggested that
Chase write a volume on Poe for the Harrap's Poetry and Life series; this inaugurated
Chase's exhaustive research into Poe's life. In 1916, Chase returned to the U.S. and taught
Literature at the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Rochester. He relocated to
India in 1920, where he was appointed professor of English Literature at Aligarh Muslim
University. Within a few years, he moved to China, where he taught at four different
universities. Eventually, he returned to the U.S., teaching at the University of California,
the California School of Technology, Riverside College and Union College before joining the

predecessor institution, "to grant such degrees and marks of honor as are given by colleges

recipients, and made up the first graduating class. The 2009 commencement was the one
hundred and fifty seventh. The University began printing commencement numbers on the
programs in 1932, when that year's was marked as the eightieth commencement. The count
therefore was started with the 1853 ceremony. Union Institute and Normal College did

<p>The Duke-UNC Center for Research on Women (CROW) was founded in 1982 as a collaborative
endeavor between Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to
promote Women's Studies scholarship, research, and curriculum development in the South.
With support from the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, smaller grants
from local foundations, and institutional backing from both Duke and UNC-CH, the Center
aimed to create a network among scholars and others in the region who were interested in
the new scholarship on women.</p>
<p> The Center's regular activities included a post-doctoral humanist-in-residence
fellowship program; the publication of a working papers series: <title type="simple" render="italic">Southern Women: The Intersection of Race Class and Gender</title>, a
joint effort with the Memphis State University Center for Research on Women; the
publication of a biannual newsletter, <title type="simple" render="italic">Branches</title>, which informed scholars and other interested individuals in the
region about conferences, job opportunities, grants and the new scholarship on women;
and a wide range of conferences, seminars and community events. </p>
<p>The Center also sponsored statewide and regional conferences on topics such as Pay
Equity in North Carolina, Women and Work in the South, and Dialogues Between Black and
White Women. Other activities included high school and college curriculum transformation
projects, including the Ford funded project, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Incorporating Women of Color Into the Undergraduate Curriculum</title>; women's
studies summer institutes; the 1988 annual Southeastern Women's Studies Association
(SEWSA) meeting; and the 1991 Southern Association of Women Historians Conference. From
1985-1990 the Research Center was home to <title type="simple" render="italic">Signs: A
Journal of Women in Culture and Society</title>, one of the leading feminist
scholarly journals in the country. The central purpose of the Center was to underline
the dynamics of gender, race, and class as central themes upon which to base
understanding of women's and men's experiences in the South. </p>
<p> The Center's Advisory Board included both Duke and UNC-CH faculty: Dorothy Browne
(School of Public Health, UNC); William H. Chafe (History, Duke); Peter Filene (History,
UNC); Barbara Harris (Women's Studies/History, UNC); Iris Hill ( Center for Documentary

<item>Rockefeller Humanist-In-Residence Fellowship Program: From 1987-1992, the
Center received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation to bring scholars to the
Center for a year to work on a book-length manuscript on race, class, and gender.
These funds provided support for 11 scholars (mostly junior scholars), all of whom
were able to turn dissertations into books or make substantial progress on
completing a second book.</item>
<item>What Difference Does Difference Make: The Politics of Race, Class, and Gender:
Ford and Rockefeller Foundation grants provided funds for a national conference to
explore the state of the current scholarship on diversity. The conference, held
May 1992, brought together scholars in women's, racial, ethnic and critical legal
studies to explore some of the current debates surrounding work on diversity,
including the controversies over "political correctness" and multiculturalism,
affirmative action and the Columbus quincentennial.</item>
<item>Pay Equity in North Carolina: The Center received funding from the Z. Smith
Reynolds Foundation to promote pay equity (based on gender and race equity) in
North Carolina through a statewide conference and a pay equity study/project which
would serve as a model for similar efforts throughout the state. The Center
completed the second phase of the project in the fall of 1992, and Orange County

<p>The Duke Chapel is the central focus of Duke University's West Campus, a Gothic-style
church rising 210 feet high and completed in 1935. It is constructed with what is commonly
called Duke stone, a bluestone from a quarry in Hillsborough, N.C., which is used across
West Campus. The Chapel contains 77 stained glass windows and hundreds of carvings and
sculptures depicting scenes from the Bible.</p>
<p>In 1924 James B. Duke created the Duke Endowment, funding the development of Trinity
College, which renamed itself Duke University. James B. Duke was closely involved with the
planning of the new campus for the university, and declared "I want the central building to
be a church, a great towering church which will dominate all of the surrounding buildings."
The firm of Horace Trumbauer of Philadelphia, P.A., was hired to design the new campus, and
the chief designer of the Trumbauer firm was Julian Abele, the first African American
graduate of the architecture program at the University of Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Construction on the Chapel began in 1930, with the cornerstone laid on October 22; the
majority of the initial construction on West Campus had been completed already. Construction
took more than two years, although the Chapel was not completely finished and formally
dedicated until 1935; the building was complete enough to be used for Commencement in 1932.
Designed in an English Gothic style, the building combines modern materials such as steel
trusses with traditional architectural methods such as flying buttresses.</p>
<p>The stained glass windows were created between 1931 and 1933, and were designed and made by
G. Owen Bonawit. A panel in Window 2, the Noah window, also credits designer S. Charles
Jaekle and craftsman Hugh Doherty. Bonawit apparently selected the subjects depicted in the
windows. </p>
<p>Stone carving was done by the John Donnelly Company; woodwork by Irving and Casson-A.H.
Davenport, Inc.; ironwork by William H. Jackson Company; carving of the sarcophagi in the
Memorial Chapel tombs by Charles Keck; and the carillon was cast by the Taylor Bell Foundry
of England. It is unknown exactly who chose the subjects of the exterior and interior
carvings. John Donnelly was located in New York, and is likely the one who chose the
subjects of the exterior carvings, consulting with a professor from Vanderbilt University.
The statues include what appear to be several mistakes: the statue meant to depict Thomas
Coke, an 18th century Methodist bishop, may actually depict Thomas Coke, a 17th century
English judge; the statue of Robert E. Lee originally had a belt buckle that read U.S.
despite Lee being famous as a Confederate general; and other unusual choices. </p>
<p>The original main organ was created by the Aeolian Company, and in 1976 the Chapel received
a new organ made by Dirk Flentrop, which was officially named the Benjamin N. Duke Memorial
Organ but is commonly referred to as "the Flentrop." A smaller organ is located in the
Memorial Chapel.</p>
<p>The Chapel also includes a Memorial Chapel and crypt. Entombed in the Memorial Chapel are
James Buchanan Duke, Washington Duke, and Benjamin N. Duke, all of whom were removed from
Maplewood Cemetery in 1935. Within the crypt can be found Duke President William P. Few,
Duke President and N.C. politician Terry Sanford, and several other figures from Duke's
history.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1994, some of the stained glass windows underwent restoration by artisan
Dieter Goldkuhle. From 2015 to 2016, the ceiling and roof of the Chapel were completely
restored.</p>
<p>In August 2017, after the white supremacist rally and counter-protests in Charlottesville,
Va., of August 8, and subsequent protests in the Durham and Chapel Hill areas that included
the toppling of a Confederate statue in front of Durham City Hall, the statue of Robert E.
Lee was vandalized. Duke President Vincent Price ordered the removal of the statue of Lee
from the entrance to the Chapel to an unknown location. In 2018, President Price announced
that no new statue would be added, and the spot remains empty.</p>
<p>The book <emph render="italic">Duke Chapel Illuminated</emph> was published in 2001.
Photographs of the stained glass windows and other Chapel images were done by Les Todd and
Chris Heldreth of Duke Photography. The text was written by Minnie Glymph and the design by
Lacy Chylack, both of the Duke University Medical Center.</p>

<p>Louis Dupree was born in Greenville, North Carolina in 1925. He attended Greenville High
School until about 1943, enlisting in the armed forces before earning his diploma. He served
in World War II, first as a merchant seaman, then as an officer in the 11th Airborne
Division in the Philippines campaign and occupation of Japan. Dupree received the Mariner's
Medal, Merchant Marine Combat Bar, Combat Infantry Badge, Purple Heart, and Bronze Star.</p>
<p>During 1947 to 1955, Dupree earned his bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in
Anthropology from Harvard. He began research in Central and South Asia in 1949. In the
United States, Dupree taught and conducted research at Air University, Maxwell Air Force
Base, Alabama, from 1953 to 1957. In 1957, he accepted a teaching appointment in the
Anthropology Department at Pennsylvania State University. Dupree taught as a Visiting
Professor at Kabul University (Afghanistan), Princeton University, and the United States
Military Academy at West Point.</p>
<p>From 1959 to 1983, Dupree was a representative of the American Universities Field Staff
(AUFS) in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He spent two years researching and writing under the
AUFS program, returning to the United States every third year to lecture at the twelve
universities sponsoring AUFS. Dupree was also director of several archaeological surveys and
excavations in Afghanistan from 1959 to1983, sponsored by American institutions such as the
American Museum of Natural History, the National Science Foundation, the American
Philosophical Society, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. His excavation on
upper Paleolithic sites at Aq Kupruk in northern Afghanistan won international acclaim.</p>
<p>In 1966, Dupree married Nancy Hatch in Afghanistan, whom he had met while she was writing a
guidebook of the Bamiyan area of Afghanistan. The Duprees continued to intermittently live
and work in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While on AUFS business in Kabul, Afghanistan just prior to the 1978 Soviet Invasion, Dupree
was imprisoned by Afghans and their Soviet advisors. He was interrogated at length about
United States intelligence operations and his interactions with Afghans. He was ultimately
released through the intervention of Afghan friends. The account of his imprisonment appears
as a six-part series, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Red Flag over the Hindu
Kush</title> in American University Field Staff Reports (1980).</p>
<p>As other nations became interested in the plight of Afghanistan, the Duprees were called
upon to advise the parliaments or foreign ministries of Germany, France, Sweden, Norway,
England, Austria, Pakistan, and to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. Dupree
frequently corresponded with Pakistan's president, General Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq. In the
United States, Dupree acted as a consultant to the State Department, United States Agency
for International Development (U.S. AID), the Peace Corps, Esso Pakistan Fertilizer Company,
United Nations Development Programs, UNESCO, Helsinki Watch, Amnesty International, the
World Bank, and other organizations.</p>
<p>In 1985, after teaching for one year at West Point Military Academy and another year at
Princeton University, he joined the Program in Islamic and Arabian Development Studies at
Duke University as a Senior Research Associate. He held concurrent appointments at Duke
University as Visiting Professor of Anthropology, Political Science, and Public Policy
Studies. He also taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the
departments of Anthropology and Political Science.</p>
<p>The Islamic and Arabian Development Studies Program operated at Duke from 1977 to 1989
under the direction of Professor Ralph Braibanti. It funded the acquisition of library
materials that supported its mission, facilitating the accession to the Duke libraries of
two major Middle Eastern collections: the Joseph J. Malone Collection on Arabian Affairs and
the Louis and Nancy Hatch Dupree Collection on Islamic Inner Asia. The Dupree Collection
consists of about 5,000 items, 200 of which are located in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book
&amp; Manuscript Library. Reflecting the careers and interests of their donors, the
materials in the collection focus on the anthropology, art, archaeology, folklore,
linguistics, and history of Afghanistan. There are also significant holdings on Islam, the
Central Asian Republics, and South Asia. </p>
<p>A social activist, Dupree was Honorary Director and one of the founders of the Afghan
Relief Committee. The beneficiaries of the Afghan Relief Committee were primarily Doctors
Without Borders, Freedom Medical of Washington, D.C., Aide Medicale International, and
Sainte Sud of Marseilles. Dupree was involved with the Afghanistan Action Committee at Duke
University and corresponded with members of many other humanitarian assistance
organizations.</p>
<p>Dupree and Nancy Hatch Dupree spent years researching and living in Afghanistan and planned
to retire there. Together they researched and planned to write a book on Afghan refugees in
Pakistan. By 1987, their collaborative work earned them a joint award, the International
Rescue Committee's Bronze Medal for Service to Afghanistan Refugees. In 1988, the Duprees
returned to Pakistan as Joint Fulbright Senior Scholars. Louis Dupree authored many books
and over 200 articles. His articles appeared in various publications such as <title type="simple" render="italic">American Anthropologist</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Middle East Journal</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Economist</title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Times</title>, the
<title type="simple" render="italic">Nation</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Evergreen Review</title>, and the <title type="simple" render="italic">Khyber
Mail</title>.</p>
<p>Some of the books authored by Dupree include: <title type="simple" render="italic">Afghanistan</title> (1973), <title type="simple" render="italic">Physical Anthropology of
Afghanistan</title> (1970), <title type="simple" render="italic">Changing Patterns of
Social Structure in Afghanistan</title> (1970), <title type="simple" render="italic">Deh
Morasi Ghundai: a Chalcolithic Site in South-Central Afghanistan</title> (1963), and
<title type="simple" render="italic">The Desert Survival Field Test</title> (1956).</p>
<p>Louis Dupree died in 1989 at the age of 63. Nancy Hatch Dupree continued her work with
Afghan refugees.</p>

Spanish-American War. During 1909-1919, he served as dean and mathematics instructor at
various institutions including Davenport College, Centenary College, and Martha Washington
College. In 1919, he became president of Southern Seminary, a school for girls in Buena
Vista, VA. He was the brother of Stonewall and Plato Durham, and the father of Dr. Margaret

<p>ECOS (Environmentally Conscious Organization of Students) was formed at Duke University in
1969. ECOS grew to include members of the Durham, N.C. community in their efforts to educate
people on environmental concerns. Other environmental groups active around the
Raleigh-Durham, N.C. area in the early 1970s were: Chapel Hill ECOS, Organization for
Environmental Quality (Raleigh), and the Conservation Council of North Carolina. </p>
<p> ECOS members were advocates of University-wide recycling, conservative population growth,
and responsible consumption. At Duke University, members proposed an environmental studies
program and organized a teach-in. ECOS came to be known for their recycling efforts,
employing a small staff to collect newspapers, aluminum, and glass for resale to local
companies. </p>
<p> Some of ECOS' awareness-raising activities included a Bike-a-Thon between Raleigh and
Durham, protesting the development of the Eno River area, protesting construction of the New
Hope Dam, and lobbying for environmentally sound work spaces. The Eno River Park project was
particularly important to the Durham, N.C. region. In the early 1970s, ECOS and supporters
led a campaign to save the Eno River area from commercial development. Due to ECOS' protest
efforts, the city of Durham withdrew its efforts to construct a reservoir. The Eno River
State Park was established in 1972. </p>
<p> As of 2003, ECOS is known as the Environmental Alliance and is active at Duke University.

<p>The Friends of Duke Chapel was founded in 1974 to provide the means for interested
persons to organize into an ongoing, supportive, participatory group to support the
ministry and program of Duke Chapel. The Friends open membership to anyone interested in
the Chapel and its program. It grew out of a predecessor group called the Full
Membership Chapel Group, organized under and continuing the name of Duke University
Church (Interdenominational). Full Members supported the Chapel program but membership
was limited to persons affiliated with the University either as faculty or staff. As
part of its mission, the Friends of Duke Chapel provide funds to aid numerous aspects of
the Chapel program such as the chapel choir, organ, vestments, renovation needs, and
provision of televised services. Membership benefits included weekly mailing of the
Sunday bulletin, announcements and invitations to services, concerts, and music
programs, as well as a Friends of Duke Chapel newsletter. </p>
<p> The Friends have continuously helped fund and contribute to numerous initiatives and
renovations of the Chapel, including the construction of a handicapped ramp access to
the Chapel, installation of the Flentrop organ, and providing televised access to the
Sunday services for patients at Duke Medical Center. They also contributed to enriching
the preaching and theologian-in-residence programs. </p>
<p> An Advisory Board governs the group. Originally a nine-person board, it was enlarged to
a thirteen person board in 1981, always including the Dean of the Chapel. Past board
members include William Stokes, Helen Crotwell, Jack Blackburn, Arthur Kale, William
King, Ella Jean Shore, Carolyn Penny, and Mary Parkerson, who became the first Friends
Director in 1980. </p>

<p>John R. Gregg (1916-2009) was a Biological Science Professor Emeritus at Duke University.
After earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama and his PhD from
Princeton University, Gregg served as a professor in the Duke University Zoology department
from 1957 to his retirement in 1986. During his time at Duke, Gregg served as the acting
chair of the Zoology department chair from 1958-1959 and as director of graduate studies
from1968-1971. Gregg authored 33 publications during his academic career including two
books, The Language of Taxonomy (1954) and Form and Strategy (1963). His work on taxonomic
systems in The Language of Taxonomy led to the development of the "Gregg Paradox". </p>
<p>During the summer of 1967, he led the Undergraduate Institute for Theoretical Biology
sponsored by NASA. During his career, Gregg collaborated closely with British biologist
Joseph Henry Woodger, the developer of the influential Axiomatic Method.In addition to his

<p>Paul M. Gross was born in 1895. He received degrees from the City College of New York
(B.S., 1916) and Columbia University (M.S., 1917 and Ph.D. 1919) in physical chemistry. He
arrived at Trinity College in 1919, and began his tenure as Assistant Professor of
Chemistry, teaching physical, organic, and fluorine chemistry. He led the Chemistry
Department as Duke University underwent the transformation from regional college to research
university. Gross served Duke University as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry (1919-1920),
William H. Pegram Professor of Chemistry (1920-1965), Chair of the Chemistry Department
(1921-1948), Dean of the Graduate School (1947-1952), Dean of the University (1952-1958),
and Vice-President in the Educational Division (1949-1960). Gross was a proponent of
scientific research and its value for education and society and held many seminars for
science educators in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Gross directed Duke University's scientific research for both the U.S. Army and Navy during
wartime. Naval Research on organic fluorine gases, compounds, and batteries was carried out
by the Chemistry Department under contract with the Office of Naval Research. As part of the
Army Scientific Advisory Panel, Gross advised top U.S. Army researchers on scientific
matters. Gross was also involved in the Frangible Bullet Project, the largest military
research project at Duke University. The frangible bullet, developed in 1942, was a plastic
explosive that behaved like a bullet and enabled accurate training practices. The project
earned Gross the President's Medal of Merit. </p>
<p>While a successful scientist, Gross is perhaps best known at Duke University as an
administrator. Gross' administrative career at Duke University began in 1934 when he was
named Chair of the University Research Council, a position he held until 1949. The Research
Council helped to guide the University as it developed into a respected research
institution. He also chaired the University Committee on Long Range Planning from 1959-1960.
His opinions on administrative matters, along with his Vice President of Educational
Division status, led to conflicts with President A. Hollis Edens around 1960, in what came
to be known as the Gross-Edens Affair. The conflict mostly concerns the debate over whether
Duke University should become a regional or national university, and to what degree the
institution should be known for its devotion to research or teaching. Edens resigned from
his position as University President, and Gross was removed from his administrative position
as a result of the conflict. </p>
<p>In addition to his university positions, Paul Gross also served on numerous state,
regional, and national boards relating to scientific research. In the late 1940s, he was a
founder of the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies (later Oak Ridge Associated
Universities) and served as its President until 1949. President Harry S. Truman appointed
Gross to the original National Science Foundation board in 1950, a position he held for 12
years. Gross held other administrative positions within the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the United States Health, Education, and Welfare Committee on
Environmental Health, the Council of Southern Universities, the North Carolina Board of
Science and Technology, Research Triangle Institute, Governor's Research Triangle Committee,
and the North Carolina Atomic Energy Advisory Committee. </p>
<p>As an independent contractor, Gross was called upon to evaluate the composition of products
including beer, cosmetics, film, and fire extinguishers. He was a sought-after speaker among
his colleagues, giving many dedications, eulogies, lectures, panel discussions,
testimonials, and dinner addresses during his career. When Gross retired from teaching at
Duke University in 1965, the Gross Chemical Laboratory on Duke University's West Campus was
named in his honor. Paul M. Gross died in 1986 at the age of 91. </p>
<p>Paul M. Gross was the son of Magnus and Ellen Sullivan Gross of New York. He married Gladys
Cobb Peterson in 1918. They had two children: Paul M. Gross, Jr. and Beatrix Gross Ramey.

<p>The Interfraternity Council at Duke University, established in 1957, is the umbrella
organization for Duke University chapters of national fraternities. The Interfraternity
Council primarily interacts with the Council of Presidents (presidents of campus
fraternities) to promote adherence to University policies and to create leadership
opportunities for fraternities to serve the campus community. The Interfraternity
Council is divided into legislative, executive and judicial branches.</p>
<p>The Legislative Board is called the Council of Presidents and includes the presidents of
all member fraternities. The Council of Presidents convenes to vote on administrative
matters of the Interfraternity Council. </p>
<p>The Executive Council generally facilitates policy creation and assembles committees to
work on special events and community service projects. Over the years, these activities
have consisted of Greek Week, Shoe and Slipper Weekend, Help Week, and many outdoor
concerts. The Executive Council also handles record keeping, publications, and financial
accounting.</p>
<p>The Judicial Board enforces the Interfraternity Council Penal Code, tries cases
involving infractions by member fraternities, and levies appropriate punishment.
Fraternities must maintain good standing with the Council by paying dues, providing
periodic financial reports, and completing service projects. Some of the issues reported
to the Judicial Board are noise and alcohol violations, hazing, pledging rules, and
property damage to fraternity houses.</p>
<p>The Interfraternity Council generally supports fraternity presence at Duke University by
employing outside contractors and advisory boards. The input from these sources has
helped fraternities make policy decisions about going co-ed, closing a chapter, or
updating their image. Since 1954, the Interfraternity Council has published many
handbooks for students including: The Greek Way (1954-2001), Rushing Relations
(1969-1970), and Open Relations (1961-1969).</p>

<p>George "Jelly" Leftwich, a native of Wilmington, NC, was born in 1905. He joined Duke
University in 1926 as conductor of the Duke University Club Orchestra, where he remained
until 1933. Leftwich is remembered best for having written the words and music to Duke's
fight song, "The Blue and White." He ultimately turned over the song's rights to the
university.</p>
<p>During his time as conductor, Leftwich elevated both the level of musicianship and
number of participants in the music department. His orchestra regularly performed and
traveled, while billed as "the South's Finest College Band." Leftwich was never known to
have mastered an instrument himself, but was well regarded in his capacity as
conductor.</p>
<p>Leftwich's time prior to Duke is unclear. While he is credited in newspapers with having
attended the University of North Carolina before transferring to Duke in his sophomore
year, there is no official record of him as a student at the university. Certain
contents of his scrapbooks indicate that he led the Wilmington, NC Seashore Hotel
Orchestra in the summer season and was a member of the Carolinians Orchestra in the time
leading up to his acceptance of an offer from Duke.</p>
<p>After his time at Duke, Leftwich changed his name to Lee Dixon and pursued a career as a
musician. However, he experienced little success and ultimately left the music business
during World War II. Upon his music retirement, Leftwich went into the hotel industry
and eventually became the manager of the "Downtown Club" in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
<p>Leftwich married his former vocalist Kay Keeyer, and they had two sons. He died in 1977
in Richmond, Virginia, and was buried in his hometown of Wilmington, NC.</p>

<p> During 1915, meetings were held in the home of Mary White Cranford. The women wanted a
chapter house on campus, but President Few opposed the idea. Sigma Delta continued to
have monthly meetings off campus until 1916, when they were granted meeting space in the
Woman's Building. In fall 1918, the women moved into a suite in Alspaugh Hall.</p>
<p> During the first year of their Kappa Delta affiliation, the Sigma Delta chapter

<p>The Society of the 9019 was the first honor society at Trinity College. In February of
1890, John Spencer Bassett founded the Society of the 9019 and became its first president.
Bassett's desire to arouse the intellectual and literary interests of students and to
stimulate interest in the history of the South inspired him to create the 9019. The 9019
recognized the outstanding students of the college, encouraged its members to promote
scholarship on campus and in the community, and fostered a "true college spirit." The origin
of the name is a representation of a) the 90 percent average required for admittance and b)
the number of original members. As a precursor to Phi Beta Kappa, the 9019 provided a unique
opportunity for recognition and involvement in campus activities. Notable contributions
include the creation of the South Atlantic Quarterly and supporting scholarly activities
among North Carolina high schools via annual declamation contests. The 9019 continued
operation throughout the transformation to Duke University, but competing fraternities and
World War II brought an end to the organization.</p>

<p>Omicron Delta Kappa was founded at Washington and Lee University in 1914 as a campus
leadership honor society. It soon expanded to other colleges and the Rho Circle chapter
was established at Duke University in 1926. Omicron Delta Kappa admitted juniors and
seniors as well as faculty members and honorary members both alumni and non-alumni on
the basis of character, scholarship, distinguished achievement, and consecration to a
great purpose. The five categories of campus life that were emphasized were scholarship,
athletics, social and religious activities, publications, and the arts. Election to
membership was considered one of the top honors that could be conferred at Duke
University. The focus of the Rho Circle chapter was service to the university and
community through the cooperation of all campus leaders. The first president of the Rho
Circle chapter was Marshall I. Pickens, later head of the Duke Endowment.</p>
<p>The Rho Circle chapter maintained a good relationship with other national officers
through correspondence of well-connected faculty and administrators, such as Frank C.
Brown. Omicron Delta Kappa became inactive in the late 1960s or early 1970s as a result
of general student opposition to the "elitism" of special leadership distinctions. There
were also disputes within the national organization about scholarship standards and the
fraternity's refusal to admit women. Although correspondence continued between William
J. Griffith, the longtime secretary of the Duke University chapter, and the national
officers, the society has never been reactivated at Duke. </p>

<p>A largely self-taught educator, Methodist minister, and author of a series of English
grammars, Brantley York (1805-1891) was asked by Methodist and Quaker farmers in rural
Randolph County, N.C. to help provide education for their sons and daughters. At the site of
the former Brown's Schoolhouse, he organized Union Institute Academy in 1838 and met with
instant success, building two new buildings within a year-and-a-half. Though gratified at
his accomplishment, he worked extremely hard raising money, and he began to go blind working
late at night preparing recitations in subjects he had not adequately studied. In fact, he
recorded in his diary a statement saying he considered his years at Union Institute to be
"truly onerous." York, however, had found his life's work at Union Institute and though
completely blind by age forty-eight, he lived to be eighty-six and founded half-a-dozen
schools, lectured over 8,000 times, and taught more than 15,000 pupils. He served as
Principal of Union Institute from 1838 to 1842.</p>

<p>The Rainbow Triangle Oral History Project was originally conceived in 1996, by
then-Director of Duke's Center for Lesbian, Gay &amp; Bisexual Life (later the Center for
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Life, now the Center for Sexual and Gender
Diversity) John Howard, who suggested the project to Ian Lekus, then a Ph.D. candidate in
the Department of History and a member of the Duke University Task Force for Lesbian, Gay,
and Bisexual Matters. </p>
<p>The project was envisioned as a way to document the lives of LGBT people in the Triangle
region in particular and central North Carolina in general, with the additional goals of
exploring the idea of community identities and formation, breaking down barriers between the
University and the local community, and documenting the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Triangle. </p>
<p>Lekus became the Project Coordinator in 1996 and worked with a varying group of volunteers
to acquire resources, conduct interviews, and ensure the preservation and access of the oral
histories collected. From 1996 to late 1997, Lekus worked with others at Duke and elsewhere
to develop forms and processes, conduct training workshops for interviewers, and establish
how interviewes would be used and preserved. Anne Valk, a visiting professor at Duke, and
Patrick Toal and Parker Doig, graduate students at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, were other active project leaders at this time. In February 1998, the project
was officially launched during a talk by author and activist Mab Segrest on the Duke campus,
but the first group of interviews were conducted in late 1998 and early 1999.</p>
<p>Dr. Karen Krahulik became the Director of the Center for LGBT Life in 1999 and continued
support for the project. In Fall 2000, Dr. Krahulik and Ian Lekus co-taught a class called
American Communities: Gender, Sexuality, and Oral History, presented by the Women's Studies
Program and the History Department, and sponsored by the Center for Documentary Studies. As
part of this class, students conducted oral history interviews that focused on gender and
sexuality in the lives of the narrators, and several of these interviews were conducted as
part of the Rainbow Triangle project. Ian Lekus taught this class again in 2004, and
additional interviews from this class became part of the project.</p>
<p>Narrators are generally residents of the Triangle region, many of them with a connection to
Duke or Durham in particular. Narrators include both LGBT people and heterosexual people who
have been involved in LGBT issues in some way. Interviewers include Duke staff or volunteers
for the Center for LGBT Life, Duke students, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
students, and others.</p>

<p>The Religious Council was formed in 1956 to coordinate interdenominational religious
activities affiliated with Duke University. In April of 1955, members of the Special
Church Board Committee, a sub-committee of the Duke University Church, proposed to
create a unified council with a widened sphere of operations. The new council would
coordinate and serve as an advisory board to the various campus committees and
organizations involved in religious activities. In 1956, to facilitate these goals, the
Board of Duke University Church (established in 1938) and the Student Religious Council
(formed in 1937) were merged to create the Religious Council. The Religious Council was
a committee-based organization with community, faculty, and student representation.
However, the Council emphasized student membership on the various committees. The
Council also emphasized its interdenominational character, encouraging the participation
of all faiths in religious activities.</p>

<p>After the opening of Duke's West Campus in 1930, the arrangement and administration of
residential life at the University remained fairly static through the 1950s. Some
fraternities had the same blocks of rooms for decades. Then, beginning with the work of the
University Committee on Long-Range Planning (1958-1962), residential arrangements and
administration came under close review. That process has continued. Groups involved in it
have included the Undergraduate Faculty Council, its successor, the Undergraduate Faculty
Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), and its successor, the Arts and Sciences Council, the
West Campus Community Council (WCCC), the Community Council of the Woman's College
(CoCoWoCo), the Residential Life Committee, the Residential Policy Committee, and successor

<p>The University Committee on ROTC was formed in 1970 at the request of Duke President Terry
Sanford. The Committee was established to review the status of the ROTC program at Duke, and
to determine whether the program should be abolished, modified, or maintained. Some students
and others had complained that ROTC did not fit into the curriculum at Duke, that its
coursework did not allow students to think critically, and that Duke symbollically supported
the war in Vietnam through its sponsorship of ROTC.</p>
<p>The members of the committee were Aubrey W. Naylor, Thomas G. Wilson, David Pace, Chip
Rawlings, and A. Kenneth Pye. In May of 1971, the committee recommended that the ROTC
program be continued, although modified, and offered a number of recommendations. ROTC is
currently still in operation at Duke University.</p>

<p>The Seashore Summer School developed out of an experimental summer school for teacher
training that was started in 1919 by Holland Holton of Trinity College's Department of
Education. The school, located at Oriental, North Carolina, initially operated as a branch
of the college's summer school; another branch of the college's summer session was located
at Lake Junaluska, NC. Both braches became distinct corporations, the one in Oriental
receiving its charter on February 5, 1924. William Preston Few, President of Trinity College
was ex-officio the chairman of its board, and Taylor B. Attmore, Superintendent of Schools
of Pamlico County, NC, its secretary, and later its director. As specified in the charter,
it remained "affiliated with" Trinity and, later, Duke, and its offerings were included in
the course catalogs of the college and university. The school offered courses in education,
history, music, and social and physical sciences. Courses had to be approved by North
Carolina's Superintendent of Public Instruction. Due probably to financial difficulties
questions about its future began to come up late in 1927, and it appears to have ceased
operations in 1928.</p>

<p>The Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies was a cooperative scholarly
institute established in 1963 under the auspices of the Duke University-University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill Cooperative Program in the Humanities. During the summers, the
institute's members presented five-week seminars in a classroom setting. The location of the
institutes alternated between the campuses of Duke University and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. They were coordinated by a joint committee of faculty members from
each university. These institutes drew scholars from colleges and universities throughout
the United States and provided a forum for intense study and teaching. Beginning in 1968,
the joint committee initiated a fund-raising effort for continuation of the institutes.</p>
<p>In 1972, the National Endowment for the Humanities approved an additional funding request
to support the institutes for the summers of 1974-1976 based on the stipulation that by 1977
the institutes would be funded entirely by the two sponsoring campuses.</p>
<p>While summer institutes were held through the summer of 1979, the joint committee was not
able to secure a commitment of permanent funding from either Duke or UNC-Chapel Hill. Plans
for the 1980 Institute were canceled due to the lack of funding and the committee began a
new search for continuing support. The Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance
Studies has not been active since 1980.</p>
<p>Many scholars and coordinators of the Southeastern Institute of Medieval and Renaissance
Studies were also affiliated with the Southeastern Renaissance Conference, an annual
conference established cooperatively by Duke University and the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill in 1943. Renaissance studies continue at Duke University at the Center for
Medieval and Renaissance Studies, an interdisciplinary, degree-granting program.</p>

<p>SHARE (Student Housing for Academic and Residential Experimentation) was founded in 1970 as
an academically elite experimental living group of 54 men and women. The integrated
residence, then known as the Experimental College, was part of Duke's "New Curriculum". The
"New Curriculum" recommendations of 1969 had suggested various changes in living
arrangements for students on campus, including the elimination of freshmen dormitories and
the establishment of a co-educational dormitory.</p>
<p>SHARE generally included students who were creative and possessed special talents or
interests. SHARE applicants also had to demonstrate a clear sense of academic direction, and
show interest in helping develop programs of the Experimental College within the first year.
Students enrolled in Program II, an interdisciplinary study program, were given preference
to live in the SHARE house.</p>
<p>The first director, overseeing the academic progress of residents, was English professor
John Clum. Clum worked closely with the administration of Duke University to blend SHARE's
social and academic components into a sustainable living environment. SHARE was first
located in the Faculty Apartments (now Wilson House) on Duke University's East Campus. The
apartment-type layout of the building allowed for men and women to live closely together
while preserving privacy. SHARE participants lived in Wilson House until 1982, then in
Alspaugh House from 1983 to 1984. In 1984, SHARE moved again to Epworth Inn, where it would
remain until 1997. In 1997, SHARE was moved to Wilson House. </p>
<p>SHARE programming consisted of a variety of seminars, credit courses, meetings, film
festivals, and lectures. Events included a "Use Your Appendages" Party, Anime Fest, Epworth
Prom (Oil My Lizard), The Epworth Retreat, and "Twilight", a rave. Two of the most notable
activities were SHARE hours and Pedagogo. SHARE hours gave members of the dorm an
opportunity to tell others about their interest and experiences. Pedagogo was a series of
events where members of the Duke University faculty were invited to Epworth to speak
informally about issues in research and academics. </p>
<p>In 1995, SHARE became the first living group on campus to include members from all four
undergraduate years. SHARE persisted as an alternative to conventional Duke residential
life. When cited for low membership in 1997, SHARE was relocated from Epworth House to the
third floor in Wilson House. As of 2003, SHARE is active at Duke University.</p>

<p>Founded in 1886, Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, is a non-profit membership
society of nearly 75,000 scientists and engineers. Sigma Xi is headquartered in Research
Triangle Park, N.C. and has more than 500 chapters at universities and colleges,
government laboratories and industry research centers. In addition to publishing
American Scientist, Sigma Xi awards grants annually to promising young researchers,
holds forums on critical issues of science and society, and sponsors a variety of
programs supporting honor in science and engineering, science education, science policy,
and the public understanding of science.</p>
<p>The idea for a Duke University chapter of Sigma Xi was conceived during spring 1929,
when a number of people interested in scientific research across departments began to
meet on campus. They contacted Sigma Xi's national secretary regarding proper
organization of a chapter and then held a general interest meeting was held in New
Science Hall on Duke's East Campus in 1929. With fourteen members, the Sigma Xi Club of
Duke University organized as a club and elected officers. As the petition for full
membership to the national society continued, the members of the club were called on to
present the history of the University and summaries of their own research. Their
completed formal petition was accepted in June, 1932 and the charter granted in December
1932. Installation took place March 23, 1933. Some early members who petitioned for the
charter were: Ruth Margery Addoms, Lucius Aurelius Bigelow, Bert Cunningham, Wilburt
Cornell Davison, Joseph Banks Rhine, and Frederick Adolphus Wolf.</p>
<p>The Duke University chapter of Sigma Xi holds meetings about six times per year.
Initiations are held annually and feature a keynote address from a professional in the
sciences. Election to Sigma Xi is arranged through a campus department representative,
with members coming from all departments in social, physical, and medical sciences. New
members are elected to Sigma Xi as associates or full members, depending on their
research contributions. New members must have demonstrated abilities in conducting
research and a potential for leadership in their field. </p>
<p>The Duke University chapter offers grants to students and professionals in the
community. Smaller grants have been awarded to science teachers in North Carolina, while
Duke University students have received awards for travel, field work, and conferences.

<p>In early August 1981, Duke University President Terry Sanford told Duke faculty that he had
opened negotiations to house the Presidential Library of Richard Nixon – a Duke Law School
alumnus – on the Duke campus. In response, Duke's Academic Council, which represented
faculty interests, formed two major committees to discuss how the decision was made and to
propose the direction of future negotiations regarding the Nixon Library: the Subcommittee
on Governance and the Subcommittee on Library Relations.</p>
<p>Philip Stewart, then a professor in the Department of Romance Studies, served on the
Academic Council's Subcommittee on Library Relations, charged on September 17, 1981, to
answer the question: "Can a Nixon Presidential Library be developed at Duke that does not
compromise the integrity of Duke University?" The subcommittee examined several areas of
Duke's intersection with the proposed library, including use of land, the library's
potential scholarly value, and whether the library would have a museum component. The
Library Subcommittee submitted its report to the Academic Council on October 21, 1981, with
recommendations on conditions to be met in order for negotiations to proceed.</p>
<p>Philip Stewart was born May 21, 1940. He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1967,
and came to teach at Duke in 1972. Stewart's books include <title>Imitation and Illusion in

<p>The origin of the Trinity College (Durham, N.C.) Athletic Association is unclear. It is
likely that it was established soon after Trinity joined the Southern Intercollegiate
Athletic Association during the 1902-1903 academic year, as did other similar institutions.
What is known is that in 1907, the Board of Trustees approved the formation of the Athletic
Council, which served as the governing body of athletics on-campus. Between the two,
athletic events/games were organized. The Athletic Association is probably the predecessor
to the current Dept. of Athletics.</p>

<p>The Duke University Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences (UFCAS), established
in 1971, guided undergraduate education in arts and sciences, adopted academic regulations
and admissions policies, advised on financial aid and recognized academic achievement. It
succeeded the Undergraduate Faculty Council after the body no longer included
representatives from the engineering and nursing schools. Council membership consisted of
the president, provost, dean of the undergraduate college, and elected members of the
faculties of the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. The dean presided at
meetings, while a member of the faculty was elected chair of the Executive Committee. </p>
<p>Most of Council's work was done through its standing and ad hoc committees, which included:
Curriculum, Courses of Instruction, Honors, Study Abroad, Program II, Academic Standards,
Advising, Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid, Residential Life, Freshman Year,
Advanced Placement, Athletics and Recreation, Health Science Education, and Non-western

<p>Undergraduate Faculty Council began in 1952, as a result of a re-organization of the
Duke University Faculty. The Undergraduate Faculty Council (UFC) was responsible for the
governance of undergraduate education, a task that the Faculty Council previously had
undertaken. The UFC included representatives from the Engineering and Nursing schools.
The Dean of Trinity College served as chair. The UFC first met on November 13, 1952. The
Undergraduate Faculty Council of Arts and Sciences succeeded the UFC in October 1971,
when undergraduate education in engineering and nursing formed separate governing
bodies. </p>
<p> Standing Committees of the Undergraduate Faculty Council included Undergraduate
Instruction (which absorbed the Curriculum Committee and the Committee on Courses of
Instruction between 1964-1965), Honors, Program II, the Faculty Advisory System,
Residential Life, Study Abroad, Undergraduate Admissions, and Financial Aid. Ad hoc
committees included Academic Standards, Committee on Committees, and the Committee on
the Organization and Functions of the UFC. The creation of a report called "Varieties of
Learning Experience," or the Krueger Report (1968), represents one of the major
accomplishments of the Undergraduate Faculty Council. The Krueger Report led to major
changes in the undergraduate course of study known as the "new curriculum." </p>

<p>The late 1960s was a time of rapid change at American colleges and universities, as most
experienced a surge of politicization by student activists; at Duke, this was most
clearly exemplified in the Allen Building takeover of February 13, 1969. In response
both to this local event and to national trends in higher education, the Faculty
Committee on Student Concerns, the Executive Committee of the Academic Council, and the
Student-Faculty-Administrative Council (SFAC) recommended the creation of a Commission
on University Governance. In April 1969 Chancellor pro tem Barnes Woodhall appointed
this committee, with the hopes that future demonstrations similar to the Allen Building
takeover might be avoided if effective official opportunities for student participation
in university governance could be established. The Commission on University Governance
was therefore charged with the task of studying changes in university organization
nationwide, focusing particularly on student participation in governance, and making
recommendations for Duke accordingly. </p>
<p> Members of the Commission eventually agreed that this purpose was best accomplished by
dividing university governance into three categories: departmental governance, the
central university administration, and the Board of Trustees. The latter body was
already the subject of a study by a Board of Trustees Special Committee headed by
Brantley Watson, and the Commission coordinated its efforts with the Watson Committee.
The Commission on University Governance also worked simultaneously and cooperatively
with the Chancellor's Advisory Committee, "The Committee of Twelve," which replaced the
SFAC as the forum for airing Duke community grievances and which was meant to advise the
administration concerning potentially volatile campus issues. The Commission on
University Governance met 34 times between October 27, 1969 and May 17, 1970, at which
time it adjourned for the school year and was never reactivated.</p>

<p>Richard Lyness Watson, Jr. was born December 25, 1914 in Mount Hermon, Mass. He attended
Mount Hermon Preparatory School and graduated 1931. He studied economics and history at
Yale University, receiving his B.A. in 1935, and his Ph.D. in 1939. Immediately after
attaining his doctorate he moved to Durham and began teaching at Duke University. He was
drafted into the Army in 1941 and commissioned in May 1943. He first served at the Coast
Artillery School until appointed to the Army Air Force Historical Office. While at this
post he served as chief of the Southwest Pacific Branch and was responsible for
selecting documents on and writing histories pertaining to the Pacific theatre of
operations during the War. His work was ultimately included in the seven volume series,
<title type="simple" render="italic">The Army Air Forces in World War II</title>,
edited by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate. </p>
<p> During his forty-five year tenure at Duke, Watson served as one of the university's
leading "citizens." He not only served in positions of leadership at the departmental
level, but at the university level as well. Duke recognized his citizenship in 1988 when
they awarded him the Duke University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service. While
trained to specialize in early 19th century American history, Watson filled a needed
role in the Department of History by shifting his research and teaching focus to early
twentieth-century American history. His particular interests lay in the Progressive,
Depression, and New Deal Eras. He chaired the department from 1960-1967 and stood in as
Acting Chair in 1970-1971 and 1980. He took a lead in the burgeoning development of
Black Studies, teaching several summer workshops for college professors on the materials
of black history.</p>
<p>Watson led, at numerous points in his career, the faculty's most important
representative bodies. He was vice chair of the University Council from 1961-1962;
Chairman of the Academic Council from 1964-1966, as well as 1975-1977; and vice chair of
the Academic Council from 1973-1974. He was the first person to hold the position of
Faculty Secretary of the Academic Council, a position created in 1984. In addition, he
was a member of the board of the Duke University Press from 1973-1982, and was associate
editor of the <title type="simple" render="italic">South Atlantic Quarterly</title> from
1974-1987. Watson also played a central role in the faculty movement to bar the Nixon
presidential library from locating at Duke.</p>
<p>Watson answered the university administration's call to service. This is evidenced in
the numerous committees, advisory councils, and task forces to which he was appointed.
He played a significant role in helping define and implement university policies during
student unrest of the late 1960s. As chair of the Committee on Judicial Procedures he
helped put into place judicial procedures and policies to deal with the pickets and
protests regulations. He also served on the Faculty Committee on Student Concerns which
helped develop policies in response to the takeover of the Allen Building in 1969 and
his work on the Student-Faculty-Administration Committee addressed drug policies,
military recruitment on campus, and the pickets policy. </p>
<p>Watson served as President of the Southern Historical Association (1976-77) and of the
Historical Society of North Carolina (1972-73); he was also chair of the Organization of
American Historians' Frederick Jackson Turner Prize Committee from 1964-68. In addition,
he sat on the board of editors of both the <title type="simple" render="italic">Mississippi Valley Historical Review</title> (1958-60) and the <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of Southern History</title> (1968-70). He was a member of the
Board of Trustees of St. Augustine's College from 1965-1971. </p>
<p>His activity in the Durham community was recognized by the Duke University Campus
Ministry, who in 1992 awarded him its Humanitarian Service Award. Watson aided in the
establishment of the St. Philip's Community Kitchen and the Durham Urban Ministry
Center. He was also a familiar face in community theater, as a long-time member of
Durham Savoyards, a group that presents annual performances of Gilbert and Sullivan. </p>
<p>In the midst of his teaching and academic service, Watson continued to conduct and
publish scholarly research. He won the R.D.W. Connor Award for the best article to
appear in the <title type="simple" render="italic">North Carolina Historical
Review</title> in both 1960 and 1965. He contributed greatly to the teaching of
history in the secondary schools by his editorship, along with William Cartwright, of
<title type="simple" render="italic">Interpreting and Teaching American
History</title> (196?) and its revised edition, <title type="simple" render="italic">Reinterpretation of American History and Culture</title>. Other books he authored or
edited include, <title type="simple" render="italic">Bishop Cannon's Own Story</title>,
the <title type="simple" render="italic">United States in the Contemporary World,
1945-62</title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">The Development of National
Power: The United States 1900-1919</title>. </p>

<p>The Duke University Woman's College opened in the fall of 1930 as part of the expansion of Trinity College into Duke University. In 1924 James B. Duke established the Duke Endowment and gave funds to transform a small liberal arts college into a major university. From 1925 to 1927 the existing Trinity Campus (now Duke's East Campus) was rebuilt and transformed to become a residential campus for undergraduate women. From 1928 to 1930 Duke's new gothic West Campus and residential campus for undergraduate male students was constructed and known as Trinity College for Men. In 1972, the Men's and Women's colleges were merged to form Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>In the Fall of 2002, the Woman's College marked the 30th anniversary of its merger with the Trinity College for Men with a reunion. Carolyn Murray Happer, Class of 1960, curated an exhibition on the history of Woman's College and decided to start an oral history interview project with alumnae for use in a proposed history of Woman's College. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Ken Wainio was born in Ukiah, California, about two hours north of San Francisco, in 1952.
He began to write at age fifteen--having been influenced by the writings of the French poets
Lautreamont, Rimbaud, and Nerval. He moved to San Francisco at the beginning of the 1970s to
study at San Francisco State University with the Greek surrealist poet Nanos Valaoritis, and
met the American surrealist poets Philip Lamantia and Stephen Schwartz. A couple of years
later, in an informal "poetry class" being conducted in the home of Harold Norse, he met
Thomas Rain Crowe, Neeli Cherkovski and Luke Breit--along with whom he would later help to
resurrect <title type="simple" render="italic">Beatitude</title> magazine. Wainio was
co-editor of issue No. 26 which appeared in 1977. During the 1970s, his poems were regularly
published in Bay area literary magazines. With Jerry Estrin, Wainio was a founding editor of
the surrealist publication <title type="simple" render="italic">Vanishing Cab</title>. After
driving a taxicab for the entire decade of the 1980s, he moved to Glenhaven, California. His
travels took him to Greece and Egypt, where he spent considerable time in the 1980s and
1990s. His poems and fiction were published both in America and abroad in such journals as
<title type="simple" render="italic">Nexus</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Asheville Poetry Review</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Litterature en

<p>Born August 23, 1902, Herbert Lee Waters spent the majority of his life in Lexington, North Carolina operating a photography studio. Waters supplemented his income from 1936-1942 by traveling across North Carolina and parts of Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carolina to film the people of small communities. He collaborated with local movie theaters to screen his films, which he called Movies of Local People and billed with the phrase "See yourself in the movies!" It is estimated that Waters created films in 118 communities, visiting some of them multiple times. In 1942, Waters returned to Lexington and continued operating his photographic studio until his death in 1997. The Library of Congress listed Waters' Kannapolis film on the National Film Registry in 2004.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Susan Wicklund was born in 1954 and spent her career as an abortion provider in the
Midwest. In her early twenties, she herself received an abortion just three years after the
procedure was legalized. Her experience was relatively traumatic due in part to the apathy
of the providers. This inspired her to pursue a career in medicine so that she could one day
be the kind of abortion provider she wished she had when she underwent the procedure. She
opened her own clinic in 1993, after which she faced constant threats from anti-abortion
groups, and was targeted as a murderer of children. Despite fearing for her life, she
continued practicing until 2013, when she retired and closed her clinic, the Mountain
Country Women's Clinic in Livingston, Montana. She recounts her experiences in her own words
in her book <title render="italic">This Common Secret: My Journey as an Abortion

<p>The primary correspondent in this collection is Charles Wilkes (1798-1877), naval
officer and explorer, who was a collateral descendant of John Wilkes (1727-1797), the
noted English politician. Charles Wilkes was born in New York City, the son of John De
Ponthieu and Mary (Seton) Wilkes. From 1815 through 1817 Wilkes was in the merchant
service on board several ships until he was appointed midshipman in the U. S. Navy on
Jan. 1, 1818. His naval career was destined to be a rather distinguished, yet
controversial one. During the next fifteen years he served on board several ships
including the <emph render="italic">Franklin</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Waterwitch,</emph> was promoted to lieutenant in 1826, and surveyed the Narragansett
Bay in 1832-1833. Wilkes's scientific achievements were rewarded by his appointment to
take charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments in Washington, D. C. in 1833. In 1837
and 1838 he was involved in further surveying work at the shoals of Georges Bank and the
Savannah River.</p>
<p>In 1838 Secretary of War Poinsett ordered Wilkes to command the South Seas Surveying and
Exploring Expedition. This expedition and the publications concerning it provided the
primary focus for his career until 1861. This Exploring Expedition, which was absent
from the United States from 1838 to 1842, had as its chief fields of exploration the
islands of the Pacific Ocean, the coast of the Antarctic Continent, and the American
Northwest coast. From 1843 to 1861, Wilkes was assigned to special duty, chiefly to be
in charge of the Exploring Expedition collections and reports. In 1844 his <title type="simple" render="italic">Narrative of the United States Exploring
Expedition</title> was published, and scientific volumes appeared from time to time.
In 1842 Wilkes had been tried by a court-martial and sentenced to be publicly
reprimanded for illegally punishing some of his men. Despite this he was promoted to
commander in 1843 and to captain in 1855.</p>
<p>During the Civil War Charles Wilkes took the controversial step of overhauling the
British mail steamer <emph render="italic">Trent</emph> and removed by force the
Confederate commissioners James Mason and John Slidell, He saw other service in a
variety of commands and received promotion to commodore and then to acting rear admiral
in 1862. Again in 1864 Wilkes was court-martialed and found guilty. Two years later he
was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list and was placed on special duty for a
part of 1870-1873, After the Civil War he purchased the iron works at High Shoals, N. C.
and pursued business interests there for several years.</p>
<p>Wilkes was married twice: first to Jane Jeffrey Renwick, sister of James Renwick
(1792-1863) in 1826, and then to Msry H. (Lynch) Bolton in 1854, after the death of his
first wife, He had six children from these marriages, For further biographical

<p>John (''Jack'') Wilkes (1827-1908), sailor and businessman, was the son of Charles
Wilkes as well as a correspondent in this collection. Immediately after his appointment
as a midshipman on September 9, 1841, young Wilkes was sent to sea. He served on the

<p>Bailey Willis (1857-1949) was a geological engineer who worked for the U.S. Geological
Survey. He was born in New York and studied at Columbia University, earning degrees in
mechanical and civil engineering. In 1879, he began working with the Northern Pacific
Railroad, under the direction of Raphael Pumpelly, and surveyed regions of Appalachia
and the Northwestern U.S. He visited Mt. Rainier in 1882, and later contributed to its
designation as a National Park. </p>
<p>Willis began working for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884, spending the next decade
working and researching in the Appalachian Mountains and throughout the eastern U.S. His
publications on the region's geology garnered international attention from scientists.
In 1903, he led an expedition funded by the Carnegie Institution to northern China, an
area previously unexplored by geologists. He also traveled and mapped geology throughout
South America, Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Later in his career he lectured at
Johns Hopkins and Stanford, retiring from teaching in 1922. He remained an active
explorer and geologist, however, until his death in 1949.</p>

<p>The Workers League for a Revolutionary Party, originally the Leninist League of the
United States, was founded by George Spiro in 1938. Spiro, known as George Marlin (a
portmanteau of Marx and Lenin), formed the party after an ideological conflict with the
Revolutionary Workers League (RWL), formed by Hugo Oehler as a Trotskyist movement
within the Workers Party of the United States. The conflict arose after RWL's rejection
of Trotskyism. Spiro and his followers, known as Marlenites, felt that the Leninsit
League did not go far enough in vocalizing its rejection of Trotskyism and Trotsky
himself. The party published a newspaper, <title type="simple" render="italic">In
Defense of Bolshevism.</title> Interpreteing the Second World War as a war on the
proletariat, the party became critical of both Leninism and Marxism, and in 1946,
changed its name to the Workers League for a Revlutionary Party. Amidst internal
dissent, the party dissolved around 1950.</p>

the 1960s. Mary Seton Watts was Hon. Chairman between 1907 until 1914, when she assumed the
title of Hon. President. May Morris was the first Hon. Secretary, and Chairman from 1915
