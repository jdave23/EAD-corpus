         <abstract id="aspace_85532d1a07d94a87dfbdad65f74a2460">Annie L. Hobbs of Laconia, N.H. was
            an instructor at the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College (Methodist) in
            Tilton, N.H. and at the Troy Conference Academy in Poultney, Vt. during the 1850s and
            1860s. Collection contains two manuscript pocket diaries, dated 1867 and 1869, and two
            pocket memoranda books, dated 1854-1855, 1859, and 1863-1865, kept by Annie L. Hobbs, an
            instructor at the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College (Methodist) in
            Tilton, Belknap County, New Hampshire and at the Troy Conference Academy in Poultney,
            Rutland County, Vermont. In the diaries, Hobbs records her travels to and from her
            schools, evening readings, croquet games, naps, teas, Saturday excursions, her sewing
            work, occasional written work, receipt of letters and newspapers, Methodist festivals
            and Sabbath observances, and fluctuations in her health. Hobbs also regularly records
            her moods and her uncertainty about whether or not to go back for another term.
            Generally, the diaries document the life of a young female teacher living away from
            home, her daily routine, social contacts, and her intellectual pursuits. In the two
            memoranda books, Hobbs records student names and recitation periods, Lyceum lectures she
            attended, mathematical equations, and her expenses for 1863 to 1865.</abstract>
