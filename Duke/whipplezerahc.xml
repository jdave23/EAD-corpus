        March 1873) Whipple wrote to Jeremiah Hacker, a Maine reformer, abolition advocate,

        for "The Voice of Peace," as well as his admiration for "The Pleasure Boat" and "N.P.
        Rogers' Newspaper Writings." He also discusses his difficulty printing "The Voice of Peace,"
        and the increase in pacifism since the end of the Civil War, noting that abolitionists and
        industrialists Adin Ballou and E. D. Draper were constant in their support of peace, while
        members of the utopian Hopedale Community were "untrue to the professions of years." Whipple
        included a printed photograph with his letter.</abstract>
