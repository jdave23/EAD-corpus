      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>A group of Law School students formed the bipartisan Nixon Portrait Committee to raise
        funds for a portrait of President Richard Nixon, a 1937 graduate of the School. The
        Committee was chaired by Charles S. Mill, Jr., a student in the Duke Law School. The
        portrait was painted by Joseph Wallace King and was presented to the Law School at the 1969
        Commencement ceremony. Since that time it has been stored in the Law School and the Art
        Museum. In March of 1998, there were plans to loan the portrait in turn to the Speaker of
        the U.S. House of Representatives, the Nixon Library, and the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
