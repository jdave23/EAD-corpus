      <abstract id="aspace_d0e103a4892593e24e61a39e7477ebf0">Founded in 1864, the J. Walter Thompson
        Company (JWT) was one of the oldest and largest advertising agencies in the United States.
        It was headquartered in New York. In 2023 the agency was absorbed into marketing and
        communications firm VML. The <emph render="bold">Domestic Advertisements Collection</emph>
        consists of print advertisements created by U.S. offices of the J. Walter Thompson Company
        (JWT). The bulk of the collection dates from the 1920s and after, but a few examples are
        available from as early as 1875. Print advertisements appear in a variety of
        formats--magazine, newspaper, color, black-and-white, proofs, tearsheets, negative
        transfers, clippings, along with a limited number of sketches for outdoor advertising
        installations. Some of the advertisements feature work from notable artists, such as Norman
        Rockwell, and photographers like Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, and Baron De Meyer. In
        addition to the actual advertisements, the files dating from the 1910s to 1950s often
        contain <emph render="doublequote">insertion schedules</emph> that provide the dates and
        names of the magazines or newspapers in which a given advertisement appeared. In general,
        proofs for JWT's long-time clients have been saved more systematically than those for
        accounts that JWT did not hold for a long time. The collection does not include
        advertisements which have been transferred to microfilm (see the JWT Microfilm Collection).
        Also, advertisements created for clients that JWT lost prior to the 1940s are less likely to
        have been saved, although some were microfilmed and are still available in that form. For
        some JWT clients there are no print advertisements at all in this collection. Among the most
        extensive files of print advertisements are those for the following JWT clients: Champion
        Spark Plug, Chesebrough-Ponds, Eastman Kodak (Instamatic, Pocket Instamatic, and Disc
        cameras, Kodak film), Ford Motor Company (consumer and dealer advertisements), R.T. French,
        Irving Trust Bank, J. Walter Thompson Company (<emph render="doublequote">house
          advertisements</emph>), Kraft Foods (including Kraft cheeses, Miracle Whip, Philadelphia
        Cream Cheese, and Velveeta), Lever Brothers (Lifebuoy, Lux, Close Up, Mrs. Butterworth), Pan
        American World Airways (passenger jet travel, cargo transportation), Radio Corporation of
        America (RCA) (RCA Victor recordings, consumer goods, National Broadcasting Company), <title
          type="simple" render="italic">Reader's Digest</title>, Scott Paper, Seven-Up, Standard
        Brands (Chase and Sandborn, Fleischmann, Royal, Tenderleaf tea), and Warner-Lambert
        (primarily Listerine, including advertisements produced by the Lambert and Feasley agency).

      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Beginning in 1919 the New York Office of the J. Walter Thompson Company began to
        systematically retain the advertisements it had created. The Statistical and Information
        Department, renamed the Information and Records Department in the 1920s, arranged the
        advertisements in scrapbooks. Initially, most of the advertisements preserved were tear
        sheets, the actual advertisements clipped from newspapers and magazines. By the 1930s,
        however, the department retained the final printers' proofs for magazine advertisements. The
        scrapbooks therefore began to be called <emph render="doublequote">proof books.</emph>
      </p>
      <p>In the 1950s the responsibility for creating proof books fell to individual account groups.
        In addition to the account group proof books, a file clerk under the supervision of the
        Traffic Department maintained proofs. When no longer of current use, the file clerk
        transferred the proofs to a storeroom or records center. Throughout these years, individuals
        who helped create campaigns or who managed an account sometimes would maintain personal
        proof books.</p>
      <p>In 1977 the New York Office established a Creative Library. Its responsibilities included
        the preservation on microfilm of all print advertisements, which was done for most of the
        1980s. Imprints are located in the JWT Microfilm Collection; the originals were apparently
        destroyed after microfilming. The Creative Library has made an effort to create files of
        work from all major U.S. offices, so work from Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San
        Francisco, and Washington, D.C., is better represented in the collection from the late 1970s
        and after. Where known, the office that created the advertisements is noted in the container
        list. In addition, JWT subsidiaries such as Brouillard Communications or Lord Geller
        Federico and Einstein (LGFE) are noted where their work has been identified. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Domestic Advertisements Collection</emph> consists of print
        advertisements created by U.S. offices of the J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT). The bulk of
        the collection dates from the 1920s and after, but a few examples are available from as
        early as 1875. Print advertisements appear in a variety of formats--magazine, newspaper,
        color, black-and-white, proofs, tearsheets, negative transfers, clippings, along with a
        limited number of sketches for outdoor advertising installations. Some of the advertisements
        feature work from notable artists, such as Norman Rockwell, and photographers like Edward
        Steichen, Irving Penn, and Baron De Meyer. In addition to the actual advertisements, the
        files dating from the 1910s to 1950s often contain <emph render="doublequote">insertion
          schedules</emph> that provide the dates and names of the magazines or newspapers in which
        a given advertisement appeared. In general, proofs for JWT's long-time clients have been
        saved more systematically than those for accounts that JWT did not hold for a long time. The
        collection does not include advertisements which have been transferred to microfilm (see the
        JWT Microfilm Collection). Also, advertisements created for clients that JWT lost prior to
        the 1940s are less likely to have been saved, although some were microfilmed and are still
        available in that form. For some JWT clients there are no print advertisements at all in
        this collection. Among the most extensive files of print advertisements are those for the
        following JWT clients: Champion Spark Plug, Chesebrough-Ponds, Eastman Kodak (Instamatic,
        Pocket Instamatic, and Disc cameras, Kodak film), Ford Motor Company (consumer and dealer
        advertisements), R.T. French, Irving Trust Bank, J. Walter Thompson Company (<emph
          render="doublequote">house advertisements</emph>), Kraft Foods (including Kraft cheeses,
        Miracle Whip, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and Velveeta), Lever Brothers (Lifebuoy, Lux, Close
        Up, Mrs. Butterworth), Pan American World Airways (passenger jet travel, cargo
        transportation), Radio Corporation of America (RCA) (RCA Victor recordings, consumer goods,
        National Broadcasting Company), <title type="simple" render="italic">Reader's
        Digest</title>, Scott Paper, Seven-Up, Standard Brands (Chase and Sandborn, Fleischmann,
        Royal, Tenderleaf tea), and Warner-Lambert (primarily Listerine, including advertisements
        produced by the Lambert and Feasley agency). </p>
      <p>The Collection is organized into three series--Main Files, Small Files, and Oversize
        Materials--that reflect both the size of the holdings for each client as well as the
        physical location of the advertisements. Within each series, clients are arranged
        alphabetically and then the advertisements are arranged chronologically. The <emph
          render="bold">Main File Series</emph> includes clients for which at least one box have
        been preserved. A separate <emph render="bold">Small Files Series</emph> is maintained for
        clients for which less than one box of advertisements, and often much less, has survived.
        The <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials Series</emph> includes many of the clients found
        in both the <emph render="bold">Main</emph> and <emph render="bold">Small Files
          Series</emph>. </p>
      <p>The collection is continued by the J. Walter Thompson Company. Domestic advertisements,

          type="inclusive">1875-1968.</unitdate> Proofs from the 1920s to 1950s feature testimonial
        advertising for Pond's Cold Cream. Noted socialites endorsing the product were photographed
        by well known photographers, including Edward J. Steichen and Baron DeMeyer.</p>
      <p> Eastman Kodak Company, <unitdate normal="1930" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
          type="inclusive">1930-present</unitdate>. Organized into two categories--Consumer and
        Trade advertisements--that correspond to Kodak's two major marketing areas. Consumer
        advertisements feature photographs by well known photographers, famous slogans and
        trademarks, and depict the American family over several decades in settings where the
        cameras are used. Introductions of new camera models are well represented, including the
        Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket Instamatic in 1972, the Instant camera in 1975, and the Disc
        camera in 1982. At different times JWT handled both film and cameras (still and/or movie) or
        just Kodak films. Trade advertisements include campaigns for medical and industrial films,
        Kodel fibers, and Eastman Chemical, as well as advertisements aimed at Kodak dealers.
        Additional Kodak advertising may be found in the <emph render="bold">Wayne P. Ellis
          Collection of Kodakiana</emph>.</p>

        (1960-1962) and the launch of the Mustang (1964). In addition to print advertisements
        showing the introduction of new models, photostats of outdoor billboards in the 1940s and
        early 1950s are included. Truck and dealer advertising can also be found. A separate

      <p> Lever Brothers, <unitdate normal="1900" era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="inclusive"
          >1900-present</unitdate>. The earliest advertisements are for Lifebuoy Soap. J. Walter
        Thompson Co. introduced Lux Flakes in 1915 and Lux Toilet Soap in 1925. The early Lux Flakes
        advertisements employed the talents of fine illustrators. Comic style advertising appeared
        in the 1930s (<emph render="doublequote">Peggy Lux</emph> and others). The Lux Toilet Soap
        campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One noteworthy campaign
        dates from 1953-1954 when Irving Penn photographed some of Hollywood's most famous stars.
        The Lever Brothers advertisements for both Lux products also include photographs of car
        cards (subway and bus posters) from the 1920s. Other Lever products represented in the

      <p> Standard Brands, <unitdate normal="1925/1984" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
          type="inclusive">1925-1984</unitdate>. Advertisements cover a range of products, including

      <p> Warner-Lambert, <unitdate normal="1915/1997" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
          type="inclusive">1915-1997</unitdate>. Advertisements consist primarily of proofs and
        tearsheets. There are no advertisements present for the years 1945-1947 or 1949. The vast
        majority of the advertisements are for Listerine Antiseptic, with other products represented
        beginning in the late 1960s. Listerine was manufactured by the Lambert Pharmacal Company
        beginning around 1915. William Warner acquired the company in 1955, merged it into his own
        pharmaceutical business and changed the name to the Warner-Lambert Co.</p>
      <p> Warner-Lambert is the only client file in this collection that includes the work of an
        agency other than JWT. Until 1962, Listerine advertising was handled by the Lambert and
        Feasley agency in New York, the house agency for the Lambert Pharmacal Co. (St. Louis) up to
        1955, and for its successor the Warner-Lambert Co. (Morris Plains, N.J.), from 1955-1962.
        When JWT obtained the Listerine account in October 1962, the back files of Listerine
        advertisements were transferred to JWT.</p>

          <p>Includes clients for which at least one box (usually at least 100 advertisements) have
            been preserved. A few files contain photocopies or prints made from microfilm, a fact
            which is noted in the list. Parenthetical identification of the client or product or the
            JWT office or division responsible for the ad has been added in some cases. The files
            are arranged alphabetically by client (not product), insofar as it has been possible to
            determine the client name accurately and as it was known during the relationship with
            JWT (hence, Lever Brothers in lieu of Unilever). The files are then arranged
            chronologically within client groupings.</p>

            <p>Organized into two categories--Consumer and Trade advertisements--that correspond to
              Kodak's two major marketing areas. Consumer advertisements feature photographs by well
              known photographers, famous slogans and trademarks, and depict the American family
              over several decades in settings where the cameras are used. Introductions of new
              camera models are well represented, including the Instamatic in 1963, the Pocket
              Instamatic in 1972, the Instant camera in 1975, and the Disc camera in 1982. At
              different times JWT handled both film and cameras (still and/or movie) or just Kodak
              films. Trade advertisements include campaigns for medical and industrial films, Kodel
              fibers, and Eastman Chemical, as well as advertisements aimed at Kodak dealers. </p>
            <p> Eastman Kodak advertising is also represented in various other collections: JWT
              Account Files (includes films and videos plus account information); Wayne P. Ellis
              Collection of Kodakiana</p>

              from the Eastman Kodak Company from 1931-1990. Although formal division titles changed
              slightly throughout the company's history, general markets consistently advertised
              include: </p>
            <p> Medical, including dental and radiography; chemical, including chemicals, plastics,
              and cellulose divisions; business reproductions, including Recordak; Tennessee
              Eastman, including Eastman Chemicals and Eastman Fibers (Kodel); industrial
              photography, including engineering and functional photography; motion pictures;
              business premiums; and pharmaceutical trade, probably the least represented. </p>
            <p> International advertisements may be found as early as 1961 randomly included and
              continuing throughout the collection for various years. The majority of advertisements
              are proofs; very few tearsheets appear. Prior to the 1960s, the physical condition of
              the advertisements varies from poor to good with many advertisements still attached to
              black scrapbook paper. The remaining advertisements were not initially stored in the
              scrapbooks; therefore, they range from good to very good physical condition. The
              quantity for any given year varies somewhat; however, the following years have a
              minimal number of advertisements: 1966-1967, 1970, 1972-1973. </p>

            <p>Key campaigns include <emph render="doublequote">There's a Ford in Your Future</emph>
              (1945-1948), the <emph render="doublequote">Peanuts</emph> campaign (1960-1962) and
              the launch of the Mustang (1964). In addition to print advertisements showing the
              introduction of new models, photostats of outdoor billboards in the 1940s and early
              1950s are included. Truck and dealer advertising can also be found throughout the
              years. </p>
            <p> Additional information and documentation for the Ford account may be found in other
              collections including: <emph render="bold">JWT Co. Newsletters</emph>, <emph
                render="bold">Winfield Taylor Papers</emph>, <emph render="bold">Norman Strouse
                Papers</emph> (a small collection), <emph render="bold">Legal and Financial
                Documents</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches</emph>. The <emph
                render="bold">Ford Collateral Literature</emph> files include showroom brochures,
              and diverse sales materials in many formats</p>
            <p> Folders marked <emph render="bold">cars</emph> do not include any model that has its
              own folder for a particular year. <emph render="doublequote">Cars</emph> include
              station wagons and minivans. Aerostar is a minivan after 1986.</p>
            <p> Folders marked <emph render="bold">trucks</emph> include all truck sizes unless
              there is a folder specifically for <emph render="bold">medium/heavy duty
              trucks</emph>, in which case the <emph render="doublequote">trucks</emph> folder would
              contain light trucks (Ranger, F series, etc. pickups). Bronco is classified as both a
              truck (1966-1989) and an SUV (1990-).</p>
            <p><emph render="doublequote">Vans</emph> includes RVs, conversion and 15 passenger
              vans, but not minivans.</p>
            <p> Throughout this list, <emph render="doublequote">General</emph> folders refers to
              car advertising for Ford cars in general or more than one model in a given ad. </p>

            <p>The earliest advertisements are for Lifebuoy Soap. J. Walter Thompson Co. introduced
              Lux Flakes in 1915 and Lux Toilet Soap in 1925. The early Lux Flakes advertisements
              employed the talents of fine illustrators. Comic style advertising appeared in the
              1930s (<emph render="doublequote">Peggy Lux</emph> and others). The Lux Toilet Soap
              campaigns began featuring movie and stage star testimonials in 1927. One noteworthy
              campaign dates from 1953-1954 when Irving Penn photographed some of Hollywood's most
              famous stars. The Lever Brothers advertisements for both Lux products also include
              photographs of car cards (subway and bus posters) from the 1920s. Other Lever Products

            <p>Proofs and tearsheets. There are no advertisements present for the years 1945-1947 or
              1949. The vast majority of the advertisements are for Listerine Antiseptic, with other
              products represented beginning in the late 1960s. Listerine was manufactured by the
              Lambert Pharmacal Company beginning around 1915. William Warner acquired the company
              in 1955, merged it into his own pharmaceutical business and changed the name to the
              Warner-Lambert Co.</p>
            <p> This file is the only one in the J. Walter Thompson Company Domestic Advertisements
              Collection that includes the work of an agency other than JWT. Until 1962, Listerine
              advertising was handled by the Lambert and Feasley agency in New York, the house
              agency for the Lambert Pharmacal Co. (St. Louis), up to 1955 and for its successor,
              the Warner-Lambert Co. (Morris Plains, N.J.), from 1955-1962. When JWT obtained the
              Listerine account in October 1962, the back files of Listerine advertisements were
              transferred to JWT.</p>
