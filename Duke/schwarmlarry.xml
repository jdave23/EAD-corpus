         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Larry Schwarm studied photography and received his MFA and BFA in photography and
            sculpture from the University of Kansas in Lawrence. Recognizing the fascination that
            all human beings have with fire, he began photographing the annual midwestern prairie
            fires in the early 1990s and has continued with this work until 2015. Other recent
            bodies of work document the F-5 tornado that hit his hometown, Greensburg, Kansas, in
            2007; the lives of Kansas farmers, as part of the "Biofuels and Climate Change: Farmers'
            Land Use Decisions project," funded in part by the National Science Foundation; and life
            and society in Cuba, 2010. In 2013â€“2014, Schwarm was one of eighty artists featured in
            the exhibit "A Democracy of Images: Photographs from the Smithsonian American Art
            Museum." His works are held by many museums and galleries in the United States,
            including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art, the
            Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Library of Congress. He is currently Distinguished
            Professor of Photography at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas.</p>
