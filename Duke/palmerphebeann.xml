        January 3 and 1865 October 13) Phebe Ann Palmer wrote to unidentified recipients. Topics
        include the weather, health of family members, visitors and visiting, the local school
        teachers, the Clinton County Fair, the Civil War and its related deaths and sacrifices. She
        added at one point "I have told you all the gossip I know," and she writes at length about

      <p>Phebe Ann Palmer married Benjamin R. Palmer and the couple had nine children. They were
        Quakers. At the time these letters were written, the couple resided in Low Moor, Clinton
        Co., Iowa. They served as links in the local Underground Railroad, delivering escaped slaves
        to Clinton, Iowa, where they rowed across the Mississippi River. Mr. Palmer was elected to
        the General Assembly in 1866, where he read the first petition for woman's suffrage.</p>
