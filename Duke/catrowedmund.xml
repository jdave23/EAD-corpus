      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Collection primarily comprises a photograph album, entitled "The Occupation of Japan:
        Nagasaki, Isahaya, Kumamoto, Sasebo," Edmund J. Catrow maintained during his service in the
        marines from 1945-1946. There are 277 black-and-white photographs, mostly 3 1/4 x 4 1/2
        inches, plus five Japanese newspapers and several other clippings. Many of the photographs
        have handwritten captions in white ink. The photograph album begins with the embarkation of
        the 2nd Marine Division at Garapan Harbor in Saipan and continues with images of the convoy
        en route. Arriving in Nagasaki, Catrow found abandoned and destroyed Japanese ships and the
        skeletal remains of the Mitsubishi factory in the harbor. The photos from Nagasaki itself
        show the destruction of the atomic bomb, and document street scenes and some of the few
        remaining buildings, such as the train station. There are also several pictures of the
        Isahaya airfield, including a number of Japanese airplanes.</p>
      <p>After Nagasaki, Catrow moved to Kumamoto, where he was assigned to a Military Police
        company. His photos include pictures of Japanese soldiers still in uniform, numerous images
        of post-war life in Japan and military life at the barracks and in town for the American
        occupation forces, and well as a number shots of military duties and activities. During this
        time, Catrow apparently provided photos for the local newspaper, the Kumamoto Nichinichi
        Shimsun; five newspapers containing his work are tipped into the rear of this album, which
        also contains a picture of Catrow in front of the newspaper office. A translation of one of
        the articles states that, "Catro-San... keeps a sharp eye on the city as he patrols on his
        jeep, but he casts another 'cultural eye' on what happens around him." After a weekend leave
        at Mt. Aso, which is documented in twelve photographs, Catrow left Kumamoto for Sasebo,
        where he was due to embark for the United States. The images there concentrate on the harbor
        and several Japanese and American vessels. The rest of the album is devoted to the voyage
        home to San Diego, including an organized wrestling match and the celebration of Christmas
        aboard the ship. Catrow's arrival in California is well documented, and the final images of
        the album are at Camp Pendleton, where he stayed while awaiting his discharge. Laid-in at
        the back of the album were newspaper clippings and one magazine clipping, dating between
        1967 and 1972 and undated, on topics related to Saipan, all presumably added by Catrow.
