            <p>The Subject files document Sanford's role as President of Duke, and also his
              continued interest in many fields including education, politics, and the arts.</p>
            <p>The records of the Sanford administration record the policies and actions of the
              University in academic planning, athletics, campus planning and the physical growth of
              the university, development and alumni affairs, student life, and the University's
              interaction with Durham and North Carolina during the 1970s and 1980s. Among the more
              notable academic planning matters documented are the early years of both the Fuqua
              School of Business and the Institute of Policy Sciences and Public Affairs, now the
              Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy. Also included is correspondence from alumni,
              faculty, and students against the administration's proposal in 1975 to phase out the
              School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Correspondents in the area of academic
              planning include Joel Fleishman, Director of the Institute of Policy Sciences and
              Public Affairs; Thomas Keller, Dean of the Fuqua School of Business; and John C.
              McKinney, Dean of the Graduate School, and other officers.</p>
            <p>Folders pertaining to the <emph render="doublequote">Retrenchment</emph> measures
              taken in 1980-1981 that eliminated the undergraduate Department of Education and the
              baccalaureate program in Nursing are also part of this series. These steps were
              recommended to the Board of Trustees in September 1980 by then-Chancellor A. Kenneth
              Pye in his memorandum, <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Directions for
                Progress.</title> The bulk of the material consists of letters and memoranda from
              Sanford to faculty and alumni of the departments announcing the actions and
              correspondence from alumni, educators, and school administrators expressing their
              support of or opposition to the plan.</p>
            <p>Continuing the fundraising efforts that began with the Fifth Decade Campaign,
              1964-1970, <emph render="doublequote">Institutional Advancement</emph> files focus
              primarily on the Epoch Campaign, a three-year campaign that attempted to raise $162
              million from 1973-1976. The material concerns the progress of the Epoch Campaign and
              other fundraising efforts, such as the Loyalty Fund, 1979-1980.</p>
            <p>Sanford's commitment to the arts can be seen in the files on the <emph
                render="doublequote">American Musical Theater Center, 1977-1980</emph> and the <emph
                render="doublequote">American Dance Festival, 1977-1985.</emph> The recruitment and
              arrival of the Festival at Duke in 1977 began a long relationship that has continued
              for over 20 year.</p>
            <p>The records also document student life, but to a lesser extent than other topics.
              Issues related to student activism of the early 1970s are found within <emph
                render="doublequote">Student Unrest</emph> files. These records include clippings
              and a scrapbook documenting the student takeover the Allen Building in February 1969,
              before Sanford's presidency. Material from May 1970 largely concerns student actions
              on campus in response to the Kent State shootings. Letters of approval or disapproval
              from alumni and student parents on these and other topics are included as well. The
              records also document another aspect of student life that Sanford faced: the use of
              illegal drugs. In 1971 Sanford rejected a proposal from the Associated Students of
              Duke University calling for a relaxed stance by the administration on the use of
              drugs, particularly marijuana.</p>
            <p>Student conduct at athletic events is also documented. On January 17, 1984 <emph
                render="doublequote">Uncle Terry</emph> Sanford sent <emph render="doublequote">An
                Avuncular Letter</emph> to students chiding them for their inappropriate behavior
              during a home basketball game with the University of Maryland. The file contains the
              original letter, many newspaper articles detailing the behavior, letters to Sanford
              from concerned parents and alumni, and Sanford's response to each.</p>
            <p>The major change in residential life during Sanford's tenure was the 1972 merger of
              the Woman's College with Trinity College for Men to create the present Trinity College
              of Arts and Sciences. While the school had long been co-educational, the merger
              completed the switch to co-residency. Included are correspondence from alumni,
              administrators, and other institutions regarding the pros and cons of the merger.
              There is also some correspondence regarding the future of the Woman's College
              administrators.</p>
            <p>Sanford's interest in all levels of education is found throughout the files as well.
              During the 1960s and 1970s he served on the Board of Directors of the <emph
                render="doublequote">Learning Institute of North Carolina</emph> (LINC), a
              non-profit agency dedicated to improving education through experimentation and
              research. The LINC records, dating from 1965-1979, consist of correspondence, minutes,
              reports, and reference material.</p>
            <p>The records also illustrate how national and international issues played out on
              campus. Among these are investment policies in South Africa, in which students,
              faculty, and the administration began questioning Duke's support of U.S. businesses
              with investments in South Africa. Regarding the Panama Canal Treaty (1977-1978),
              Sanford attempted to put together a panel debate with Jesse Helms, Henry Kissinger,
              and others participating. Correspondence is included with these two, President Jimmy
              Carter, and others.</p>
            <p>Among the other major issues of the Sanford administration were the <emph
                render="doublequote">Nixon Library Controversy, 1981-1982,</emph> (3.5 boxes). These
              files concern the debate over whether Duke should house Richard Nixon's presidential
              library. Sanford argued in favor of the library as a valuable archival repository.
              Letters of support and disapproval from faculty, alumni, and other sources in and out
              of the University community are included. Correspondence dates from as early as
              1971.</p>
            <p>In 1981 Duke co-sponsored and Sanford a this public series of speeches and debates by
              a bipartisan group of political leaders concerned with reforming the process of
              nominating presidential candidates (<emph render="doublequote">Duke University Forum
                on Presidential Nominations</emph>). Co-sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson
              International Center, the first event was held on 11 May 1981 in Washington, D.C.
              Speakers and panelists included Robert Dole, Gerald Ford, Vernon E. Jordan, and Robert
              Strauss.</p>
            <p><emph render="doublequote">Soviet-American Track Meet</emph> files consist of
              correspondence, minutes of meetings, committee lists, schedules, and planning for the
              twelfth annual event held the first week in July 1974. Sanford's continued interests
              in politics are documented in files on the <emph render="doublequote">Democratic
                Party, 1970-1982.</emph> Correspondents include Senators John Glenn and Ted Kennedy.
              Sanford assisted in founding the <emph render="doublequote">Education Commission of
                the States</emph> in 1965/66. Headquartered in Denver, Col., the Commission provides
              research and advice to assist states and school systems in long-range planning and

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series consists of administrative records, along with some personal papers. The
            bulk of material runs from 1992-1997 and consists of computer disks, correspondence,
            faxes, journals, mailing lists, memoranda, photographs, speeches, transcripts, website
            printouts, writings, clippings and other printed matter. The files are organized into
            subject files, correspondence (1990-1998), and writings.</p>
          <p>The records also include files on organizations to which Sanford belonged or boards on
            which he served. Included among these: Methodist College, Fayetteville, N.C. (Trustee);
            North Carolina Museum of Art (chaired Board of Trustees); Ovation, Inc. - a Fine Arts
            Network (Board of Directors); and the Sarah W. Stedman Center for Nutritional Studies
            (Board of Advisors). Some files continue and supplement material found in other series:
            American Dance Festival; Education Commission of the States; and Outward Bound.</p>
          <p>Files are included on courses Sanford taught within the Public Policy Studies
            Department at Duke from 1993-1997, most notably a course titled "Creativity in State
            Government". Syllabi, handouts, lists of students, and some correspondence are included.
            These files contain student identifiable data, and are subject to federal privacy
            legislation.</p>
          <p>The records show Sanford's continued interest in and opinions on various issues,
            including political ones. Examples include the Nicaraguan Canal project, poverty, and
            racism. Within the Racism file is a 1997 memo from Sanford to John Hope Franklin,
            Professor Emeritus of History at Duke University and chair of President Clinton's
            National Advisory Panel on Race, outlining his plans to begin an association to help
            promote improved race relations. Sanford mentioned <emph render="doublequote">National
              Good Neighbor Council</emph> as a possible title.</p>
          <p>Sanford's day-to-day activities during the 1990s are documented throughout these files.
            Folders labeled <emph render="doublequote">Journal</emph> contain loose-leaf paper with
            daily appointments and schedules detailing meetings, dinners, travel plans, and leisure
            activities. Often, Sanford would write notes on the particular meeting/event (wrote
            before and/or after). In 1993 Sanford kept a bound journal for a week in February. Other
            files documenting Sanford's daily activities include folders of telephone messages and
            two rolodexes of addresses and business cards.</p>
          <p>Other significant records include Sanford's Cyber Bookstore project. This was intended
            to create a means of purchasing publications over the World Wide Web similar to the
            Amazon.com. There are also reports, drafts, and proposals from the Ethics Review
            Commission of the United States Senate, 1993-1994, and files on his support for the
            Airborne and Special Operations Museum project in Fayetteville, N.C.</p>
          <p>Correspondents include President Bill Clinton, to whom Sanford voiced his opinion or
            expressed his support; and Howard Covington, Sanford's biographer. Sanford sent
            Covington thoughts or remembrances that he felt should be included in the biography, or
            he would write in response to Covington's questions. Among the recollections include a
            detailed account of Sanford's decision to endorse John F. Kennedy's presidential
            campaign.</p>
          <p>Two of the three boxes of writings consist of hand-written and typed drafts, research
            notes, a synopsis, and bibliographical material for Sanford's unfinished historical
            novel, Top of the World. Sanford worked on the novel from 1994-1998 and drafts of the
            first six chapters at the time of his death are included. According to an article in the
            Raleigh News and Observer (Jan. 10, 1994, p.3-A), Sanford did not think it would be
            completed until the 21st century. The third box contains drafts, notes, and additional
            material on three Sanford manuscripts. They include the unfinished works <title
              type="simple" render="doublequote">The Lasting Lyndon</title> (1991) on the Lyndon B.
            Johnson administration, and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Out of the
              Valley,</title> (1975), surveying public policies; Sanford referred to the latter work
            as "an autobiographical political platform". The file also includes the manuscript of
            Outlive Your Enemies: (Commack, N.Y.: Nova Sciences Publishers, 1996), Sanford's study
            on aging and growing old gracefully.</p>
          <p>A final box labeled <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Miscellaneous</title>
            contains primarily Democratic Party-related material from the 1980s and a note to
            incorporate them into the records.</p>

          <p>The personal and political papers of Terry Sanford consist of correspondence,
            memoranda, manuscripts, newspaper clippings, reference material, printed matter,
            audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and a scrapbook that document his personal
            and public life. Also present are correspondence, memoranda, clippings, speeches,
            statements, drafts, press releases, and printed matter documenting Terry Sanford's
            campaigns for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972 and 1976, including a
            large set of film recordings used for the 1972 campaign created by Drew Associates.
            Records documenting Sanford's study of the future role of state governments in society
            and in the federal system are present as is material concerning the Legislative Library
            Project. Sanford's work with the Democratic Charter Commission is also included.</p>

            <p>The personal and political papers of Terry Sanford consist of correspondence,
              memoranda, manuscripts, newspaper clippings, reference material, printed matter,
              audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and a scrapbook. The bulk were acquired
              from Sanford's house in Durham, N.C., and he apparently kept them close by for
              reference purposes for much of his career. Some folders appear to have been removed
              from his records as Duke President.</p>
            <p>The papers primarily contain the files of organizations to which Sanford belonged or
              boards on which he served. These included the Foreign Study League (advisory council);
              Citizens Committee for Government Reorganization (co-chairman); the National Council
              on Crime and Delinquency (chaired N.C. Committee); the National Municipal
              League/Citizens' Forum on Self Government (multiple offices including President); the
              National Public Affairs Center for Television (Board of Directors); the National
              Recreation and Park Association; National Urban League; Outward Bound; Shaw University
              (Trustee); the Soul City project; Southern Regional Growth Board; Robert Taft
              Institute of Government (Trustee); Children's Television Workshop; and Urban America,
              Inc. (Trustee).</p>
            <p>Also included are records from Sanford's political career and interests. Among these
              are records from his tenure as N.C. Governor, including files on race relations,
              reports, and correspondence; the 1960 Gubernatorial campaign; speeches and drafts;
              clippings and printed material; surveys of political climate and polls; the 1954
              Senatorial Campaign (campaign manager for W. Kerr Scott); his support of Fritz
              Hollings' 1983-1984 Presidential Nomination; and correspondence with the N.C. Young
              Democrats, 1965-1968. Of particular note is a 1977 confidential memo that Sanford
              typed for his records recounting President Carter's request that Sanford accept the
              position of Ambassador to France. Other correspondents include Lyndon B. Johnson and
              John F. Kennedy.</p>

            <p>This series contains the original film and sound recordings created by Drew
              Associates, a documentary film company, for campaign advertisements for Terry
              Sanford's 1972 Presidential campaign. Some notes on the exact format, contents, and
              codes to match motion picture and sound are included. Recordings include original raw
              footage as well as edited versions. The series also includes two videos created by
              Ralph Johnson Associates.</p>
            <p>The majority of the reels in this series were re-wound onto new reel cores for
              preservation during processing in 2017; labelings and marking have been recorded as
              the item's title but no attempt at arranging or matching picture to sound or varying
              versions has yet been made.</p>

            <p>Correspondence, memoranda, clippings, film, speeches, statements, drafts, press
              releases, and printed matter documenting Terry Sanford's campaigns for the Democratic
              nomination for President in 1976. Records contain files documenting the campaign in
              individual states, including detailed county-bycounty files for North Carolina, and
              within these files are updates on the campaign, letters of support, suggestions by

              announcement to begin the campaign and his withdrawal in January 1976, as well as
              files related to Citizen Assmelbies, grass-roots support organizations for Sanford's

            <p>Duke University sponsored a grant from the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford
              Foundation for a study of the future role of state governments in society and in the
              federal system (1965-1967). Terry Sanford directed this project. Out of his research
              came his book, Storm over the States (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967), which concerns the
              individual citizen's active involvement in government.</p>

            <p>Correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports, printed matter and other material
              concerning the Legislative Library Project of Legis 50 / The Center for Legislative
              Improvement.</p>
            <p>Formed in 1966 as the Citizens Conference on State Legislatures, the organization
              examined state legislatures and prepared strategies to enhance their effectiveness.
              Terry Sanford served on the Board of Trustees in the late 1960s and later as an
              honorary Board member. Initiated in 1976, the Library Project attempted to develop a
              series of publications addressing the history and operation of American State
              governments in order to raise public interest in legislative reform. Sanford chaired
              the project committee and was named editor-in-chief of the series. Originally, Duke
              University Press was to play a major role in the publication. The Library Project
              struggled to get off the ground due to a number of factors including decisions on
              authors and publication, and financial concerns. The project folded in 1980 as Legis
              50 filed for bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>Earlier material in these records, 1966-1975, consists of correspondence, memoranda,
              agendas, minutes, and annual reports while Sanford served on the Board of Trustees.
              Material from 1976-1980 concerns the Library Project and includes grant proposals and

            <p>Correspondence, memoranda, minutes, drafts, proposals, printed matter,
              questionnaires, financial material, films, audiocassettes, and audiotapes concerning
              the Democratic Charter Commission, which Terry Sanford chaired. The Commission was
              established by the 1972 Democratic Convention to draft a charter for the Democratic
              Party, the first in the party's history. The Charter established national structures
              and guidelines for the party on issues such as leadership, membership, and education.
              It was approved during the midterm convention of December 1974 and went into effect in
              1980.</p>
            <p>The records, though largely unorganized, document Sanford and the Commission's
              efforts from 1972-1974. Includes folders on individual states, which often contain
              lists of delegates and material on individual state conferences or hearings (including
              agendas, discussions, and summaries of proceedings) held to discuss the proposed
              Charter. Sanford usually attended these state conferences and delivered the opening
              and/or closing remarks. Other material consists of Commission member lists,
              questionnaires on party structure and charter proposals, and Commission-related
              newspaper clippings. The correspondence is not foldered together, but spread
              throughout the records. Correspondents include President Jimmy Carter, then Governor
              of Georgia; Robert Strauss, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee; members of
              the Commission; and Democratic members of Congress.</p>
            <p>Included among the approximately 20 original reel to reel films and audiotapes and 20
              audiocassettes are session recordings from Commission conferences (in Colorado,
              Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington D.C., and Wisconsin); and
              interviews with members of the Commission for a proposed public relations project in
              1974 (not completed). Most films and cassettes are labeled and in fair condition.</p>

          <p>The photographs and negatives span Sanford's career. Photographs are arranged and
            foldered by subject, though some subjects are vague (<emph render="doublequote"
              >people</emph> and <emph render="doublequote">political</emph> for example). Others
            include: Duke University Activities, Functions; 1972 Presidential Campaign; FBI;
            Gubernatorial Years; and University of North Carolina Law School. Among the individuals:
            Jimmy Carter, Andy Griffith, J. Edgar Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Soviet
            Premier Kosygin, Carl Sandburg, Strom Thurmond, Harry S. Truman, John Wayne, and
            Sanford's family and friends. For additional photographs see the general photograph
            collection in the Duke University Archives.</p>
          <p>The printed matter includes newspaper articles written during his tenure as President
            of Duke University. A majority of the articles are from the Durham newspapers and the
            Duke student newspaper, The Chronicle. The articles are poorly organized, though hint at
            a chronological arrangement. The document box contains ready reference files, again
            focusing primarily on his tenure at Duke. This includes copies of speeches, clippings on
            his inauguration, and programs for a tribute ceremony to Sanford in 1985. Other files
            include the Democratic Charter Commission, U.S. Senate, and other political
            clippings.</p>
          <p>Could only find one box of photographic materials in January 2007. </p>
