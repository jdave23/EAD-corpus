    <head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Nell Irvin Painter Papers span the years 1793-2021, with the bulk of the material dating between 1876 and 2007, and are primarily composed of the extensive correspondence, writing, research, teaching materials, and other professional papers that Painter has produced in her long career as a scholar, teacher, and writer in 19th- and 20th-century American and African American history. The materials document the breadth and depth of Painter's interests and her intellectual and personal influence on a generation of historians. Her varied roles as student, teacher, colleague, and mentor are recorded in a wide variety of formats: correspondence with colleagues, students, family, and friends; syllabi, department memoranda, and meeting minutes from her graduate and faculty positions at Harvard, Princeton, and the Universities of North Carolina and Pennsylvania; materials from many professional organizations in the fields of African American history, Southern history, American studies, and women's studies; and records of her speaking engagements, conferences, and meetings. Painter the historian and author are revealed in the extensive notes, photocopies, recordings, photographs, manuscripts, and proofs produced in writing many articles and five of her major books: <title type="simple" render="italic">Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas after Reconstruction</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919</title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol</title>; and <title type="simple" render="italic">Creating Black Americans: African-American History and its Meanings, 1619 to the Present.</title> The portrait is rounded out by the materials in other series: personal files, which include materials from her student years at Harvard and abroad in Ghana and France as well as personal journals; a few papers of Ghanaian writer Ayi Kwei Armah; photographs, including many historical photographs of African Americans as well as many personal snapshots in color and black-and-white; and other non-print media such as audiotapes, audiocassettes, videocassettes, and computer diskettes.</p><p>Painter's research files contain a wealth of information about many topics in American history: biography of African Americans; biography as a literary form; slavery; Reconstruction; the 1870s migration from the South to Kansas; a variety of social reform movements--such as abolition, communism, labor, and women's suffrage--and movers, such as Sojourner Truth and Hosea Hudson; and the history of social conditions and political change in the United States from the early-19th to the mid-20th century, particularly as expressed in race relations, in women's history, and in the South. At the same time, Painter's papers also constitute a contemporary record of many trends in American culture such as career and educational choices and opportunities for academic women and African American professionals. Her correspondence with students, colleagues, and longtime friends such as Nellie Y. McKay, her teaching material and academic files, her papers from an array of historians' organizations, and her personal journals each shed their own light on these themes. </p><p>The collection is arranged in these series: <emph render="bold">Correspondence, Writings and Research, Teaching Materials, Professional Service, Personal Files, Photographic Materials, Audiovisual Materials,</emph><emph render="bold">Electronic Formats,</emph> and a collection of private papers collected by Painter, the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah Papers.</emph> The first four series comprise almost eighty percent of the physical extent of the collection and are each divided into several subseries. The <emph render="bold">Correspondence Series</emph> follows Painter's personal life, education, and professional career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s through her retirement from Princeton in 2004. </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Research Series</emph> is arranged in seven subseries, the first five of which are based on five of Painter's major books; the final two subseries are <emph render="bold">Other Research Topics,</emph> which gathers many of Painter's shorter writings, and <emph render="bold">Writings by Others.</emph> With the exception of the last, all the subseries here contain correspondence with colleagues and editors; typescript drafts of works; various stages of proof; extensive photocopies of archival materials and published articles; voluminous notes about her readings and research; and some photographs and recordings, most of which have been removed to their respective series for preservation. </p><p>The <emph render="bold">Teaching Materials Series</emph> documents Painter's work with students and academic colleagues at Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of North Carolina, Hunter College, and Princeton University. It is arranged into two series: <emph render="bold">Courses Subseries</emph>, with syllabi, reading lists, and Painter's notes on the development of her courses that reflect the evolution of women's studies and African American studies in the curriculum; and the <emph render="bold">Academic Files Subseries</emph>, revealing Painter's many different roles over three decades: graduate student, job applicant, junior and tenured faculty member, dissertation advisor, mentor, and department head.</p><p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Service Series,</emph> arranged in two subseries, documents Painter's activities in the broader academic community beyond her university of employment and her personal connections through materials from well over one hundred professional organizations, conferences, foundations, committees and task forces, as well as editorial boards of journals and publishers with which Painter has worked during her career. The <emph render="bold">Engagements Subseries</emph> gathers documents relating to addresses, speeches, and awards ceremonies at some three hundred conferences, meetings, and symposia.</p><p>Five smaller series and a gathering of oversize material round out the collection. The <emph render="bold">Personal Files Series </emph> contains an assortment of records such as curriculum vitae; documents about her family; and some records of her student years, especially her travel and study in France and Africa. The series includes some three dozen personal journals covering most of the years from 1959-2005 containing entries about her life and career (NOTE: some journals are CLOSED to use; see details in the series note). The <emph render="bold">Photographic Materials Series</emph> contains several hundred photographs, negatives, and slides, predominantly personal and travel snapshots but also including professional portraits of Painter as well as a number of original photographs and reproductions of archival photographs she used in her research and writing. Much of the material in the early years of the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials Series</emph> is related to her research and writing; by the 1990s, the content shifts focus to documenting Painter herself on the occasion of various interviews and addresses. The <emph render="bold">Electronic Formats Series</emph> consists of diskettes containing correspondence and drafts of writings. The <emph render="bold">Oversize Materials</emph> contains items from several series and subseries are gathered. The final series in the collection consists not of Painter's own work but that of a Ghanaian novelist and poet; see the <emph render="bold">Ayi Kwei Armah Papers (RESTRICTED)</emph> series note for further information on the provenance and usage of these materials.</p><p>Unprocessed additions to the collection are listed at the end of the collection guide.</p><p><emph render="bold">Note about date range of materials:</emph> The primary material produced by Painter begins around 1959 with her earliest journals. Earlier dates in various series, occurring mainly in Writings and Research, reflect the intellectual content and original publication of the large volume of reproduced research material present in the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

Documents Painter's personal life, education, and career from her graduate years at Harvard in the late 1960s up through her retirement from Princeton in 2004. Major figures who corresponded with Painter include African-American novelist Toni Morrison; professors of English Houston A. Baker, Jr., Werner Sollors, and Nellie Y. McKay; and historians Darlene Clark Hine and William L. Andrews. Theirs and others' correspondence may appear in either the Chronological Subseries or Alphabetical Subseries. Professional correspondence also includes some letters related to editorial matters, organizations such as the National Endowment for the Humanities, and such publishers as Heinneman of the African Writer's Series. Arranged in four subseries: the <emph render="bold">Chronological, </emph><emph render="bold">Alphabetical, </emph><emph render="bold">Student/Candidate Files, </emph> and <emph render="bold">Nellie Y. McKay (CLOSED).</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">Materials Retrieval Note:</emph> In addition to the material gathered in this series, Painter's extensive correspondence can be found in many other places in the collection. This is particularly true of the Writings and Research Series and the Professional Service Series. In the case of the former, each of the five subseries for Painter's major books contains a Correspondence subgroup within it related to research and publication of the book, and correspondence also appears in various folders throughout the other two subseries. In the Professional Service Series, correspondence appears in both subseries--Organizations and Engagements--though more substantially in the former. Thus in order to be sure of seeing all correspondence that might relate to a particular book, for example, patrons should retrieve not only the correspondence from that book's subseries in the Writings and Research Series, but also any boxes in the Correspondence Series that originate from any applicable time spans or persons in the Chronological and Alphabetical subseries, respectively.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_d213441762d7712650570c663bf668b6"><head>Processing Information note</head><p><emph render="bold">Processing Note:</emph> Letters often include attachments, such as photographs, articles, newspaper clippings, and booklets related to Painter's research or academia in general, and abstracts and drafts of dissertation chapters from students.

Where possible, Painter's own system of labeling has been retained, which accounts for some overlap in dates across folders. Materials from the mid to late 1990s and early 2000 often have been divided into the categories <title type="simple" render="doublequote">professional,</title><title type="simple" render="doublequote">business,</title> and <title type="simple" render="doublequote">personal</title> as Painter saw fit, and the folders containing these materials have been so labeled along with the year and, at times, month. Printed electronic correspondence was largely separated by Painter from traditionally-formatted letters when it first began to appear in the mid-1990s and has been retained in her folders; after a few years, however, she began to treat e-mail as any other correspondence and by 2002 was interfiling items regardless of how they originated. </p><p><emph render="bold">Processing and retrieval note for 2008 and 2010 accessions:</emph> There have been two substantial expansions of this subseries since the collection was originally processed in 2006. Materials from Accession 2008-0016 were integrated into the subseries chronologically but not physically, meaning that newer box numbers will sometimes appear out of strict numerical sequence. Materials from Accession 2010-0116 were processed minimally, and can be found appended at the end of this inventory. Researchers are advised to examine all these points when seeking to retrieve all correspondence from a particular period of time, especially materials dated 1997 or later.</p></scopecontent><c03

McKay, who met in 1969 when both were first-year graduate students at Harvard (Painter in history, McKay in English). McKay went on to become a professor of American and African-American Literature and published important works on Toni Morrison and Jean Toomer among other writers. She spent most of her career at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Bulk of subseries consists of correspondence from McKay, but several years into the sequence many copies of Painter's letters begin to appear, too. Letters cover the personal and professional lives of both women, enriched by a variety of attachments, including drafts of writings, newspaper clippings about their careers and current events, promotional materials, snapshots, and sometimes copies of correspondence with third parties. Arranged chronologically, although researchers should note that Painter's original labeling on the folders is not always complete. Often the correspondence inside the folders covers a longer span of months than she indicated; this has been amended in pencil, but items were not shifted between or within folders, so contiguous folders should be examined for particular weeks or months.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_f510e190d945a345a7222aa89d48e492"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p>[CLOSED: Items in the Nellie Y.

Contains significant amounts of correspondence with publishers, sources, and colleagues; articles and talks sent by colleagues; and copious notes and numerous photocopies of primary sources, including newspapers and government records. There are also many drafts of Painter's talks and writings, including manuscripts, typescripts, and printer's proofs.</p><p>Arranged in eight subseries, the first six of which are based on five of Painter's major books: <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction</emph> </title> (1976); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">The Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South </emph> </title> (1979); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol </emph> </title> (1996); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Standing at Armageddon: The United States, 1877-1919 </emph> </title> (1987); <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">Creating Black Americans: African American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present </emph> </title> (2005); and <title type="simple" render="italic"><emph render="bold">The History of White People</emph> </title> (2010). Each subseries is further divided into three subgroups, Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials; see specific subseries notes for further detail about the arrangement and content of these categories for each book. Materials unrelated to these five books--or whose relationship to them could not be established--have been placed in one of the final two subseries, <emph render="bold">Other Research Topics</emph> or <emph render="bold">Writings by Others.</emph> Note that while all the subseries contain writings by other authors, the main criterion for placing materials in Writings by Others is that the folder contains only such writing. If a folder contains Painter's notes and commentary in addition to writings by other authors or contains works by multiple authors that Painter gathered under a topical heading, then they are placed in one of the first five subseries or in Other Research Topics. This subseries, the largest in the Writings and Research Series, is further divided into subgroups by topic; see its subseries note for further details on its arrangement.</p><p>Several types of documents that appear in this series are supported by related material in other series. Three are of particular note: correspondence, addresses, and writing by other authors. Much correspondence appears in various subseries in Writings and Research, and it addresses many of the same topics broached in the Correspondence Series; it can be searched alphabetically or chronologically according to the arrangement of the particular subseries. Drafts of Painter's addresses and articles have generally been placed in the Writings and Research Series--especially in the Other Research Topics Subseries--if the folders consist mainly of substantive drafts of the work or research on it; but other versions may also appear in the Engagements Subseries of the Professional Service Series. Finally, a substantial amount of writing by other authors, especially when those authors were current or former students or advisees of Painter's, appears in two other series. Most such material appears as attachments to letters in the Student/Candidate Files Subseries of the Correspondence Series; a smaller amount, in the form of drafts unattached to correspondence, appears at the end of the Teaching Materials Series, Academic Files Subseries.</p><p>As mentioned in the Collection Overview, the dating of folder titles is of particular note in this series due to the large volume of photocopies and microform printouts of archival and historical material. If the folder contains Painter's notes or quotations from a primary source, the date corresponds to the time Painter worked on the subject. If the folder contains an original source or photocopy of one (almost always the latter), the date corresponds to when the intellectual content was originally produced or published.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_2a939883e4e7fb39aab18418932486a6"><head>Processing Information note</head><p><emph render="bold">Processing Note:</emph> Materials in this series containing mold have been remediated, replaced in the collection, and so identified on the folder and in the box list.

Correspondence also includes book reviews. The Drafts subgroup consists of typescripts and printer's proofs. Related writings and speeches by Painter are organized with the research materials. The materials in the Correspondence and Research Materials subgroups are arranged alphabetically, while those in the Drafts subgroup are arranged chronologically. Because they lack precise date information, three typescripts and three printer's proofs have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not reflect any chronological ordering among those documents. In the Research Materials subgroup, articles by Painter are indicated by (NIP); writings by others are listed alphabetically by last name. The designations "(d)" and "(w)" she occasionally places after the names of certain newspapers indicate whether it was a daily or weekly publication, respectively.</p></scopecontent><c03

Other items of note in the subgroup include readers' reports and Painter's replies to them and a letter of consignment for the Hudson interview tapes, which Painter donated to the Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where they are housed in the Southern Historical Collection. </p><p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of materials used in verifying and annotating the text.

The majority of the drafts are of the first three chapters, but a few copies of chapters four and five are also included. These items have been organized chronologically.</p><p>The Research Materials subgroup largely consists of notes, articles, and photocopies of book chapters and letters. There are also a number of talks and articles by Painter in relation to <emph render="italic">Sojourner Truth</emph>. In particular, there are several folders with materials relating to the chapter <title type="simple" render="doublequote">Difference, Slavery, and Memory: Sojourner Truth in Feminist Abolitionism,</title> which appeared in Jean Fagan Yellin and John C.

At the time the materials in the collection were prepared, the chapter was known only by its subtitle and the book was called <emph render="italic">An Untrodden Path</emph>. Also of interest is an article by Richard Powell, which is related to a chapter in <title type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth</title> on photography and representations of Truth. Other materials relevant to this topic, particularly cartes de visite, are found in the Writings by Others Subseries and the Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries.

Divided into Correspondence, Drafts, and Research Materials subgroups.</p><p>Compared to other subseries, the <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> Subseries contains relatively little correspondence. The existing materials are largely publication-related. The correspondence with the Henry George School of Social Science includes a lesson plan and quiz questions on <emph render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</emph>. Related correspondence perhaps may be found in the Correspondence Series. The Drafts subgroup includes a manuscript, several typescripts, and two master proofs. The Research subgroup materials include photocopies of scholarly articles, newspaper articles, and Congressional records, as well as extensive notes from those materials and books. The subgroup also includes talks, reviews, and articles by Painter. </p><p> In addition to materials directly about the book, all materials in the Writings and Research Series involving the issues of labor, gender, and race, as they relate to the economic and political conditions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, have been incorporated into the <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> Subseries. The subseries also includes materials on the South that are relevant to the period addressed by <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title>.</p><p>The correspondence and research materials are arranged alphabetically, while the drafts are arranged chronologically. Talks or articles by Painter have generally been identified by <emph render="doublequote">(NIP)</emph> following the work's title. As three typescripts of <title type="simple" render="italic">Standing at Armageddon</title> lack any date information, they have been labeled A to C. This labeling does not reflect any chronological ordering among those typescripts. In addition, inasmuch as their dating is uncertain, those typescripts have been placed after the other typescripts in the subseries.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref1507_oe7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><container id="aspace_7bd56122c96f8d657f8f7274c5f10007" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">114</container></did><c04 id="aspace_ref1508_jta" level="file"><did><unittitle>Borland, Bruce: Harper Collins, 1995</unittitle><container id="aspace_5f8047858caef68dcca56e87bc162d66" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">114</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1509_251" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry George School of Social Science, 1997</unittitle><container id="aspace_3ce951ec7c1915ecde2d12735fe227f5" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">114</container></did></c04><c04 id="aspace_ref1510_2ks" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kehoe, Bob (W.W.

Although Painter probably used these materials for her own research, they have been placed in the Writings by Others Subseries because they were unrelated to, or could not be particularly identified with, any of her major books. Moreover, they have not been included among the materials in the Other Research Topics Subseries, although they frequently include notes or marginalia by Painter, because Painter organized these materials in such a way that the work in each folder is primarily the work of a single author other than herself. Correspondence, including notes from those sending materials to Painter, can be found in some folders, and related material from some authors may also be found in the Correspondence Series.</p><p>Significant topics covered in the subseries include feminism, photography, and the history of photography. Other materials on photography are found in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Sojourner Truth</title> Subseries and the Photography subgroup of the Other Research Topics Subseries. Of interest is a work by Painter's mother, Dona Irvin, about the members of Downs Memorial United Methodist Church. The work focuses on the lives of middle-class African-Americans rather than prominent figures or the underprivileged.

correspondence and memoranda, meeting minutes, university and department forms and invoices, printed materials, files on students for whom Painter served as advisor or committee member, student writings, and other materials. Arranged alphabetically by institution (Harvard, Princeton, University of North Carolina, University of Pennsylvania, and Wellesley College), then chronologically within those groups. At the end of the series are several folder groups that span Painter's years in various positions, arranged alphabetically by topic. The largest of these are Applications and Job Searches, containing correspondence and other documents relating to various positions and fellowships she sought at different times; and Student Writings, containing various papers, theses, and dissertations written by Painter's students. Note that student files gathered here are mainly writings that were found unattached to correspondence and represent only a fraction of such material; the bulk of her extensive correspondence with her students, including discussion and copies of their research and writing, is in the Correspondence Series.</p></scopecontent><c03 id="aspace_ref2767_bnx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Harvard

Materials include copies of her curricula vitae through the years; awards and honors; biographical citations about her from various reference works; clippings; appointment calendars and telephone logs; information about a number of family members, especially her parents; class notes and other documents from her student years abroad in Ghana and France; and over three dozen of her personal journals. By far, the journals are the most substantive item in the series in both richness and quantity of information. In more than five thousand manuscript pages Painter records details of her personal and professional life and her thoughts about her writing for almost thirty years, up to 1989; there then follows a gap of nine years before the journals resume in 1998, though in considerably less detail. Arranged alphabetically by category in the following folder groups: Biographical, Calendars and Contacts, Family and Friends, Journals, Student Years, and Other Personal Papers. Folders are then arranged chronologically in those categories with the exception of the alphabetical arrangements of Family and Friends and Other Personal Papers.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict

After the late 1970s there are also a number of formal portraits and publicity photographs of Painter (noted as "NIP").
