      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Family, personal, and business papers of three generations of the Munford and the Ellis
        families of Virginia, connected by the marriage of George Wythe Munford and Elizabeth
        Throwgood Ellis in 1838. The papers contain information on politics, literary efforts,
        social life and customs, economic conditions, and military questions principally in
        nineteenth century Virginia. </p>
      <p>Letters and papers of the Munford family center around William Munford (1775-1825) of the
        first generation, George Wythe Munford (1803-1882) of the second generation, and the
        children of George Wythe Munford, notably Thomas Taylor Munford (1831-1918), Sallie Radford
        (Munford) Talbott (1841-1930), Lucy Munford and Fannie Ellis Munford. </p>
      <p>The letters of William Munford (1775-1825) are concerned with some details relative to the
        management of his plantation in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, by an overseer, his legal
        practice in the early 1800s in southside Virginia, accounts of his election to the
        governor's council in 1805, and political questions confronting the council. The collection
        also contains letters concerning possible publication by Thomas Willis White of a novel
        written by Ursula Anna (Munford) Byrd, sister of William Munford. Letters of friends and
        relatives and members of the first generation of Munfords are also included. </p>
      <p>Volumes are an account book, 1799-1873, and a miscellany, 1790-1814, containing poems of
        William Munford, a list of the books in his library, and a list of subscribers to the
        Munford and William W. Hening Reports of Cases argued and determined in the Supreme court of
        appeals of Virginia. Chief of the literary works are two poems, "The Richmond Cavalcade"
        (1798), and its sequel, "The Richmond Feast" (1799), in Hudibrastic verse aimed at the
        political maneuvers of the Federalists. Also included are original poems by John Blair,
        Thomas Bolling Robertson, Anna (Munford) Byrd, St. George Tucker, and Mrs. John Page of
        Rosewell concerning social matters; and other poems by Munford, some of which were later
        published in the <title type="simple" render="italic">Richmond Enquirer</title>.</p>
      <p>George Wythe Munford (1803-1882), named for the mentor of his father, was clerk of the
        Virginia House of Delegates, an office which he held until the end of the Civil War, when he
        attempted farming until forced by reverses to secure a clerkship in the U.S. Census Bureau.

        code of laws, 1873; the Readjuster Movement, which resulted in his removal from office as a

        merchant and partner of John Allan, who was the foster father of Edgar Allan Poe, and of his
        brother, Powhatan Ellis (1790-1863), jurist, U.S. senator, and diplomat. Letters of Charles
        Ellis concern business affairs and personal matters, the latter consisting largely of
        admonitions to his son, James, while a student at the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New
        York, and of letters written from the springs of western Virginia. Letters of Margaret
        (Nimmo) Ellis (1790-1877), wife of Charles Ellis, Sr., are numerous from 1840 to her death
        and, although generally concerned with family affairs, also contain accounts of war

        Ellis, merchant and businessman, relate to his education at the University of Virginia,

        included. Letters of James Ellis (1815-1839) in general were written from the U.S. Military
        Academy. One contains a reference at the time of the death of John Allan, Poe's foster
        father, stating that Allan had not "spent his time in a proper way" and making some
        reference to Allan's second wife, which has been thoroughly obliterated. Charles Ellis, Jr.
        (1817-189-), left many business and personal letters, the latter consisting largely of
        family letters and accounts of numerous visits to the springs in western Virginia,
        especially Warm Springs in Bath County, with minute descriptions of activities, guests, his
        ailments, and the young ladies whom he escorted during his long life and many sojourns at
        Warm Springs. Other correspondence concerns the education of James West Pegram at Clifton
        Academy, in Amelia County, Virginia, 1855-1856; John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, 1859;
