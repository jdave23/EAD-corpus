         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>The Friends of Duke Chapel was founded in 1974 to provide the means for interested
            persons to organize into an ongoing, supportive, participatory group to support the
            ministry and program of Duke Chapel. The Friends open membership to anyone interested in
            the Chapel and its program. It grew out of a predecessor group called the Full
            Membership Chapel Group, organized under and continuing the name of Duke University
            Church (Interdenominational). Full Members supported the Chapel program but membership
            was limited to persons affiliated with the University either as faculty or staff. As
            part of its mission, the Friends of Duke Chapel provide funds to aid numerous aspects of
            the Chapel program such as the chapel choir, organ, vestments, renovation needs, and
            provision of televised services. Membership benefits included weekly mailing of the
            Sunday bulletin, announcements and invitations to services, concerts, and music
            programs, as well as a Friends of Duke Chapel newsletter. </p>
         <p> The Friends have continuously helped fund and contribute to numerous initiatives and
            renovations of the Chapel, including the construction of a handicapped ramp access to
            the Chapel, installation of the Flentrop organ, and providing televised access to the
            Sunday services for patients at Duke Medical Center. They also contributed to enriching
            the preaching and theologian-in-residence programs. </p>
         <p> An Advisory Board governs the group. Originally a nine-person board, it was enlarged to
            a thirteen person board in 1981, always including the Dean of the Chapel. Past board
            members include William Stokes, Helen Crotwell, Jack Blackburn, Arthur Kale, William
            King, Ella Jean Shore, Carolyn Penny, and Mary Parkerson, who became the first Friends
            Director in 1980. </p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>These records were produced by the Friends of Duke Chapel in the course of their
            activities as a support organization for the program of Duke Chapel. Materials are
            present from 1973 to 1999. The bulk of the records consists of correspondence, official
            letters to members, advisory board and committee minutes and reports, newsletters, and
            other organization publications. There is some material not directly produced by the
            Friends of Duke Chapel but mentions the organization in its publications, or deals with
            the history of Duke Chapel.</p>

               <p>This series includes material relating to the function of the Friends of Duke
                  Chapel. It is arranged alphabetically. Material includes by-laws and resolutions,
                  a description and background statement regarding the mission of the Friends group,
                  membership lists, and news clippings relating to the history of Duke Chapel. In
                  addition, there are records from the organizing committee relating to the founding
                  of the group and the definition of its mission. Of particular interest in this
                  series are the oral history transcriptions of interviews conducted by Arthur Kale
                  of Barney L. Jones, James T. Cleland, Howard Wilkinson, and Robert DuBose. The
                  transcriptions are a rich source of historical information on the staff and
                  history of the Chapel and its program. The interviews provide personal
                  reminiscences of chapel history and staff, including Foster Barnes, Mildred
                  Hendrix, Frank Hickman, Ben Smith, and the carillonneurs. They discuss their
                  relationships with numerous campus organizations, athletics, the inter-racial
                  council, and the role of the administrative committee. The men remember visits and
                  sermons by guest preachers such as Ralph Sockman, Martin Niemoller, Henry Crane,
                  and Paul Tillich. They also recall chapel events throughout the calendar year
                  including Religious Emphasis week, the Christmas pageant, and Easter services. </p>
               <p>Other significant materials are several speeches, by Bishop W. Kenneth Goodson,
                  Mary D. B. T. Semans, and Marjorie C. Jones respectively, given during the Friends
                  annual dinner meeting. Bishop Goodson, former Bishop-in-Residence of the Divinity
                  School and trustee emeritus of the Duke Endowment, fondly remembers his
                  relationship to Duke Chapel. Mary D. B. T. Semans speech recalls her mother Sarah
                  P. Duke's feelings for the Chapel, and includes her memories of numerous Chapel
                  ministers and music staff. Marjorie Jones gives insight into the role of chapel
                  hostesses and the life of the chapel during the week. [See also: Barney L. Jones
                  Papers for "Chapel Reminiscences: The First Two Decades," a speech given to the
                  Friends of Duke Chapel Annual Dinner, 1983.]</p>
