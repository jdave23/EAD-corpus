            native who graduated from Southern University, Baton Rouge, and from Yale Divinity
            School. He is an ordained minister and is currently Professor of the Practice of Public

            University. He is also responsible for launching the U.S. - Southern Africa Center for
            Leadership and Public Values. Joseph has worked for four U.S. presidents, beginning as
            Interior undersecretary for President Carter from 1977-1981. He has also served on the
            Advisory Committee to the Agency on International Development under President Reagan,
            and was appointed by President Bush to the Presidential Commission on Historically Black
            Colleges. In 1996, he was appointed as Ambassador to South Africa by President Clinton,

            Council on Foundations, largely dating from the late 1980s, and some awards and honors
            dating from the early 2000s. Some newspaper clippings dating from the 1960s discuss his
            Civil Rights work and ministerial activities. This material has not been processed and
            therefore no arrangement has been completed at this time. Acquired as part of the John

         <p>James A. Joseph is a Louisiana native who graduated from Southern University, Baton
            Rouge, and from Yale Divinity School. He is an ordained minister and is currently
            Professor of the Practice of Public Policy Studies and Leader-in-Residence at the Hart
            Leadership Program at Duke University. He is also responsible for launching the
            U.S.-Southern Africa Center for Leadership and Public Values.</p>
         <p>Joseph has taught at Yale Divinity School and at Clairemont Colleges, where he served as
            chaplain. He was also active in the Louisiana Civil Rights movement during the 1960s.
            From 1971-1976 he worked as vice president of the Cummins Engine Co. and was president
            of the Cummins Engine Foundation. In 1977, he was appointed by President Carter to be
            the undersecretary of the Interior, where he served until 1981. He was also chairman of
            the presidentially appointed Commission on the Northern Mariannas under President
            Carter; a member of the Advisory Committee to the Agency for International Development
            under President Reagan; and an incorporating director of the Points of Light Foundation
            and a member of the Presidential Commission on Historically Black Colleges under
            President Bush. He is also a former president and CEO of the Council on Foundations,
            1982-1995.</p>
         <p>Joseph served as ambassador to South Africa from January 1996 to November 1999, and was
            the first and only U.S. ambassador to present his credentials to President Nelson
            Mandela. In recognition of Joseph's contributions, South African President Thabo Mbeki
            awarded him the Order of Good Hope, the highest honor the Republic of South Africa
            bestows on a citizen of another country. Before serving in South Africa, Joseph was the
            first chairman of the board of directors of President Clinton's Corporation for National
            Service.</p>
         <p>This information is taken from his personal papers and from Joseph's biography as
            written on the Hart Leadership Program website.</p>
