         <abstract id="aspace_240c220326d98ffb0b01fb53692fa406">Anna Letitia Barbauld was an English
            woman of letters who had great professional success at a time when women writers were
            still something of an anomaly. She is remembered for her poetry, children's literature,
            essays, criticism, and editorial works. She was rediscovered when feminist literary
            critics examined her place in British literary history. Barbauld was also an
            abolitionist, something she had in common with fellow educator and Stoke Newington
            resident William Allen. This item is a single small sheet of paper with an autograph
            manuscript poem by Barbauld on the front dated August 23, 1823, and another one on the
            back by William Allen dated August 30, 1823. Both poems were aimed at a juvenile
            audience. It is likely that their common interests and close proximity led them to
            develop a friendship. Although this was written towards the end of Barbauld's life, it
            is evidence that they still had at least an epistolary relationship in 1823.</abstract>

         <p>Anna Letitia Barbauld (1743-1825) was an English writer, teacher, and editor who
            published poetry, works for children, literary criticism, and essays. She was a
            successful writer at a time when women professional writers were an anomaly. Her first
            book of poems (1773) established her literary reputation in England, and her later
            essays were compared to Samuel Johnson. Along with her husband, Barbauld ran the boy's
            school Palgrave Academy for 11 years, during which time she established herself as a
            writer of children's pedagogical texts, as well as poetry for children. She is credited
            with establishing children's literature as a legitimate genre, and her editorial works,
            particularly The British Novelists series, helped establish the British literary canon.
            Barbauld was an abolitionist and was also against the Napoleonic Wars, two subjects she
            addressed in her political writing. Both her poetry and her political essays were
            occasionally subject to harsh contemporary criticism, which eventually caused her to
            retreat from the public eye. She lived in Stoke Newington from 1802 until her death in
            1825. Barbauld's literary legacy was largely forgotten until the rise of feminist
            literary criticism in the late 20th century, which helped resurrect her place in
            history. </p>
         <p>William Allen (1770-1843) was an English Quaker abolitionist, scientist, educator, and
            philanthropist who was active in various social reform movements of early 19th century
            England. He was trained as a chemist, and his pharmaceutical company, Allen &amp;
            Hanburys, grew into one of the UK's largest drug companies. One year after this poem was
            written, he founded the Newington Academy for Girls, a progressive school in Stoke
            Newington. Although Barbauld was near the end of her life at the time of this writing,
            is it evidence that she and Allen maintained at least an epistolatory friendship based
            on their common interests.</p>

         <head>Collection Overview</head>
         <p>Collection consists of a single piece of paper (20 x 12.5 cm) with an autograph
            manuscript poem by Anna Letitia Barbauld on the front and a poem called "Follow Me" by
            William Allen on the back. Barbauld's poem reads as follows: Born to the weighty honours
            of a name/Whose deeds of mercy England's shores proclaim/Yet know, you may inherit lands
            or pelf/But must, for praise - for love, be good yourself. It's signed A.L. Barbauld and
            dated August 23rd 1823. The verso contains a two-stanza autograph manuscript devotional
            poem by William Allen titled "Follow Me." It is signed Stoke Newington 30 of 8th month
            1823. Barbauld and Allen were both educators and abolitionists who lived in Stoke
            Newington at the time of this writing. These poems are evidence that they had at least
            an epistolary friendship.</p>
