        education, law enforcement, farming, and slavery. The bulk of the papers relate to Nathan
        Carter Newbold and his relatives, including his father William A. Newbold and grandfather
        William Newbold (Sheriff of Pasquotank County, North Carolina), his first wife Mabel Wooten,
        and his second wife Eugenia Bradsher. Nathan Carter Newbold was the Director of the Division
        of Negro Education for the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction from
        1913-1950. The collection includes personal and professional correspondence, photographs,
        financial and property records dating from the 1840s, and recorded speeches given at Nathan
        Carter Newbold's retirement dinner. Some photographs have been identified as being of South
        Carolina during the late 19th century-early 20th century, which include portraits, street
        scenes (in Charleston), sail boats, as well as a few photographs of people of color,
        including photographs of "Lascar Sailors."Some photographs are of the U.S. Military Academy
        at West Point during the 1890s. Many of the legal and financial papers were generated by
        Nathan Carter Newbold's father and grandfather. The bulk of the correspondence relates to
        Nathan Carter Newbold's role as an administrator for North Carolina public schools and to
        his tenure as the Director of the Division of Negro Education during segregation and Jim
        Crow.</abstract>

          <p>Includes personal and professional letters written to and from Eugenia Bradsher
            Newbold, Nathan Carter Newbold, Mabel Wooten and others. The letters document the
            courtship between Nathan Carter Newbold and his first wife Mabel Wooten, whom he married
            in 1900, as well as his later marriage to Eugenia Bradsher. These personal letters
            reveal the day-to-day experiences of the authors including their affection for one
            another. Much of the correspondence written to Nathan Carter Newbold is made up of
            appreciation letters from public school officials who wrote to Newbold upon his
            retirement. Other correspondence documents Newbold's professional networks (including
            connections to Trinity College) and depicts his activity within the North Carolina
            public school system as an administrator.</p>

            from business interactions created by William Newbold in Pasquotank County and Elizabeth
            City in North Carolina. One folder includes receipts made while William Newbold served
            as the legal guardian for children of the Bright family. Some of the receipts are from
            taxes collected by William Newbold when he served as Sheriff for Pasquatank County in
            the 1850s; these receipts list the names of residents and the amounts paid.
            Additionally, a few of the wills and deeds identify people of color and document the
            transfer of enslaved people.</p>

            <p>Various-sized (mostly 3x5) cyanotypes, many with captions. They appear to have been
              taken in South Carolina. Though they are undated, it is likely they were taken in the
              late 19th or early 20th century. Many of the prints are stamped "Wm. M. Mackenzie, 16
              Glebe St., Charleston, S.C." Photographs include portraits, street scenes, sail boats,
              as well as a few photographs of people of color, including photographs of "Lascar
              Sailors."</p>

          <p>Includes writings and speeches by Mabel Wooten and Nathan Carter Newbold and others.
            Wooten, who graduated from the State Normal and Industrial School in 1895 (which later
            became the University of North Carolina at Greensboro), writes about pedagogy, manners,
            and the history of Person County, North Carolina. Nathan Carter Newbold's writings
            pertain mostly to education and to Christianity. Additionally, there are recordings of
            speeches made at Newbold's retirement dinner in 1950.</p>
