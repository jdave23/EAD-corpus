      <abstract id="aspace_4b445d7c3ed4c2821a91b0c2e2866305" label="Abstract">Leo Bogart was an
        applied sociologist and mass media expert who was Vice President and General Manager of the
        Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) from 1960-1989. In his career with the NAB, Bogart
        pioneered new methodologies in newspaper marketing research and led two major projects
        during the mid 1970s-1989 to bolster the ailing newspaper industry, the Newspaper Readership
        Project and the Future of Advertising Project. He was also a prolific author and public
        speaker, and published 195 articles and 14 books, and delivered over 150 speeches from
        1943-2005. The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2010 and document Bogart's professional
        work with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media expert; and as an author and
        public speaker. The collection includes correspondence, clippings, articles, speeches,
        books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes, reports, scrapbooks, resumes,
        interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative records, research materials,
        publications, promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks, student papers, military records,
        photographs, negatives, and slides. Materials represent Bogart's professional work as Vice
        President and General Manager of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, as well as his early
        employment with Standard Oil (New Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and Revlon, Inc.; as a prolific
        author and public speaker; as a Senior Fellow with the Gannett Center for Media Studies at
        Columbia University; and as a mass media consultant with the Innovation International Media
        Consulting Group. The bulk of files relate to research on U.S. markets, although some files
        do cover international research projects. Topics include newspaper marketing research;
        newspaper readership; newspaper advertising; television and society; critiques of mass
        media; social science research methodology; and international newspapers in emerging
        markets. The collection also documents Bogart's early experiences as a student and as a
        soldier in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, which formed the basis for
        several of his writing projects.</abstract>

      <p>The Leo Bogart Papers span the years 1912-2005 and document Bogart's professional work with
        the Newspaper Advertising Bureau; as a mass media expert; and as an author and public
        speaker. The collection includes correspondence, clippings, articles, speeches, books,
        journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes, reports, scrapbooks, resumes, interviews,
        schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative records, research materials, publications,
        promotional materials, ephemera, yearbooks, student papers, military records, photographs,

        Standard Oil (New Jersey), McCann-Erickson, and Revlon, Inc.; as a prolific author and

      <head>Collection Arrangement</head>
      <p>The collection is organized into six series: <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph>;
          <emph render="bold">Professional Series</emph>; <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides
          Series</emph>; <emph render="bold">Artifacts</emph>; <emph render="bold">Oversize
          Materials</emph>; and <emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Personal Series</emph> consists of correspondence, clippings,
        fiction and nonfiction writings, notes, student papers, brochures, pamphlets, ephemera,
        drawings, yearbooks, scrapbooks, awards, military documents, photographs, and memorabilia
        that document Bogart's personal life. Series is divided into two categories: <emph
          render="bold">Student materials</emph> and <emph render="bold">Other materials</emph>.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Series</emph> consists of correspondence, clippings,
        articles, speeches, books, journals, chapters, drafts, proposals, notes, reports,
        scrapbooks, resumes, interviews, schedules, programs, pamphlets, administrative records,
        research materials, publications, promotional materials, and photographs that document
        Bogart's professional career. Series is divided into nine subseries: <emph render="bold"
          >Biographical Materials Subseries</emph>; <emph render="bold">Conferences and Meetings
          Subseries</emph>; <emph render="bold">Correspondence Subseries</emph>; <emph render="bold"

      <p>The <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series</emph> consists of photographs,
        slides, and negatives that document Bogart's personal and professional life. Photographs
        chiefly document professional meetings and conferences. Slides, which make up the bulk of
        this series, include Newspaper Advertising Bureau presentation slides; Freedom Forum Russia
        workshop slides; and family vacation and travel slides.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Artifacts</emph> consists of plaques and other awards.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Audiovisual Materials</emph> consists of videocasttes, DVDs,
        audiocassettes, CDs, and floppy disks, featuring or collected by Bogart. Many of the
        videocassettes were used for Bogart's work as a mass media expert in two trials, <title

          <p>The <emph render="bold">Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB) Subseries</emph> documents
            Bogart's twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper Advertising Bureau (NAB),
            the advertising and marketing organization for the newspaper industry. Bogart began work
            with the NAB as Vice President of Marketing Planning and Research in 1960 and was
            promoted to Executive Vice President and General Manager in 1966. Bogart was the
            architect of many of the major research studies conducted during his tenure with the
            NAB. Bogart led two major research projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from
            1977-1983 and the Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the
            Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations to reverse declines in
            newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the
            newspaper industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was
            formed shortly afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising revenues
            that began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of television. Recommendations from the
            Future of Advertising Project led to standardization in advertising formats and invoices
            across newspapers. This subseries is divided into three sections: <emph render="bold"
              >General</emph>, <emph render="bold">Newspaper Readership Project</emph>, and <emph
              render="bold">Future of Advertising Project</emph>. <emph render="bold">General</emph>
            consists mainly of materials related to various research projects at the NAB. For slides
            of NAB presentations, see the <emph render="bold">Photographs &amp; Slides
            Series</emph>. Speeches and presentations in this subseries report directly on the
            workings of the NAB; for all other speeches, see the <emph render="bold">Writings and
              Speeches Subseries</emph>. Arranged alphabetically within category except for speeches
            and meetings, which are arranged chronologically.</p>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">Professional Service Subseries</emph> documents Bogart's
            membership and service in professional organizations and clubs and on committees and
            advisory boards. Arranged alphabetically by organization.</p>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">Research Files Subseries</emph> consists of clippings,
            writings, and notes on various subjects that Bogart maintained for reference and as
            source material for his writings, speeches, and research. Arranged alphabetically by
            topic.</p>
          <p>The <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph> documents 149 speeches;
            195 published articles; 14 books; book chapters and contributions; and other written
            materials Bogart produced over his career. Also includes articles for a monthly column
            in <title type="simple" render="italic">Presstime</title> that Bogart wrote from
            1989-2005. The subseries is divided in five sections: <emph render="bold"
              >Speeches</emph>, <emph render="bold">Articles</emph>, <emph render="bold"
              >Books</emph>, <emph render="bold">Book chapters and contributions</emph>, and <emph
              render="bold">Unpublished writings and drafts</emph>. Writings are arranged
            chronologically by date of publication, or for unpublished writings, creation date.
            Speeches are arranged chronologically by date of delivery.</p>

            <p>After Bogart retired from the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, he was nominated a fellow
              with the Gannett Center for Media Studies for the 1989-1990 academic year. As a
              fellow, Bogart received support while completing his book <title type="simple"
                render="italic">Commercial Culture: The Media System and the Public
              Interest</title>. For materials related to this book, see the <emph render="bold"
                >Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>. Bogart continued a relationship with the
              Gannett Center, which became financially independent from the Gannett Broadcasting
              Group in 1991 and was renamed the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. On behalf of the
              Freedom Forum, Bogart advised the <title type="simple" render="italic">Oakland
                Tribune</title> on how to restructure their business in 1991 and organized a
              newspaper advertising workshop in Russia and Eastern Europe in 1992. </p>
            <p>Bogart spent much of his late career sharing his newspaper industry and mass media
              expertise. As Director and Senior Consultant for Innovation International Media
              Consulting Group, Bogart advised newspapers, particularly in Spain, Latin America,
              Russia, and Eastern Europe; and assessed the state of newspapers and mass media for
              Innovation publications and conferences. Bogart also shared his knowledge about the
              mass media with attorneys as a media expert in two very public trials in the 1990s,
                <title type="simple" render="italic">Chandler v. Jackson</title> (Michael Jackson
              child molestation lawsuit) and <title type="simple" render="italic">Valenzuela v.
                Hughes Aircraft Company</title> (TCE groundwater contamination lawsuit in Tuscon,
              Arizona).</p>
            <p>Slides of presentations given at the Freedom Forum workshop and photographs of the
              trip are located in the <emph render="bold">Photographs and Slides Series</emph>.
              Presentation scripts are in Russian and English and slide text is in Russian.
              Videocassette tapes of media coverage of Michael Jackson and TCE groundwater
              contamination in Arizona are located in the <emph render="bold">Audiovisual
                Materials</emph> section. Arranged alphabetically. </p>

            <p>Documents Bogart's twenty-nine year executive career with the Newspaper Advertising
              Bureau (NAB), the advertising and promotion organization for the newspaper industry.
              Bogart began work with the NAB as Vice President of Marketing Planning and Research in
              1960 and was promoted to Executive Vice President and General Manager in 1966. During
              his tenure with the NAB, Bogart was the architect of most of the major research
              studies. Bogart led two major research projects, the Newspaper Readership Project from
              1977-1983 and the Future of Advertising Project from 1979-1988. The goal of the
              Newspaper Readership Project was to make recommendations to reverse declines in
              newspaper readership that begun in the 1920s and were threatening the vitality of the
              newspaper industry during the 1970s and 1980s. The Future of Advertising Project was
              formed shortly afterward to address newspapers' decline in national advertising
              revenues that began in the 1960s due largely to the rise of television.
              Recommendations from the Future of Advertising Project led to standardization in
              advertising formats and invoices across newspapers. This subseries is divided into
              three sections: <emph render="bold">General</emph>, <emph render="bold">Newspaper
                Readership Project</emph>, and <emph render="bold">Future of Advertising
                Project</emph>. <emph render="bold">General</emph> consists mainly of materials
              related to various research projects at the NAB. For slides of NAB presentations, see
              the <emph render="bold">Photographs &amp; Slides Series</emph>. Speeches and
              presentations in this subseries report directly on the workings of the NAB; for all
              other speeches, see the <emph render="bold">Writings and Speeches Subseries</emph>.
              Arranged alphabetically within category except for speeches and meetings, which are
              arranged chronologically.</p>
