<abstract id="aspace_240c220326d98ffb0b01fb53692fa406">Anna Letitia Barbauld was an English
woman of letters who had great professional success at a time when women writers were
still something of an anomaly. She is remembered for her poetry, children's literature,
essays, criticism, and editorial works. She was rediscovered when feminist literary
critics examined her place in British literary history. Barbauld was also an
abolitionist, something she had in common with fellow educator and Stoke Newington
resident William Allen. This item is a single small sheet of paper with an autograph
manuscript poem by Barbauld on the front dated August 23, 1823, and another one on the
back by William Allen dated August 30, 1823. Both poems were aimed at a juvenile
audience. It is likely that their common interests and close proximity led them to
develop a friendship. Although this was written towards the end of Barbauld's life, it
is evidence that they still had at least an epistolary relationship in 1823.</abstract>
<abstract id="aspace_5ae16712dd681b865483ef952fddf654" label="Abstract">Bates Worldwide advertising agency (Bates) was established in 1940 by former executives of the Benton &amp; Bowles agency. It grew to become one of the largest agencies in the U.S. until its demise in 2003. Bates began as a simple proprietorship, but as the company grew its organizational structure took on different forms: a partnership, then a corporation before becoming a publicly traded transnational entity, and finally becoming a subsidiary in a global holding company. From the 1970s on, Bates' growth and international expansion was fueled by a long series of mergers, partnerships and acquisitions that continued until the company was itself acquired, first by the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and later by the WPP Group. Materials in the collection relate to Bates' permutations into a variety of corporate entities, including Ted Bates &amp; Co., Ted Bates, Inc., Backer Spielvogel Bates, and Bates Worldwide, Inc., along with its subsidiaries (such as Campbell-Mithun and Kobs and Draft) and parent organizations (Cordiant Communications Group, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi). Thus, the collection provides a window into the larger corporate culture of mergers, consolidations, acquisitions and takeovers that led to the formation of giant transnational advertising conglomerates and marked a profound shift in the landscape of the advertising industry during the late 20th century. The Bates Worldwide, Inc. Records spans the years 1934-2003 and includes correspondence, corporate policy manuals, photographs, publications, graphic designs, print advertisements, electronic records and videocassettes that document the activities of this major global advertising agency over the course of its corporate life. Bates built its early reputation as an advertising agency with a particular talent for promoting pharmaceutical products (Carter's Pills, Anacin analgesics) and common household goods (Mars candies, Wonder bread, Palmolive soap, Colgate dental cream). Advertising policies developed around a philosophy Bates called the Unique Selling Proposition (USP), which informed an imperative to identify and promote a single, unique and compelling reason for consumers to use any given product or service. As the company grew into a global business, USP evolved into more complex forms, including the Bates Brand Wheel. Major clients included Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., Carter-Wallace Corporation, Hyundai America, the Joint Recruiting Advertising Program of the combined U.S. Armed Services, M&amp;M/Mars Inc., Miller Brewing Company, Pfizer, the U.S. Navy and Wendy's International. There is also some information on the company's founder, Ted Bates, as well as on Rosser Reeves, Bates' first copy writer and the chief architect of the USP concept.</abstract>

southern Virginia in the early twentieth century. Collection of 74 unpublished
typewritten sermons and texts for prayer meetings assembled by a Methodist minister
active in Virginia in the early twentieth century. Although no author's name is given,
from church appointment records it is almost certain that the minister is John Luke Bray
(1871-1938). The sermons were given from 1907 to 1938 in localities in southern Virginia
(almost all in Danville, Crewe, South Boston, Richmond, and Norfolk); the earliest
sermon was given in Shawnee, Oklahoma. At times the minister may have been using
churches that offered space to other denominations. The sermon notes, typed in red and
black and typically two to four pages, document the typical style of Methodist preaching
in the South and sometimes refer to social or economic issues. Each envelope enclosing
the sermon text is marked with the title and when and where preached; most have multiple
dates and locations. There are also a few miscellaneous items, including newspaper
clippings, handwritten notes, and one leaf with an undated hymn with words by A. W.
Davis, entitled "Over the Top With Jesus," dedicated to a "Rev. D. H. Kenney." Some
fragile items have been photocopied. Arranged in two series: Prayer Meetings and

<abstract id="aspace_3b6acece563cbf46df1c9cc926f4c500">Autograph manuscript letter with
postmarked envelope from the actress and writer Fanny Kemble in London to Miss Patteson in
Andover, 10 May, 1889. Kemble thanks Miss Patteson for sending photographs, mentioning that
she particularly values one of Bishop Patteson. She says she is "glad Lord Coleridge thought
Lenox (Mass.) pretty. It has always seemed to me a charming mountain village." Frances Anne
"Fanny" Kemble was a British actress, writer, and abolitionist. She was born into a theater
family; her acting career spanned the years 1829-1868. Kemble acted to support herself, but
she was most passionate about writing, and was an accomplished playwright, poet, and
diarist. She married the Pierce Mease Butler, an American who subsequently inherited his
family' plantations. After spending time in Georgia, Kemble became an abolitionist and later
divorced her husband. In 1863, Kemble published her anti-slavery memoir, Journal of a
Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839, which is said to have influenced the
British against supporting the Confederacy in the Civil War. Kemble's own family was divided
on that issue, as her elder daughter sided with her mother, while her younger daughter
returned to Georgia with her father. Frances Butler Leigh published Ten Years on a Georgia
Plantation Since the War (1883) as a rebuttal to her mother's memoir. Kemble's success as a
Shakespearean actress enabled her to buy a cottage in Lenox, Massachusetts. Her
correspondent, Miss Patteson, is the daughter of Frances Duke Patteson, a niece of the poet
Samuel Coleridge Taylor; the Lord Coleridge mentioned in the letter is John Duke Coleridge
(1820-1894), the 2nd Lord Chief Justice of England. Bishop Patteson refers to Miss
Patteson's sister, John Patteson (1827-1871), who became an Anglican martyr after being
killed doing mission work in the Solomon Islands.</abstract>

<abstract id="aspace_f96a75d97897ba613d2e3901a4b68d2f" label="Abstract">Prominent feminist,
author, and political activist in the 1960s and 70s. Author of MEMOIRS OF AN EX-PROM QUEEN
(1972), ON THE STROLL (1980), and DRINKING THE RAIN (1995). The materials in the Alix Kates
Shulman Papers span the dates 1892 to 2000, with the bulk of materials dating from 1968 to
2000. These materials include: manuscripts, notes, clippings, published books,
correspondence, photographs, audio and videotapes, microfilm, address and date books, family
and business records. The primary focus of the collection is Shulman's writing and literary
career. The secondary focus is the women's liberation and feminist movements, in which
Shulman was and continues to be very active (from 1968 to 2000). However, feminism and
feminist activism are inextricably intertwined with Shulman's writing career, and her 1972
novel MEMOIRS OF AN EX-PROM QUEEN is regarded by many as the first novel to "come out of"
the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</abstract>
