      <p>On August 8, 1899, H.C. (Henry Christian) Engberg married Mary
		  Davenport. The Engbergs were prominent members of the Bellingham (Wash.)
		  community, participating in a number of social organizations including the
		  Twentieth Century Club, the Bellingham Woman’s Music Club, and the YWCA. Their
		  house was located at 531 N. Garden Street.</p>
      <p>Often referred to as Madame Davenport-Engberg, Mary was an
		  accomplished violinist and symphony conductor. In addition to organizing the
		  eighty-five piece Davenport Engberg Orchestra in Bellingham in 1914, she also
		  directed the sixty-five piece Seattle Symphony Orchestra from 1921-1924.</p>
      <p>H.C. Engberg founded the Engberg Pharmacy in Bellingham in 1890. The
		  store was originally located in Fairhaven and then moved to 139 W. Holly Street
		  at the intersection of Holly and State Streets. In 1912 the Engberg Pharmacy
		  published Easton’s recreational map of Mt. Baker (copy available in the CPNWS
		  Pamphlet Collection). Engberg was also an avid outdoorsman, participating in
		  and photographing multiple expeditions into the Mt. Baker wilderness. According
		  to Lottie Roeder Roth’s History of Whatcom County, Engberg was responsible for
		  naming Bastile and No Name Glaciers, as well as Heliotrope Ridge and Creek.</p>
