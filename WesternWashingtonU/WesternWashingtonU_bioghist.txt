<p>Hands Off Washington (HOW) was a project of the Washington Citizens for Fairness (WCF)
which lasted from 1993 to 1997. WCF, a state-wide organization, was a coalition of concerned
citizens and organizations with the specific aim of preserving the civil rights of all
Washington citizens. HOW was created to specifically oppose initiatives 608 and 610, which
sought to limit the rights of Washington citizens and legalize discrimination based on
sexual orientation. Quoting from the official ballot summaries: </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Initiative 608</emph>, sponsored by the Equal Rights, Not Special Rights
Committee. “This measure would prohibit the state of Washington and its political
subdivisions from enacting or enforcing any law or policy that grants protection against
discrimination or that recognizes or provides any benefit, right, standing, or privilege to
homosexuals or other persons on the basis of sexual orientation. This measure also would bar
common schools, their employees, volunteers, and guests from discussing or presenting
homosexuality, bisexuality, transexuality, or transvestism as appropriate, positive, or
healthy in any respect.”<emph render="italic">-Initiate 608 Summary, 1994-03-29</emph></p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Initiative 610</emph>, was sponsored by the Citizens Alliance of
Washington. “This measure would prohibit governments from according rights, status or
protection from discrimination based on homosexuality; from expending funds through
governmental or educational institutions to promote, approve, or present homosexuality as a
positive, healthy, or acceptable condition; from recognizing same-sex marriages and gender
change alterations; and from awarding homosexuals custody of their own or other children in
adoption or other child custody proceedings. The measure would grant enforcement standing to

<p>Hands Off Washington Whatcom County Coalition Council was a county branch of the state-wide
HOW project. Originally, this branch encompassed only Whatcom County, but in 1995, it
incorporated both Whatcom and Skagit Counties. This branch contributed to the statewide
effort to oppose discriminatory initiatives and prevent them from getting on the ballot.
Through community involvement, strategic planning, fundraisers, and a public education
campaign, the initiatives never received the necessary signatures to appear on the ballot.
Initiatives 608 and 610 reappeared a year later as initiatives 166 and 167 only to fail for
a second time, like their predecessors. In 1995, HOW mobilized a campaign to put their own
gay rights initiative on the ballot. However, it was shot down by legislators who claimed it
was unconstitutional for citizens to vote on the civil rights of a minority. This right,
opponents claimed, should be reserved for legislators. Two years later, HOW proposed another
initiative, 677, which would have banned employment discrimination based on sexual
orientation. This initiative, however, was voted on by Washington citizens and defeated.
Unlike earlier defensive measures, this proactive approach received mixed support from the
gay and lesbian community throughout the state. After this defeat, HOW ceased to be and
changed their name to Equality Washington. </p>

<p>The Morse Hardware Company is one of the oldest mercantile businesses
in the Northwest region and is also one of the oldest, continually operating
family owned businesses in the area. The company was founded by Robert I.
Morse, who sold his property in San Francisco and used the proceeds to purchase
$3000 worth of hardware, paints, glass and other supplies and sailed for
Bellingham Bay in 1884, determined to find a role in the booming economy of the
Pacific Northwest . </p>
<p>Morse located his store near the waterfront at 1039 Elk St. and
established his personal residence on the second floor. Initially, the store
operated solely as a retail operation, but the success of the Morse
merchandizing slogan "Sell 'em Low, Send and Get More" generated a loyal and
growing customer base. As the business expanded Morse entered the wholesale
trade as a supplier to the burgeoning number of crossroad establishments that
served the growing population in the region. </p>
<p>The expansion of the railroad in the 1890's facilitated the shipment
of supplies and merchandise and promoted additional growth in the business. The
advent of World War I generated a demand for lumber and hardware for
ship-building. The company supplied this endeavor and used the proceeds to
expand into the Alaska cannery business, eventually becoming the dominant
supplier of hardware and other supplies to this industry. </p>
<p>Upon the death of Robert I. Morse in 1920, his eldest son, Cecil A.
Morse, assumed the duties of the president and general manager of Morse
Hardware. Cecil held the company together during the Great Depression and
although most employees accepted wage and salary reductions, the company
managed to avoid any layoffs. Cecil's presidency also oversaw expansion in
sales and marketing with sales territories and staff growing farther afield.
World War II spurred an expansion of the industrial supply division of Morse
Hardware as the company furnished shipyards with the supplies necessary to
sustain the war effort. The company also purchased several new buildings
adjacent to the original store to house a growing inventory.</p>
<p>After fifty-seven years in the business, Cecil Morse died in 1958 and
David C. Morse, the youngest son of the founder, became president. David
continued to expand distribution markets by making new inroads in Alaska and
Oregon. In 1960, the store closed its individual retail outlet and focused
operations on wholesale distribution to retail stores and heavy industry. The
primary customer base became lumber yards, retail outlets, and home centers in
western Washington, northern Oregon and Alaska. Industrial supply sales were
complimented by the movement of the Mobil Oil Company refinery and the Intalco
Aluminum Corporation in Whatcom County. Georgia Pacific and the Atlantic
Richfield Co. also became Morse customers. In 1963, the company became a member
of PRO Hardware, Inc. PRO was a voluntary international organization of
wholesalers with several distributors located in the United States. The
organization assisted wholesalers in developing and distributing merchandizing,
marketing and promotional programs. Morse hardware successfully implemented the
program through 50 of its dealers throughout western Washington and Alaska.</p>
<p>In 1975, Bob Morse, grandson of the original founder assumed the
presidency. The final decades of the 20th Century witnessed significant change
in business focus. In 1994, Morse Hardware Co. announced that it would cease
supplying wholesale hardware goods to retailer stores and lay off 25 workers.
And, in November of 1998, the company announced that it would sell its
industrial supply division with operations in Bellingham and Tacoma to Stellar
Industrial and Construction Supply. Stellar leased the original Morse Hardware
site in Bellingham and Morse operations in Tacoma changed its name to Stellar.
Prior to the sale, the Morse industrial division distributed nearly 12,000
items, including hand and power tools, cutting tools and abrasives, and mill
and construction supplies. The sale allowed the company to focus on its core
business, Morse Steel Service, which continues in successful operation in
Bellingham. The warehouse building is a large tilt up concrete structure with
two 55 foot bays served by seven overhead five and ten ton bridge cranes. The
operation requires specialized machinery including a 5/8 inch shear, acetylene
and plasma computerized cutting equipment, automatic saws, rebar bending
machine, and an iron monger to fulfill diverse customer requirements. The
product base is carbon steel, cut to all shapes and sizes, and utilized by
fabricators, building constructors, and heavy industry. </p>
<p>The original building on State Street, houses the offices of the steel
business. Morse Steel service also operates a similar, but smaller steel
warehouse in Wenatchee. </p>

<p>David T. Mason was born January 7, 1937 in Berkeley, California. His parents, Lucile
(Roush) Mason and Herbert Mason were renowned botanical scientists and longtime faculty at
the University of California, Berkeley and Davis. David T. Mason earned his Bachelor of Arts
in biology at Reed College in 1958. In 1961, David received a Master of Arts degree in
zoology at the University of California, at Davis, where he went on to complete a PhD in
Limnology in 1966. Soon after receiving his doctorate, David became an associate professor
of Biology at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. </p>
<p> David integrated teaching and research with theatrical productions and creative writing.
He was actively involved in producing and directing plays, and creating musical scores for
countless Friends of Fairhaven Theater productions. He became especially well known for his
performance art piece, “Blue Baroque.” </p>
<p>As a much beloved professor at Fairhaven College, Mason taught a wide variety of
inter-disciplinary classes including basic biology and ecology theory and practice. Among
the very few publicly ‘out’ gay male teachers in the mid 1960s, David also created one of
the first gay and lesbian studies classes in the Pacific Northwest. He was also well known
for his theater courses and performances. Of particular note are his "Orpheo," "Dictionary"
and "Opera" classes. David emphasized experiential learning. Classes such as the ‘Lynden
Recycling Project’ helped increase awareness about the importance of recycling. Students in
his gay studies class were invited to learn about gay culture by touring the local gay bar.
‘The Course of the Stream’ encouraged students to study natural habitats along rivers and
streams in Whatcom County.</p>
<p> During the late 1960s through 1980s, David pursued various research and activist projects,
and was awarded a Fulbright fellowship in 1973, which took him to Uruguay to pursue his
environmental research. The Uruguay experience culminated in a series of traveling lectures
and multimedia slideshows on environmental concerns which David presented to audiences as
varied as learned biology scholars and school children. His sabbaticals and research trips
took him mainly to the Alaskan arctic to study the effects of crude oil on natural habitats.
His major research interests ranged from limnology studies of Mono Lake in California, and
Antarctica, the impacts of sewage treatment and heavy metals on natural bodies of water in
the arctic and the Pacific Northwest, and habitat studies along the lower Stehekin River, to
ecological effects on plants and animals along the Nooksack River and Lake Abert in Oregon.
He also studied the release of chemicals in Bellingham Bay by Georgia-Pacific mill. David
produced numerous articles and research papers both published and unpublished for
educational presentations and traveling multi-media slideshows. </p>

<p>The Washington State Good Roads Association (WSGRA) was established in 1899 by Sam Hill to encourage development of an adequate and practical statewide highway system in Washington State. Sam Hill cultivated the support of non-profit civic groups interested in road-building and affiliated operations. The primary goal of the WSGRA was to establish a highway system created by the state legislature and operated under state management. The membership of WSGRA consisted mainly of county chapters representing local civic groups such as Chambers of Commerce and Granges. These local groups lobbied not only through WSGRA for the state-wide road network, but also in their local districts for improved road conditions. WSGRA was led by a president and was supported by an executive committee, consisting of one representative from each district. Districts were based on geographical divisions within the state. The yearly conferences involved delegates from the local organizations state-wide.</p>

<p>Established by the Emergency Conservation Work Act of 1933, the
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) comprised one of the popular and far-reaching
public works operations established under Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.
Implemented during Roosevelt’s first “Hundred Days” of office, the
administration envisioned the CCC as a means to tackle the growing problems of
poverty and unemployment in the United States. During the 1930s and 1940s,
under the directorships of Robert Fechner and James McEntee, the program
engaged over three million unemployed male volunteers in public works projects
designed to conserve natural resources and improve recreational and
communication infrastructure. </p>
<p>Roosevelt’s program required unprecedented peacetime mobilization of
men and labor. The scope and scale of the CCC program was such that its
Advisory Council included representatives from the Departments of War, Labor,
Agriculture and Interior. The CCC worked in conjunction with government bodies
such as the Bureau of Animal Industry, the National and State Forest Services,
National and State Parks, and the Soil Conservation Service. Although CCC camps
and projects were established across the United States, many enrollees served
in locations far removed from their place or state of origin. The program sent
large numbers of unemployed men from depressed areas on the east coast, for
example, to training and work camps in the western United States, including
Washington State. The government directed the U.S. military to mobilize and
train CCC members, appointing officials from the Coast Guard, Navy, Marines and
most frequently the Army as commanders of CCC companies, induction and work
camps. </p>
<p>Vic Olsen and his wife Mae Olsen were instrumental in preserving the
history of the CCC and their achievements in Washington State. In Washington,
host to over 200 CCC camps, Roosevelt’s “tree army” was involved in forest and
soil conservation, construction of roads, bridges, telephone lines, and park
and recreational facilities. CCC members built some 21,788 miles of public
trails, and planted 51,057 acres of trees and seedlings.* Camps included those
based at Rosario on Fidalgo Island and at Coronet Bay on Whidbey Island (the
latter camp was for CCC enrollees from the East Coast of the US). Vic Olsen
himself enrolled in the CCC in Everett, Washington, in April 1933, attending
training at Fort Worden and Fort Casey before transfer to Camp Easton (F-32),
near Cle Elum. In November 1933, Vic was relocated with his company to Camp
Louella (F-60) near Sequim, Washington, in the Olympic National Forest, until
his later injury and honorable discharge. During his work with the CCC, he
assisted with the construction of several facilities at Deception Pass,
Washington. </p>
<p>Vic and Mae Olsen retained an active interest in the history of the
CCC, founding the Everett Chapter (Chapter #78) of the CCC Alumni Association
in March 1983. The Olsens worked as campground hosts at Deception Pass State
Park in Bowman Bay for many years. During their tenure at Deception Pass State
Park, they were instrumental in establishing an interpretive center devoted to
the history of the CCC in the region. The interpretive center was created in
1987 through CCC alumni members’ renovation of an old park bathhouse. The
center was dedicated on July 16, 1988, and remains open for visitors to
Deception Pass State Park. </p>

district. The Chiwawa district includes the drainage of the Little Wenatchee,
White, and Chiwawa Rivers. While the mainstay of the mine was copper silver,
gold and tungsten were also found as byproducts. In 1929, about 2,500 feet of
mining work was done with a workforce of 80 employees. In support of operations
at the mine, the Royal Development Company operated a large and completely

a flotation mill was erected and by 1936 the mine produced more than 10,000
tons of copper ore. However, in 1937 operations began to slow and the mine
produced only 5,825 tons. As costs increased and the returns did not,
operations were slowed. The company was forced into receivership in the early

<p>The Druzea Club was formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1937 in the
home of Mrs. Maude Fischer with the express purpose of facilitating mental
improvement and social enjoyment for its members. In 1938 the club joined the
Washington State Federation of Women’s Clubs and enjoyed a long association
with this umbrella organization.</p>
<p>Druzea is a Russian word meaning ‘friendship’ which was to be the root
of the Druzea Club’s purpose in the local and regional communities. The club
was active in a number of service projects which included aiding needy families
during the holidays, collecting magazines for monthly drop-off at the Juvenile
Detention quarters of the Court House, sponsoring a rural school through the
Save the Children Federation, assisting in the restoration of the Whatcom
Museum as well as engaging in war service projects during World War II. </p>
<p>Library service was also one of the main focuses of the Druzea Club,
which took an active role in the formation of Friends of the Bellingham Public
Library in October 1952. The club was also involved in the establishment of a
library at Pt. Roberts by furnishing books and magazines to the local
community. </p>
<p>The Druzea Club was active as well in supporting State and General
Federation of Women’s Clubs projects and also gave financial assistance to the
Heart, Cancer, and Polio funds, the local food bank, the Indian Youth Mission,
the Home for Abused Women and the Salvation Army. The club also acted as a
leadership training ground in that five of its members eventually became
Federation of Women’s Clubs district presidents, three were general chairman to
the state convention when it was held in Bellingham, and several members went
on to become state officers and department chairs. This connection with the
Federation was cherished by club members and fortified their resolve to
continue actively supporting their local and regional communities. The club
celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1987 and has since disbanded. </p>

<p>Born in Memphis Tennesee on October 11, 1895, Lafayette Rogan Jones
moved with his parents, Francis Goodbar Jones and Mary Rogan Jones to Boston in
1901, and then to Aberdeen, Washington in 1906. He attended private schools in
Boston, public schools in Aberdeen and spent one year at Columbia University
where he studied business. Jones lived in Aberdeen intermittently until 1930.
Jones acquired his first radio station, KXRO, in Aberdeen, Washington in 1928,
and purchased KVOS in Bellingham, Washington the following year. In addition to
these stations, Jones owned KPQ radio in Wenatchee and KPCB in Seattle. </p>
<p>A pioneer in his field, Jones often generated conflict through his
attempts to expand the interests and role of radio broadcasters and attract
larger audiences. The legal case KVOS v Associated Press (circa 1934-1936)
comprised one of the most noteworthy legal battles of his career. Responding to
refusals by the Associated Press, the United Press, and the International News
Service to sell news copy to radio stations, Jones and KVOS rewrote and then
broadcast information found in newspapers. Accusing Jones of “news piracy”,
local newspapers such as the Bellingham Herald and national news organizations
including the Associated Press filed suit against KVOS. In 1936, the US Supreme
Court decided in favor of KVOS, allowing for greater access by radio
broadcasters to news sources (including sporting events), and paving the way
towards the sale of information by news organizations to radio.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, Jones attracted further controversy through his
creation of International Good Music (IGM), a centralized service providing
recorded music and radio shows for broadcast across the world. In 1964, the
Amercian Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) sued IGM and
recipient stations, arguing that IGM broadcast music without their permission
or that of the artists. The case was decided in favor of the IGM and other
defendents. Having established himself in radio, Jones soon expanded his
professional interests to include television, creating one of the first
commercial cable systems in Bellingham, Washington. His first TV station,
KVOS-TV, aired its first broadcast on May 23, 1953. Jones also founded cable
television station, KPQ-CA in Wenatchee in 1953, before selling the station the
following year. The British Columbia company Wometco eventually bought KVOS in
1962. Rogan Jones died on 27 April, 1972 in Bellingham, Washington.</p>

<p>Al Swift was born in Tacoma, Washington on September 12, 1935, where
he later graduated from Lincoln High School. Swift attended Whitman College in Walla
Walla from 1953 to 1955, then graduated in 1957 with a B.A. in Journalism
from Central Washington University in Ellensburg. While attending college, Swift began
his career in broadcasting by working for local radio stations. After graduation, he
joined KVOS Television and Radio in Bellingham, Washington. Swift was promoted to program
director of KVOS in 1962. </p>
<p>In 1965, Swift joined Congressman Lloyd Meeds' (D-WA) staff as his first administrative
assistant where he remained for the next five years. In 1969, Swift returned
to KVOS as news and public affairs director. While at KVOS, he produced many programs
on state and local issues and, in the process, won many awards, including the prestigious
Emmy award. While in Bellingham, Swift remained active in community affairs. In the early
1970s he played a key roll in rewriting Bellingham's 1906 city charter. By 1975 he had
became chairman of a citizen's advisory committee on Bellingham schools and was
appointed by Mayor Ken Hertz to the Bellingham Housing Authority. </p>
<p>In 1977 Swift returned to Representative Meeds' staff as his top aide.
When Meeds decided to retire, Swift resigned from his position to begin his own
campaign for Washington's 2nd Congressional District. Throughout the 1978
campaign Swift was considered the underdog and his first hurdle was to gain the
State Democratic Party nomination. Senator Henry Jackson's longtime press
secretary, Brian Corcoran, was considered a "shoe-in" for the nomination yet
Swift came from far behind to defeat Corcoran in the primary election by 3,881
votes. His next hurdle was Republican John Nance Garner, who nearly ousted
Meeds in 1976. Garner spent extensively on his campaign against Swift, but Swift
attacked Garner's heavy spending which turned Garner's monetary advantage into
a liability. The outcome was a 51 percent victory for Swift. </p>
<p>Once elected to Congress it did not take Swift long to become active.
He was a protegé of Senator Warren G. Magnuson, and it was through Magnuson's
influence that Swift was appointed to the Energy and Commerce Committee in his
freshman term. During his congressional career he also chaired the Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Transportation and Hazardous Materials and the
Elections Subcommittee. Membership on these key committees allowed Swift to
play a major role in some of the most important issues that arose during his
tenure, including broadcast deregulation, telecommunications,
uniform polling results, the Northwest Power Bill, the Motor Voter Law,
campaign finance reform, and the spotted owl controversy. </p>
<p>Swift was described by Alan Ehrenharlt of "Congressional Quarterly" in
1986's Politics in America as "patient, diligent, and disdainful of publicity,
he is one of the most impressive legislators to arrive in Congress in recent
years." This kind of sentiment and his reputation for being the legislative
expert on broadcasting and telecommunication issues led to the naming of Swift
as one of the twelve most underrated members of Congress in 1985. </p>
<p>Swift was first elected in 1978 and served 8 successive terms until
1994 when he chose not to run for reelection. </p>

1940s. He graduated from Pacific Lutheran University with a BA and BEd. in
1951, and later pursued graduate studies in history and economics, earning an
MA at the University of Washington in 1966. Metcalf worked as a high school
math and history teacher in Everett, Washington for nearly thirty years. </p>
<p>Metcalf began his political career in state government, serving as a
Republican member of the Washington State House of Representatives (1961-1964)
and later the Washington State Senate (1967-1975 and 1981-1993), where he
chaired the Senate Environmental and Natural Resources Committee between 1988
and 1992. In 1994, as the Republican Party gained control of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Metcalf was elected representative for Washington State's 2nd
Congressional District.</p>
<p>Often described as a political conservative, Metcalf was concerned
with a wide range of legislative issues. He served as a member of the House
Banking, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Science Committees, and on
subcommittees for Ground Transportation, Aviation, Financial Institutions and
International Monetary Policy. As a politician and legislator, Metcalf focused
much of his attention on regionally significant issues including Puget Sound
transportation development, natural resource and fisheries management, and
environmental protection. In 1997, Metcalf and U.S. Senator Patty Murray
(D-Washington) established the Northwest Straits Advisory Commission, a
bipartisan body intended to conserve marine life in Northwest Washington.
Metcalf also led an unsuccessful challenge to the resumption of whaling by the
Makah Indian Tribe in Neah Bay, Washington. </p>
<p>A long-time advocate for the US military and military personnel,

<p>Hokan (Hovander) Olsson was born on December 6, 1841, near Malmo, Sweden. Hokan's parents,
Ola Persson and Else Nilsdatter, were semi-prosperous tenant farmers who struggled to
support Hokan and his eight siblings, including Hokan's twin brother Christian. In 19th
Century Sweden, tenant farming was a particularly difficult livelihood for most families.
Only 10% of Sweden's land was arable and suitable for farming. In addition, Swedish laws
stipulated that landowners must maintain their land parcels as a unit and were prohibited
from dividing lands among heirs. As a result, many younger sons, such as Hokan, chose to
migrate to large cities like Stockholm in search of more viable vocational prospects. Once
in Stockholm, Hokan became an apprentice bricklayer by day and studied architecture in the
evening. Sometime during the 1860s, Hokan changed his surname from Olsson to Hafvander
(later Havander or Hovander). This name change probably reflected Hokan's desire to
facilitate his architectural career by choosing a more distinctive name than the common
"Olsson." </p>
<p>In 1865, Hokan and his brother Christian left Sweden and travelled first to Australia and
New Zealand and then to the United States, where they established separate homesteads in
Kansas. Christian chose to remain in Kansas, but Hokan continued his travels in the U.S.,
eventually migrating to Chicago. While in Chicago, Hokan returned to his chosen profession
of architecture. In the wake of the devastating fire of 1871, he found ample opportunity to
hone his architectural skills as he helped to rebuild the city. He also worked along the
West Coast in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. </p>
<p>In 1879, He returned to Sweden and married Louisa Leontine Johandatter Lof and settled into
family life and an architectural career. Although he was not officially licensed as an
architect in Sweden, this period was particularly prolific for Hokan, and he completed many
building and design projects during this time. Hokan's work in Sweden culminated with the
creation of his most famous work, the "Mansion," a large residential building in Stockholm
created in the Beaux Arts style. </p>
<p>In 1885, Hokan succumbed to an episode of tuberculosis and was advised to spend some time
in a warmer climate. Hokan, Leontine and their children, Hugo, Elsa and Otis embarked on a
world cruise, traveling from Sweden to Australia and finally to San Francisco. In
California, Elsa met her future husband, Karl Stromee. The Stromees and other transplanted
Swedes convinced the Hovanders that immigration to the U.S. would be beneficial to both
Hokan's health and the future of the children. After returning to Sweden and selling the
"Mansion", the Hovander family set sail for New Zealand in 1896. By then, the family had
grown to include three more children: Angelo, Charles and Ada. </p>
<p>The Hovander family reached Seattle by 1897 but chose not to stay, complaining of noise and
price inflation caused by Gold Rush fever. Instead, the family migrated north to Whatcom
County. The Hovanders paid Betsey Nielson $4000 in gold coin for 60 acres near Ferndale,
which included two small cabins, some farm implements, and a few livestock. In 1899, the
last Hovander child, Vera, was born in one of the cabins. Hokan designed a house and barn
based on traditional Scandinavian architectural features but which also incorporated
building techniques learned while working in the U.S. These buildings still stand on the
property today.</p>
<p>Hokan died in 1915 of chronic myocarditis, fifteen years after work on the house was
completed. Leontine died in 1936, as a result of complications from diabetes. All the
children married, except for Otis. Otis, a friendly and colorful local personality with wide
and varied interests, is well represented in the family papers. He was an avid stamp
collector and maintained a large correspondence with fellow collectors. Otis loved antique
cars and belonged to a vintage car club. He was a member of the Knights of Pythias and was
also interested in politics and automobile safety issues. Otis also enjoyed playing musical
instruments and once requested an audition with the Original Amateur Hour in New York City.
Otis shared the Hovander House with widowed sister Elsa from 1946 until her death in 1961.
Otis remained in the house until 1969, when he moved into the Lynden Rest home where he
resided until his death in 1979. </p>
<p>The papers of Elsa Hovander Stromee are also well represented in this collection. Elsa's
husband Karl owned and ran the Economy Print Shop in San Bernardino, California, which
employed Japanese and Chinese Americans and nationals. Karl died in 1946, after which Elsa
moved back to Whatcom County to live with Otis. </p>
<p>The Whatcom County Parks and Recreation Board purchased the Hovander property for $60,000
in 1969. Upon acquisition, the Parks Department repainted and refurbished the buildings and
continues to maintain the house today. A small working farmyard adjacent to the house was
restocked with typical farm animals. Farm implements were collected from many different
sources and displayed in the barn along with identifying labels. The house and grounds are
open to visitors. </p>

<p>Whatcom Falls Mill Company was located on Bellingham Bay, in the
northwestern corner of Washington State. The mill, located on Whatcom Creek in
Bellingham, was originally the Washington Colony Mill, positioned on a site
established by Henry Roeder and J.E. Peabody in 1853. In 1895, George W.
Loggie, along with his brother James A. Loggie, rented the Washington Colony
Mill, creating the Whatcom Falls Mill Company.</p>
<p>George W. Loggie and Samuel J. Knight filed papers for incorporation
of Whatcom Falls Mill Company 28 October 1895. The mill specialized in Western
Red Cedar and manufactured a variety of products including bevel siding, sash
and doors, and lumber. A new plant, built in 1903 at the bottom of “G” Street,
eventually produced only red cedar lumber and shingles. The company shipped its
product all over the world by rail and water. </p>
<p>Loggie formed a partnership with Pat McCoy of Seattle, who had large
timber holdings in the Kulshan district. The McCoy-Loggie Timber Company,
formed in 1910, had McCoy as its President with Loggie as Secretary and
Treasurer. The McCoy-Loggie Timber Company supplied the Whatcom Falls Mill with
lumber until the Timber Company dissolved in 1926.</p>
<p>The management of the mill was largely a family affair. G.W. Loggie
was President until his death in 1922. Upon his death, Loggie’s brother, James,
assumed the roll until 1933. D.H. Lowery, son-in-law of George, became
President in 1933, serving until the company filed dissolution papers on June
22, 1940. </p>
<p>George W. Loggie was born 22 June 1851 near Loggieville, New
Brunswick, Canada. In 1879, he came out west and began an extensive career in
the logging business, working at mills along the Puget Sound as well as in
Oregon. Oregon mills were located in cities such as Portland and Coos Bay,
where he spent time as general manager for the large Southern Oregon Company.
Washington mills include the Puget Sound Mill Company at Utsaladdy and Port
Gamble. Loggie eventually became superintendent of the Utsaladdy plant. He also
worked in Seattle, and established mills in Snohomish and Port Angeles in 1893.
