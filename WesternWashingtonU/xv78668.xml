        family, prominent local Whatcom County pioneers who immigrated to Ferndale in the early
        1900's. The head of the family, Hokan Hovander, was a well-known architect in Sweden who
        also did substantial architectural work for the city of Chicago after the 1871 fire. He also
        designed the Hovander Homestead house. Included are documents generated by researchers and
        Hovander/Tennant Lake park staff regarding the Hovander family. These documents were
        subsequently used by the park interpretive center and tour guides. </abstract>

    <bioghist encodinganalog="5450_">
      <p>Hokan (Hovander) Olsson was born on December 6, 1841, near Malmo, Sweden. Hokan's parents,
        Ola Persson and Else Nilsdatter, were semi-prosperous tenant farmers who struggled to
        support Hokan and his eight siblings, including Hokan's twin brother Christian. In 19th
        Century Sweden, tenant farming was a particularly difficult livelihood for most families.
        Only 10% of Sweden's land was arable and suitable for farming. In addition, Swedish laws
        stipulated that landowners must maintain their land parcels as a unit and were prohibited
        from dividing lands among heirs. As a result, many younger sons, such as Hokan, chose to
        migrate to large cities like Stockholm in search of more viable vocational prospects. Once
        in Stockholm, Hokan became an apprentice bricklayer by day and studied architecture in the
        evening. Sometime during the 1860s, Hokan changed his surname from Olsson to Hafvander
        (later Havander or Hovander). This name change probably reflected Hokan's desire to
        facilitate his architectural career by choosing a more distinctive name than the common
        "Olsson." </p>
      <p>In 1865, Hokan and his brother Christian left Sweden and travelled first to Australia and
        New Zealand and then to the United States, where they established separate homesteads in
        Kansas. Christian chose to remain in Kansas, but Hokan continued his travels in the U.S.,
        eventually migrating to Chicago. While in Chicago, Hokan returned to his chosen profession
        of architecture. In the wake of the devastating fire of 1871, he found ample opportunity to
        hone his architectural skills as he helped to rebuild the city. He also worked along the
        West Coast in San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. </p>
      <p>In 1879, He returned to Sweden and married Louisa Leontine Johandatter Lof and settled into
        family life and an architectural career. Although he was not officially licensed as an
        architect in Sweden, this period was particularly prolific for Hokan, and he completed many
        building and design projects during this time. Hokan's work in Sweden culminated with the
        creation of his most famous work, the "Mansion," a large residential building in Stockholm
        created in the Beaux Arts style. </p>
      <p>In 1885, Hokan succumbed to an episode of tuberculosis and was advised to spend some time
        in a warmer climate. Hokan, Leontine and their children, Hugo, Elsa and Otis embarked on a
        world cruise, traveling from Sweden to Australia and finally to San Francisco. In
        California, Elsa met her future husband, Karl Stromee. The Stromees and other transplanted
        Swedes convinced the Hovanders that immigration to the U.S. would be beneficial to both
        Hokan's health and the future of the children. After returning to Sweden and selling the
        "Mansion", the Hovander family set sail for New Zealand in 1896. By then, the family had
        grown to include three more children: Angelo, Charles and Ada. </p>
      <p>The Hovander family reached Seattle by 1897 but chose not to stay, complaining of noise and
        price inflation caused by Gold Rush fever. Instead, the family migrated north to Whatcom
        County. The Hovanders paid Betsey Nielson $4000 in gold coin for 60 acres near Ferndale,
        which included two small cabins, some farm implements, and a few livestock. In 1899, the
        last Hovander child, Vera, was born in one of the cabins. Hokan designed a house and barn
        based on traditional Scandinavian architectural features but which also incorporated
        building techniques learned while working in the U.S. These buildings still stand on the
        property today.</p>
      <p>Hokan died in 1915 of chronic myocarditis, fifteen years after work on the house was
        completed. Leontine died in 1936, as a result of complications from diabetes. All the
        children married, except for Otis. Otis, a friendly and colorful local personality with wide
        and varied interests, is well represented in the family papers. He was an avid stamp
        collector and maintained a large correspondence with fellow collectors. Otis loved antique
        cars and belonged to a vintage car club. He was a member of the Knights of Pythias and was
        also interested in politics and automobile safety issues. Otis also enjoyed playing musical
        instruments and once requested an audition with the Original Amateur Hour in New York City.
        Otis shared the Hovander House with widowed sister Elsa from 1946 until her death in 1961.
        Otis remained in the house until 1969, when he moved into the Lynden Rest home where he
        resided until his death in 1979. </p>
      <p>The papers of Elsa Hovander Stromee are also well represented in this collection. Elsa's
        husband Karl owned and ran the Economy Print Shop in San Bernardino, California, which
        employed Japanese and Chinese Americans and nationals. Karl died in 1946, after which Elsa
        moved back to Whatcom County to live with Otis. </p>
      <p>The Whatcom County Parks and Recreation Board purchased the Hovander property for $60,000
        in 1969. Upon acquisition, the Parks Department repainted and refurbished the buildings and
        continues to maintain the house today. A small working farmyard adjacent to the house was
        restocked with typical farm animals. Farm implements were collected from many different
        sources and displayed in the barn along with identifying labels. The house and grounds are
        open to visitors. </p>

      <p>The Hovander Family and Park Papers consist of papers created by the Hovander family as
        well as material generated by Hovander Homestead Park staff. The bulk of the Hovander family
        materials were created and collected by Hokan, Elsa, and Otis Hovander, with other family
        members making up the remainder. </p>
      <p>This collection includes correspondence, architectural drawings, maps, notes and writings,
        newspaper clippings, canceled checks, deposit slips, bank statements, tax records, legal
        documents, pamphlets &amp; broadsides, photographs, Park reference materials and oral
        histories. A few of these oral histories include an audiocassette and full transcript, while
        most have only a short transcript. Roughly half of the total family correspondence is
        written in Swedish without accompanying translations. The other subseries also contain some
        Swedish language materials. </p>
      <p>The photographs included in this collection provide not only a detailed account of the
        lives of the Hovander family, but also depict life on the farm and the many travels taken by
        members of the family. Included are many photographs of Paris, Germany, and Stockholm at the
        turn of the 20th century, as well as the family's multiple trips to San Francisco and
        southern California in the early half of that century. Early events in Whatcom County are
        also included. Parades, photographs of schools, and other views of downtown Bellingham and
        portions of Ferndale are numerous within the collection. </p>
