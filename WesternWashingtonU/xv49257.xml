      <!--Use heading Historical Note for corporate history-->
      <p>The Druzea Club was formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1937 in the
		  home of Mrs. Maude Fischer with the express purpose of facilitating mental
		  improvement and social enjoyment for its members. In 1938 the club joined the
		  Washington State Federation of Women’s Clubs and enjoyed a long association
		  with this umbrella organization.</p>
      <p>Druzea is a Russian word meaning ‘friendship’ which was to be the root
		  of the Druzea Club’s purpose in the local and regional communities. The club
		  was active in a number of service projects which included aiding needy families
		  during the holidays, collecting magazines for monthly drop-off at the Juvenile
		  Detention quarters of the Court House, sponsoring a rural school through the
		  Save the Children Federation, assisting in the restoration of the Whatcom
		  Museum as well as engaging in war service projects during World War II. </p>
      <p>Library service was also one of the main focuses of the Druzea Club,
		  which took an active role in the formation of Friends of the Bellingham Public
		  Library in October 1952. The club was also involved in the establishment of a
		  library at Pt. Roberts by furnishing books and magazines to the local
		  community. </p>
      <p>The Druzea Club was active as well in supporting State and General
		  Federation of Women’s Clubs projects and also gave financial assistance to the
		  Heart, Cancer, and Polio funds, the local food bank, the Indian Youth Mission,
		  the Home for Abused Women and the Salvation Army. The club also acted as a
		  leadership training ground in that five of its members eventually became
		  Federation of Women’s Clubs district presidents, three were general chairman to
		  the state convention when it was held in Bellingham, and several members went
		  on to become state officers and department chairs. This connection with the
		  Federation was cherished by club members and fortified their resolve to
		  continue actively supporting their local and regional communities. The club
		  celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1987 and has since disbanded. </p>

      <p>The Druzea Club records (1937-1987) contain textual materials which
		  document the history of the club’s volunteer and community service activities
		  as well as the active role the group played within the Washington State
		  Federation of Women’s Clubs.</p>
      <p>The materials primarily consist of club scrapbooks which are organized
		  chronologically. Scrapbooks contain numerous clippings from the Bellingham
		  Herald and the Washington Clubwoman regarding the activities of the club,
		  certificates of award from the Washington State Federation of Women’s Clubs,
		  photographs of club members, thank you letters to the club, yearly membership
		  and officers lists as well as numerous ephemera from various functions and
		  gatherings.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains materials relating to the Washington
		  State Federation of Women’s Clubs of which the Druzea Club was an active part.
		  These materials include Bellingham-hosted convention booklets, club bylaws, a
		  1986-87 directory and speech and communication help-manuals. These materials
		  can help in the establishment of the connection between the Druzea Club and the
		  umbrella organization of the Federation. </p>
