<p>The charts and lithographs described in this guide were part of a larger selection of rare books collected by Dorothy Stimson Bullitt (1892-1989) and donated to the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies by her daughters, Priscilla Collins and Harriet Bullitt, in 1992. Bullitt, founder of the founder of the King Broadcasting Company, is known for her pioneering work in radio and television, as well as involvement in civic matters and the arts. The original donation to the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies included a range of bound rare books and accounts of early eighteenth century exploration. The majority of these books have now been transferred to Western Libraries Special Collections and are part of its rare book collection. At least some of the remaining, oversize charts and lithographs are believed once to have been bound together.</p>
