      <p>The Morse Hardware Company is one of the oldest mercantile businesses
		  in the Northwest region and is also one of the oldest, continually operating
		  family owned businesses in the area. The company was founded by Robert I.
		  Morse, who sold his property in San Francisco and used the proceeds to purchase
		  $3000 worth of hardware, paints, glass and other supplies and sailed for
		  Bellingham Bay in 1884, determined to find a role in the booming economy of the
		  Pacific Northwest . </p>
      <p>Morse located his store near the waterfront at 1039 Elk St. and
		  established his personal residence on the second floor. Initially, the store
		  operated solely as a retail operation, but the success of the Morse
		  merchandizing slogan "Sell 'em Low, Send and Get More" generated a loyal and
		  growing customer base. As the business expanded Morse entered the wholesale
		  trade as a supplier to the burgeoning number of crossroad establishments that
		  served the growing population in the region. </p>
      <p>The expansion of the railroad in the 1890's facilitated the shipment
		  of supplies and merchandise and promoted additional growth in the business. The
		  advent of World War I generated a demand for lumber and hardware for
		  ship-building. The company supplied this endeavor and used the proceeds to
		  expand into the Alaska cannery business, eventually becoming the dominant
		  supplier of hardware and other supplies to this industry. </p>
      <p>Upon the death of Robert I. Morse in 1920, his eldest son, Cecil A.
		  Morse, assumed the duties of the president and general manager of Morse
		  Hardware. Cecil held the company together during the Great Depression and
		  although most employees accepted wage and salary reductions, the company
		  managed to avoid any layoffs. Cecil's presidency also oversaw expansion in
		  sales and marketing with sales territories and staff growing farther afield.
		  World War II spurred an expansion of the industrial supply division of Morse
		  Hardware as the company furnished shipyards with the supplies necessary to
		  sustain the war effort. The company also purchased several new buildings
		  adjacent to the original store to house a growing inventory.</p>
      <p>After fifty-seven years in the business, Cecil Morse died in 1958 and
		  David C. Morse, the youngest son of the founder, became president. David
		  continued to expand distribution markets by making new inroads in Alaska and
		  Oregon. In 1960, the store closed its individual retail outlet and focused
		  operations on wholesale distribution to retail stores and heavy industry. The
		  primary customer base became lumber yards, retail outlets, and home centers in
		  western Washington, northern Oregon and Alaska. Industrial supply sales were
		  complimented by the movement of the Mobil Oil Company refinery and the Intalco
		  Aluminum Corporation in Whatcom County. Georgia Pacific and the Atlantic
		  Richfield Co. also became Morse customers. In 1963, the company became a member
		  of PRO Hardware, Inc. PRO was a voluntary international organization of
		  wholesalers with several distributors located in the United States. The
		  organization assisted wholesalers in developing and distributing merchandizing,
		  marketing and promotional programs. Morse hardware successfully implemented the
		  program through 50 of its dealers throughout western Washington and Alaska.</p>
      <p>In 1975, Bob Morse, grandson of the original founder assumed the
		  presidency. The final decades of the 20th Century witnessed significant change
		  in business focus. In 1994, Morse Hardware Co. announced that it would cease
		  supplying wholesale hardware goods to retailer stores and lay off 25 workers.
		  And, in November of 1998, the company announced that it would sell its
		  industrial supply division with operations in Bellingham and Tacoma to Stellar
		  Industrial and Construction Supply. Stellar leased the original Morse Hardware
		  site in Bellingham and Morse operations in Tacoma changed its name to Stellar.
		  Prior to the sale, the Morse industrial division distributed nearly 12,000
		  items, including hand and power tools, cutting tools and abrasives, and mill
		  and construction supplies. The sale allowed the company to focus on its core
		  business, Morse Steel Service, which continues in successful operation in
		  Bellingham. The warehouse building is a large tilt up concrete structure with
		  two 55 foot bays served by seven overhead five and ten ton bridge cranes. The
		  operation requires specialized machinery including a 5/8 inch shear, acetylene
		  and plasma computerized cutting equipment, automatic saws, rebar bending
		  machine, and an iron monger to fulfill diverse customer requirements. The
		  product base is carbon steel, cut to all shapes and sizes, and utilized by
		  fabricators, building constructors, and heavy industry. </p>
      <p>The original building on State Street, houses the offices of the steel
		  business. Morse Steel service also operates a similar, but smaller steel
		  warehouse in Wenatchee. </p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The Morse Hardware Company records consist of three specific series
		  spanning the years 1891-1999. These series are: 1) The records of the Morse
		  Hardware Company, 2) Morse Family Materials, and 3) Bellingham and Whatcom
		  County Historical Materials. The first series, the company records, comprise
		  the bulk of the collection. This series includes Board of Directors meeting
		  minutes, stockholder minutes, extensive financial material including ledgers
		  and account books, sales records, invoices, daybooks, cash books, shipping and
		  freight records, taxes, leases and other property records which document growth
		  and change in business activity. The records also include extensive material
		  documenting employees and employee functions. Marketing, merchandise and
		  customer relations played an increasingly important role as the company grew
		  and flourished. A large section of the collection documents this activity and
		  includes a number of sales catalogs generated by Morse Hardware and other
		  companies. These catalogs were used by the Morse sales staff as they canvassed
		  their respective territories. Finally, the Morse company records include
		  subject files maintained in the main office which document the humor, general
		  interests, and business philosophy of the Morse family. The final two series
		  were created by members of Morse family and include pamphlets, maps,
		  photographs and manuscript material, which document the history of Morse
		  Hardware and the history of the local community and which underscore the
		  important role that this family-owned business served in the local community
		  and the regional economy. </p>
