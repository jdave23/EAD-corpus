Smohalla. Randy Lewis and Nettie discuss losing the long house at Priest Rapids to the
wind. Nettie speaks about her husband, Alba, who was half Wanapum and half Yakama.
Nettie explains the difference between a "drummer" and a "dreamer." Dreamers or the
Wasklik are of the feather dance. Wasklik have more power, like the Shaker Indian
doctor. The <emph render="italic">Washat</emph>, or drummers, don't dream, they just
believe there is a heaven. Nettie and Randy Lewis list the Indian doctors in the
Valley and the surrounding area. Nettie and Randy Lewis speak about the Chinook dances
in the winter where <emph render="italic">Wasklik</emph>, or Indian doctors must prove
themselves. There are different categories or degrees of Indian doctors, like the
strongest would be the Bluejays. Nettie speaks about the preparation that is needed
before roots are gathered in the springtime. This is part of Washat. There is the root
feast in the spring time, then the salmon feast, and berry feast. Nettie speaks about
having a root feast in Wanapum after gathering the roots. Nettie discusses the people
involved in the gathering party as well as the doings at night after the gathering of
roots. Nettie speaks about peeling the roots and then going to sweat. The next morning
the cooking begins early, and everyone in the long house must wear new clothing for
the root feast. Nettie explains about the significance of the seven drums for Washa.
Randy Lewis concludes that Smohalla was not the founder of Washa, but was more a
prognosticator for it. Randy Lewis adds that only those who belong to Washat have the
right know about it. Transcript available.</p>

July and November of 1995 and April of 1996. Also included in this series are a few other
newsletters from other HOW county coalitions.</p>
<p>Speaker and workshop files record the training of both organizational members and
educational speakers. Speaker training packets constitute the majority of this series; they
contain question and answer sections, samples speeches, newspaper articles, speaking
techniques and advice, and other resources pertinent for the training of HOW educational
speakers. These files illustrate one method by which HOW ensured that discriminatory
initiatives, such as 608 and 610, did not make it on the ballot. With the assistance of
public speaking engagements along with public events, and education, they successfully
prohibited these initiatives.</p>
<p>The most extensive of the HOW, Whatcom County Coalition Council records are the subject
files. Subjects cover a wide spectrum of gay and lesbian issues from HIV/AIDS and sexual
orientation research to supportive religious statements and other like minded organizations.
HOW also amassed a wide variety of materials pertaining to oppositional organizations. These
materials consist of both local and national organizations from conservative groups like
Focus on the Family, Lynden Youth Action Coalition, Colorado for Family Values and Paul
Cameron to Newt Gingrich, Militias, and other hate groups. Formats in this series include
articles, pamphlets, newspaper and magazine clippings, emails, press releases, activity
fliers, and other printed material. Subject files were maintained in the order that HOW
originally utilized them. They are coded in parentheses from 100 to 1000 and arranged by
subject.</p>
<p> The reference files are mostly articles, organized by title. They contain many of the same
themes contained within the subject files. Articles such as âIdeas for Handling Distress
Patterns and Attacksâ and âDealing with Homophobiaâ are found in these files. Similar to the
subject files, the reference files contain information from and about conservative
oppositional organizations. Opposition materials, such as âViolence and the Far Rightâ and
âThe Rightâs Agenda,â make up the majority of the reference files. Also included in these
files are various reports, workshop information, and newspaper clippings about gay and
lesbian issues. </p>
<p>There is also ephemera which contain banners, buttons and stickers relating to HOW and
their public outreach campaign. The audio visual material contains video tapes and audio
cassettes of programs pertaining to gay and lesbian issues. </p>

<p>The Morse Hardware Company records consist of three specific series
spanning the years 1891-1999. These series are: 1) The records of the Morse
Hardware Company, 2) Morse Family Materials, and 3) Bellingham and Whatcom
County Historical Materials. The first series, the company records, comprise
the bulk of the collection. This series includes Board of Directors meeting
minutes, stockholder minutes, extensive financial material including ledgers
and account books, sales records, invoices, daybooks, cash books, shipping and
freight records, taxes, leases and other property records which document growth
and change in business activity. The records also include extensive material
documenting employees and employee functions. Marketing, merchandise and
customer relations played an increasingly important role as the company grew
and flourished. A large section of the collection documents this activity and
includes a number of sales catalogs generated by Morse Hardware and other
companies. These catalogs were used by the Morse sales staff as they canvassed
their respective territories. Finally, the Morse company records include
subject files maintained in the main office which document the humor, general
interests, and business philosophy of the Morse family. The final two series
were created by members of Morse family and include pamphlets, maps,
photographs and manuscript material, which document the history of Morse
Hardware and the history of the local community and which underscore the
important role that this family-owned business served in the local community
and the regional economy. </p>

<p> The David T. Mason Papers reflect the varied interests and research pursuits of this
beloved Fairhaven professor and include a small portion of materials relating to the lives
of his parents, Lucile (Roush) and Herbert Mason. </p>
<p>Family and Personal papers contains correspondence, photographs and background information
about Mason and his immediate family. The Mason and Roush family photographs date from
approximately 1865 to the middle of the 1900s and document Herbert Masonâs research
expeditions to the arctic during the early 1900s, Yosemite National Park field school,
Stanford and Berkeley, California, as well as a host of botanical and geological locations.
This series documents his school and formative years, including his experimentation with LSD
in the mid 1960s, teaching and scholarly pursuits, and ongoing contact with family, male and
female lovers, and friends.</p>
<p>Records pertaining to Mason's education and career comprise the core of his collection,
including samples of course materials (lectures and notes) from classes he taught at Western
Washington University and at Fairhaven College from the 1970s through the 1990s. Course
materials include a clippings file from Mason's Gay Studies class from the early 1970s, as
well as handwritten lectures from popular and well-attended biology and ecology classes.
Education and Career records also contains project notes, data, published, and unpublished
research papers about various sites Mason explored including the Alaskan Arctic, Mono Lake
and other sites in California, the Stehekin River in Whatcom County, Washington, and
Georgia-Pacific mill among others as well as correspondence and reports from Masonâs
sabbaticals and Fulbright travels. The Mason Education records also include slides and field
notebooks from Mason's various research projects. Slides include images of people,
landmarks, plants, and animals from Bellingham and his world travels. There are also images
of theater works and other artistic projects. Locations of slides and field notebooks
include: Alaska, Australia, Antarctica, South America, Africa, the Philippines, and
Japan.</p>
<p>This collection also contains speeches, lectures, publications and letters of appreciation
regarding Masonâs popular and dynamic traveling multi-media slideshows. The collection
contains scripts and musical compositions from Friends of Fairhaven Theater productions in
which Mason played the vital roles of producer, director, actor and musician. Writings and
Art contain samples of Mason's creative writing, drawings, musings, and include several
one-of-a-kind local gay publications. </p>

The Collection of Aerial Photographs comprises over 30,000 individual images from aerial
surveys conducted in different areas of the Pacific Northwest including the
northwest counties and National Forest Lands of Washington State. The majority of
images in the collection are from aerial surveys conducted by US government
agencies, including the USDA Forest Service and Washington Department of Natural
Resources. These include coverage of Whatcom County, the Mt. Baker National Forest
and other National Forest and Parks lands in Washington. The collection also
includes some coverage of other Washington counties and U.S. states. For example, a
small group of images document survey work conducted for the Alaska-Canada Highway
during the 1930s. The collection is a valuable resource for researchers interested
in environmental history and change (including forestation, glaciation and
waterways), and supports fields of inquiry relating to habitat restoration, urban
growth studies and property history. Researchers should be aware that coverage for
locations or flight surveys may not be comprehensive and that CPNWS cannot guarantee
coverage and images for all areas of interest. In some cases, the collection may
contain an index for a flight without any accompanying images (or vice versa). </p>

<p>The Buswell papers and photographs consists of primary source material
collected by self-trained historian Howard Buswell during his lifetime.
Researchers must pay particular attention to the fact that in his collecting
efforts and in his writings Buswell provides an interpretation of history that
reflects his own biases and the time period in which he lived. The items
included in the collection cover nearly all aspects of social and economic life
of the lower Nooksack Valley and North Puget Sound areas in Washington State
from the time of the first contact between white settlers and Native Americans
to the early decades of the twentieth century. He was also interested in the
Lummi culture and the collection contains a good deal of source material
related to the history of this tribe. </p>
<p>The collection consists of thirty boxes of material including
correspondence, duplicates of primary source material, indexes and lists,
business records, transcripts of interviews, copies of legal documents,
scrapbooks and newspaper clipping. The collection also includes 16 boxes of
photographs, 10 boxes of microfilm, over 2000 maps, and 3 boxes of reel to reel
audio tapes of oral history interviews. </p>
<p>The correspondence begins in 1938 and ends in 1965 with the main
purpose of assembling materials and other evidence on pioneer settlement in the
Marietta/Lummi area. The bulk of the letters, however, relate to historical
materials held in various archives and other repositories or else are inquiries
to the latter about such materials. The correspondence is arranged in
chronological order with the original letter attached to the reply. The indexes
and lists are, for the most part, lists and indexes of various materials Howard
Buswell collected. It should be noted though that the present organization of
the Buswell papers and photographs is often radically different from the
arrangement suggested by the indexes. The Bernard N. McDonough business records
include miscellaneous private and business letters, receipts and bills, various
legal documents, and a number of account books kept in McDonough's Marietta
store. The legal documents and papers have been arranged in part according to
subject, in part according to type, and in part according to the court of
origin. They are composed of a variety of legal records ranging from business
records to transcripts of select court cases. </p>

<p>Howard E. Buswell: This is January the 15th 1960. About the third of the way through this reel of tape is a tape
of a religious discourse by the late Mrs. John Brown. Formerly Mrs. Johanna Guerin. I believe her maiden name was
Johanna Ti'elish. Or Johanna George Ti'elish. I just played it over after a lapse of several years since Mrs. Brown
and her husband John have been dead for two or three years now, and I found it of considerable interest. I meant
this in the fact that there is an unoccupied piece of tape for quite a ways. After Mrs. Brown's discourse is a sermon.
And other services at the Marietta Mission. It is run by the Reverend and Mrs. Walter Harnden. The Mormons that continue
on the religious, the religion of the Lummi people, the Mormons have a mission here in the house formerly occupied and
owned by Mr. Chris Iyland. I do not believe, besides the Mormons, and Reverend Harnden's Mission, that there are any
other active religious groups on the reservation except the Roman Catholics, who have had a church there for many years.
But in the past decades or two why various Protestant groups have come in, but none of them have seem to have shown the
stick-to-itiveness that the Mormons and Reverend Harnden's Mission have. The Shaker's have a church over there, but I
don't believe it is being used now. Mrs. Brown was a very devout Christian woman. She and her husband use to go to the
Catholic Church, but they for some reason or another, they found that they were not getting what they wanted. So they
turned their backs on it, and became followers of revivalists such as Oral Roberts. Mrs. Brown always went to his revivals
meetings when he was in the area. And she is telling in her discourse here, something about her observations and
experiences of while he was having his services. I don't know whether it was in Portland, Oregon or Tacoma. But
somewhere within easy traveling distance of this location. </p>
<p>Cassette Tape # 1: Mrs. John Brown (Johanna Guerin/Ti'elish) recounts her observations of the healings and miracles she has
witnessed through prayer. She calls this, "to lay hands on the sick." She then reads a letter she received from Oral Roberts,
an evangelical preacher. Following this she reads or preaches from memory a sermon based on Bible scriptures. She, throughout,
emphasizes the healing miracles she has witnessed by Oral Roberts. One example is an Indian man, she recalls from Neah Bay
who was healed. The interview segways into a broadcast of Oral Roberts entitled the "Indian Christian Hour" which appeared on KVOS. </p>
<p>Cassette Tape #2: Oral Roberts' TV program continues. Many hymns are sung (in English). Indian people are asked to come
forward and give their testimony. A service by Rev. Harnden follows given at the Marietta Indian Mission. Rev. Harnden notes:
"Don't be called among those, a rebellious people." </p>

<p>Cassette Tape #1: Philip Clark speaks of "Dirty" Dan Harris. His physical description, and character. The history of his properties in Fairhaven.
Covers a period to 1891, when Dan Harris left. Tells the legend of what happened to Dan Harris after he left the Bellingham area.
Dan Harris' exact location in Fairhaven on Dead Man's Point. Dan Harris known to do business in Marietta. He would come over by

<p> The Jack Metcalf Papers document two decades of Metcalfâs political
career as a Washington State Senator and United States Congressman. Collection
materials span the period 1973-2001, with the bulk of materials dated
1981-2000. Pre-congressional records comprise approximately one linear foot of
material generated during Metcalfâs final years as a Senator in the Washington
State Legislature (1981-1993). Alphabetically-arranged Legislative Issue files
document Metcalfâs long-standing opposition to the U.S. Federal Reserve, and
his role as head of the Senate Environmental and Natural Resources Committee
between 1988-1992. These files include correspondence, reports, surveys and
articles reflecting communication and conflict between the Washington State
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Washington Wildlife Commission, Tribes
and other interest groups over hunting rights and restrictions.
Pre-congressional materials also contain a small number of awards and
certificates of appreciation Metcalf received for his legislative work. With
the exception of one âOutstanding Senatorâ award from 1973, the collection does
not document Metcalfâs activities in the Washington State Legislature prior to

<p>Congressional Records document Jack Metcalfâs role and interests as
representative for Washington Stateâs 2nd Congressional District between 1994
and 2000. The majority of Congressional records were generated at Metcalfâs
offices in Washington D.C., with a smaller amount of material (approximately
three linear feet) from his District Office in Everett, Washington. </p>
<p>D.C. Office materials include a significant number of âLegislative
Issueâ files, grouped together according to subject (A-Z). These files include
variously correspondence, memos, notes, statements, articles, and draft
legislation pertaining to twenty-four broad areas of legislative concern. Many
of Metcalfâs political activities focused on issues of immediate significance
to the Pacific Northwest and his constituents in Washington State. Legislative
Issue files document his roles in securing appropriations for transportation
projects in the Puget Sound region, and seeking relief for fishers affected
adversely by the downturn in the fishing industry at the end of the twentieth
century. The collection documents many of the ongoing conflicts between
environmental and commercial interests over protection, use and development of
local resources, including National Park and National Forest Land, fisheries,
waterways, and industrial clean-up sites. Whale and Marine Mammal files detail
Metcalfâs active opposition to whaling by the Makah Indian Tribe in Neah Bay,
Washington, while Water and Shipping files record his bipartisan efforts to
enact the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative (1998). The
collection contains press clippings, correspondence, statements, hearings
transcripts and reports documenting the aftermath of the June 10, 1999 gas
pipeline explosion at Whatcom Creek in Bellingham, Washington, and subsequent
attempts by legislators and community organizations to enact pipeline safety
legislation. </p>
<p>Legislative issue files pertaining to Aviation, Defense and US
Military, Education, and Housing reflect Metcalfâs active support for local
military contract bids, concern with the interests of local military families,
his investigations into Gulf War Syndrome, and his active support for homeless
veterans programs. Materials related to Defense and the Executive Branch record
Metcalfâs opposition to Clintonâs alleged expansion and misuse of executive
authority, notably through his troop deployments in Kosovo. Legislative Issue
files also document Metcalfâs legislative involvement in areas of Banking and
Investment, Agricultural, Health and Immigration policy, Energy Provision,
Science and Telecommunications, Tribal Issues and International Trade and
Foreign Affairs. </p>
<p>Metcalfâs D.C. Office Files include correspondence files dated
1995-2000. The majority of letters are outgoing from Metcalf (often in
coalition with other legislators) to correspondents including the President,
White House officials, the Speaker of the House, leaders of House Committees,
and key figures in the private and non-government sector. Press Files comprise
photographs, press statements and releases pertaining to Metcalfâs legislative
concerns, and partial documentation of Metcalfâs congressional voting record.
D.C. Office files also include a small number of awards and certificates
Metcalf earned for his legislative work. </p>
<p>Metcalfâs congressional papers also contain a smaller amount of
material (approximately three linear feet) generated at Metcalfâs District
Office in Everett, Washington. The bulk of District Office records are
subject-based Legislative Issue files. Articles, hearing transcripts and
reports document Metcalfâs investigation into links between military vaccines
and Gulf War Illnesses among Persian Gulf veterans, and include a copy of his
2000 report entitled Potential Role of Squalene in Gulf War Illnesses,
submitted to the House Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs, and
International Relations. The subseries also contains materials regarding
military issues and local military bases, Lummi Indian Nation requests for
federal assistance, Swinomish leaseholds and water rights, the local fishing
industry and regional transportation and environmental projects. District
office files include a further number of awards and certificates presented to

<p>The Archie W. Shiels papers consist of research material,
publications, personal papers, maps and charts dating from around 1790 to 1965.
The bulk of the materials date from around 1850 to 1950.</p>
<p>Research materials date from circa 1797 to 1964, and represent the
background sources Shiels used for writing his many manuscripts, books, and
speeches. The documents reference a number of topics primarily related to
Pacific Northwestern history and, in particular, Russian America, the Alaskan
Territory, and the State of Alaska. Specific subjects include Alaska's
annexation to the United States and its eventual statehood, subsequent boundary
disputes, as well as the Bering Sea controversy regarding fur seal fishing.
Other topics cover the fishing and fur industries in Russia and Alaska, Alaska
Nativesâ fishing rights, maritime and navigation, oil and geology, and
transportation throughout Alaska, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Publications date from around 1846 to 1965, and contain items authored
by Shiels and other individuals that are related to Alaskan topics and the
Pacific American Fisheries company. Some of the rarer books written by Shiels
included <emph render="underline">Sewardâs Ice Box: A Few Notes on the
Development of Alaska, 1867-1931</emph> (written in 1933), and
<emph render="underline">The Early History of Canned Foods</emph> (written in
1940). Other authorsâ works include Lieutenant L.A. Zagoskinâs
<emph render="underline">Account of Pedestrian Journeys in the Russian
Possessions in America</emph> (undated), and J.M. Shivelyâs âRoute and
Distances to Oregon and California with a Description of Watering Places,
Crossing, Dangerous Indians, etc. (written in 1846).</p>
<p>Personal papers date from circa 1800 to 1962, and include documents
belonging to Shiels, but generally unrelated to his research regarding Alaskan
history. For example, these materials include a number of documents created by
and/or retained by Shiels during his tenure at the Pacific American Fisheries.
Cannery blueprints, canning industry publications, and a letter from Filipino
cannery workers protesting their working conditions are a few examples of items
located in Shielsâ personal papers. Additionally, there are photographs and
negatives documenting Shielsâ career and personal life, and other Northwestern
themes.</p>
<p>Maps and charts date from around 1910 to 1944, and comprise early
representations of Alaskan, Canadian, and Pacific Northwestern territories,
cities, and surrounding areas. Some of the maps relate to early transportation
in these regions, including maritime, railroad, and highway routes.</p>

<p>The Whatcom Falls Mill Company Records and George W. Loggie Papers
span the years 1886 to 1978, with the bulk of the material dated 1895-1940. The
collection primarily documents the story of Whatcom Falls Mill Company. The
remaining papers focus on Loggie's personal life. Little is known as to how the
collection arrived at the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies; however, it is
clearly a compilation of records from many facets of Loggieâs life. Few of the
personal papers are truly family oriented, and focus instead, on Loggieâs other
business interests prior to the creation of Whatcom Falls Mill Company.</p>
<p>The first series of papers documents the business activities of
Whatcom Falls Mill Company from its incorporation in 1895 to its dissolution in
1940. Included are administrative and financial records, correspondence,
operations information, maps and drawings, and various advertising materials,
including a business envelope with a picture of the original mill, and business
cards printed on cedar. Included in this series are several records relating to
the McCoy-Loggie Timber Company. While not a subsidiary company, the Timber
Company supplied lumber to the mill, and records from both companies appear to
have been kept together. Enriching The Whatcom Falls Mill Company Records are
photographs of Whatcom Falls Mill, including a photo of a drawing of the
original mill, two Brubaker aerial surveys, and one Sandison aerial survey.
</p>
<p>Separate from both the Whatcom Falls Mill Company Records and the
George W. Loggie Papers is information included on other regional lumber mills.
This information, collected after Loggie's death in 1922, bears no immediate
connections to Whatcom Falls Mill. It was possibly collected in order to assess
the competition of other regional mills. Included in this series is information
on the Bloedel-Donovan Lumber Mill, as well as Wood &amp; English Limited. </p>
<p>The remainder of the collection focuses on personal materials of the
Loggie family, and in particular, the business activities of George W. Loggie
prior to his work with Whatcom Falls Mill Company. Included is early
correspondence of George W. Loggie, primarily with regard to his previous mill
experience in Oregon; papers, a ledger, and booklets that document G.W.
Loggieâs interest in Trotting Horses; copies of the certificate of Registry of
the Schooner Vigilant; a Family Expense Ledger (dated after G.W. Loggieâs
death); and family photos. Also included are photographs of other mills, as
well as those depicting various aspects of logging and milling operations. Some
of these photos date to the 1880s and 1890s. Identified mills include
Bloedel-Donovan, as well as other mills on Bellingham Bay, the Olympic
Peninsula, and mills near the Cascade Mountains. The Family Expense Ledger,
page 151, contains genealogical material of interest regarding the Lowery
family. </p>
<p>The following items are of special note: Materials regarding the
Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union and Whatcom Falls Mill Company, including
correspondence and newspaper clippings dealing with the workers' strike in
1937; a 1914 Kroll Atlas section map showing McCoy land as well as other lumber
and mill company property; an 1887 Map Guide to the City of Seattle, Washington
Territory surveyed by Whitworth and Thomson which was probably a real estate
map; and a December 10, 1895 copy of the newspaper Daily Reveille. </p>
<p>The artifacts in this collection include a wallet owned by George W.
Loggie, and Volume VI of the 14-volume set of Houghâs American Woods is also
part of this collection. Romeyn Beck Hough wrote and published the set between
1888 and 1928. Each volume consists of twenty-five species of trees specific to
a particular part of the United States. Volume VI represents trees of the
Pacific Slope. Actual wood samples of each tree are included; cut in thin
sections to show the various planes of the wood (transverse, radial, and

<p>The M. L. (Marc La Riviere) Stangroom papers document the early career
and activities of an engineer for the Bellingham Bay &amp; British Columbia
Railroad. The collection spans the years 1855-2005, with the bulk of the
material ranging from 1855-1968. Stangroom's personal papers include a resume
and fifteen-page report regarding the construction of the Bellingham Bay &amp;
British Columbia railroad (for which he served as engineer). </p>
<p>The bulk of the collection comprises letters from Stangroom to his
mother and siblings regarding his travels and experiences in the western United
States. In a letter dated 1855, Stangroom writes of his plan to go to the
United States from India to enjoy better business prospects. Subsequent
correspondence documents Stangroomâs experiences in California and the
Sierra-Nevada region circa 1855-1873. His letters include reference to the
Chinese quarter of Sacramento, the Placerville mining community, and the
adverse road and weather conditions he encountered during his travels.
Stangroom describes his experiences prospecting for gold in the Sierra Nevadas,
life in the mining town of Michigan Bluff in Placer County, California, and the
mining processes of the 1850s and 1860s. He writes of a town destroyed by fire
in 1856, and also of interactions between white settlers and Native Americans.
A June 1858 letter describes how Californians are driven âstark raving madâ by
the lure of gold in British Columbia, with hundreds of men leaving daily for
the Fraser River. Later letters from 1865 and 1866 refer to Stangroomâs work
for the Western Pacific Railroad, and to surveying a line between Sacramento
and Stockton. </p>
<p>Stangroomâs letters provide rich description of western landscapes
including California redwood forests and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The
correspondence reveals aspects of his personal and family life, including his
courtship and eventual marriage to Emily Stewart in December 1856 in Sulphur
Springs, California. An 1857 letter reflects the isolation of many miners and
California settlers: when Emily Stangroom falls ill, there is no physician
nearby to attend her. </p>
<p>The collection also contains condolence letters to Stangroomâs
daughter Zoe Stangroom Kindall, written after the death of her husband, and
newspaper clippings documenting M. L. Stangroomâs achievements. Other documents
include an affidavit from Mabel Stangroom Egan affirming her relationship to
her sister, Zoe Stangroom. </p>

the annual Christmas bird counts (CBCs) ââ¦began in 1900 as an alternative to
the traditional Christmas âside hunt,â where the objective was to KILL as many
birds as you could. Ornithologist Frank Chapman called for an end to this
slaughter by suggesting that, rather than shooting birds, people count them
instead.â NCAS sponsors two local Christmas bird counts: âBellinghamâ and
