      <p>Howard E. Buswell was born on April 22, 1895, on his family's farm
		  near Ferndale, Washington. In 1906, the Buswell family moved to land near
		  Marietta, Washington on Bellingham Bay. There, except for a short period during
		  and right after World War I, Howard Buswell lived out the remainder of his
		  life.</p>
      <p>Buswell's early education was acquired at various elementary and high
		  schools in Ferndale, Marietta, and Bellingham, Washington. During World War I
		  he served in the United States Navy, and on discharge he continued for a short
		  time at sea in the merchant navy. He then worked briefly in the insurance
		  industry with the Metropolitan Life Company. </p>
      <p>Two years at the State College of Washington, now Washington State
		  University, in the early 1920s were followed by a year at the Bellingham Normal
		  School, now Western Washington University. After obtaining his teaching
		  certificate at the Normal School, he began teaching elementary school in
		  Cosmopolis, Washington in Grays Harbor County. Poor health, however, cut short
		  his career in education and he was forced to retire. </p>
      <p>For the remaining forty or so years of his life, he lived on the
		  family farm, raising chickens and processing cider in association with his
		  brother, Ray. It was during these years that he began his research into local
		  history, undertaking many "projects", as he called them. These "projects" took
		  him to libraries, museums, and court houses across the country, and led to the
		  voluminous correspondence with archivists and librarians in many of the major
		  repositories in the United States and several in Canada as well. He intended to
		  write a local history book on Marietta and the nearby Lummi Reservation,
		  however, he was still gathering materials at the time of his death in 1965 and
		  his book was never completed. </p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The Buswell papers and photographs consists of primary source material
		  collected by self-trained historian Howard Buswell during his lifetime.
		  Researchers must pay particular attention to the fact that in his collecting
		  efforts and in his writings Buswell provides an interpretation of history that
		  reflects his own biases and the time period in which he lived. The items
		  included in the collection cover nearly all aspects of social and economic life
		  of the lower Nooksack Valley and North Puget Sound areas in Washington State
		  from the time of the first contact between white settlers and Native Americans
		  to the early decades of the twentieth century. He was also interested in the
		  Lummi culture and the collection contains a good deal of source material
		  related to the history of this tribe. </p>
      <p>The collection consists of thirty boxes of material including
		  correspondence, duplicates of primary source material, indexes and lists,
		  business records, transcripts of interviews, copies of legal documents,
		  scrapbooks and newspaper clipping. The collection also includes 16 boxes of
		  photographs, 10 boxes of microfilm, over 2000 maps, and 3 boxes of reel to reel
		  audio tapes of oral history interviews. </p>
      <p>The correspondence begins in 1938 and ends in 1965 with the main
		  purpose of assembling materials and other evidence on pioneer settlement in the
		  Marietta/Lummi area. The bulk of the letters, however, relate to historical
		  materials held in various archives and other repositories or else are inquiries
		  to the latter about such materials. The correspondence is arranged in
		  chronological order with the original letter attached to the reply. The indexes
		  and lists are, for the most part, lists and indexes of various materials Howard
		  Buswell collected. It should be noted though that the present organization of
		  the Buswell papers and photographs is often radically different from the
		  arrangement suggested by the indexes. The Bernard N. McDonough business records
		  include miscellaneous private and business letters, receipts and bills, various
		  legal documents, and a number of account books kept in McDonough's Marietta
		  store. The legal documents and papers have been arranged in part according to
		  subject, in part according to type, and in part according to the court of
		  origin. They are composed of a variety of legal records ranging from business
		  records to transcripts of select court cases. </p>

            <unitdate>1960 January 15</unitdate>

          <scopecontent>
            <p>Howard E. Buswell: This is January the 15th 1960. About the third of the way through this reel of tape is a tape 
              of a religious discourse by the late Mrs. John Brown. Formerly Mrs. Johanna Guerin. I believe her maiden name was 
              Johanna Ti'elish. Or Johanna George Ti'elish. I just played it over after a lapse of several years since Mrs. Brown 
              and her husband John have been dead for two or three years now, and I found it of considerable interest. I meant 
              this in the fact that there is an unoccupied piece of tape for quite a ways. After Mrs. Brown's discourse is a sermon. 
              And other services at the Marietta Mission. It is run by the Reverend and Mrs. Walter Harnden. The Mormons that continue 
              on the religious, the religion of the Lummi people, the Mormons have a mission here in the house formerly occupied and 
              owned by Mr. Chris Iyland. I do not believe, besides the Mormons, and Reverend Harnden's Mission, that there are any 
              other active religious groups on the reservation except the Roman Catholics, who have had a church there for many years. 
              But in the past decades or two why various Protestant groups have come in, but none of them have seem to have shown the 
              stick-to-itiveness that the Mormons and Reverend Harnden's Mission have. The Shaker's have a church over there, but I 
              don't believe it is being used now. Mrs. Brown was a very devout Christian woman. She and her husband use to go to the 
              Catholic Church, but they for some reason or another, they found that they were not getting what they wanted. So they 
              turned their backs on it, and became followers of revivalists such as Oral Roberts. Mrs. Brown always went to his revivals 
              meetings when he was in the area. And she is telling in her discourse here, something about her observations and 
              experiences of while he was having his services. I don't know whether it was in Portland, Oregon or Tacoma. But 
              somewhere within easy traveling distance of this location. </p>
            <p>Cassette Tape # 1: Mrs. John Brown (Johanna Guerin/Ti'elish) recounts her observations of the healings and miracles she has 
              witnessed through prayer. She calls this, "to lay hands on the sick." She then reads a letter she received from Oral Roberts, 
              an evangelical preacher. Following this she reads or preaches from memory a sermon based on Bible scriptures. She, throughout, 
              emphasizes the healing miracles she has witnessed by Oral Roberts. One example is an Indian man, she recalls from Neah Bay 
              who was healed. The interview segways into a broadcast of Oral Roberts entitled the "Indian Christian Hour" which appeared on KVOS. </p>
            <p>Cassette Tape #2: Oral Roberts' TV program continues. Many hymns are sung (in English). Indian people are asked to come 
              forward and give their testimony. A service by Rev. Harnden follows given at the Marietta Indian Mission. Rev. Harnden notes: 
              "Don't be called among those, a rebellious people." </p>
