         <p>Issued on February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066
            resulted in the forced relocation and incarceration of approximately 120,000 individuals
            and families of Japanese ancestry (including U.S. citizens) living in the United States.
            Heart Mountain War Relocation Center in Wyoming was one of ten internment camps used for
            imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II. </p>
         <p>"Heart Mountain Choral Suite" was written by composer and mezzo-soprano Sarah Mattox,
            and derived from her "Heart Mountain" chamber opera. The text of these works is based
            upon journals written by Kara Matsushita Kondo of Yakima Valley in Washington State, who
            was interned at Heart Mountain with members of her family. On March 17, 2019, Whatcom
            Chorale performed the world premiere of Mattox's "Heart Mountain Choral Suite at St.
            Paul's Episcopal Church in Bellingham, Washington. Soloists were Kimberly Sogioka
            (mezzo-soprano) with Laura Speck Camacho (violin), and Wade Dingman on piano. Deborah
            Brown is Conductor and Artistic Director of the Whatcom Chorale. </p>
