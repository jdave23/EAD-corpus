            <p>Ms. Bliss briefly outlines her early experiences with playing music and some of her
              early artistic influences, including Simon and Garfunkel, and the Beatles. She spent
              the majority of her college career at University of Washington. Ms. Bliss recalls how
              she was exposed to bluegrass style music, and how she was first introduced to playing
              the dobro, a lap-played guitar often featured in country and bluegrass music. She
              relates her experiences playing with the South Fork Bluegrass Band of Bellingham,
              including playing at the Darrington Bluegrass Festival and the Grass Valley Festival.
              Ms. Bliss has taught classes at the Puget Sound Guitar Workshop since 1984, and
              attended Whatcom County Homemade Music Society (WCHMS) music circles at the Roeder
              house when she was first learning to play folk music. She also describes the recording
              of a record, Old Pal, in 1994 with long-time friend, Cliff Perry, and discusses her
              experiences playing Cajun music, specifically with the Bellingham-based band the Happy
              Valley Sluggers.</p>

            <p>Ms. Breskin briefly describes her experiences as the first Jewish family on Mercer
              Island, and how this isolation as a child led her to music. She moved to Bellingham in
              1970 at the height of the counter-culture movement and recollects her connections with
              the South Fork Bluegrass Band. She relates her experiences as one of the founding
              members of the Puget Sound Guitar Workshop, and the various camps and workshops that
              sprang forth from that, the Sound Acoustic Music Workshop and the California Coast
              Music Camp for example. Ms. Breskin also discusses the influences she had on the
              WCHMS, and her thoughts and experiences in the Bellingham folk music scene in general.
              She explores the impact that musicians like Elizabeth Cotten had on her own folk music
              experience and her personal connections to other folk artists like Janis Ian, Larry
              Hanks, Mike Marker, Eric Schoenberg, and Richard Ruskin. She explains her connection
              to Mama Sundayâs, now the Underground Coffee House on Westernâs campus, its history,
              and its connection to the music scene in Bellingham.</p>

            <p>Mr. Lopresti and Ms. Weiner both discuss their early musical memories, including
              familial influences and popular music influences, including 1960s folk staple, Joan
              Baez. Both were born on the east coast, Lopresti in New Jersey in 1954, and Weiner in
              New York in 1956. Both also found their initial interest in folk music during high
              school, and discuss the reasons that they were drawn to folk music. They relate the
              difference in the way music was experienced on the east coast in the 1960s and 1970s
              compared to the west coast, the accessibility of the music scene and the musicians in
              the Northwest that was not true for them on the east coast. They re-located to
              Bellingham in 1987. They discuss their first experiences with the concerts at the
              Roeder House and the WCHMS. Relate their musical experiences in Bellingham, including
              seeing such acts as Richard Scholtz, Ani diFranco, and Bob Franke. They also discuss
              their experiences with the monthly concert series put on by the Homemade Music Society
              and put on at the Roeder House.</p>

            <p>Ms. Penttinen-King was born in Pasadena, California in 1942, and recounts her early
              experiences with music, as both a performer and a listener. She sang in her junior
              high and high school choirs, and recalls her father listening to jazz and Big Band
              music when she was a child. She recalls her own early influences, including Mike
              Seeger and Elizabeth Cotten. She attended the University of Maryland and San Diego
              State, where she saw Peter, Paul and Mary, and Joan Baez perform. While in San Diego,
              Ms. Penttinen-King was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, taking part in
              picketing during the Civil Rights movement, and she picked this back up after moving
              to Bellingham in 1982. She briefly discusses the connection between those movements
              and singing. She explains the structure and organization and activities of the WCHMS.
              She discusses her experiences hosting the concert series at the Roeder House, and the
              acts that she has brought to Bellingham as host, including Hank Bradley and Kathy
              Whitesides.</p>

            <p>Ms. Smith was born in Hawaii in 1947. She recalls that her early exposure to music
              came from her father playing classical piano and ragtime when she was growing up. Her
              main musical outlet was choir, and she sang in her church choir through high school.
              She went to college in Portland, Oregon, and continued to sing there. Ms. Smith
              recalls her musical influences and interests during those years, including Joan Baez,
              Mimi Farina, Mark Spoelstra, and Steve Young. She relates how she began playing banjo,
              and how this led to her playing with Larry Hanks, her husband. She moved to Bellingham
              in 1979, where she and Larry reconnected with Robert Scholtz and became involved in
              the WCHMS. As a host, she has sponsored various acts including The Wanderers, Bill
              Merlin and Carl Allen, the Birdâs Creek Boys, and Sarah Gray. She discusses briefly
