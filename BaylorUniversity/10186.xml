   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Opened in 1908, the Woodrow School in Dallas, Texas, was a fine arts school for girls from elite families of the greater Dallas area. Operated by Caroline Beatrice Mead Woodrow, the school is a typical example of a north Texas girls' finishing school in the early 1900s.</p><p>Caroline Beatrice
Mead Woodrow, originally from Missouri, first shows up in Texas in 1910. She was 38 years old, and married to Otho D. Woodrow, a railroad clerk and agent in the Dallas area. It is assumed that Caroline must have been well-educated prior to opening her school, since she taught many of the classes
herself. She opened her new school in 1908, first at 279 Elm Street, but then moved to the Watkins Studios at 1205 Elm Street. The name of the school also changed as Woodrow was fine-tuning her teaching operation. Originally the school was known as the "Woodrow School of Elocution and Dramatic Art."
By 1913 it was the "Woodrow School of Elocution and Physical Culture," a name which it kept for a number of years. By 1912 Woodrow was able to hire an assistant, and by 1915 Caroline had a staff of three and was teaching about 90 students a year in the White system of expression. This system of
expression was a noted way to teach students how to best utilize gesture, emotion, and voice in public.</p><p>By the 1920s the Woodrow school was doing very well, with multiple instructors teaching over 200 students a four-year curriculum of voice, acting, singing, violin, piano, dancing,
literature, French, and other liberal arts subjects. The school had also moved again by 1925, this time to Bush Temple on 1311 Elm Street, and slighly changed their name to the "Woodrow School of Expression and Physical Culture." The school had official colors of crimson and gold, and produced a
school newspaper, the "Woodrow School Siren." Many issues of this newspaper are present in the collection. Appropriately enough, the school was placing heavy emphasis on public performances of the students' learning, with seven plays scheduled to be performed in 1921.</p><p>Also in the 1920s, the
Alumni Association of the Woodrow School is mentioned, though the alumni could have been meeting informally for years. By that time the school had moved again, to 1203 Elm Street. Night classes at the Woodrow School are mentioned in 1938, along with classes in radio, and home study courses. The
school's name had also been shortened to the "Woodrow School of Expression." On a more personal note for Woodrow, her husband, Otho Dwight Woodrow, passed away in 1939.</p><p>The school continued operations into the 1940s, though they changed locations again in 1942, to 3215 Mabray, in a "cottage
studio." By now, it seems the demand for girls' finishing schools had lessened, as Woodrow had no assistants helping to teach. No total count of students was available, but it seems the number of students had dropped significantly. Woodrow continued teaching for many years, but passed away in 1963
at the age of 92.She had trained hundreds of north Texas girls in liberal arts, was head of one of the longest-running girls' schools in the area, and had made a significant impact in the art and culture of Dallas, Texas.</p>
