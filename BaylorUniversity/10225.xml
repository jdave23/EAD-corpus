   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The Women’s Missionary Society was an organization affiliated with one of the Methodist churches located in Wharton County, Texas.  The collection records the details of their monthly meetings beginning 1933 December and ending in 1939 December.  During these six years, the organization was
known by three names and had only two secretaries during that time (Mrs. J.O. Graham, 1933, 1937-1939; Mrs. Hart, 1934-1936).  Initially, it was recorded as the Missionary Society, followed by the Women’s Missionary Society, and finally as Women’s Christian Service beginning in 1939
July.</p><p> </p><p>The Women’s Missionary Society meetings were highly organized in which they regularly followed a set schedule.  Events sponsored by the organization included religious education for children, the maintenance of a women’s home in Houston, and support of Methodist
missionaries in Texas oil company towns and in China.  In order to support these activities, the organization engaged in various fund raising initiatives.  These included soliciting wealthy individuals for donations, selling brand products, and hosting teas, fairs, and special events, such as the
Shirley Temple Show during the summer of 1937.  These fund raising endeavors provided enough money for the organization to increase its funds during the Great Depression from $300.57 in 1933 to $1,070 in 1939.      </p><p> </p><p>The Women’s Missionary Society in Wharton County is an example of
how a women’s organization flourished during the Great Depression.</p>
