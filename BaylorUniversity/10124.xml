   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on 1909 April, 9 Oscar Norbert DuCongé was the first African-American mayor of Waco, Texas, serving from 1974-1975. Additionally, he served as a Waco city councilman in 1972 and was an avid volunteer in the community up to his death on July 26, 1978.
</p><p>Former Waco Mayor, Roger Conger, received the extensive collection of Waco photographer Fred A. Gildersleeve some time after his death. The subject matter of the photo negatives contained in this collection were either requested by DuCongé or selected by Conger to present as a gift.
</p><p>Fred A. Gildersleeve, whose work comprises this entire collection, was born on 1880 June 30, and came to Waco in 1905 living here until his death in 1958. During most of this time he documented important aspects of the city's history, life, culture, and events. Additionally, he is one of
Waco’s best-known photographers being commissioned by local businesses, residents, Baylor University, and the African-American Paul Quinn College, the latter of which the bulk of the Gildersleeve-DuCongé Collection represents. </p><p>Paul Quinn College was originally started in Austin, TX., in
1872, as the Connectional High School and Institute for Negro Youth. When the school moved to Waco in 1877 on 8th and Mary Streets, it was known as Waco College and taught trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, and tanning to newly freed slaves. It became Paul Quinn College in 1881 named after
Bishop William Paul Quinn, the fourth Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was then relocated to Elm Street in east Waco on 20 acres of land that was once part of the Garrison Plantation. </p><p>In 1952 December, Paul Quinn Colleges’ girl’s dormitory was destroyed by fire. The
following year in 1953 May, the campus was affected by a devastating tornado that tore away roofs and caused widespread damage to the entire campus. This same tornado destroyed a large part of downtown Waco and killed a total of 114 people. However, by 1954, the African Methodist Episcopal Church
came to the aid of Paul Quinn College and paid off their debts and additionally funded the construction of the $150,000 Gomez Administration Building. In 1954, the Waco Chamber of Commerce launched a successful community wide campaign and raised $100,000 for the construction of a new girls dormitory
to replace the one destroyed by fire. </p><p>In 1964, Waco businessmen helped aid Paul Quinn College in the construction of the Sherman-Abington Library that could house 30,000 volumes. In 1968, a women’s dormitory, Lucy Hughes Hall, and a men’s dormitory, Richard Allen Hall, were both
constructed partly from a grant through the Moody Foundation. In 1967, Paul Quinn College earned further funding under the “Model Cities” program. Waco earned this designation at a time when the community was almost ten years into a wide scale federal Urban Renewal program. </p><p>In 1968,
Paul Quinn College was the only four-year institution in the city’s targeted redevelopment area for the “Model Cities” program. Additionally, the college received funds from Baylor University and Texas State Technical Institute in a cooperative project due to its location in a “Model
Cities” redevelopment section of Waco. All of this work had greatly benefitted the institution and by 1972, its 100th anniversary, the Paul Quinn College campus and facilities were valued at 2 million dollars. </p><p>By 1979, the operating budget of the college was 2.5 million dollars and
operated on funding by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, United Negro College Fund, federal funding, and private donations. In 1990, Paul Quinn College moved to Dallas, TX. Currently still in operation, the institution is the oldest liberal arts college for African-Americans in the state of
Texas. The former campus located at 1020 Elm Avenue is now occupied by the Rapaport Academy Quinn Campus Middle School and the Meyer High School.</p>
