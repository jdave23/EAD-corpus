   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p> Sylvester Purl Kirk (1828-1874), son of William A. A. and Ann R. Clark Kirk, was born in 1828 August. Between 1852 and 1855, he moved from Mississippi and settled in Bell County. At some point, he married Eliza Jane White Kirk Grimes (1837-1916), who was originally from Alabama. The couple
had three children: Alice Kirk (born 1859), Laura Kirk (1861-1951), and Viola Kirk (born 1866).</p><p> </p><p>In 1862 May, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and was a member of Company I, 17th Texas Infantry Regiment. He was company wagon master in 1864. Kirk died in Bell County on 1874 December
11. His wife remarried three years later to James Grimes on 1877 December 25.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p> The Sylvester Purl and Eliza Jane White Kirk papers consists of two groups of letters--those written by Sylvester and Eliza Kirk during the Civil War, and those addressed to the family between 1874 and 1888. Both groups of letters are filed together in a single folder.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Kirk's letters to his family during the war tell of the unpreparedness for the cold weather, illnesses and deaths of soldiers, and military movements of his company as it traveled from Texas and Arkansas to Louisiana. Eliza Kirk's letters to her husband included descriptions of events in the
area, including the murder of an African American for harboring escaped enslaved people, and providing news about the children and other family members. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Letters in the second group are addressed primarily to Eliza Kirk following the death of her first husband and are written by her mother-in-law, Ann R. Kirk, and brother-in-law, W.W. Oxsheer, both of whom lived in Cameron, Milam County. Their letters provide information on such family-related
matters as the legal disposition of Kirk's land and G.A Kirk's farming accident, and also relate local news, including deaths in the area from measles and flux.</p>
