   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Robert Porter “Buddy” Tinsley, Jr. was born on 1924 August 19 in Damon, Texas. He was a standout football player at Barbers Hill High School in Mount Belvieu, Texas. At the age of 17 he enlisted in the Navy hoping to be a pilot, however, his size prevented this. Tinsley was stationed at
Corpus Christi, Texas from 1942-1945 and was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant. </p><p>Buddy Tinsley played college football at Baylor University from 1946-1948. He was listed as a center early in his career, but was known for his position play at both offensive and defensive tackle. In
1948, his senior season, Tinsley was named co-captain of the bruin squad and received All-Conference honors. His performance led to his 7th Round selection (54th overall) in the 1948 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. </p><p>Despite being drafted by an NFL team, Tinsley played for the Los Angeles
Dons of the All-American Football Conference in 1949. After that season the AAFC went out of business, which led to Tinsley’s signing with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. He played eleven seasons with the Bombers, was team captain for ten years, a seven-time Western
All-Star, and two-time Grey Cup winner. These honors were topped by Hall of Fame inductions by Barber’s Hill High School, Baylor Athletics, Canadian Football, and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. </p><p>In retirement, Buddy Tinsley ran several businesses, was active with the Shriner’s, and enjoyed
hunting and fishing. As a naturalized Canadian citizen, and Texan, he spent the latter years of his life wintering in Texas and summering in Canada. Tinsley was married to Hazel Stevens Tinsley until her death in 1993; they had two children, Jack and Cindy. He was remarried in 1994 to Jean Laughlin
Tinsley. Buddy Tinsley died 2011 September 14 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and is buried in West Columbia, Texas.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>This Robert P. “Buddy” Tinsley collection includes personal memorabilia from his time as a football player at Baylor University. Items were donated by Tinsley’s children after his death. Buddy Tinsley also spent eleven seasons with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football
League after his career at Baylor. Items related to that time period were donated to the Bombers organization. </p>
   <p>Printed material in the collection includes copies of <emph render="italic">The Baylor Line</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Illustrated Football Annual</emph>. These magazines include articles about the Baylor football squad as well as mentions of Tinsley’s prowess on the field. Copies of the 1948 Baylor Yells and Songs are present in
addition to a football media guide, banquet program, and Student directory. </p>
   <p>  </p>
   <p>Photographs and Memorabilia hold individual and group photos of Tinsley and other Baylor players, an original Jack Hamm newspaper cartoon drawing, and a deconstructed scrapbook. Also included is general memorabilia such as ticket stubs and pocket schedules as well as a specialized kicking shoe
created for Tinsley by the University. Although Tinsley is never credited as a kicker, it is possible he performed such duties requiring the specialized shoe. Football programs and media guides of the time period omit “kicker” as an official position.</p>
