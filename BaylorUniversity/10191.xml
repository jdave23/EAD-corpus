   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Edward Charles (E.C) Blomeyer was born in Missouri in 1882. He married Amma Pottinger in 1904 and together they had three children, Mary, Edward, and Earle. During his time in Waco, Texas, 1912-1920, Mr. Blowmeyer became one of the early pioneers in the telephone industry in central Texas. He
served in many capacities in this growing field, helping to establish and improve communication networks throughout the central Texas area. As well as his work in the telephone industry, he was active in community service in the Waco area. Examples include membership in the following organizations:
the Young Men's Business League (YMBL), in which he served as chairman, Waco Chamber of Commerce, Waco Ad Club, Waco Public Library, and the Waco Rotary Club. He was also a member of the Karem Temple and various Masonic organizations in the city. Additionally, his two sons were born in Waco. 
</p><p> In 1904, Blomeyer entered the telephone industry working for the Southeast Missouri Telephone Company, in Charleston, Missouri, starting as auditor, then secretary, and later its manager. In 1912, he moved to Waco, Texas, to work for the Brazos Valley Telegraph and Telephone Company. In
1914, the Texas Telephone Company merged with 5 separate telephone companies in central, south, and east Texas. This conglomeration expanded the Texas Telephone Company greatly operating lines through thirty-four towns in the state at that time. </p><p> Blomeyer first served as secretary-treasurer
of the newly formed Texas Telephone Company, as well as assistant to the president, J.B. (John Baylis) Earle II. The Texas Telephone Company's local expansion included Lorena, Mart, McGregor, Moody, Waco, and West, Texas. In 1918, E.C. Blomeyer became president of the TTC as the company continued to
buy out or merge with several other independent telephone operations in the greater central Texas area. Additionally, in 1918, he began serving as president of the Texas Independent Telephone Association, a position he held until 1920; he would later be designated an honorary life member. Serving in
this capacity he took part in proceedings, and later, executive positions in the United States Independent Telephone Association. </p><p> </p><p>E.C. Blomeyer's time in Waco and the central Texas area helped build on his previous experience in the telephone industry. As a result, in 1920, he took a
position with the Automatic Electric Company, owned by Theodore Gary and Co., of Chicago, Illinois. The AEC of Chicago's corporate lineage began in the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Co., started by the inventor of the dial telephone, Almon Strowger. AEC bought the patents from Strowger in
1918 and was a major supplier of dial-telephones to independent telephone companies in the United States and abroad. Blomeyer's arrival at Automatic Electric was at an important time in that company's history. The Strowger (rotary-dial telephone) patents which they held had just been licensed to the
Bell Corporation for a sum of $2.5 million. After the sale, AEC still continued to produce the rotary-dial system for telephone operations other than the Bell Corporation. </p><p>In his position at the Automatic Electric Company, Blomeyer also served as contract sales manager for its associated
company, the International Telephone Sales and Engineering Corporation. In doing so, he supervised overseas business and contract sales of dial telephones. At this time, the AEC manufactured and supplied approximately 80 percent of the automatic dial-operated telephone equipment used worldwide. In
1923, he was made vice-president of Theodore Gary and Co., owner of the AEC, and remained so until his retirement in 1956. The Theodore Gary &amp; Co., was later purchased by General Telephone Corporation in 1955, later renamed General Telephone &amp; Electronics (GTE). </p><p> </p><p>With his keen
interest in the telephone industry and engineering, Blomeyer was also a prolific writer contributing articles to several publications including: <emph render="italic">The Magazine of Business; Telephony: The American Telephone Journal; Business, A Magazine for Office Store, and Factory; Public Utilities Fortnightly;</emph>
<emph render="italic">American Telephone Journal, and Popular Mechanics. </emph>He was also known throughout the telephone industry as the author of a series of booklets entitled<emph render="italic">: Letters to Managers. </emph>By 1934, copies of the ten book series numbered over three million in circulation. </p><p>After retirement, he spent some of his
remaining years in Palm Beach, Florida, where he died in 1964. A year later, to recognize his life's work in the telephone industry, E.C. Blomeyer was inducted into the Independent Telephone Hall of Fame. Additionally, the Blomeyer's were a philanthropic family and shared the benefits of their
success. The widow of Edward Charles Blowmeyer, Amma, donated funds to Palm Beach Atlantic College enabling the establishment of the E.C. Blomeyer Library, dedicated on March 9, 1969. The library is now called the Warren Library (dedicated 2007) as a series of donations has enabled Palm Beach
Atlantic University to expand since its beginning in 1968. E.C. Blomeyer's legacy carries on as a benefactor of this university, in his writings, photographic record, and contributions to the telephone industry, including that of central Texas.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Edward C. Blomeyer photographic collection consists of photo negatives and prints taken by Edward Charles Blomeyer, a pioneer in the telephone industry. His photographic record gives an insight into the early telephone and communications networks of the central Texas area. Additionally,
while living in Waco, he photographed the city including popular sites such as Cameron Park and events such as The Texas Cotton Palace. Structures such as many of the city's famous bridges are recorded and events such as auto races are represented. The collection also includes images of early road
conditions and scenes around McLennan County, Texas. </p>
   <p>Outside of Waco, Blomeyer took images including San Antonio, Austin, and the Texas gulf coast. His vacations were recorded as well, including Yellowstone National Park and Bella Vista, Arkansas. Also photographed are ships, autos, airplanes, people-including family members, and his home state
of Missouri.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>E.C. Blomeyer organized the photo negatives and prints in this collection by subject using an index card box with small folders separated by divider tabs. The general arrangement remained intact as when the collection was received. It did require some reconciliation of misfiled items and renaming
of subjects/series for better identification purposes. The Edward C. Blomeyer photographic collection is now arranged in eight series: I. Company: Telephone, II. Texas, III. Vacation, IV. People, V. Missouri, VI. Transportation, VII. Agriculture, and VIII. General.</p>

   <p>In 1904, E.C. Blomeyer entered the telephone industry working for the Southeast Missouri Telephone Company, in Charleston, Missouri. The images in this series include industry related subjects beginning in the states of Missouri and Illinois. Blomeyer then moved to Waco, Texas, in 1912, to
work for the Brazos Valley Telegraph and Telephone Company, and later The Texas Telephone Company after a large merger of many independent telephone entities. </p><p> The merging expanded operations of the Texas Telephone Company to Lorena, Mart, McGregor, Moody, and West, Texas. By 1918, E.C.
Blomeyer had become president of the TTC and the company continued to buy out or merge with several other telephone operations around the state. The images in this series help document the work done after these acquisitions. In some cases, telephone poles, lines, and equipment were primitive or
outdated for their time, and they are detailed in these photographs.</p>

   <p>Edward Charles Blomeyer left behind a detailed photographic record of the state during the time he lived in Waco, Texas (1912-1920), after moving from Missouri to work in the telephone business. He photographed Waco extensively, including images of local military facilities, events, parks,
rivers, and parades. Around the state, he took pictures on trips to San Antonio, Austin, New Braunfels, Port Arthur, Galveston, and Lake Greenbriar in Tyler. A few of the images pre-date the year E.C. Blomeyer moved to the state, including some of the images of San Antonio which were taken
approximately 1906.</p><p>He also photographed the railroad that ran through central Texas including the Missouri Kansas and Texas (MKT) and St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt). These show locomotives, carriages, crossings, and tracks. The rural roadways in and around McLennan County are
detailed as Blomeyer took pictures of the rough road conditions encountered in his travels by automobile. Also included is a group of pictures of an unidentified Texas oil field.</p>

   <p>This group of images shows some of Waco's most popular scenic spots such as Cameron Park, located within the city and the Brazos and Bosque Rivers that flow through the park and nearby downtown. The river crossings that span the Brazos such as the Waco Suspension Bridge, Interurban Bridge, and
the Washington Street Bridge are shown. Images of the Brazos River at flood as well as low water levels are seen. Elm Street is included as the images show how it was adversely affected when the nearby Brazos River flooded.</p>

   <p>On June 18, 1918, troop train number 264, carrying soldiers from the 80th Field Artillery, which was posted at Camp MacArthur, left Waco, Texas, traveling eastward on the Cotton Belt rail line, derailed in the nearby town of Selby. The <emph render="italic">Waco News-Tribune</emph>, June 19-20, 1918, states that the
accident caused the deaths of 2 troops: Corporals Laurn Harrell and August Handschumacher, Jr. Additionally, about 30 military personnel and 4 employees of the railroad were injured. The wreckage of the derailment is documented by E.C. Blomeyer in this series of photographs.</p>

   <p>E.C. Blomeyer captured several scenes of the roads around Waco, McLennan County, and the central Texas area at a time when they were suited more for wagons than automobiles. He consistently photographed his Ford Model-T along these roads as if to record the adverse conditions he encountered in

&quot;Eastland&quot; is shown in this image. On July 24, 1915, while docked in Chicago, Illinois, for departure on a cruise to Michigan City, Indiana, it rolled over onto its side causing passengers to be thrown into the water. This tipping or listing of the vessel began after the 2,573 passengers
had boarded. This accident claimed the lives of 844 men, women, and children. It is reported the incident caused the largest number of deaths in any single event in the continental U.S. in the twentieth century. Digital image is from a scan of a 3 ¼ by 4- inch, cellulose nitrate negative. Digital
