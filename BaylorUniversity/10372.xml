   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p><emph render="italic">Where the Heart Is</emph> was a film directed by Matt Williams in 2000.  Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel adapted the screenplay from author Billie Lett’s best-selling novel (1995).  This film project was the first time Matt Williams directed a feature length film.  He had won prior
acclaim as a creator and executive producer for the successful television series <emph render="italic">Roseanne </emph>and <emph render="italic">Home Improvement</emph>.  Natalie Portman, an up-and-coming star at the time, played the lead role in the film alongside actresses Ashley Judd and Joan Cusack.</p><p> </p><p>The screenplay was given to Baylor
University by director Matt Williams as a gesture of appreciation.  On 1999 August 16 the production crew filmed scenes at various locations across Baylor University's campus including Pat Neff Hall and Armstrong Browning Library.  Due to its resemblance to prestigious East Coast campuses, Baylor
University served as a fictional college campus in Maine.  Many Baylor students volunteered as extras for the film.</p>
