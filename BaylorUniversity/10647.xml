   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Philip Dale (P.D.) Browne taught in the Texas Education System as well as conducted research on the Civil War, specifically in the Freestone County, Texas area. He worked at Seventh and James Baptist Church and later was a mathematics and religion teacher at Baylor University, both in Waco,
Texas.</p><p>  </p><p>Jack Beaumont Hamm was born March 5, 1916, in Wichita, Kansas. He studied in Chicago at the Moody Bible Institute and the Frederick Mizen Art Academy. Lack of funds contributed to his leaving school and pursuing other work, notably at Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) in
Cleveland, Ohio, as a cartoonist. Hamm also served in the Army with stops in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.</p><p>  </p><p>Hamm enrolled at Baylor University and created content for the <emph render="italic">Baylor Lariat</emph> (student newspaper) and <emph render="italic">Round-Up</emph> (yearbook). He graduated in 1948 and was immediately hired by the
university as an art instructor and as the University Designer.</p><p>   </p><p>In 1950, Jack Hamm started Religious Drawings, Inc. to distribute his ministry through art. In his Waco studio, he created a weekly religious cartoon for more than 700 newspapers in 45 states and at least 17 foreign
countries, an audience he estimated to be more than 29 million. In 1961, Hamm left Baylor to become the Staff Artist for the <emph render="italic">Baptist Standard</emph> and moved his studio to Dallas, Texas. Eventually, he also became an instructor at Dallas Baptist College (now University).</p><p>   </p><p>Jack Hamm was
married to the former Dorisnel Alexander and had four children. Hamm died December 22, 1996, in Dallas, Texas. He is buried in the Gordo City Cemetery in Gordo, Alabama.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Original Drawings series includes pencil drawings as well as pen and ink drawings created by Hamm for use in advertising and in the Centennial Edition (1945) of the Baylor University <emph render="italic">Round-Up</emph> (yearbook). The Prints and Clippings series is made up of art prints and newspaper clippings which
provide a reference to the types of work Hamm created. The art prints are primarily religious in nature and were created and distributed through Religious Drawings, Inc. The newspaper clippings were created while Hamm was a student and instructor at Baylor. The clippings have been retained on
newsprint to provide a view of his work as originally intended.</p>
