   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>George Clarence “Cotton” Moffett was born on November 20, 1895, in Chillicothe, Texas. He graduated with a degree in agriculture and animal husbandry from Texas A&amp;M College before serving in the US Army Air Force during WWI. After returning from the war, he worked in the oil and
lumber industries and managed his family farm. </p><p> </p><p>In 1930, Moffett successfully ran for a position in the Texas House of Representatives. After serving in his position for eight years, he successfully ran for Texas Senate, a position he held for nearly three decades. Moffett was a
supporter of legislation related to his many passions: agriculture, science, livestock, and veterans. He earned his nickname "Cotton" through his efforts working with the cotton industry. </p><p> </p><p>Moffett was a good friend of Judge Jack Hightower. Both men grew up in nearby towns and were
Freemasons. In 1964, Moffett retired from the Texas Senate, clearing the way for Jack Hightower’s successful campaign. In the early 2000s, Poage Library staff created the George "Cotton" Moffett collection, pulling the materials out of the Jack Hightower papers.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The George "Cotton" Moffett collection contains documents from 1933 to 1957. These years correspond to Moffett’s years in politics. Moffett served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1931-1938, and the Texas Senate from 1939-1965. The documents in this collection relate primarily to
his campaigns for reelection. His collection features flyers, business cards, postcards, and other election-related promotional materials. It also contains an extensive collection of correspondence relating to his campaign as well as general correspondence throughout his time in office.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The George "Cotton" Moffett collection was previously processed and housed in a three-ring binder. An old finding aid was previously created by Poage Library staff in 2004. The collection has since been reprocessed.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Due to the size of the collection, no series were created. The materials, however, are divided between campaign-related materials and general correspondence, reflecting the previous arrangement.</p>
