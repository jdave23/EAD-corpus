   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center collected documents on Mormons in the Soviet Union from 1990-1999 with the bulk of the content focused on 1996-1999.</p><p>Joseph
Smith, the founder of Mormonism, was the first to suggest Russian missionary work. He commissioned two men to go to Russia, but circumstances ultimately prevented the trip. The first baptism on Russian soil occurred in 1895. However, none involved were ethnically Russian. While there was occasional
Mormon activity within Russia throughout the 1900s, organized missionary work appears to have begun in 1990. Within the following year, Mormonism “received national recognition” (Miller). As of 2021, there was no temple in Russia, although one was announced in 2018.</p>

Law on Religion, and the abduction and release of two Mormon missionaries. Some key terms and concepts in the documents include missionaries, history of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith, 1997 Law on Religion, cults, and registration.</p>
