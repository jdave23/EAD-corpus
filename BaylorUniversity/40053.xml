   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center received a folder related to Soviet Union Nazarenes in 1969. The content reviews the status, membership numbers, and levels of
freedom in various locales, especially in Eastern Europe.</p><p>The Nazarene Church in Eastern Europe was established in 1832 by a Swiss, Samuel Heinrich Fröhlich. In that century, Nazarene beliefs spread to Hungary and Yugoslavia, soon followed by Romania and Transylvania in the 1900s. One
characteristic of the Nazarene communities was their refusal to join the military. Although there were periods when they were given an exemption, this subject was often a point of conflict between Nazarenes and the government.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Soviet Union Nazarene File contains a document of correspondence written in May of 1969, though it identifies events from previous years. The majority of the content details the varying levels of religious freedom in different European countries, including Romania, Yugoslavia,
Czechoslovakia, and the Bukovina region. Specific topics include oppressive practices against Nazarenes and membership numbers.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The Keston Center received the Soviet Union Nazarene documents with the Mennonite files. Because the document was a duplicate, one copy remains in the Mennonite files, and the other has been separated to comprise this folder. No further organization was required.</p>
