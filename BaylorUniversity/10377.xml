   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>James Edward Grant was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 1905 July 2.  At the start of his professional career, he wrote for various newspapers before moving to Southern California to work in the film industry.  He directed two films, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1958 for Best Original
Screenplay, and had writing credits on more than 50 films including <emph render="italic">Angel and the Badman </emph>(1947), <emph render="italic">Hondo </emph>(1953), <emph render="italic">The Alamo</emph> (1960), and <emph render="italic">The Comancheros</emph> (1961).  Grant, who often wrote screenplays for Western films, worked on a number of occasions with legendary actor John Wayne.  Grant passed away in
Burbank, California, on 1966 February 19.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation produced <emph render="italic">The Comancheros</emph> in 1961.  Michael Curtiz directed the project with legendary Western film actor John Wayne leading the cast.  Wayne played Texas Ranger Captain Jake Cutter who goes undercover to catch a notorious group of smugglers and bandits
who call themselves “The Comancheros.”  </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Historically, a Comanchero was an inhabitant of New Mexico who earned a living by trading with Native American plains tribes such as the Comanche.  Some Comancheros were legitimate businessmen but others resorted to cattle rustling and theft to increase their profits, a plot that appears in
many Western films.  </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The screenplay, the focal point of this collection, was written by James Edward Grant in 1961.  It was based on the novel by Paul I. Wellman. The materials are in good condition.</p>
