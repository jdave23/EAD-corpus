   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Edward Clark (1815-1880), governor of the state of Texas in 1861, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He moved to Texas in 1841 and practiced law in Marshall. As a delegate to the Texas Constitutional Convention in 1845, he helped craft the initial state constitution. He later served as a
state representative and senator. During the Mexican-American War, he temporarily set aside his political career to serve as an aide to General J. Pinckney Henderson. In 1853, he served as Texas secretary of state and later served as commissioner of claims. In 1859, he was elected lieutenant
governor of Texas, with Sam Houston serving as governor.</p><p> </p><p>In 1861, when Sam Houston refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor and Edward Clark was installed as governor. Clark worked with Confederate officials to raise troops and money to
support the war effort, as well as communicating with nearby Mexico and various Native American tribes in West Texas and Indian Territory (-present day Oklahoma).</p><p>Clark was defeated by Francis R. Lubbock in the 1861 election for Texas governor. Despite allegations of fraud, Clark transitioned
the governor's office to Lubbock without protest and was commissioned into the Confederate Army as a colonel. After being wounded in the Battle of Pleasant Hill in 1864, he received an honorable discharge and returned to Texas. At the end of the war, Clark spent a short time in Mexico before
returning to Texas. He was active in veterans' groups and  fraternal organizations until his death in 1880 May 4.</p>
