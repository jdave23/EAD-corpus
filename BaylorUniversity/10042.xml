   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Oscar Henry Cooper, who was often referred to as O. H. Cooper by his contemporaries, was born in Panola County, Texas, to Dr. William Henry and Katherine Rosser Cooper on 1852 November 22.  His long academic record shows him to be a brilliant scholar as well as a noted public educator in the
United States and Germany.  After studying for two years at Marshall University, Cooper transferred and completed his undergraduate work at Yale University where he graduated as the valedictorian of the class of 1872.  His prolific work in the educational field included teaching positions at
Henderson Male and Female College (1873-1879), Sam Houston Normal Institute (2 years), and a return to Yale University.  He received his graduate education while attending the University of Berlin from 1884 to 1885.  Upon returning to the United States, Cooper pursued teaching positions at the
secondary level, working as the principal of Houston High School, the Texas State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the superintendent of Galveston-area schools (1890-1896).  Amidst all these career pursuits, on 1886 November 24, Cooper married Mary Brian Stewart.  They had four children.
</p><p>    </p><p>Cooper’s success as an educator and his devotion to his Baptist roots led to his appointment as the President of Baylor University from 1899 to 1902.  With Cooper as President, Baylor gained national acclaim.  Most of the school’s degrees were recognized for the first time by
the more established eastern universities, the Department of Pedagogy was officially created, and the Department of Theology was expanded. The school also received substantial grants and scholarships during this period including $75,000 each from F.L. Carroll and his son George to build a chapel,
library, and science building.  These were the largest donations in Texas school history at the time.  In 1914, Baylor University awarded Cooper an honorary doctoral degree.  </p><p>    </p><p>The story of Cooper’s resignation from Baylor University is odd for such a distinguished teacher and
leader.  According to Baylor University’s website, a couple of students snuck a dog into chapel service one day.  When the dog started barking, Cooper became enraged and threw the dog out a window from the third floor.  Students protested the act, and Cooper resigned on 1902 March 31.</p><p>He
then went on to Simmons College from 1902 to 1909, enjoying similar successes.  From 1909 to 1915, Cooper established a school for boys in Abilene.  His last position before retirement was at the University of Texas at Austin.  Cooper had been  instrumental in the establishment of the University of
Texas in Austin during the 1880s, and later served as a professor of history and the philosophy of education there.  Cooper died in Abilene, Texas, on 1932 August 22.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The BU Records:  O.H. Cooper begin in 1899 with letters of correspondence and continues throughout Cooper’s tenure as the head of Baylor University.  The bulk of the collection is correspondence pertaining to the business side of his position.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>This collection was originally named BU Records of the Office of the  President-Oscar Henry Cooper, 1899-1902.  During the processing stage,  this name was shortened to BU Records:  O.H. Cooper.  The subject’s  first and middle name were abbreviated, because President Cooper went by  the
name O. H. Cooper.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The current organization of the BU Records:  O.H. Cooper reflects the original provenance.  Currently the records are arranged in three series:  I. Correspondence, II. Financial Documents, and III. Literary Productions.</p>
