   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The connection between Lydia Ann English Guyler and Sam Houston is unknown, although we know that Mrs. Guyler named one of her sons after General Sam Houston in memory of the victory that he had in San Jacinto. Of the Guyler family, we also know that Mrs. Guyler aided the Civil War soldiers at
home and donated supplies to the cause, while Mr. William Guyler served the Confederate forces as a member of the General John Sayles Company in the 23rd Brigade. Mr. Guyler established a post office on 1873 October 13 and served as Post Master of Bovine Bend (now Wallis, Texas).</p><p>Sam Houston
was a powerful political figure of Texas history. Houston was born 1793 March 2. In 1809, shortly after his family moved to Tennessee, Houston ran away from home. He lived among the Cherokees for several years, and then joined Andrew Jackson’s army on 1813 March 24. Houston studied law and
enjoyed rapid success as a public official; he was elected governor of Tennessee at the young age of 34. He married Eliza Allen in 1829 but they separated eleven weeks later. Houston retreated back among the Cherokee Nation and married under Cherokee law a Native American woman of mixed blood,
Diana.</p><p>Houston again left the Cherokee tribe and came to Texas on 1832 December 2. In 1836 Houston served as a delegate to the convention that adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence. He went on to lead the Texas revolutionaries to a victory over Santa Anna in the Battle of San Jacinto,
which helped him be elected as the first and third President of the Republic of Texas. Having divorced Allen in 1837, he married Margaret Moffette Lea, a religious Baptist woman, in 1840. Together they had eight children. In 1854 Houston was baptized by Baylor University President, Reverend Rufus C.
Burleson, at Little Rocky Creek near Independence, Texas. </p><p>After Texas joined the Union, Houston served as a U.S. Senator and then as the seventh governor of the state of Texas. During his term as governor, Houston refused to swear loyalty to the Confederacy when Texas seceded from the Union
in 1861, and he was removed from his position as governor. Houston died on 1863 July 26.</p>
