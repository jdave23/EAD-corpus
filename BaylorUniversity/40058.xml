   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center received documents regarding the Quakers the Soviet Union. These documents range from 1973 through 1989, but primarily focus on the
history and past presence of the group.</p><p>The Society of Friends or Quakers began in the mid-1600s in England. The defining feature is the emphasis on listening to the voice of God. There may have been a Quaker presence in Russia as early as 1678, but one of the first confirmed accounts occurred
in 1817. At least two Quakers were brought from England by the Russian government to improve St. Petersburg’s agriculture. Additionally, there seems to have been a Quaker presence in the Volga region from 1819 to 1916.</p>
