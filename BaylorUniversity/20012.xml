   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Alan Steelman (1942- ) represented Texas's Fifth District from 1973-1976 in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican. He ran a distinctive "walking campaign" against incumbent Democrat Earle Cabell and won.  At the date of his election, Nov. 7, 1972, Steelman was the youngest
Republican member of the House at age 29 and earned a post-graduate fellowship at Harvard's Institute for Politics in late 1972.  Steelman's Congressional career immediately blossomed. He was named one of TIME Magazine's "200 Emerging Young National Leaders" in 1974.  While in Congress, Steelman
served on two committeesDLGovernment Operations and Interior and Insular Affairs.  Environmental  issues were one area in which Steelman left his mark, particularly the  fight against the Trinity River Canal and for the formation of Big Thicket  National Preserve.  Other legislative priorities for
Steelman included energy, transportation, veterans, wage and price controls, and Social Security. </p><p>His road to the House began with his upbringing in two towns in Arkansas:  Arkadelphia and Fordyce.  Steelman later attended Baylor University on a baseball  scholarship and received his B.A. in
Political Science in 1964.  Next,  he led the Republican Party of Dallas County from January 1966 to January 1969,  and in 1971 graduated from Southern Methodist University with an  M.L.A.  During his leadership of the Dallas County Republicans, Steelman  also remained executive director of the Sam
Wyly Foundation of Dallas from January to September in 1969.  President Richard Nixon appointed Steelman  the executive director of the President's Advisory Council on Minority  Business Enterprise in that same September in 1969.   Steelman held that post until  he stepped down to run for Congress
January 1972.    </p><p>Steelman ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in 1976 and lost to Democratic incumbent Lloyd Bentsen.  In 1977, he began work with the Alexander Proudfoot Company, a worldwide consulting firm listed on the London Stock Exchange.  He was appointed by Governor  George W.
Bush to the Texas Growth Fund Board, a $600 million venture capital fund run by the  State of Texas. Other posts included Vice Chairman of the Board at the John Tower Center for Political Studies at SMU and the Trinity Foundation, Chairman of the Dallas Council on World Affairs, and former President
of Maxager Technology, Inc. (now Profit Velocity Solutions), a private, California-based, software company.  </p><p>While at Proudfoot, Steelman was Group President for the Asia-Pacific region. This enabled him to live in Singapore for eight  years and build the Proudfoot start-up in that
geographical area.  Steelman oversaw the company's business interests in Malaysia, New  Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong,  and Thailand.  He currently lectures on U.S.-Asia relations, drawing from his business experience in that part of the world.
</p><p>Steelman  is married to his wife Susan, the former Susan Seligman Fuller, and is  father to five children: Robin Whitehead, Kim Cuban, Allison Carter,  Alan Steelman Jr., and Alex Steelman.  He has two stepchildren, Daniel  Fuller and Elizabeth Fuller.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The  Alan W. Steelman papers contain materials from 1960-2003, the bulk of  which are from 1973-1976: Steelman's service as U.S. Representative of  Texas's Fifth Congressional District. The Administrative series consists  of GOP office and district information, requests, and schedules. The
Biographical section has background information on Steelman after his  House race victory in 1973 and personal, family news articles from  1960-1969, and a folder of information on his Proudfoot leadership  role. Campaigns feature news  clippings, press releases, and campaign literature from two
years:   Steelman's 1972 House Campaign and his 1976 Senate Campaign.  A large  portion of the news clippings on the Senate campaign have now been rehoused in archival safe folders.   </p>
   <p>Constituent  correspondence are arranged alphabetically, by incoming/outgoing correspondence, and  topically. </p>
   <p></p>
   <p>The  Departments and Agencies series enumerates Steelman's contact with  numerous federal agencies from 1973-1976. By far, the bulk of this series illuminates how Steelman voiced a  variety of constituent concerns to the U.S. Postal Service.  Also of  note are recommendations written by
Steelman on behalf  of constituents to different federal departments such as the Department  of Labor, Department of Justice, and the White House. The District  series for Dallas highlights Dallas area concerns and contains  photographs in the file on the Urban Park Baptist Singers.  A Texas
subseries of the District series mainly consists of materials on  individual cities in Steelman's district, but also holds numerous  folders on general affairs in Texas or local communities.  </p>
   <p>Next, Legislation by Committee encompasses bills from ten different  Congressional committees.  Legislation on banking and currency issues  make up the largest subseries, followed by the Judiciary Committee  subseries. The Judiciary Committee subseries chronicles sentiment in Steelman's
district for and against bills on  President Nixon's impeachment and the Watergate break in.  Other notable  subseries include: Government Operations, Interior &amp; Insular Affairs (both of which Steelman served on) and the Cabinet Committee on Spanish  Speaking People.  Land use controversies
dominates the subseries on  Interior and Insular Affairs, just as revenue sharing does in the  Government Operations subseries.  </p>
   <p> The Legislative series contains three subseries.  Major topics in the 93rd  Congress subseries include, ecology, the economy, commerce, Citizens  Band radios, transportation, and FDA consumer vitamin labeling.  Land  use, conservation, the EPA, ecology, healthcare, transportation, and
veterans issues prevail in the 94th Congress series. The Topical subseries in the Legislative series itemizes some of  Steelman's highest legislative priorities:  AMTRAK, Big Thicket, Energy,  and the Trinity River.  Binders also held these materials prior to  processing.  Here, General materials
contain legislative analysis from the American Enterprise Institute dated 1965-1967, and later from 1973-1976. </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p> The  Columns, Magazines, and Newsletters subseries of the Press are in  poor condition.  The Magazines  subseries highlights Steelman's favorable reception by the mainstream  Texas and American media upon his election and after his two terms in  Congress. Steelman's Speeches and Floor
Statements are in average condition and range from 1968  to his years after Congress.  All of the post-Congressional speeches  are undated and the majority of the speeches are from 1973.   Additionally, most of the speeches were written on a typewriter with  hand-written corrections.  The Voting
Record series retains alpha  ordering by issue from the years 1973 to 1975.  Steelman's voting by issue  in 1976 is missing, but his roll call votes from 1973 to1976 exist in this series. The Photographs in the Audio-Visual series largely came out of three notebooks.  A  little over half of the
photographs are undated and many have negatives. A list of the monthly radio programs Steelman gave in the Reel-to-Reel items.  </p>
   <p>The Clippings series contains photocopied clippings and is in good condition. This series spans the years  1966-2002 and has four subseries: General, House Campaign, News  Clippings Scrapbooks, and Senate Campaign.  The General subseries  consists of articles from Steelman's time as chair of
the Dallas County Republican Party and the Dallas Council on World Affairs to his  directorship of the Wyly  Foundation and employment at the Alexander Proudfoot Company.  The News Clippings Scrapbooks encompass the years 1973 to 1976 and are oversized.  Lastly, the Casework series ranges from 1975
to 1976.</p>

   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>This series comprises the majority of Steelman's correspondence with constituents in four subseries by year: 1972-1973, 1974, 1975, 1976.   Each subseries except the 1976 subseries contains four sub-subseries: Alpha, Incoming, Outgoing,  and Topical.  Incoming and Outgoing sub-subseries deal
with praise,  thanks, and congratulations to and from Steelman. The topical sections  have letters on pertinent issues from that year, such as Steelman's controversial 1973 naming of the federal building  in Dallas after his opponent in the 1973 Texas Fifth Congressional  District race, Earle
Cabell. This series is in good condition. Alphabetical ordering by the first two letters of the constituent's last name structures the 1973 correspondence. Incoming and outgoing correspondence for 1972-1973 mainly consists of thank you notes, praise, and congratulatory letters while the 1972-1973
topical subseries heavily leans towards Dallas Metroplex issues. The years of 1974-1976 mirror the 1972-1973 arrangement and thematic focus. 1976 correspondence lacks an alpha subseries.</p>

   <p>This series encompasses Steelman's work in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas with two subseries: Dallas and Texas.  The Dallas subseries contains materials on AMTRAK's service to that city, community activism, and records of Steelman's trips in January and February 1973.  Particular
localities, numerous industries (mining, air travel, tool manufacturing, food processing), and state and local relations figure prominently in the Texas subseries. This series remains in good condition.</p>

   <p>Three subseriesDL93rd Congress, 94th Congress, and TopicalDLreside in this series.  It is the largest in the Steelman papers. These subseries were in binders prior to processing.  In the 93rd  Congress subseries, many folders center around the economy, Citizens  Band radios, ecology,
transportation, commerce, and FDA consumer vitamin  labeling. Conservation, the EPA, healthcare, transportation, veterans  issues, and ecology remain prominent in the 94th Congress series.  Unique documents such as materials on urban homesteading and Guam's constitution are in the 93rd and 94th
Congresses, respectively.  Other interesting pieces comprise a bill brought to the floor of the 93rd Congress to make the marigold the U.S. national flower, and Steelman's baseball cards from his stint in the Congressional Baseball Game. Heavy sampling took place in the 94th Congress subseries.
Moreover, a folder in 94th Congress entitled "Patriotism, 'Our United States-Help Save It' " contains a tape recording. A trio of folders on the elderly expound on Steelman's special concern for them, exhibited in photos in the A/V series of the papers.  The Topical subseries contains five
sub-subseries: General, Amtrak, Big Thicket, Energy, and  Trinity River.  These five sub-subseries chronicle the areas of  expertise (and the largest issues) Steelman worked on during his four  years in the U.S. Congress.  The Big Thicket and Trinity River  sub-subseries demarcate the two large
conservation efforts he passed  into law at the national level. This series remains in average condition.</p>

   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Overall,  the Press series remains in good condition, though the Columns,  Magazines, and Topical subseries are in poor condition compared to the  Releases subseries. The Columns subseries contains articles written by and  about Steelman.  Steelman's achievements are highlighted in the
Magazines subseries, which includes pieces on him from outlets such as <emph render="italic">TIME</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Harvard Political Review</emph>.  The  Releases subseries constitutes the largest part of the series and has  alphabetical ordering according to the title of the release.    A conglomeration of documents on subjects from
Steelman's talking  points to a pamphlet introducing Steelman from the first session of the  93rd Congress comprise the Topical subseries.</p>

   <p>In average condition, the Speeches and Floor Statements series spans the length of Steelman's professional career before and during his time in the U.S. Congress and encompasses two subseries: Floor Statements and Speeches.  The Floor Statements subseries has chronological ordering from
1973-1976 and the 1976 folder holds Steelman's appearances in the Congressional Record from that year.  The Speeches subseries is in alphabetical order.   His speech to the AFL-CIO and his pamphlet, "How to Be An Active  Congressional Constituent" retain parts from his time as the chair of  the
Dallas County Republican Party.</p>

   <p>The Clippings series contains four subseries: General, House Campaign, News Clippings Scrapbooks, and Senate Campaign.  The General subseries was in the original inventory   but the other three were created during processing.  Steelman's  post-Congressional work with the Alexander Proudfoot
Company in  1989-1990 and the Dallas Council for World Affairs in 2000-2002 is highlighted in the General subseries, as is his pre-Congressional leadership of the Wyly Foundation (1969)  and the Dallas County Republican Party (1966-1968).  The House Campaign  subseries is divided in three groups of
months while the Senate  Campaign subseries has three separate articles.  Subdivided by year, the News Clippings Scrapbooks are in oversized boxes.  This series is in good condition and most of the clippings have been copied.</p>
