   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The Legion Valley Massacre was one of many violent events in the history of Texan-Indian relations. The scrapbook in this collection describes the homestead of one family in Llano County, Texas, and the violent confrontation between Comanche Indians and some Euro-Americans living in the
area.</p><p>With the American Civil War ending in 1865, Euro-Americans were moving West again, onto lands already controlled by American Indian tribes. Llano County, Texas, west of Austin, had just become a county in 1856, and people were still moving there in search of land for farms and ranches.
In south Llano County, several related families settled at the confluence of the Sandy and Legion Creeks. These families included the Friends and two related Johnson families, who were all involved in the 1868 massacre.</p><p>On 1868 February 5, the three men from these three families left to get
supplies from the nearby town of Fredricksburg. That left their three wives, Matilda Jones Friend, Elizabeth "Betsy" Townsend Johnson Bradford, and Samantha Johnson, as well as their infant children Nancy Elizabeth Johnson and Fielty Johnson. Lee Temple Friend, eight years old, son of Matilda Jones
Friend and the only male of the group, was present as well. Also staying with the group at this time were 18-year-old Amanda Townsend, cousin of the Johnsons, and 11-year-old Malinda Caudel, also a relative of the families.</p><p>At the end of the day, with the children playing in the yard, a group
of Indians rode in and began to steal horses at some distance from the house. Hearing the screams of the women and children, the Indians charged the house, taking everyone prisoner except for Matilda Jones Friend, whom they shot three times, scalped twice, and left for dead. Incredibly, Matilda
walked a mile and half to the nearest help with two or three arrows still in her. She recovered and lived near Marble Falls, Texas, until 1909.</p><p>Only Malinda Caudle and Lee Temple Friend of the captured women and children survived. The children were brutally killed and the women were sexually
assaulted and killed. Their bodies were found one by one by a group of men who set out to rescue them, but were too late. Malinda and Lee were reunited with what remained of their families several years after their capture, though Lee died shortly after coming into Anglo-American society.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Bolt Family Homestead and Legion Valley Indian Massacre collection begins and ends in 1985. Though all of the photographs, manuscripts, maps, and genealogical information dates from 1985, it all describes the people involved in the Legion Valley Indian Massacre Collection of 1868.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>This collection documents the Legion Valley Indian Massacre and the Bolt  Family homestead. It is not clear what relationship the Bolts had with  the Legion Valley incident. A large part of the scrapbook also traces  the history of the Johnson family, which was involved in the Legion  River
event.</p>
