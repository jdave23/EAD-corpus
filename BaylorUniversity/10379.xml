   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Albert Horton Foote, Jr., more commonly known as Horton Foote, was a renowned American dramatist and screenwriter.  Albert was born on 1916 March 14 in Wharton, Texas, a town 40 miles southwest of Houston.  He was the eldest of three sons born to Albert Horton Foote, Sr. and Harriet Gautier
Brooks.</p><p>            From his youth, Foote desired to become an actor.  Upon graduating from high school at age sixteen, he moved to Pasadena, California, and eventually to New York City, studying method acting and performing at various theaters and playhouses.  While living in New York City,
Foote met Lillian Vallish whom he married on June 4, 1945.  They were together until 1992, when Lillian passed away.</p><p>Foote struggled to find success as a young actor.  After receiving encouragement from various mentors, he ultimately found his calling in writing, excelling at dramatic plays
for television and Broadway.  In many of his stories, Foote focused on the theme of human suffering, and often set the action in fictional Texas towns.  He enjoyed relative success throughout his lengthy career, winning two Oscars and a Pulitzer Prize.  He passed away in Hartford, Connecticut, on
2009 March 4 at the age of ninety-two.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Horton Foote Screenplay collection consists of three scripts and two screenplays composed by Texas-born writer Horton Foote.  The works span a large portion of Foote's writing career with the earliest script dated 1954 and the latest being 1991.  Overall, the materials are in excellent
condition.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>There are two screenplays in the collection that Foote adapted for the big screen. The first is Foote's adaptation of his own play, <emph render="italic">The Traveling Lady</emph>.  The film, released in 1965, later had its name changed to <emph render="italic">Baby The Rain Must Fall</emph>.  The second screenplay is a film adaptation of John
Steinbeck's literary classic, <emph render="italic">Of Mice and Men</emph>.  This was directed by Gary Sinise and released in 1992.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The collection also contains three scripts written expressly as plays to be performed for theater. These include <emph render="italic">The Traveling Lady</emph> (1954) and <emph render="italic">The Habitation of Dragons</emph> (1988), both of which were later adapted for films.  The final script, <emph render="italic">A Nightingale </emph>(1982), constitutes part one of a
three-act play entitled <emph render="italic">The Roads to Home</emph>.</p>

   <p> </p>
   <p>The Horton Foote Screenplay collection has now been described and is arranged into a single series, I. Literary Productions.  The materials are organized alphabetically by document type.</p>
