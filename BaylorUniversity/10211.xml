   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>    Annie E. Keeling was born in 1887 October to Ben and Arie Keeling.  After moving to Waco in the early 1900’s, the Keeling family lived on North Sixth Street.  Annie attended college at Central Texas College, a school in Waco with close ties to her church, New Hope Baptist.  In college,
she majored in general education, but took a special interest in poetry and drama.  She was part of several plays at Central Texas College, and also traveled around the local area giving dramatic readings at local churches.  She also wrote several plays and poems, two of which make up this
collection.</p><p>    Annie married Sarnie Randle on 1911 July 12.  After getting married, she helped to start the Waco City Department of Recreation as a volunteer.  She was later hired to teach drama and speech in the Waco Public Schools, but in order to be trained to teach, she attended Baylor
University without getting credit.  This was in approximately 1932, many years before the first black student was officially admitted to Baylor.  After retirement, Randle was involved with many local clubs, including a gardening club and an art club.  She died on Christmas Day in 1984.  This
collection is an excellent resource for anybody interested in early 20th-century theater, or the black community in Waco.</p>
