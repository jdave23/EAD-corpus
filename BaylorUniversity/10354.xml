   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The Belton-Temple Traction Company built one of the earliest interurban railways in Texas when it constructed a 13-mile line between the two towns in 1904-1905.  Belton was the county seat of Bell County and by the 1880's had become a regional hub for the cotton trade.  Temple, which had been
founded in 1881 to serve the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway, had quickly surpassed Belton in population and offered opportunities for increased economic growth. </p><p> </p><p>The citizens of Belton also sought to expand their markets southward via the railroad.  At the turn of the century,
Williamson County was the second largest producer of cotton in Texas.  Albert Bentley and other leading businessmen surveyed land for a potential rail line to the south in 1913. </p><p> </p><p>In 1918, the Belton-Temple Traction Company was re-organized as the Southwestern Traction Company with
Albert Bentley as its president.  Unfortunately, improved roadways and the rise of the automobile industry led to the gradual decline of the interurban railways in Texas.  Although citizens of Belton were able to file a Writ of Injunction through the courts to stop the destruction of the
Belton-Temple Interurban line in 1918, service was ultimately terminated by the Southwestern Traction Company in 1926.  By 1948, virtually all Texas interurban railways had ceased operations.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>Series I. Legal Documents, is comprised of two documents.  The first, dated 1913, is an agreement between Albert Bentley, future President of the Southwestern Traction Company, and the citizens of Belton to fund a survey for the construction of a line from Belton to Williamson County to the
south.  The second document, dated October 1918, is a Writ of Injunction filed by various citizens of Belton in order to prevent the destruction of the Interurban track between Belton and Temple.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Series II. Literary Productions contains a single, undated newspaper clipping which chronicled Albert Bentley's desire to build a rail line from Dallas to Houston, incorporating the track that had already been constructed from Temple to Belton in 1904-1905.  </p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The materials in this collection range in chronology from 1913 to 1918.  Most of the materials in this collection have been sleeved and are in average condition.</p>

   <p>This series contains two legal documents involving the railroad industry and Belton.  The first is a contractual agreement made in 1913 between Albert F. Bentley and the citizens of Belton.  Bentley and several local businessmen spearheaded the effort to raise funds for a survey of a potential
rail line between Belton and Williamson County to the south.</p><p> </p><p>The second document is a Writ of Injunction filed by the citizens of Belton in October 1918 to stop the destruction of the Belton-Temple Interurban line. Judge F.H. Spann ordered the defendants, primarily individuals from
Temple, not to destroy the track.  The materials in this series are in average condition.</p>
