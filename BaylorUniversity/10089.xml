   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Baylor University students have been active in Texas military forces going back to the American Civil War in 1861-1865. The Baylor Cadets were an on-campus military organization that carried on this tradition from 1888 until 1904, preparing Baylor students for possible duty with the armed
forces.</p><p>The Baylor Cadets were formed in 1888 as a military company under the command of Albert Boggess, a mathematics professor at the time. Boggess, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute and veteran of the Civil War Battle of New Market in 1864, moved to Texas in 1866. He succeeded in
getting the student-soldiers navy-blue uniforms and an adequate amount of the gear necessary for an infantry company. It seems there were never enough firearms and ammunition to outfit the cadets; several manuscripts in this collection mention obtaining more of both. At some point the Baylor Cadets
became a department of Baylor University. Professor Albert Boggess, commander of the cadets, died in 1891.</p><p>From 1891 until 1893, the cadets ran their own military training program, probably under the supervision of faculty members. The collection contains a minute book detailing the cadets'
administration of their own department from 1888 until 1893. </p><p>In1893 December, Lieutenant Beaumont Bonaparte Buck arrived to command the cadets at the request of the Baylor Board of Trustees. Lieutenant Buck completely reorganized the department, issued new Springfield rifles to the cadets,
and added two cannons and signaling equipment. He also designed a new blue uniform for the cadets modeled on the Texas Volunteer Guard. The Baylor Cadets were now able to field two infantry companies, one artillery battery, and one signal unit. </p><p>In 1894,Baylor University began requiring all
male Baylor University students to serve in the cadet corps for three years. The Military Department, under Lieutenant Buck, was tasked with developing "manliness, courtesy, accuracy, promptness, and devotion to duty," as well as physical fitness, in the young men of the Baylor Cadets. To accomplish
this, the department conducted regular drills and offered lectures on a variety of military topics. Lieutenant Buck also hosted prize contests for the best drilled company, the best drilled squad, the best drilled cadet, and a rifle-shooting contest. The collection contains a drill and regulation
book from 1894, when Lieutenant Buck commanded the Baylor Cadets.</p><p>Lieutenant Buck served as commandant of cadets for only two years, but his reforms and establishment of professional standards for the department lasted for years. Beaumont Buck later became a major general in the United States
army and received many awards in World War I. He resigned in 1895 because of health reasons, and was replaced by Lieutenant Jonas A. Emery. </p><p>Lieutenant Emery made several changes to the Baylor Cadets. Because of all the new cadets, now that Baylor required military service from all male
students, the number of infantry companies was increased from two to ten. The uniform was also changed from blue to cadet grey, new flags were ordered for the signal corps, a military band was formed which eventually became the Golden Wave Marching Band, and the Baylor Cadets began to occasionally
hold "sham battles" on campus.</p><p>In 1898 Lieutenant Emery was recalled to active service for the Spanish-American War, and the cadets ran their own department for the next three years. Apparently the department was run well in the absence of a formal commander. New commander Major Edward G.
Mathey took command in 1901 as the last commander of the Baylor Cadets.</p><p>Major Mathey at the time of his appointment to command the Baylor cadets was a retired United States military officer. He had served in many campaigns against the American Indians, including the Little Bighorn Campaign in
1876 and the Nez Perce Campaign of 1877. When Major Mathey arrived at Baylor, he organized the 159 men into three infantry companies and an artillery battery. Regular drill was continued in the area around Burleson Hall until 1902, when they began to drill in the athletic field on campus. Apparently
requiring male students to serve in the Baylor Cadets had been discontinued at some point, but Major Mathey succeeded in requiring male students to serve for one year in the Baylor Cadets. </p><p>In 1902, the band and the cadets parted ways, with the band becoming a stand-alone program at the
university. The coming of football as an alternative physical exercise to military drill as a cadet irritated Major Mathey enough to claim "football has no more relation to physical culture than a bull fight to agriculture." Major Mathey resigned in 1903, probably to retire permanently. </p><p>In
1904, the Baylor trustees decided to end the Baylor Cadets program. A regular army officer could not be supplied to command the cadets, and students seemed to be losing interest in the program. Another reason was supplied by the Baylor <emph render="italic">Lariat</emph> publication, that many thought the most athletic men
should be helping Baylor in athletics, not military exercises. Whatever reasons were involved for ending the program, the Baylor Cadets organization had trained a generation of young men in the art of war, and this training was put to use by many Baylor men who fought in the Spanish-American War and
World War I.</p>
