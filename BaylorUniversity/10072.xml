   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Benjamin Rush Milam was born on 1788 October 20 to Moses and Elizabeth Pattie Boyd Milam in Frankfort, KY. He fought in the War of 1812 with the 8th regiment, 39th infantry company of the Kentucky militia, serving from 1812 August 17 to December 8. By 1818, Milam was in Texas, trading with the
Comanche Indians on the Colorado River. The following year he joined José Félix Trespalacios and James Long in what became known as the “Long Expedition,” working to separate Mexico and Texas from Spain. Milam became a Mexican citizen under the new constitutional government on 1824 June 24,
and was commissioned as a colonel in the Mexican army.  Sometime after 1826, Milam was engaged to Annie McKinney. After returning from a trip to England in 1829, however, Milam found that McKinney had married another. He never married.</p><p>On 1826 January 12, Milam signed a contract granting him
permission to establish “Milam’s Colony.” The agreement required that he settle                  three hundred Catholic families on the land within six years. Milam failed to do so and the contract expired on 1832 January 25. The claims of the fifty-two families in Milam’s ColonyDLlike
those of settlers across TexasDLwere therefore in question. In 1835, Milam convinced the governor of Coahuila and Texas, Agustin Viesca, to grant land titles to Texas settlers. Shortly thereafter, however, Antonio López de Santa Anna overthrew the government and captured Viesca and Milam on 1835 June
5. </p><p>Milam escaped in October and joined a band of Texans under George Collinsworth who were fighting for independence from Mexico. They captured Goliad and then marched to San Antonio. On December 4, Milam heard that most of the men had given up the plan to attack San Antonio. He challenged
the army by asking, “Who will go with old Ben Milam into San Antonio?” Three hundred men volunteered, and the attack began on 1835 December 5. Four days later, General Martin Perfecto     de Cós      and the Mexican army surrendered. Milam did not live to see the victory, however; he was
killed by a sniper’s bullet on December 7. Milam is believed to be buried in Milam Park in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
