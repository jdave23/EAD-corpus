   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Georgia Jenkins Burleson was born in Merriweather, Georgia, to Judge Pleasant C. and Harriet Daniel Jenkins, in 1833 September. She moved to Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas, in 1836. In 1852 she graduated from Judson Female Institute in Marion, Alabama. A year later Georgia married Rufus
Columbus Burleson on 1853 January 3 in Independence, Texas. </p><p>The family moved to Waco, Texas, in 1861, when Rufus Burleson became president of Waco University. Georgia Burleson was active in the community, serving as a charter member of Columbus Avenue Baptist Church and also as a matron at
Baylor University. She was the mother of five children. Only two of her children survived adolescence, Hallie Byrd Burleson and Richard Adair Burleson. She died on 1924 June 11. The second oldest building at Baylor University, built in 1887, was named Georgia Burleson Hall in her honor.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Literary Production series is the largest in the Georgia Jenkins Burleson collection and includes <emph render="italic">The Evergreen</emph>, a gift book with a collection of short stories published in the 1850s. The series also contains a diary transcript and a speech transcript. The diary transcript describes two
trips taken by Burleson and her husband. The first was an account of traveling to Gonzales, Texas, for the Baptist State Convention in 1855 January. The second account describes a trip taken to Waco, Texas, for a Waco Baptist Association meeting in 1857 October. Both travel logs document Burleson's
impressions of travel conditions such as scenery, roads, and lodging accommodations. They also give insight into the life of a Texas minister's wife. The speech transcript was taken from an address delivered to the Waco Baptist Association in 1934 October by Richard A. Burleson, son of Georgia
Burleson. In the speech, Richard refers to an excerpt from his mother's diary. The excerpt is of the trip to Waco for the Baptist Association Meeting. Richard dates the trip as 1859 rather than the 1857 date listed in the diary transcript.</p>
   <p>The Scrapbook series has a scrapbook that has two entries and one letter written from Mollie Burrells to Georgia Burleson. The album also contains four pencil sketches including one of Baylor University at Independence, Texas.</p>
