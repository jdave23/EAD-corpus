   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway was chartered on 1873 May 28.  The owners designed the railroad with the intention of promoting trade between the port of Galveston and the Texas interior by ultimately by-passing the city of Houston.  Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the name suggests, was the
railroad's western terminal.</p><p> </p><p>Many of the inhabitants of Central Texas wanted railroads to pass through their towns for the potential of increased commerce and growth; the people of Belton were no exception.  The citizens of Bell County hoped to attract the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe
Railway to Belton.  The railroad agreed on the condition that Bell County raise $75,000 for the project.  Local citizen Orville Thomas (O.T.) Tyler vowed to donate $1,000 and a portion of his land holdings near Belton to jump-start the project.  His attorney, George W. Tyler, was a famous lawyer,
Texas Senator (1888-1892), and local historian.  He drafted the deed.  </p><p> </p><p>The deed itself was eventually cancelled as the railroad executives opted instead to build a track from Temple to Valley Mills in 1881.  However, Belton was eventually connected to the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe
Railway in 1882 with track leading to Lampasas.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The single document that comprises this collection is dated June 19, 1880.  It is a land deed from Bell County, although the transaction was eventually cancelled.  O.T. Tyler, who offered to donate money and land to the construction project, sought to attract the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe
Railway Company to connect to Belton, Texas.  The document is in good condition.</p>

<p>Prior to the latest round of processing, this collection consisted of one folder that lacked a descriptive title.  A single land deed constitutes the contents of the collection.</p>
   <p>The document has been re-sleeved and described.  The collection is now organized into a single series: I. Legal Documents.</p>
