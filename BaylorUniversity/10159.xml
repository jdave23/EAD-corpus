   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>James Anderson Slover, the son of John and Rachel Slover, was born on 1824 September 15 in Jefferson County in East Tennessee. Slover spent the majority of his youth working at the family mill and later at the family farm. A section of Slover's autobiography focuses on stories about memorable
experiences from his childhood, his experiences growing up on a farm, various religious events, and a variety of schooling adventures. After attending several schools, seminary, and later teaching and preaching, Slover married a former student, Harriet M. Ingram, on 1850 January 17.</p><p>Shortly
after their marriage, Slover and his wife moved to Washington County, Arkansas. During their time in Arkansas, Slover set up a school and participated in the local religious community. James and Harriet had five children, two sons and three daughters.</p><p>In 1856, Slover got an appointment from
the Southern Baptist Convention through the Domestic and Indian Mission Board to preach to the Cherokee Indians. After accepting this appointment, he moved to Tahlequah, capital of the Cherokee Nation, and began extremely successful operations as a missionary. After the completion of this missionary
work, Slover and his wife moved back near his old home at Elm Springs and purchased forty acres. </p><p>Slover's autobiography details various events and political tensions which occurred during the American Civil War. Religious issues pertaining to the Native American perception of slavery are
discussed in the context of the Civil War.</p><p>At some point, Harriet Slover passed away, leaving James to care for their five children. James Slover later married Josephine M. Rodgers, with whom he had an additional two children. Slover moved back to Arkansas to continue with his missionary work,
but farther west than he had been before. However, he struggled to make a success in farming, and he eventually gave it up to preach and teach in the community.</p><p>Towards the end of his life he traveled to see family, acquaintances, and friends. At the conclusion of his trip he moved to Oregon
to live with one of his daughters. Slover died of pneumonia on 1913 November 13 and was buried in Ashland, Oregon, in Pioneer Cemetery.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The James Anderson Slover papers include a manuscript by Slover. This manuscript appears to be an early typed version of the book <emph render="italic">Minister to the Cherokees:  A Civil War Autobiography</emph> edited by Barbara Cloud.  The title headings and all of the text appears to be the same, but the manuscript in
this collection has a different preface and a different photograph of Slover than the book contains.</p>
   <p>The entire collection is undated, though it is thought to be from circa 1907-1913. The only series in the collection, Autobiography, contains a manuscript written by James Anderson Slover. This autobiographical sketch encompasses Slover's lifetime of 83 years. The text includes descriptions of
significant events in American History including the Civil War and Reconstruction. These events are supplemented by personal details of Slover's life such as his career, family, travels, schooling, and general observations of day to day activities.</p>
