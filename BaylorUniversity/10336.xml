   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Judge Joseph Hickman Aynesworth (1874-1940) was born on November 11, 1874, in Williamson, Texas, to George L. Aynesworth and Sarah Ellen Hickman. Joseph Hickman Aynesworth was an attorney and judge. He married Mary Alice Timmons on December 17, 1895. Together, they had nine children.
Aynesworth passed away on July 25, 1940, in McLennan County. He is buried in Childress, Texas.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Joseph Hickman Aynesworth papers are divided into two series: I. Aynesworth  Family Photographs and II. Scrapbook. The entire first series of photographs have handwritten notes on the back identifying people in the photograph as members of the Aynesworth family. Only one photograph is
dated, possibly circa 1935. The other photographs are presumed to be from a similar time period, with a few probably dating to earlier 1900's. This series is in good condition. The second series, Scrapbook, contains a scrapbook filled with clippings. Some of these clippings were written by Joseph
Hickman Aynesworth. They discuss local and Texas history. This series is in average condition, with some acid deterioration, however, the scrapbook has kept the clippings well-preserved. All of these clippings date from 1924-1936.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to current processing, the collection was placed into two file folders. They were organized by photographs in one folder and a scrapbook with clippings in the second folder. Neither of these folders had folder titles. The series created by these folders was kept in current processing. There
are now two series: I. Family Photographs II. Scrapbook.</p>
