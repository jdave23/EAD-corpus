   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center has collected documents on the Rerikhi group in the Soviet Union from 1987-1998 with the bulk of the content from
1994.</p><p>Rerikhism was created by “Nikolai Konstantinovich [Rerikh] and Yelena Ivanovna [Rerikh, who] were able to unite eastern religious values intrinsically with Russian culture and even with certain substantial borrowings from Orthodox Christianity” (Lunkin and Filatov 2000, 138-139).
While parts of their philosophy were taken from Christian concepts, overall, the religion denies many tenants of the faith. The primary text of this worldview is the Agni Yoga which was produced during the 1920s and 1930s. Surprisingly, Rerikhism had no hold within the Soviet Union until around
1960, decades after the Agni Yoga was completed.</p>
