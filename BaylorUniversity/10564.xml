   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>George Green immigrated to Big Rapids, Michigan, from England in 1914. He stayed with his uncle Frederick Hurdle and his wife, Ida. Green enlisted in the military on 1916 February 14, when he was sent to the Texas-Mexico border as a result of the Pancho Villa raids with the 32nd Division.
Following that conflict, the 32nd was activated for service in World War I, and Green was sent to Camp MacArthur, Texas, to train. While in training, the 32nd unit was converted to the 126th United States Infantry Regiment. Green was deployed to France in 1918. On 1918 August 7, Green was poisoned
with mustard gas, resulting in a case of otitis media, an ear infection that causes a putrid discharge and deafness. On 1918 August 10 he was promoted to the rank of corporal. He was finally discharged from the hospital on November 1st, and then was assigned to the 292nd Military Police Company
where he served until June 10, 1919. He was promoted twice more during his service, to sergeant on June 1, 1919, and 1st Sergeant on 1919 July 28. Green then served with the Guard Company 135 Infantry until 1919 October 20, when he returned to the United States. He was officially discharged from
military service on 1919 November 9.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The George Green papers consist of materials from 1916-1919, with some notes from a transcription dating to 2017. The papers document Green's time in the military, serving on the Texas-Mexico border and in France. The photographs were originally part of a bound photo album. However, due to
degradation of the glue used to secure the photographs to the construction paper, many photographs were loose. In order to make the collection easy to research and use, the loose photographs were removed from the book. Series I, World War I Materials, contains a diary, a transcription of the diary,
and photographs.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">

<p>The collection contained three bound volumes. For the current round of processing, the materials were grouped topically.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Currently, the collection has one series: World War I Materials.</p>
