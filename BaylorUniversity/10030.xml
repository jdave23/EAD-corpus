   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Smith’s-Turner’s artillery battery operated for the entire war.  The unit, raised in Clarke County, Mississippi, was originally intended to be an infantry company, but was consolidated with another company and turned into artillery.  The two amalgamated units were commanded by Captain
Melancthon Smith, a native of Alabama who had served in the United States army and attended West Point.</p><p>The artillery battery served with Leonidas Polk’s Army of the Mississippi , which operated along the Mississippi River.  By 1862, Polk’s army, including Smith’s-Turner’s Battery,
was called upon for every major Civil War campaign in the west, including the battles of Shiloh, Perryville, Stone’s River, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and Mobile.  Captain Smith prior to the 1862 Kentucky Campaign was promoted to chief of artillery for the division, and William B. Turner
became acting battery commander.  Smith later became the chief of artillery for Hardee’s Corps during the Atlanta Campaign, with the rank of Colonel.  Smith’s-Turner’s Artillery Battery ended the war in Alabama, with Smith as overall artillery commander, and Turner in command of the
battery.</p>

 for operating an artillery unit during the American Civil War. Several papers that were inserted into the account book were removed and placed into folders, with the page number they were found on written in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
