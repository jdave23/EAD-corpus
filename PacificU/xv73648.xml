      <p>Carol and Herb Drew were students at Pacific University from 1956-1960. Both were journalism majors and were involved in many clubs and activities on campus. Carol, whose maiden name was Bowser, married Herb while they were enrolled.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The collection is comprised of approximately 40 black-and-white photographs depicting student life at Pacific University from 1956-1960. Some of the photographs were apparently created for the Pacific University Index (the student newspaper) during that time period. Some notable subjects include sporting events, Greek letter societies (Phi Lambda Omicron and Alpha Zeta), portraits of individual students, plans for the construction of Walter Hall, a "Boxer Toss," librarians in the old Carnegie Library, and the swimsuit competition in a "Miss Forest Grove" contest. Also present in the collection is one envelope of negatives.</p>
