      <p>The collection consists of three small photograph albums. The first is labelled "Snaps of Josephine Harriman" and features very small photographs, probably of her classmates at Pacific University; most are portraits but there are a few outdoor scenes. The second is labelled "My Last Vacation" but most of the pictures appear to have been taken on the Pacific University campus. The third album, which is mostly blank, features approximately 15 small prints of women in outdoor scenes, probably in Oregon circa 1900. With the exception of one cyanotype, all the photographs are silver gelatin prints.</p>
