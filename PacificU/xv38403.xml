      <p>The Young Women's Christian Association at Pacific University was formed in 1892 with a total of sixteen members. By 1899, approximately two-thirds of the female students on campus (42 of 68) were members. The YWCA met regularly during the school year. Its members arranged on-campus bible studies for the University women, ran prayer meetings, sponsored talks on missionary work, and contributed to charity.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The record book includes a constitution, meeting minutes and membership lists from 1892-1900. It provides details on the YWCA's activities at Pacific University, such as prayer meetings, bible study, charity work, studies of missionary work, and participation in regional YWCA activities. Several blank Pacific University student registration cards, an instruction sheet entitled "The Bean" (apparently a work-sheet from a botany class), and some notes about YWCA committees are also laid in.</p>
