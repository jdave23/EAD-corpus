<p>The collection consists of three items - a photograph album, book, and newspaper clipping. The photograph album features images of Pacific University during Reeher's time as a student, including activities such as as sports, May Day and theatrical presentations; individual and group views of classmates and faculty; and graduation ceremonies. Some images are identified; most are not. The book,
<title render="italic">The Home Within the Wilderness</title> was written by Mildred S. Reeher and tells the story of the Reeher family traveling to and settling in Oregon in 1887. The newspaper clipping appeared in the News-Times (Forest Grove) as part of their "Senior Clips" series and featured Reeher and her memories of Pacific University, Forest Grove, and married life.</p>

<p>The collection contains approximately 80 glossy black and white prints of the Pacific front of World War II. Some significant images within the collection include the bombing of Pearl Harbor; the bombardment of Guam; aircraft and ships in battle; sailors engaged in fighting and evacuations; the Japanese surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri, and other signings of surrenders; and others. All the photographs appear to be publicity shots for the United States Navy. According to notes that arrived with the collection, the prints were given from a Navy photographer to Kevin Trainor, who gave them to Dean Howard L. Smith, who donated them to the Pacific University Archives.</p>

<p>The collection consists of three small photograph albums. The first is labelled "Snaps of Josephine Harriman" and features very small photographs, probably of her classmates at Pacific University; most are portraits but there are a few outdoor scenes. The second is labelled "My Last Vacation" but most of the pictures appear to have been taken on the Pacific University campus. The third album, which is mostly blank, features approximately 15 small prints of women in outdoor scenes, probably in Oregon circa 1900. With the exception of one cyanotype, all the photographs are silver gelatin prints.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This collection consists of photographs, awards, yearbooks, publications and memorabilia that Wille and Truman Teeter collected. Most of the material is related to their connections to Pacific University, such as awards that Willie Teeter won for her service as a staff member. Several issues of "The Optimist," the yearbook of Forest Grove High School from their daughter's time there, are also present.</p>
<p>Note: Cookbooks that belonged to Willie Teeter are cataloged separately, under MS.100. Yearbooks and runs of Pacific University publications donated by the Teeters were added to existing runs of the same publications in the Archives. Additional books from the Teeter Family were donated to the Pacific University Library for its general circulating collection.</p>

<p>This small collection of material was formerly deposited in a time capsule within Scott Hall on the Pacific University Campus. The time capsule was sealed during the dedication of Scott Hall, which was at the time called the Harvey Scott Library, in 1967. Contents include a sealed 1967 Pacific University catalog; a Spring 1967 issue of the Pacific Review; a Pacific University faculty handbook; a copy of the final construction bill for Scott Hall; notes and minutes from student government meetings; a list of recent additions to the library collection; and a Coors Beer label signed by three members of the Pacific University student government. The beer label was surreptitiously placed the label within the time capsule, according to the alumni's reports. The capsule was opened on the 50th anniversary year of Scott Hall's dedication in 2017. The metal capsule that originally housed the collection was returned for use as a new time capsule in Scott Hall's walls.</p>

<p>This collection contains handwritten serial publications created by the students of Pacific University and Tualatin Academy. It is not clear how (or how much) they circulated. They look like a printed format of a publication. Most of the articles have to do with do with morals and values, such as happiness and temperance, as well as subjects of general interest to the student writers. Some examples of these interests include astrology, arts, education, and current events. A few of the editorials touch on student life at Pacific University and Tualatin Academy, but are very spare in detail.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The four family photograph albums contain approximately 200 photographs, most dating from around 1880 to 1900. Nearly all of the photographs are portraits, probably of the McDonald Family and their friends. Many are baby pictures and wedding pictures. The majority are are albumen prints in cabinet card format, with some carte-de-visite and tintypes of various sizes also present. The two larger albums are bound strikingly, one in bright blue velvet with embroidered flowers, and the other in blindstamped sheepskin.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs in the first album were produced in studios located in Salem, Oregon. One photograph in this album has a note attached to it that reads: "To Mrs. McDonald, Sincerely, Hattie." The woman in this photograph may have been a domestic servant with the McDonald family. She appears to have possibly been a woman of color. Other photographs in the album are from studios in Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, California; Saint Louis, Missouri; and other locations.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs in the second album were produced in London, Ontario. A few of the photographs are from studios located in Michigan. These pictures probably depict Catherine's friends and family. Like the other album, most of the pictures are single or group portraits, baby pictures or wedding pictures. There are two carte-de-visite format photographs of baseball players in uniforms, possibly dating from about 1895, with the letter "T" on their shirts. They were probably members of the London Tecumsehs, a professional baseball team active at that time. One loose piece of cardboard used as backing within the album preserves a handwritten address to "Miss Katie McIntosh"; another item is labelled, "Mrs. McIntosh... London, Ontario." A funeral card for an Ann McIntosh who died in 1897 (probably Catherine's mother), is laid in, along with a few other loose items.</p>
<p>The third photograph album is smaller, with one carte-de-visite inserted per page. At least two photographs in this album have the note written on the verso, "Mrs. M. McDonald, Salem, Ore." Several of them were produced in studios in Scotland, and may picture distant Scottish relatives of the McDonalds. There is also one carte-de-visite depicting two Native Americans from Minnedosa, Manitoba.</p>
<p>The fourth photograph album is also smaller, with one carte-de-visite inserted per page. The Pacific University Archives believes that it is associated with the McDonald Family, although it was previously shelved in a separate area and has no handwritten notes identifying it as a McDonald album. Several of the photographs picture the same people who appear in the other albums, and some were taken in studios in Ontario and Scotland. The pictures probably depict Catherine's friends and family. The archives had previously identified this album as being of the "Rogers Family?" but there is no other information about why this assignment had been made.</p>

<p>The record book includes a constitution, meeting minutes and membership lists from 1892-1900. It provides details on the YWCA's activities at Pacific University, such as prayer meetings, bible study, charity work, studies of missionary work, and participation in regional YWCA activities. Several blank Pacific University student registration cards, an instruction sheet entitled "The Bean" (apparently a work-sheet from a botany class), and some notes about YWCA committees are also laid in.</p>

<p>The bulk of the collection is made up of photographs, diaries, and travel documents relating to the Jeffersons' travels across the Western United States, the Middle East and Europe in the early twentieth century. Many of the photographs illustrate their interest in driving automobiles to exotic and scenic locations. There are many images of roads, unusual vehicles and tourist locations. Early images of tourist routes through Yosemite National Park, Mount Rainer National Park, and the Columbia River Highway depict the roads and natural scenery of these areas. The group of photographs from the Jeffersons' trip to the Middle East and Europe (1909-1910) includes many pictures of tourist sites, but also many pictures of street scenes. They took numerous photographs of people doing manual labor. There are pictures of African American dock workers moving freight, women washing clothes, shoe shiners, peddlars and two pictures of child laborers in Italy, among others. In addition to the photographs, other notable items in the collection include a two-volume diary of the Middle East/Europe trip; a visa issued for travel in Turkey; and a group of unidentified family photographs.</p>
<p>Provenance information for the collection: The donor of this collection to the Pacific University Archives, Glen Griffitts, worked as a police detective in Portland, Oregon. A colleague of his, Detective Patrick McGuire, found these items abandoned in a house in Northeast Portland in the mid-1970s. Glen Griffitts determined that they were once the property of Dr. G. Orlo Jefferson and his wife, Matilda. The Jeffersons donated a large sum of money to Pacific University around 1945 and had no children. Glen Griffitts believes, based on probate records, that the Jeffersons bequeathed this collection to one of their household staff, and that it was subsequently abandoned. Additional information about the provenance is available in the research notes section of this collection. </p>
