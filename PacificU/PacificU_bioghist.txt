<p>Pacific University is located in Forest Grove, Oregon. It formerly had an associated high school, Tualatin Academy, which was active from 1849-1914. Between at least the late 1800s and the early 1900s, records of students' registrations and grades were compiled in handwritten log books. Information from these log books was probably the source of the rolls of students which were printed in the annual university Catalogues.</p>

<p>Malcolm and Catherine McIntosh were a prominent family of Salem, Oregon, who later founded the Orenco neighborhood of Hillsboro.</p>
<p>Malcolm was the president of the Capital City Nursery Company, which produced fruit, nut and shade trees, berry plants, and other nursery stock for shipping throughout the United States and Canada. In 1896, the company expanded its operations into rural Washington County east of the town of Hillsboro, renaming themselves the "Oregon Nursery Company." This location later became their headquarters, and the company name became the name of the local community, which is now known as Orenco. Malcolm McDonald was Orenco's first mayor. Orenco later merged into the town of Hillsboro.</p>
<p>Catherine and Malcolm were both of Scottish descent. Catherine was born to James and Annie McIntosh of London, Ontario, around 1862. Malcolm's parents were Duncan McDonald and Agnes McIntyre, probably also of Ontario, though this is not confirmed. Malcolm was already living in Salem, Oregon, when he married Catherine in London, Ontario, on 22 May 1897. Their 1912 Arts-and-Crafts home still stands in the Orenco neighborhood at 22180 NW Birch Street, Hillsboro.</p>

<p>Dr. G. Orlo Jefferson (1860-1949) was an optometrist in Portland Oregon, and also a trustee of Pacific University. He and his wife, Matilda J. Calhouns Jefferson (1859-1933) traveled extensively in the Western United States, the Middle East and Europe during the early twentieth century. They appear have to have enjoyed automobile travel, going on lengthy car trips in remote areas.</p>
<p>From 1909-1910, the Jefferson went on a lengthy trip to the Middle East and Europe, travelling by train, ship, carriage, donkey and their own personal car.</p>
<p>They began the trip by train, leaving Portland on September 29 for New Orleans via Juarez, Mexico. They took a boat from there up the Mississippi, eventually arriving in New York. There, the Jeffersons bought a 1910 Cadillac Model 33 and had it shipped ahead to Italy, where they would pick it up later. They left the United States from New York on the "Cedric" on January 5, 1910. Their ship stopped briefly in the Azores, Madeira and Gibraltar. After pausing at several cities in Italy, they moved on to Egypt, where they spent about a month sightseeing. From there, they went to Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, and then stopped briefly at Beirut and Damascus before reaching Constantinople in Turkey. From there, they travelled on to Greece and then back to Italy, where the Jeffersons picked up their automobile from customs in order to drive for the remainder of their trip. They drove to various cities in Italy, and then went through Austria to Germany, followed by the Netherlands and France. After shipping the car across the Channel, they then travelled through England, Wales and Scotland, and after another ferry ride, through Ireland. They logged 1,246 miles in the British Isles alone. They sailed back to New York City on October 15, 1910, more than a year after beginning their journey.</p>
<p>The Jeffersons also saved early images of tourist routes through scenic areas of the Western United States, including roads in the Mount Rainier National Park (late 1910s or early 1920s), the Columbia River Highway (circa 1920), and Tioga Pass near Yosemite National Park (1923).</p>
<p>The Jeffersons appear to have had no close living relatives when they passed away. The bulk of their estate was bequeathed to Pacific University and funded a building for the new School of Optometry, which had just opened in 1948. The building is named Jefferson Hall in their honor.</p>

<p>Thomas McClelland was Pacific University's fourth president, serving from 1892-1900. Born in 1849 in County Derry, Ireland, he immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of three. He earned an A.B. at Oberlin College in Ohio in 1875, and then attended Union Theological Seminary in New York and Andover Theological Seminary in Massachussetts. He then taught philosophy for 11 years at Tabor College in Iowa.</p>
<p>When McClelland became Pacific University's president in 1892, he stepped into a tense political atmosphere. The previous president, Jacob Ellis, had resigned over the issue of sectarian control of the university. Ellis, along with one half of the Board of Trustees, favored bringing Pacific under the formal control of the Congregationalist denomination. The other half of the Board of Trustees wanted Pacific to remain non-denominational. McClelland's task was to heal the fractures between the two parties. He fashioned a compromise, amending the charter to give a two-thirds majority of the Board to the Congregationalists, without putting the school under the denomination's direct control. This solution allowed Pacific to retain a special relationship with the Congregationalist Church, while staying a non-sectarian school.</p>
<p>Student life at Pacific evolved considerably during McClelland's presidency. The football team played its first game in 1893. Men's baseball, basketball and track also began early in the decade; women's basketball and track began in 1899. Extracurricular clubs centered on debate, music, drama, archery and the YMCA/YWCA flourished.
<title render="italic">The Index</title>, the student newspaper, was established in 1893r;
<title render="italic">The Heart of Oak</title>, the student yearbook, was first issued a year later. McClelland raised funds to construct Marsh Memorial Hall, which became the center of campus administration. He also helped to recruit two influential faculty members, Henry Liberty Bates and Mary Frances Farnham, and oversaw Pacific's 50th anniversary celebrations. Student enrollment in the university doubled during his term.</p>
<p>The constant need to raise money for the university took its toll on McClelland however. He often travelled for months at a time to locations across the United States, looking for sources of funding. When he resigned in 1900, he explained, "I had begun to feel the strain of the constant canvass for money at such a great distance from home and I was keenly sensible to the dact that under the circumstances I could not do for the institution all that, in my judgment, a president should do for a college," (Letter to Myron Eells, 10 Jan 1901). On leaving Pacific, he took a new position as the president of Knox College in Illinois, where he remained for 17 years. He continued to advocate for Pacific University even after leaving. As a member of the board of directors of the Carnegie Foundation, he very likely had a hand in securing its funds for a new dormitory and a library at Pacific University, which were built in 1907 and 1912.</p>

<p>Various departments and individuals at Pacific University have collected newspaper clippings about the school since the 19th century. By the 1920s, clippings were being systematically collected and compiled into scrapbooks. Most of the scrapbooks were probably compiled by the Publicity Department or related departments of the University. By the 1940s, the University was subscribing to a clippings service, which supplied clippings about the University, accompanied by tickets stamped with the date and title of the newspaper where the articles appeared. These clippings were normally compiled into scrapbooks, but were sometimes left loose. This process of acquiring clippings from a commercial service and then creating scrapbooks appears to have continued from the 1940s through the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, the Publicity Office began saving its press releases, and filing them with clippings of any articles that were published based upon them. They appear to have discontinued making scrapbooks at that time.</p>
<p>In addition to the scrapbooks and press release files, various individuals associated with Pacific University independently collected loose clippings. Several people who may have been involved in saving clippings include Irene Story and Rick Read, who were involved with the Old College Hall Museum. Female students in the Herrick Hall dormitory may also have collected some of the earliest clippings records, though the records are unclear.</p>
