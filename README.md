# EAD-corpus
A collection of encoded archival description XML documents for text and content analysis.

These materials were collected between January and April of 2024 to form an unannotated text corpus for content analysis. Text was identified and extracted using the `eadretrieve` wrapper script invoking [xmllint](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libxml2/xmllint.html) and compiled with Unix text processing utilities.

Elements selected for the project include `abstract`, `scopecontent`, `bioghist`, `custodhist`, and `head`. Content was evaluated using the [style](https://www.gnu.org/software/diction/) command, and results listed in the `readability-data` table.
