      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p> In 1876 Walker Brothers, a Salt Lake City, Utah, mining and banking firm, hired Marcus
        Daly to investigate silver mining properties in Butte, Montana. The Walkers and Daly
        purchased the Alice Mine and incorporated as the Alice Gold and Silver Mining Company. Daly
        served as general superintendent until he sold his interest in the company in 1880.</p>
      <p> That same year he bought the Anaconda Mine, located by Michael Hickey in October 1875.
        Hickey, unable to keep up annual assessment work on the mine, had sold half interest in it
        to Charles Larabie, a banker. Larabie brought in Daly as a third partner to sink a shaft.
        Daly got an option from his partners to purchase the property for $30,000 and tried to
        interest the Walker Brothers in investing in it. When they declined, Daly went to San
        Francisco and secured the backing of James Haggin, George H. Hearst, and Lloyd Tevis. The
        four men operated the mine under a partnership arrangement as a silver property. The small
        quantities of copper which the mine produced were shipped to Swansea, Wales, for processing.
        In late 1882 a rich copper vein was struck.</p>
      <p> As copper became the main product of the mine, Daly decided to build his own smelter
        instead of continuing the expensive procedure of shipping ore to Wales. He located a
        suitable site on Warm Springs Greek, twenty six miles west of Butte. He officially platted
        the new town of Anaconda on October 27, 1883, and began the construction of what became
        known as the Upper Works. Transportation of the Butte ores to the new smelter was provided
        by the narrow-gauge Montana Railway. This railroad, under the name Montana Union Railway,
        was later operated jointly by the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific companies. The original
        500-ton capacity mill, completed in 1884, quickly became inadequate and, within two years,
        was expanded to 1000 tons. During the early years, only the initial stages of treatment were
        done at the Anaconda Reduction Works, with the concentrated ore still being shipped to Wales
        for refining. To eliminate this necessity, Daly built an experimental electrolytic refinery,
        completed in 1888. He also built a second reduction plant, known as the Lower Works, a mile
        east of the Upper Works. Fire destroyed this plant shortly after its completion. Daly
        quickly rebuilt on an even larger scale.</p>
      <p> While Daly was developing the Anaconda Reduction Works, he was also expanding the basis of
        his mining operations. Until 1891 the Haggin-Hearst-Tegin-Daly syndicate had operated its
        Montana properties as a partnership under the name Anaconda Gold and Silver Mining Company.
        In January 1891 when it incorporated as the Anaconda Mining Company, the company owned four
        groups of mines: the Anaconda Group, the Mountain Consolidated Group, the Union Consolidated
        Group, and the Anglo-Saxon Group. Daly, Hearst, and Tegin owned only the minimum shares
        required by law. Haggin held the remainder in trust. The Anaconda Mining Company reinvested
        all profits in building its facilities instead of giving dividends.</p>
      <p> From 1891 to 1895 the Anaconda Mining Company began the process of consolidating its
        control over its services and sources of raw materials. Angered by the Montana Union
        Railway's high charges and inefficient service, Daly built his own railroad, the Butte,
        Anaconda, and Pacific, to connect the smelter with the mines. The Big Blackfoot Milling
        Company and the Bitter Root Development Company were created as allied companies to provide
        Anaconda with needed timber. The Castner Coal and Coke Company, with Daly as a minor
        stockholder, provided the company with coal. The Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company was
        formed to meet the smelter's foundry and hardware needs. When a larger smelter was needed to
        meet increased treatment requirements at Anaconda, the Washoe Copper Company was created to
        build the New Reduction Works, which was then operated by Anaconda under a lease
        arrangement. </p>
      <p> In 1895 the company was again reorganized, this time as the Anaconda Copper Mining
        Company, with a capitalization of $30,000,000. Haggin's trust-held properties were
        transferred to the new company and, over the next year, several of the allied companies were
        brought in as subsidiaries. </p>
      <p> In 1899 H.H. Rogers and A.C. Burrage, officers of the Standard Oil Company and
        stockholders in the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, urged the union of all Butte mining
        operations under one holding company. In April 1899 the Amalgamated Copper Company was
        formed to acquire the stock of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and its subsidiary
        companies including the Big Blackfoot Milling Company, the Bitter Root Development Company,
        the Diamond Coal and Coke Company, the Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company, and the
        Washoe Copper Company. In addition, the Amalgamated acquired several other previously
        unallied Butte mining companies including the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and
        Silver Mining Company and the Parrot Silver and Copper Company. The Amalgamated Copper
        Company was simply a holding company and was not involved in management of the various
        companies, which continued to operate independently. The most important of the companies
        brought under the Amalgamated umbrella was the Boston and Montana. It owned several
        important mining claims in Butte (including the Mountain View and East Colusa) and a smelter
        in Great Falls. This smelter, built in 1892, duplicated many of the facilities in Anaconda,
        handling all levels of ore processing from concentration to refining. </p>
      <p> In 1910 the Anaconda Copper Mining Company took over most of the other companies in the
        Amalgamated Copper Company, all Amalgamated subsidiaries becoming departments within
        Anaconda. One of the most important results of this reorganization was that it allowed the
        two major reduction works at Anaconda and Great Falls to coordinate their operations.
        Anaconda continued to handle the early stages of concentrating and smelting, while Great
        Falls gradually phased out these operations and specialized in refining. All stages prior to
        refining were finally eliminated from Great Falls in 1919. At the same time, Great Falls
        increased its refining capacity by the addition of an electrolytic zinc plant. In 1915 the
        Amalgamated Copper Company ended its corporate existence.</p>
      <p> During the period that Anaconda Copper Mining Company was consolidating its Montana
        operations, it was also expanding towards its goal of controlling copper "from mine to
        consumer." In 1913 the company acquired the International Smelting and Refining Company,
        which owned smelters at Tooele, Utah, and Miami, Arizona, as well as the Raritan Copper
        Works in New Jersey. In 1922 Anaconda bought the American Brass Company in Waterbury,
        Connecticut, one of the major producers of finished copper products. Also in the early
        192Os, Anaconda invested in Chile, acquiring the Chuquicamata copper mine from the
        Guggenheim family, as well as the smaller, but important, Potrerillos mine. It acquired from
        the heirs of Georg von Giesche a large zinc treatment plant at Katowice, Poland. In 1928
        W.A. Clark's heirs sold his Montana companies to Anaconda. In 1955, in recognition of the
        wide range of corporate operations, the company name was changed to The Anaconda Company. </p>
      <p> The company prospered during World War II and the years following. Several ambitious
        projects, including the Greater Butte Project to expand underground operations and the
        Berkeley Pit to commence surface mining, were undertaken. In 1971, however, Chile
        nationalized the Chuquicamata and other American-owned mines. This, along with low copper
        prices brought about a financial crisis. Forced to meet financial deadlines in New York, the
        company sold its entire lumber operation, including thousands of square miles of Montana
        timber land and the Bonner mill, to Champion International. This liquidation, however, did
        not solve the company's financial problems, and in 1979 the company was purchased by the
        Atlantic-Richfield Company (ARCO). Over the next few years, ARCO shut down its entire
        Montana operation, including the Berkeley Pit in Butte, the Anaconda Smelter, and the Great
        Falls Refinery. </p>

      <p> The Anaconda Copper Mining Company Records consist of correspondence, court papers,
        financial and production records, legal documents, organizational records, subject files,
        and other materials for the company and many of its predecessor and subsidiary companies and
        departments. Among the major subgroups into which the collection is arranged are the General
        Office, the Big Blackfoot Milling Company, the Bitter Root Development Company, the Boston
        and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company, the Butte and Boston Consolidated
        Mining Company, the Colorado Smelting and Mining Company, the Diamond Coal and Coke Company,
        the Parrot Silver and Copper Company, the Reduction Department (Anaconda), the Trenton
        Mining and Development Company, the Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company, and the Washoe
        Copper Company. In addition, there are more than one hundred smaller subgroups (see Table of
        Contents). Unconnected with the primary mining, smelting and timber operations of the
        Company were several affiliated companies in the hotel and related fields; oil and gas
        development; water and townsite companies; and newspaper publishing. Subgroups for these
        include the Silver Bow Club, the Florence Hotel and the Montana Hotel; the West Dome Oil
        Company; the Anaconda Townsite Company and the Hamilton Water Company; and the Post
        Publishing Company and the Montana Free Press.</p>
      <p> Among the more significant operations documented in this collection are the General
        Office, both in Butte and in Anaconda; the various subsidiary operations, both before and
        after their absorption into Anaconda; and the two large treatment plants, the Anaconda
        Smelter and the Great Falls Refinery. Among the subjects documented are the technical and
        economic details of the two smelters; the company's large lumber operations in the Missoula
        area; the company's coal mines; relations with employees; and treatment and recovery of
        tailings, including the related issue of air and water pollution. There is less
        documentation for the core mining operations in Butte. </p>
