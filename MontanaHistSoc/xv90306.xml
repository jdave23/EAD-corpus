			<p> Representative John N. Rodgers introduced HB Memorial 7 in December 1866 that sought
				federal funds for a territorial penitentiary in Montana. In January 1867 funding was
				approved and the penitentiary opened in Deer Lodge in July 1871. It was relinquished
				to Montana Territory in 1873, and taken over by the federal government once again in
				1874. The penitentiary became a state institution in 1889, when Montana achieved
				statehood. </p>
			<p>The state contracted with former prison guard Frank Conley and Colonel Thomas McTague
				to operate the penitentiary from 1890 to 1908, with Conley as warden. In 1909 the
				state hired Conley as warden, a position he held until 1921. Conley instituted an
				extensive trusty program in which many prisoners worked outside the prison walls.
				Prison work crews built roads in western Montana and constructed buildings at the
				Montana State Hospital for the Insane and the Montana State Tuberculosis Sanitarium,
				as well as making many improvements to the prison itself. In 1921 Governor Joseph
				Dixon initiated an investigation of Conley's alleged use of state monies for
				personal gain; this investigation led to Conley's dismissal. </p>
			<p>Conditions at the prison deteriorated in the decades that followed Conley's
				dismissal. The trusty program was largely abandoned due to the depressed economy and
				the concomitant protest by free labor against prisoners working outside the prison.
				Additionally, few industries had been developed within the prison, leaving many
				inmates idle. Overcrowding and the decay of the physical plant contributed to poor
				living conditions at the prison. </p>
			<p>In 1957 an investigation of prison conditions conducted by Kenyon J. Scudder reported
				appalling and potentially explosive conditions at the prison. Later that year a
				"disturbance" did occur during which hostages were taken. A large scale riot
				occurred in 1959. The prison was made part of the Department of Institutions in
				1963. A new prison was constructed in 1979 outside of Deer Lodge. </p>
			<p>The Board of Territorial Prison Commissioners (later the Board of Prison
				Commissioners) was established in 1867, consisting of three elected members holding
				office for two years. The commissioners had "full and exclusive control over all the
				territorial prison grounds, buildings, prisoners, prison labor, prison property and
				all other things belonging or pertaining to said prison," and established "rules,
				regulations and by-laws" to govern the prison. The commissioners met every three
				months. An 1893 law removed prisoners from the commissioners' control, empowered the
				Board to appoint the warden, and established the Board as consisting of the
				governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general, with two members
				constituting a quorum. In 1907 the Board was given the power to approve or
				disapprove parole for prisoners recommended by the governor. In 1913 the governor
				was given the power to appoint the warden, and the Board was given jurisdiction over
				persons receiving suspended sentences. In 1955 the Board's jurisdiction over paroles
				and suspended sentences was delegated to the State Board of Pardons. Legislation
				establishing the Board of State Prison Commissioners was not included in the 1972
				constitution; the Board was formally abolished in 1974. </p>
			<p>The State Board of Pardons was established in 1891, consisting of the secretary of
				state, the attorney general, and the state auditor. The Board was required to
				convene if the governor granted a pardon, remitted a fine or forfeiture, or commuted
				a punishment. The Board would then cause a notice of a hearing concerning the case
				to be published in a newspaper in the county in which the crime was committed and
				notify the concerned county attorney, district judge, and sheriff. Subsequent to the
				hearing the Board would file its decision with the secretary of state. In 1955 the
				Board membership was changed to three members appointed by the governor to terms of
				six years. The appointees were given the responsibility of administering the
				executive clemency, probation, and parole system. The Board was made part of the
				Department of Institutions in 1971. </p>

			<p>This collection is divided into four subgroups: Montana State Prison Records
				(1881-1974); Board of State Prison Commissioners Records (1890-1962); State Board of
				Pardons Records (1890-1965); and the United States Penitentiary, Montana Territory
				Records (1864-1878). </p>
			<p>The records of the Montana State Prison are divided into five series. The general
				correspondence (1891-1916) contains letters between Frank Conley and Thomas McTague
				and the governor, the clerk of the Board of Examiners, and two suppliers to the
				prison. The outgoing correspondence (1909-1921) of Conley and McTague pertains to
				inmates (paroles, pardons, behavior, time served, restoration to citizenship,
				escapes, work camps, sale of goods produced by prisoners, etc.), supplies, prison
				employment, penology, personal business of Conley and McTague, etc. The financial
				records (1893-1963) include cash books, general ledgers, journals, prisoner accounts
				with Deer Lodge and prison stores, voucher registers, etc. The bulk of the prisoner
				records (1881-1974) consists of prison description sheets which include each
				prisoners' vital statistics, and information about the crime committed, the sentence
				received, and a list of past crimes. The prisoner records also include lists of a
				conduct record; criminal charges against former Montana State Prison inmates; lists
				of prisoners received and discharged; a medical treatment record; lists of prisoners
				who were pardoned, paroled, and received suspended sentences, diminished sentences,
				and restoration of citizenship; and prison population statements. </p>
			<p>The records of the State Board of Pardons include minutes (1880-1926), prisoner
				records (1892-1922), and miscellany (1963, 1965). The minutes are primarily
				approvals of paroles. The prisoner records are correspondence and documents relating
				to specific prisoners' pardons. </p>
			<p>The records of the Board of State Prison Commissioners are divided into seven series.
				The general correspondence (1905-1929) consists of correspondence of the clerk of
				the Board. The hearings series (1957) consists of a transcript of a hearing
				concerning an investigation of conditions at the prison. The legal documents (1907,
				1927) consist of an agreement for the purchase of cement and an easement granted to
				a railroad. The minutes (1890-1962) primarily concern the approval of paroles, the
				discharge of prisoners, the termination of sentences, return of prisoners for
				violation of parole, transfer of prisoners to the State Hospital for the Insane,
				etc. For some years (1910-1927,1949-1954) there is a separate run of minutes that
				deals exclusively with paroles. There is some discussion of procedures,
				investigations, etc. The prisoner records (1913-1955) consist of suspended sentence
				orders. The reports series (1960) consists of a report by the Prison Advisory Board
				concerning prison industries. The miscellany series (1959, undated) includes blank
				forms, procedural guidelines, and interviews with prisoners relating to the approval
				of "good time".</p>
			<p>The records of the United States Penitentiary, Montana Territory, are divided into
				six series. The general correspondence series (1875) consists of correspondence sent
				by W. F. Wheeler concerning housing prisoners. The incoming correspondence series
				(1874-1876) consists of correspondence received by W. F. Wheeler concerning housing
				prisoners and leasing space in court rooms. The financial records series (1886-1889)
				consists of an expense journal kept R. S. Kelley. The legal documents series
				consists of leases, memoranda of agreement and miscellany concerning housing
				prisoners, operating the prison and construction of the prison. The reports series
				(1873, 1878, undated) consists of reports of the Directors, the Physician, the
				Warden, and the U.S. Grand Jury. The miscellany series (1868-1878) consists of
				documents regarding the construction of the prison, inventories and rules and
				regulations. Restriction: Prisoner description sheets are restricted from public use
				due to their fragility. An archivist can search these sheets and provide the
				researcher with a receival date at the prison. This date will allow the researcher
				to find the prisoner description sheet on State Microfilm 36, where the description
				sheets are arranged by date received at the prison. Researchers are advised to
				provide the archivist with all possible variations of the prisoner's name.</p>
