The Montana Student Nurses' Association (MSNA) is a statewide voluntary membership organization composed of students enrolled in nursing education programs, leading to licensing as registered nurses, as well as already registered nurses continuing their education toward a baccalaureate degree. Prior to 1947 student nurses attended annual conventions of the Montana Nurses Association (MNA). In 1947 they formed their own organization, an affiliate of the National Student Nurses Association (NSNA). During the first years students developed bylaws and a structure for the operation of the organization and held two statewide meetings a year, one of which was held in conjunction with MNA. Since the 1950's a "Student Nurse of the Year" award is given annually by MNA which recognizes a student for outstanding nursing qualities, leadership ability, scholastic achievement and contributions to MSNA. By 1952 all schools of nursing in the state were represented in MSNA with a membership close to 100. Membership increased to 244 by 1960. They published a newsletter, "White Caps" highlighting activities of students in the several schools In 1998 the name of the newsletter was changed to "Heart Beats" which had previously been the name of the MSU, Billings chapter newsletter. Several nursing students attended NSNA conventions during the 1950s but participation dropped during the 1960's and 1970's as hospital schools of nursing closed.

At both the national and state levels, students now plan programs and activities focusing on issues that affect them as students and future members of the nursing profession. Several MSNA members have served as officers of the national organization, including Wendy Blakley elected secretary in 1974; Lynne Riley elected to the Board of Directors; and Julie McGee, elected president 1992.

In June 1906, the syndicate incorporated as the Basin Mining Company. Directors of the new company were Paul A. Fusz, Auguste B. Ewing, Mark Ewing, L.M. Rumsey Jr., and Joseph P. Hartnett. The company's mines were never large producers. Little work appears to have been done after 1909, although small amounts of bullion continued to be sent to the Denver Mint until 1925. By 1922 most of the stock was held by heirs of the original owners. The company dissolved in 1926 when its twenty year term of existence expired.
Lee Metcalf was born in 1911 in Stevensville, Montana. He attended Montana State University for one year and transferred to Stanford University where he majored in history and economics. He graduated from Montana State University law school in 1936 and entered private practice. He was elected representative to the 25th Montana Legislative Assembly from Ravalli County in the same year. In 1937 Metcalf resigned from the legislature to accept appointment as a Montana assistant attorney general.
During his tenure as an assistant attorney general, Metcalf campaigned extensively for Attorney General Harrison Freebourn who was seeking election to the U.S. Senate in the 1940 primary. During this period Metcalf also represented the Montana State Congress of Industrial Organizations Council from 1938 until 1941. In 1941, following Freebourn's defeat in the primary, Metcalf returned to private practice in Hamilton. Metcalf enlisted in the army in 1942 and was later commissioned. Following the war he served as a military government officer in Germany where he helped set up the civilian court and occupation police system. He also supervised repatriation and drafted the ordinances for and supervised local elections.
Metcalf was elected associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in 1946, where he served until he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1952, succeeding Mike Mansfield in Montana's First (Western) Congressional District. After serving four terms in the House, Metcalf was elected to the Senate in 1960, succeeding James E. Murray.
Although Metcalf is best known for his work to protect the natural environment and regulate utilities, he composed and supported a wide variety of legislation. His prodigious legislative accomplishments are testimony to his parliamentary acumen.
Lee Metcalf worked throughout his career to protect the nation's natural resources from both wanton exploitation and destruction. He was an early proponent of water and air pollution control; research on the harmful effects of pesticides, strip mining, and highway construction; regulation of timber cutting and grazing; alternative energy development; and many other conservation issues. His efforts to preserve the nation's wild lands and rivers were productive and lauded by national conservation organizations. As a long-time member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Metcalf helped establish many wildlife refuges.
While Lee Metcalf was an ardent protector of the natural environment, he believed in the responsible development of resources. He supported rural cooperative efforts, public power projects, and diverse types of assistance to independent workers in agriculture and minerals.
Metcalf advocated the use of government resources to redress the injustices of an imperfect society and to broaden and strengthen access to information for all individuals. He proposed and worked for legislation concerning Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and veterans' benefits; aid to libraries, schools and small businesses; minimum wage laws; work safety laws; job training programs; consumer protection; and the return of control over their own lives to Native Americans.
Metcalf's long, adversarial relationship with the Montana Power Company and other utilities stemmed from his belief that the power industry held a monopolistic, unregulated control of an essential product. Lee Metcalf's and Vic Reinemer's book Overcharge delineates their position that the utilities exert tremendous influence throughout American society, yet are not subject to the democratic election process and are controlled by a small group of profiteers.
Closely related to Metcalf's efforts to regulate utility companies was his opposition to the growth of "corporate statism." Especially in his capacity as chairman of the Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditure (later Reports, Accounting, and Management), and in close association with Vic Reinemer, Metcalf worked for disclosure of meaningful information, such as interlocking directorships, regarding corporate activity in regulated industries.
Congressional colleagues respected Lee Metcalf's thorough knowledge of the workings of government, knowledge which he used astutely throughout his career. In 1959 Metcalf helped establish the Democratic Study Group, an organization which instructed, mobilized, and coordinated liberal Democrats. As a member of the Government Operations Committee, Metcalf worked for many years, especially after Watergate activities spotlighted such concerns, to reorganize government to improve its efficiency and honesty.
Lee Metcalf enjoyed the cooperation of an able staff. He also provided experience to as many interns, the majority of whom were Montanans, as his time and office space would allow.
Vic Reinemer joined Metcalf's staff in 1961 and worked closely with him until Metcalf's death. Reinemer was born in Circle, Montana, in 1923, and graduated from Montana State University with a B.A. in journalism in 1948. He worked as a newspaper editor in Washington, D.C., for Freedom amp; Union Magazine in 1950 and 1951, and in North Carolina for the Charlotte News from 1950 until 1955. From 1955 until 1960 Reinemer worked as executive secretary for Senator Murray and then served until 1973 in the same position for Senator Metcalf. From 1973 until Metcalf's death in 1978, Reinemer was staff director of the Senate Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting, Management, and Expenditures, which changed its name in 1975 to Reports, Accounting, and Management. Reinemer concentrated his energies on utility regulation and corporate ownership reporting.
Other long-time influential staff members include Merrill "Brit" Englund, Metcalf's administrative assistant, who worked for United Press Internatinnal and the Associated Press in Helena for six years before joining Metcalf's staff in 1953; Peggy McLaughlin, personal secretary, who worked for the Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Montana Attorney General, and for Senator Murray before beginning her years with Metcalf; and Dorothy Tannenbaum, legislative assistant with special knowledge of education and Native American affairs. Ted Roe replaced Vic Reinemer as executive secretary in 1973. These staff members' contribution to Metcalf's work can most easily be noted by the many letters in the collection which they composed.
Lee Metcalf married Donna Hoover in 1938. He died in January 1978 during what he declared would be his last Senate term.
Thomas O. Larson was born in Norway on November 27, 1874, the second of nine children of Ole and Annie Larson. The family moved to the United States in 1880 and settled on a farm in Benton County, Minnesota. In the summer of 1895 Thomas opened a small store at Burton in Teton County, Montana. The following two years he operated a stage line between Collins and Choteau. He then went into ranching, raising cattle, horses, sheep, and wheat on a desert land claim half way between Choteau and Bynum. He was involved in the Teton Co-operative Reservoir Company, the Brady Townsite Company, and the Brady Irrigation Company. He served two terms as president of the Montana Wool Growers Association, and one term as president of the Montana Livestock Production Credit Association. Larson was also active in Republican politics. He served as assessor of Teton County from 1900 to 1904, was in the state Senate from 1911 to 1921 and from 1927 to 1937, and ran for the U.S. Senate in 1936. While in the Legislature, Larson sponsored the bill splitting Teton County into three counties; introduced the first Blue Sky Law, regulating the sale of stocks; and helped establish the 19th Judicial District. Larson was active in several fraternal orders, including the Masons, the Knights Templar, the Helena Consistory of the Scottish Rite, the Algeria Shrine Temple, the Red Cross of Constantine, and the Royal Order of Jesters. Larson married Helen Stowe in 1902. They had two daughters Alva Gertrude and Harriet Helen. Alva married Wilfred Armstrong, who succeeded Larson in managing the ranch; Harriett married the noted Choteau author A.B. Guthrie Jr. Thomas O. Larson died March 18, 1958.
In 1876 Walker Brothers, a Salt Lake City, Utah, mining and banking firm, hired Marcus Daly to investigate silver mining properties in Butte, Montana. The Walkers and Daly purchased the Alice Mine and incorporated as the Alice Gold and Silver Mining Company. Daly served as general superintendent until he sold his interest in the company in 1880.
That same year he bought the Anaconda Mine, located by Michael Hickey in October 1875. Hickey, unable to keep up annual assessment work on the mine, had sold half interest in it to Charles Larabie, a banker. Larabie brought in Daly as a third partner to sink a shaft. Daly got an option from his partners to purchase the property for $30,000 and tried to interest the Walker Brothers in investing in it. When they declined, Daly went to San Francisco and secured the backing of James Haggin, George H. Hearst, and Lloyd Tevis. The four men operated the mine under a partnership arrangement as a silver property. The small quantities of copper which the mine produced were shipped to Swansea, Wales, for processing. In late 1882 a rich copper vein was struck.
As copper became the main product of the mine, Daly decided to build his own smelter instead of continuing the expensive procedure of shipping ore to Wales. He located a suitable site on Warm Springs Greek, twenty six miles west of Butte. He officially platted the new town of Anaconda on October 27, 1883, and began the construction of what became known as the Upper Works. Transportation of the Butte ores to the new smelter was provided by the narrow-gauge Montana Railway. This railroad, under the name Montana Union Railway, was later operated jointly by the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific companies. The original 500-ton capacity mill, completed in 1884, quickly became inadequate and, within two years, was expanded to 1000 tons. During the early years, only the initial stages of treatment were done at the Anaconda Reduction Works, with the concentrated ore still being shipped to Wales for refining. To eliminate this necessity, Daly built an experimental electrolytic refinery, completed in 1888. He also built a second reduction plant, known as the Lower Works, a mile east of the Upper Works. Fire destroyed this plant shortly after its completion. Daly quickly rebuilt on an even larger scale.
While Daly was developing the Anaconda Reduction Works, he was also expanding the basis of his mining operations. Until 1891 the Haggin-Hearst-Tegin-Daly syndicate had operated its Montana properties as a partnership under the name Anaconda Gold and Silver Mining Company. In January 1891 when it incorporated as the Anaconda Mining Company, the company owned four groups of mines: the Anaconda Group, the Mountain Consolidated Group, the Union Consolidated Group, and the Anglo-Saxon Group. Daly, Hearst, and Tegin owned only the minimum shares required by law. Haggin held the remainder in trust. The Anaconda Mining Company reinvested all profits in building its facilities instead of giving dividends.
From 1891 to 1895 the Anaconda Mining Company began the process of consolidating its control over its services and sources of raw materials. Angered by the Montana Union Railway's high charges and inefficient service, Daly built his own railroad, the Butte, Anaconda, and Pacific, to connect the smelter with the mines. The Big Blackfoot Milling Company and the Bitter Root Development Company were created as allied companies to provide Anaconda with needed timber. The Castner Coal and Coke Company, with Daly as a minor stockholder, provided the company with coal. The Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company was formed to meet the smelter's foundry and hardware needs. When a larger smelter was needed to meet increased treatment requirements at Anaconda, the Washoe Copper Company was created to build the New Reduction Works, which was then operated by Anaconda under a lease arrangement.
In 1895 the company was again reorganized, this time as the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, with a capitalization of $30,000,000. Haggin's trust-held properties were transferred to the new company and, over the next year, several of the allied companies were brought in as subsidiaries.
In 1899 H.H. Rogers and A.C. Burrage, officers of the Standard Oil Company and stockholders in the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, urged the union of all Butte mining operations under one holding company. In April 1899 the Amalgamated Copper Company was formed to acquire the stock of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and its subsidiary companies including the Big Blackfoot Milling Company, the Bitter Root Development Company, the Diamond Coal and Coke Company, the Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company, and the Washoe Copper Company. In addition, the Amalgamated acquired several other previously unallied Butte mining companies including the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company and the Parrot Silver and Copper Company. The Amalgamated Copper Company was simply a holding company and was not involved in management of the various companies, which continued to operate independently. The most important of the companies brought under the Amalgamated umbrella was the Boston and Montana. It owned several important mining claims in Butte (including the Mountain View and East Colusa) and a smelter in Great Falls. This smelter, built in 1892, duplicated many of the facilities in Anaconda, handling all levels of ore processing from concentration to refining.
In 1910 the Anaconda Copper Mining Company took over most of the other companies in the Amalgamated Copper Company, all Amalgamated subsidiaries becoming departments within Anaconda. One of the most important results of this reorganization was that it allowed the two major reduction works at Anaconda and Great Falls to coordinate their operations. Anaconda continued to handle the early stages of concentrating and smelting, while Great Falls gradually phased out these operations and specialized in refining. All stages prior to refining were finally eliminated from Great Falls in 1919. At the same time, Great Falls increased its refining capacity by the addition of an electrolytic zinc plant. In 1915 the Amalgamated Copper Company ended its corporate existence.
During the period that Anaconda Copper Mining Company was consolidating its Montana operations, it was also expanding towards its goal of controlling copper "from mine to consumer." In 1913 the company acquired the International Smelting and Refining Company, which owned smelters at Tooele, Utah, and Miami, Arizona, as well as the Raritan Copper Works in New Jersey. In 1922 Anaconda bought the American Brass Company in Waterbury, Connecticut, one of the major producers of finished copper products. Also in the early 192Os, Anaconda invested in Chile, acquiring the Chuquicamata copper mine from the Guggenheim family, as well as the smaller, but important, Potrerillos mine. It acquired from the heirs of Georg von Giesche a large zinc treatment plant at Katowice, Poland. In 1928 W.A. Clark's heirs sold his Montana companies to Anaconda. In 1955, in recognition of the wide range of corporate operations, the company name was changed to The Anaconda Company.
The company prospered during World War II and the years following. Several ambitious projects, including the Greater Butte Project to expand underground operations and the Berkeley Pit to commence surface mining, were undertaken. In 1971, however, Chile nationalized the Chuquicamata and other American-owned mines. This, along with low copper prices brought about a financial crisis. Forced to meet financial deadlines in New York, the company sold its entire lumber operation, including thousands of square miles of Montana timber land and the Bonner mill, to Champion International. This liquidation, however, did not solve the company's financial problems, and in 1979 the company was purchased by the Atlantic-Richfield Company (ARCO). Over the next few years, ARCO shut down its entire Montana operation, including the Berkeley Pit in Butte, the Anaconda Smelter, and the Great Falls Refinery.
Cornelius B. Nolan was born December 24, 1855, in County Limerick, Ireland. He was educated in Dublin. In the fall of 1873, at seventeen, Nolan immigrated to the United States. Nolan settled in Oswego, New York, where he worked as a day laborer with a railroad section crew, while pursuing his studies at Oswego Academy. In 1877, Nolan moved to Port Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and worked in a tannery for two years. A year later, he went to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit his brother, Thomas. He remained there five years studying law in Roger Foster's law office and at the St. Louis Law School. In 1884, he was admitted to the practice of law in the Missouri courts. After a brief period working as a stenographer for an agricultural house in Chicago, Nolan moved to Montana to become private secretary to the general manager of the freight and passenger service of the Northern Pacific Railroad. However, not long after his arrival in Montana, he resigned his railroad position to become official court reporter for the First Judicial District of Montana, which included Lewis and Clark, Jefferson, and Beaverhead counties. Reporting for Judges N.W. McConnell and Henry L. Blake, Nolan received training which was of great value in his subsequent career. Nolan was elected County Attorney of Lewis and Clark County in 1889. Chosen on the Democratic ticket, he held the position by re-election for five years. In 1896, he was elected Attorney General of Montana. During this four-year term, Nolan took charge of a special grand jury investigation of the alleged bribery of legislators. In 1910, Nolan was elected to the Montana House of Representatives and served one term. While County Attorney, Nolan began to build a private law practice that would eventually become an extensive civil and criminal practice. Initially he worked with John Bean and then, between 1901 and 1904, he was a partner with attorney Albert I. Loeb. In 1906, he formed a partnership with Senator Thomas J. Walsh, which expanded to include William Scallon. In addition to his law work, Nolan invested in mining and real estate, acquiring ranch properties in Broadwater, Park, and Wheatland counties. He was also an active participant in many organizations. He served, with the rank of colonel, on General Toole's staff in the state militia. He also belonged to several fraternal organizations, serving as Masonic Grand Master in 1909. In 1894, Nolan married Harriet Shober. Harriet, niece of Helena attorney John H. Shober, Sr., was a native of Dodge County, Minnesota. During the 1870s and 1880s, she had taught in the public schools of Adair County, Iowa. In 1887, she moved to Helena, Montana, to live with her uncle. After her marriage to Cornelius Nolan, she became active in Helena community projects, Democratic Party politics, and the work of the American Red Cross. Cornelius Nolan died in Butte on June 24, 1922, and his wife Harriet died seven years later, August 23, 1929, at Lake McDonald.
The Montana State Legislature is made up of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Montana limits the size of the Senate to no fewer than 40 and no more than 50 members and the size of the House of Representatives to no fewer than 80 and no more than 100 members. Each house is responsible for choosing its officers, creating committees and establishing its own rules. The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day. The first State Legislature convened on November 23, 1889, fifteen days after Montana became a state. Each following Legislature has been numbered sequentially.
The 34th Montana Legislature met from January 3rd to March 3rd, 1955. The leaders of the Senate were George Gosman (R-President), and Glenn Larson (R-President Pro Tempore and Majority Leader). The leaders of the House were Leo Graybill (D-Speaker), John Emmons (D-Speaker Pro Tempore), and Eugene Mahoney (D-Majority Leader).

The Butte Machinist Union, International Association of Machinists, Lodge 88, was organized in Butte, Montana, in 1891. Officers included Master Machinist August Heimbach, Foreman Charles O'Rourke, Recording Secretary James Hamlin, and Treasurer Thomas Ogle.
John E. Dougherty was born in Perth, Ontario, Canada, in 1841. He taught school near Ottawa for four years. In 1870 he came to Montana Territory and taught school for a year. In 1871 he bought Billy Quinn's general store in Radersburg, which at that time was a bustling mining town. The J.E. Dougherty store sold general merchandise and farm implements to the local farmers and miners, until it closed in 1886. In addition to the store, Dougherty had a farm in the Crow Creek valley. Daugherty married Eliza Jane Clark on February 7, 1875. They had three children. John E. Dougherty died in an accident in 1905.
The Montana State Board of Health was created by the state legislature in 1901. One of the first diseases the Board was asked to study was Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (also known as tick fever, since the disease is spread by wood ticks) which was occurring in the Bitterroot Valley. Early work with the disease was done by Dr. T.D. Tuttle of the State Board of Health and Dr. Howard T. Ricketts, who was sponsored by the American Medical Association in 1906, and by the Montana legislature in succeeding years. Work on ticks and their control by "dipping" domestic animals and the killing of rodents upon which tick lived was done at Montana Agricultural College and Experiment Station in Bozeman by Dr. R.A. Cooley. In 1913 the Montana State Board of Entomology was created and charged with studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and methods for its control. The Board was composed of the secretary of the State Board of Health (serving as chairman), the state veterinarian, and the state entomologist (serving as secretary). During the years from 1913 to 1931, the membership of the Board was W.F. Cogswell, W.J. Butler, and R.A. Cooley. Dr. Cooley also conducted tick research in Africa in the 1920s. R.R. Parker served as assistant entomologist and conducted field research on ticks from 1915 until 1922. Throughout the early years of research on tick fever, representatives from the United States Public Health Service worked in Montana in cooperation with the State Board of Health and the State Board of Entomology. In 1927 the Montana Legislative Assembly appropriated $60,000 for the construction of a laboratory in Hamilton to provide facilities for the study of the disease and the search for vaccines to prevent the disease. In 1930 the state Boards assisted in the formation of the Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever Committee composed to representatives from other states having documented cases of the disease. This committee requested that the United States Public Health Service "take over and assume full control of investigations of tick-borne, human diseases." In 1932 the laboratory facilities at Hamilton were sold to the federal government and work on tick fever was continued by federal employees.
The Montana State Legislature is made up of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Montana limits the size of the Senate to no fewer than 40 and no more than 50 members and the size of the House of Representatives to no fewer than 80 and no more than 100 members. Each house is responsible for choosing its officers, creating committees and establishing its own rules. The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day.

The 48th Montana Legislature met from January 3rd to April 21st, 1983. The leaders of the Senate were Stan Stephens (R-President), Allen Kolstad (R-President Pro Tempore), Frank Hazellbaker (R-Majority Leader), and Chet Baylock (D-Minority Leader). The leaders of the House were Dan Kemmis (D-Speaker), Joe Brand (D-Speaker Pro Tempore), John Vincent (D-Majority Leader), and Bob Marks (R-Minority Leader).

Her interest in politics began early in life, and she aspired to one day run for U.S. Congress but then realized she would have to mortgage her house to finance a campaign. While attending the University of Buffalo’s Cadet Nurses Training program, Arlyne met her future husband Harold “Rick” Reichert, on December 25, 1942. They married in 1945 after he returned from serving overseas in the U.S. military. The couple moved to Great Falls and had five children: Cheryl, Greg, Robert, Claire, and Roger. Reichert did not continue her nursing training because at that time married women were not accepted for training at either hospital in Great Falls.
In 1967, Reichert began working at the McLaughlin Research Institute with Dr. Jack Stimpfling as the executive secretary and technical editor of the Transplantation Journal. Reichert’s involvement in local government began after she moved to Great Falls and served as a Library Trustee and President of the Friends of the Great Falls Public Library. She was also a member of the League of Women Voters, serving on both the Local and State Boards.
In 1970, Reichert ran for the Montana state legislature and lost, but the following year, was elected as a 1972 Constitutional Convention delegate. She served on the Legislative Committee and pushed for a unicameral legislature, although Montana voters decided against it when the new Constitution was ratified.
After the Convention, Reichert remained active in Great Falls local government. She participated in getting the local government structure changed from a mayor-alderman form to commission-manager system. In 1974, she was elected to the Cascade County Study Commission. She also served as a legislative analyst for television news and Regional Vice President of the National Municipal League.
In 1979, Reichert was elected to the Montana State House of Representatives and served one term. During that time, she worked on the topics of a unicameral legislature and separation of powers. Reichert retired as Assistant Director of the McLaughlin Institute in 1989. Arlyne Reichert remains active in local politics and historic preservation efforts, including preservation of the Great Falls 10th Street Bridge. Her efforts to save the bridge led her to establish Preservation Cascade, Inc., which she serves on as secretary-treasurer. She also served as a National Civic League council member and on the Montana Capitol Restoration Committee.
Her husband passed away from cancer in 1968.
The original Helena Cemetery Association was incorporated on June 11, 1887, by Andrew J. Fisk, Ansalem J. Davidson, William Muth, and others, in response to a lack of space available in existing cemeteries. A year later the Helena City Council appointed a committee to study the matter. In May 1890, after several years of considering various proposals for locations and facilities, F.R. Wallace, as trustee for the City of Helena, purchased the present site of the cemetery from Evan and Amelia Harris for $22,220. In August 1890 a second Helena Cemetery Association was incorporated by P.D. Grommon, John B. Clayberg, A.M. Thornburgh and E.C. Richards to acquire land; improve and beautify it; lay out and construct lots, roadways, and water systems; sell lots; and all other acts "connected with the maintenance and operation of a Cemetery..." The Association was incorporated for $250,000 and stockholders included many of the most prominent names in Helena society. One of the first acts of the new Association was to purchase the property for the cemetery from trustee F.R. Wallace, for "$1 and other valuable considerations" among which was the full $250,000 worth of capital stock. Wallace then transferred back to the Association $61,000 worth of stock to be sold as needed to finance improvements. One such improvement was a street railway to the site, constructed by Peter Winne. Under the leadership of Winne, who became President in December 1892, the association developed the site, installed a water system, planted trees and shrubs, and sold lots. A permanent Endowment Fund and a Perpetual Care and Improvement Fund were also established.
The Helena Cemetery was renamed the Forestvale Cemetery around 1901. The Helena Cemetery Association's corporate charter expired in 1910, but the affairs of the Association were never formally closed. The Association continued to meet until 1913. Secretary and Manager Henry Winter had by this time acquired, through direct ownership and proxies, control of over 99% of the stock. He assumed personal management of the property. In May 1918, in response to rapidly rising lot prices, poor maintenance, and accusations of mismanagement, William Muth and other trustees of the Permanent Care and Improvement Fund and Endowment Fund filed suit against Henry Winter and other trustees to force them to account for the funds. Muth and other lot owners and relatives of people buried in the cemetery met in June of 1919 to form a new association. They selected the name Forestvale Cemetery Association and proceeded to file a condemnation suit to force Winter to sell the property. The court eventually set the price at $35,000 and the property was conveyed to the Forestvale Cemetery Association. Over the years the endowment funds which were based on a percentage of the original lot purchase prices became inadequate to maintain the cemetery, which fell into serious disrepair.
In 1965 a concerted effort was made to clean up the grounds by removing excess trees and shrubs, improving the irrigation system, filling sunking plots, etc. However by the late 1980s the cemetery was again in poor condition. In a special election on April 2, 1991, School District #1 voted to fund a cemetery district to provide permanent upkeep by Lewis and Clark County.
The 1st Regiment of Montana Volunteers was formed in July 1867 by executive order of Governor Green Clay Smith. The formation of the regiment was in response to the perceived increased threat of attacks by Sioux and other tribes. The regiment was divided into nine companies under the general command of Col. Thomas Thoroughman. He was directed by the governor to "send out from time to time such forces as may be deemed necessary to chastise marauding and guerilla bands of Indians." Quartermaster and Commissary officers were appointed to secure needed supplies. By August, Neil Howie had taken command of the forces.
The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America was founded in 1881 by Peter J. McGuire and Gustav Luebkert. In April of that year the two men formed a provisional committee and started the newspaper The Carpenter to promote the idea of a national union of carpenters. The first convention of the Brotherhood was held in Chicago in August of 1881. Like many unions of the period the Brotherhood grew out of a tradition of social democracy and socialism. The early preamble reflected this in its call for a "Cooperative Commonwealth" with trade unions as its cornerstone. The union's immediate goals included wage and hour demands and death and sickness benefits. The union grew rapidly; its 1881 membership of 2000 expanded to 50,000 by 1890, and 100,000 by 1900. In May 1889 an organizational meeting was held in Anaconda, Montana, to form a local carpenters' union. The first formal meeting of the new Local #88, of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America was held on June 6, 1889 by nine charter members. Anthony Blise was elected president and George Owen, recording secretary. The reform ideology of the national union was reflected in the local bylaws, the preamble to which stated that "We hold it as a sacred duty to posterity to use our utmost endeavor to replace the present wage system by cooperative industry and to claim our inalienable right to the means of living which are inherent in the soil." The Anaconda local bylaws fined members for patronizing Chinese businessmen. Both the preamble and the anti-Chinese clause were eliminated in later bylaws. The union's main concerns were promoting the eight hour day, protecting wages, providing sick and death insurance, enforcing union shop conditions, and protecting the jurisdiction of the union against other unions. In 1915 the carpenters formed a statewide organization, the Montana State Council of Carpenters, to coordinate the work of all the locals in Montana. The carpenters' union was also active in the Montana State Federation of Labor, the Montana State AFL-CIO, the Montana State Apprenticeship Council, and the Non-ferrous Metals Council. The latter was a joint negotiating team of unions in the regional copper industry.
John Wilson Fulton was born in Massachusetts on October 26, 1872, the son of Charles J. and Mary Anne (Wilson) Fulton. About 1892 he moved to Helena, Montana, with his father, where they invested in mining properties. Their investments included the Big Ox Mining Company, the Plymouth Gold Mining Company at Gould, and other mines. The Big Ox Mining Company firm was incorporated on October 16, 1896 by John, Charles, and M.A.H. Fulton. They purchased the mining properties of the Big ox Mining and Reduction Company near Marysville, Montana. The company operated the Big Ox Mine and the Golconda Mine until about 1916, when the corporate charter expired. On May 17, 1920, John and Charles re-incorporated under the same name. The company went bankrupt and in 1926 the Fultons organized Montana Mines (an Express Trust) to buy the properties at sheriff's sales. They continued to operate the properties until the mid 1930s. The Northern Angora Goat Company was formed as the Northern Angora Goat& Live Stock Co. in 1900. The company's home office was the Pittsburgh Block in Helena, Montana, with the Mohair Sales Depot and Eastern Office in Boston, Massachusetts. The original officers included Charles W. Hoffman of Bozeman as president, W.C. Bailey as vice-president, George F. Thompson of Washington, D.C., as treasurer, Herbert Hammond of Chicago, Illinois, as secretary, and John Wilson Fulton of Helena, as manager. By 1904 Charles J. Fulton, took over the position as manager. He held this position until his death in February 1928. John continued to manage the company after his father's death. The firm advertised itself as the "largest breeders of long mohair Angoras in America," and promoted the goats as a new farm industry. C.J. John Wilson Fulton worked for the company from its office in the Pittsburg Block until his death on April 17, 1966. He was preceded in by his wife, Antoinette (maiden name Rathbone) Fulton, whom he married on June 29, 1911 and who passed away on December 31, 1942.
State officers for the Young Democratic Club of Montana were first elected in 1933. The organization was affiliated with the Young Democratic Clubs of America. The purpose of the organization was to contribute to the growth and influence of the Democratic Party, to develop leadership, and to maintain and promote harmony within the party ranks. The membership was organized in county clubs of Young Democrats chartered by the Executive Committee of the Young Democratic Club of Montana. Officers were elected for one year by a majority vote of delegates to the annual state convention. Elected officers included a president, a vice-president, a secretary, and a treasurer. Members in good standing of any chartered club were eligible to hold state offices provided they were over twenty-one and under thirty-five years of age. The State Executive Committee was composed of two state committeemen and two state committeewomen elected by county clubs from each congressional district, the elected officers of the organization, and the state's representatives ("national committeeman and committeewoman") appointed to attend the annual convention of the Young Democratic Clubs of America. State and national annual conventions were governed by votes of members of chartered clubs. The major activity of the state organization between 1936 and 1938 was to promote memberships in local county chartered clubs. County clubs held meetings and sponsored social events to raise funds to defray the cost of charter membership to the Young Democratic Club of Montana. In 1936 Gail Meagher Brown of Helena became secretary of the Young Democratic Club of Montana. In 1937 she was appointed committeewoman to the national organization, as Montana's representative. In 1938 Gail Brown also served as director of the Young Democratic Clubs of America's Region Ten, which included Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In addition, she produced and edited the state club's newsletter, Montana Young Democrat.
The 1983 Montana Legislative Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 21 recognizing the approaching Montana Statehood Centennial and urging the governor to make recommendations to the 1985 Legislative Assembly on formal centennial observances. In response to this resolution, Governor Ted Schwinden appointed Lieutenant Governor George Turman to coordinate the official response. Turman concentrated on three areas: volunteer citizen involvement, interagency cooperation, and communication with other centennial states in the region. To encourage citizen participation, Turman created "The Eighty-Niners", a volunteer organization with local chapters around the state. The Eighty-Niners solicited suggestions concerning possible celebrations, published a newsletter, and its local affiliates sponsored many local events. The Centennial Commission sponsored several projects among which were the issuing of special Centennial license plates to finance grants for local projects; the Century Citizens Project, honoring Montanans who would be 100 years old by 1989; and the Centennial Acres Project, selling certificates of "ownership" in several State Parks and sites. The main focus of the work of the Centennial Office, however, became the licensing of officially sanctioned products, events, and projects. The Office received 1,068 applications for licensing, most of which were approved. These applications included museum exhibits, musical events, parades, rodeos, plays, pageants, tree plantings, art work, books, belt buckles, lapel pins, baseball caps, etc. Money from license plate sales funded a small number of grants to worthy projects. The Centennial celebration's grand finale was the Centennial Ball held in Helena November 11, 1989. The final event of the year-long celebration was the burying of a time capsule on January 23, 1990.
J.H. McKnight and Company was founded by Joseph Hempstead McKnight during the years following 1870. McKnight, originally from Dubuque, Iowa, came west in the 1860s in the company of Thomas C. Power, a business associate. Before forming his own company, McKnight worked as clerk at sutler stores at Fort Buford, at Camp Cook on the Judith River, and at Fort Benton, where he arrived in August 1866. In 1871, McKnight, assisted by the financial backing of T.C. Power, took charge of the trading post at Fort Shaw, Montana. Fort Shaw, located at Sun River Crossing twenty miles above the mouth of the Sun River, was established in 1867. An infantry post, it served as the regimental headquarters in the military department of the Territory of Montana. It was designed to protect settlers and prospectors, to prevent the invasion of Blackfeet treaty land, and to keep the route between Fort Benton and the Helena gold fields open. As the licensed post trader, J.H. McKnight and Company served the military, plus trappers, area settlers, Indian agents from the Blackfeet Agency, and the Northwest Mounted Police of Canada. In its operation, J.H. McKnight and Company was very closely connected with T.C. Power and Brother at Fort Benton, the two owners being personal friends and business allies throughout McKnight's life. The firms supplied each other, shared orders, provided transportation for commodities, and conferred on the prices and availability of goods. In 1887, McKnight sold the Fort Shaw traders' post and moved his operation to Great Falls. There, J.H. McKnight and Company served as "wholesale and retail grocers and dealers in agricultural implements, wagons, harness, and building materials," at the corner of Central Avenue and Third Street in the McKnight Block. The organization of the firm was formalized in 1894 when bylaws were adopted, stock was issued, and the name was altered to J.H. McKnight Company. Originally there were only four stockholders: T.C. Power and J.H. McKnight (499 shares each) and F. George Heldt and C.B. Power (one share each). These men also served as the Company's Board of Trustees, alternating the offices of the Board among themselves. When McKnight died on January 20, 1903, the other three trustees continued the business until the expiration of the J.H. McKnight Company charter on June 4, 1914. At that time the corporation was dissolved and all company property was sold, with the assets of the firm totaling more than $108,000. This money was dispersed to the corporation's stockholders.
Edward H. Sherman was born in Iowa around 1866, the son of Patrick H. and Sarah (McAtee) Sherman. After his father died young, Edward went to work for an undertaker and learned the trade. In the early 1880s he joined the circus and headed west. He left the circus in Butte, Montana. About 1889 he opened an undertaking establishment in Butte, which also sold pianos, organs, recording equipment, and sewing machines. Sherman's business went through several changes over the years. In 1893 he incorporated the Sherman Music Company with John M. Bowes, Charles E. Wendell, and Thomas C. O'Meara to run the piano and organ business, while his brother William P. Sherman took over the undertaking business. Another brother Thomas J. Sherman acted as agent for the undertaking establishment. Briefly about 1897, Edward also owned the Sherman Mattress Factory in Butte. When William moved to Kalispell, Edward formed a partnership with John R. Reed to run the funeral and undertaking business while continuing to operate the Sherman Music Company. In 1910 Edward H. Sherman moved to Salt Lake City where he opened a casket manufacturing company. In 1917 he relocated to Helena, Montana, where he managed the piano department of A.P. Curtin's furniture business. In 1927 he incorporated a new Sherman Music Company as a successor the Curtin piano department.
Edward H. Sherman married Sina Masterson in 1907. They had four children: Joy (born about 1908), Virginia (born about 1910), Edward H. (born about 1913), and William P. (born about 1918). Edward H. Sherman died at the home of his daughter in Bozeman July 15, 1938.
Galt Brothers was founded about 1910 by Henry H. (1886-1986), Errol F. (1889-1975), and Oliver J. (1891?-1986) Galt, all born in Minnesota, sons of William and Emeretta (Robinson) Galt. Younger brother Glen A. Galt (1894-1986) later joined his brothers in the business. The store specialized in hardware and agricultural implements. In 1917 Errol sold out his share of the store to open the First National Bank in Geyser. Henry also sold out his share to concentrate on the cattle business. O. J. Galt retired from the store about 1980. The store continued under new ownership as the Pioneer Hardware Store.
In addition to the hardware business, the brothers ran a drayage business, a cattle ranch, and a Ford automobile dealership and garage. Oliver primarily ran the hardware store and drayage business, Henry the ranch, and Glen the garage, but all four brothers were involved in all aspects of the family enterprises.
Edward Charles "Teddy Blue" Abbott was born December 17, 1860, in Cranwich Hall, Norfolk County, England. In 1871, he moved to the United States with his father, J.B. Abbott. They traveled to Texas, eventually purchased a cattle herd, and drove it north to Nebraska. Teddy Blue settled with his family at the end of the Texas cattle trail near Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1883, he entered Montana Territory with a herd of longhorns, and two years later, signed on with the DHS Ranch at Fort Maginnis. He became engaged to Mary Stuart, daughter of one of his employers, Granville Stuart. The couple married on September 29, 1889, and settled on the 3 Deuce Ranch at Giltedge, Montana. They had ten children: Katie Anne (1890-1986); Charles Edward (1892-1959); Mary E. (1895-1904); William (1897-1897); Elsie Blue (1898-1995); Granville Stuart (1901-1990); James Jefferson (1903-1988); William Robert [Robert] (1906-1964); Teddie Blue [Ted] (1909-1982); and Mary Inez (1915-1984).
Teddy Blue Abbott was a longtime member of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, he served six years on the Montana Stock Commission for Fergus County, thirty years as a member of the Democratic Central Committee, and sixteen years as a school trustee. In 1924, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Montana State Legislature. In 1938, Abbott collaborated with Helena Huntington Smith on his autobiography, We Pointed Them North, the story of his years as a cowpuncher on the Texas cattle drives and his experiences on Montana's open range in the 1880s. Teddy Blue Abbott died of pneumonia on April 7, 1939, days after the book was published.
Mary Stuart Abbott was born February 2, 1870, in Deer Lodge, Montana, to Granville and Arbonnie Stuart. She died February 5, 1967, in Lewistown, Montana.
The Montana Attorney General was originally authorized under the Organic Act of 1864 which established Montana as a territory. The 1889 Constitution established the office as an elective executive office. The duties of the Attorney General included prosecuting and defending all cases to which the State or any county was a party; enforcing judgements reached in such cases; supervising county attorneys; giving opinions on legal issues to state agencies, the legislature, and county officials; to bid on property in the name of the state; and to serve ex officio on a variety of boards and commissions including the Board of Examiners, the Board of Land Commissioners, the Board of Education, the Board of Equalization, the Board of State Prison Commissioners, the Board of Pardons, and others. While the specifics of the duties have changed over the years, the general principal that the Attorney General is the attorney for the state, has remained constant. As the complexities of state government have increased the Attorney General has acquired a staff of Assistant Attorneys General to handle most of the work. Many of these are assigned to specific agencies. Among the Attorneys General during the period of these records were Albert J. Galen (1905-1913), S.C. Ford (1917-1921), L.A. Foot (1924-1933), Harrison J. Freeborn (1937-1941), R.V. Bottomly (1942-1949), Arnold Olsen (1949-1957), and Forrest Anderson (1957- ).
The 1972 Montana Constitution required the legislature to "...provide procedures requiring each local government unit or combination of units to review its structure and submit one alternative form of government to the qualified electors ... " by 1976. The 1974 legislature accordingly established the nine-member State Commission on Local Government. Harold Gerke chaired the Commission, and George Boulisman was the director until July 1974 when Dale Harris assumed that position. In its three year existence the Commission was required to: make a detailed study of local government structure, powers, services, and finances, and state-local relations; prepare a revised code of local government law; consult and assist local government study commissions; publicize the voter review of local government; and publish reports and make recommendations to the governor and legislature. The legislature concurrently funded community education projects to be carried out by such bodies as the University of Montana's Bureau of Government Research, Montana State University's Cooperative Extension Service, the Montana Chamber of Commerce, and the League of Women Voters of Montana.
One hundred eighty-two city, town, and county local government study commissions, consisting of at least three unpaid members were elected in nonpartisan elections held in November 1974. These commissions conducted reviews of their local governments and drew up proposals for alternative forms of government which were voted on in 1976. The amount of time and effort invested by each commission in this work varied widely.
The Montana Historical Society’s Research Historian position was established in 1993 to “provide verification, research, writing, and editing for projects and publications by the Society and cooperating agencies.” The position also served as a representative of the Society at public events, conducted radio and television interviews, and served as a historical consultant.
Major projects undertaken by the office included serving as the Society’s consultant with the Montana Heritage Project, the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Advisory Council (later renamed the Montana Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission), and the Virginia City/Nevada City Task Force, along with writing and editing text for the Montana history textbook for middle school students, editing interpretive script for museum exhibits, and writing biographical sketches for the “Capital Niches” and nominees for Trustees Awards.
Dave Walter was Montana Historical Society's first Research Historian. He was born in Racine, Wisconsin in 1943 and graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut in 1965. He then entered the University of Montana as a graduate student, where he worked closely with historian K. Ross Toole, taught undergraduate history classes, and developed educational materials for schools. In 1979, he was hired as a Reference Librarian at the Montana Historical Society and in 1993, he became the first Research Historian at MTHS. In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Montana.
Additionally, Walter had a regular history column in Montana, Magazine of the Northern Rockies and the Helena Independent Record. He wrote numerous articles for other publications, including Montana, the Magazine of Western History. Walter also initiated and moderated the “Jerks in Montana History: Speaking Ill of the Dead” session at the annual Montana History Conference and the "More Quarries of Last Chance Gulch" column in the Helena Independent Record, both of which became published books. He also wrote Christmastime in Montana and Campfire Tales, among other books. Walter conducted many oral history interviews, including a series of interviews on conscientious objectors during World War II, and co-authored Speaking of Montana, a guide to oral histories at the Montana Historical Society. Dave Walter died July 19, 2006.
The Montana Power Company was incorporated on December 12, 1912, as a result of a merger of the Butte Electric and Power Company, the Madison River Power Company, the United Missouri River Power Company, and the Billings and Eastern Montana Power Company. The merger was brought about by John D. Ryan, head of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and John G. Morony, president of the First National Bank of Great Falls. Each of the constituent companies had been formed as the result of mergers of earlier companies.
The Butte Electric and Power Company, was formed in 1901 to take over the assets and liabilities of the Butte Lighting and Power Company, which was, in turn, the successor to several local Butte power generating plants, including the Brush Electric Light and Power Company, the Silver Bow Electric Light Company, the Butte Electric Light and Power Company, the Silver Bow Electric Light and Power Company, the Butte General Electric Company, the Phoenix Electric Company, the Butte Gas Light and Coke Company, and others. The Butte Electric and Power Company's properties also included a hydro-electric power station on the Big Hole River from The Montana Power Transmission Company, successor to the Big Hole Improvement Company; and a majority interest in several Great Falls companies including the Great Falls Street Railway Company, the Boston and Great Falls Electric and Power Company, and the Great Falls Electric Properties.
The Missouri River Electric and Power Company, was organized in 1911, as a successor to the United Missouri River Power Company (UMRPC), which had gone into receivership. The UMRPC was itself a merger of the Missouri River Power Company, the Capital City Power Company, and the Helena Power Transmission Company. By 1912 the successor company owned most of the hydro-electric facilities on the Missouri River, including the first Canyon Ferry Dam completed in 1898 by the Helena Water and Electric Power Company; the Hauser Dam built in 1907 by the Helena Power Transmission Company; and the Holter Dam, begun around 1907 by the Capital City Power Company; and, due to financial difficulties, not completed until after the merger into Montana Power Company.
The Madison River Power Company was organized in 1905 by Butte Electric and Power Company interests to take over the Nunn power plant on the Madison River from The Power Company. The Madison River Power Company also constructed the Lower Madison Development in 1906 and transmission lines to Butte. In addition the Company acquired the Bozeman Electric Light Company, the Bozeman Street Railway Company, the Gallatin Light, Power and Railway Company, and the Livingston Water Power Company.
The Billings and Eastern Montana Power Company was organized in 1908 to take over various power developments along the Yellowstone River, including the Yegan Brothers properties, the Yellowstone River Power Company, the Billings Water Power Company, the Montana Trading Company, and the Big Timber Electric Light and Power Company.
After the organization of the Montana Power Company in 1912, the company continued to consolidate power developments around the state. In 1929 several major systems were acquired. The Missoula Public Service Company, was a merger of the Missoula Light and Water Company and the Missoula Street Railway Company both developed by William A. Clark. The various Helena properties which had been consolidated under the Helena Gas and Electric Company in 1927, also became part of Montana Power Company in 1929. A third major acquisition in 1929 was the Thompson Falls Power Company, including its predecessor the Northwestern Development Company. The Great Falls Townsite Company, the Great Falls Power Company, and the Great Falls Street Railway Company were all acquired by Montana Power Company between 1931 and 1936. The last major system acquired before World War II was the Union Electric Company of Dillon, which included the properties of its predecessors the Rife Electric Company and the Dillon Electric Light and Power Company. In addition, many local utilities were added for which there are no records in this collection.
[For more comprehensive information on the history of the predecessor companies see "Corporate Growth" [Box 1 Folder 2] and Douglas F. Leighton,  The Corporate history of the Montana Power Company, 1882-1913, (M.A. Thesis. Montana State University, Missoula, 1951)]
The Montana Juvenile Justice Advisory Council was established by Governor Forrest Anderson in August 1972, to examine existing juvenile legislation and juvenile correctional facilities, and to recommend revisions in the law. Governor Anderson stressed the need to examine the constitutional rights of juveniles in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision expanding those rights. Governor Anderson appointed Associate Justice Frank Haswell to head the Council and Doug Chase, Harold Hanser, Paul Hatfield, Jeremiah Johnson, Helen Kampfe, Mike McLean, Frank Sennett, John Thomas, and Robert Wilson as Council members. Terry Wallace and Steve Nelson were hired as staff. In April 1973 the Council published a discussion draft of its proposed Montana Youth Act and solicited comments from legal experts and the public. As a result of these comments the draft was revised and in November a second draft Montana Youth Act was published. Governor Thomas Judge re-appointed the Council in July 1973 to continue its work. As a result, two bills were introduced into the second session of the 43rd Legislative Assembly (1974): HB 797 to revise the law relating to abused, neglected, and dependent children; and HB 798, the Montana Youth Justice Act. Both passed into law.
The Eastmont Human Services Center was established at Glendive in 1967 by the 40th Legislature. The center operated two facilities for lodging residents, a 40 bed cottage and a 15 bed cottage. The 15 bed cottage (Cottage II) originally housed residents under a five-day program where developmentally disabled students were bussed from the surrounding areas to the center for training classes during the week. Gradually, these students were integrated into the school system in their own communities.
By the 1980s, the purpose of the center was to provide residential and day training to people with severe developmental disabilities through an on-going seven-day program. The seven-day program includes people who range in age from fifteen to over sixty years. The majority of these residents transferred to the center from the Montana Developmental Center and required 24 hour supervision. Course instruction included academics, home living, perceptual training, social awareness, recreation and physical education, speech therapy, and pre-vocational training. Residents occupied fifty-two of the center's fifty-five beds at June 30, 1986.
The center closed in 2003 due to budget concerns. Authority was then transferred to the Montana State Department of Corrections where it was transformed into a DUI treatment center.
The University of Montana at Missoula was established in 1893. In 1913 Montana's higher education system was unified under the name University of Montana, and the name of the university at Missoula was changed to State University of Montana. In 1965 the name of the statewide office was changed to Montana University System. Under the system were the University of Montana at Missoula (formerly Montana State University), Montana State University at Bozeman (formerly Montana State College), Western Montana College at Dillon (formerly Montana State Normal School), Eastern Montana College at Billings, and Northern Montana College at Havre.
Forrest H. Anderson was born in Helena, Montana, on January 20, 1913, the son of Oscar Anderson, a Swedish immigrant, and his wife Mary O'Keefe, an Irish immigrant. He attended public schools in Helena, and then studied pre-law at the University of Montana in Missoula. He got his law degree from Columbus University in Washington, D.C.
Anderson was admitted to practice before the Montana Supreme Court in 1938. He was elected to the Montana legislature in 1942, and also served as Lewis and Clark County Attorney. He was elected to the Montana Supreme Court in 1952 and served 4 years, before running for Montana Attorney General in 1956. He was re-elected as Attorney General three times. During the 1959 State Prison riot, he personally negotiated with the prisoners in helping to resolve the conflict. In 1968 he defeated incumbent Governor Tim Babcock, largely on an anti-sales tax platform. His slogan was "Pay More, What For?"
Anderson's one term as Governor was filled with controversy, but made significant accomplishments. The early years of his administration were dominated by conflict with Frank Dunkle, Fish and Game Commissioner, and the Fish and Game Commission, over the direction of the Commission on environmental issues and on fisherman and hunter access issues. In 1971 the Legislature deadlocked over a sales tax. Anderson called two special sessions to deal with the issue, and finally resorted to putting the tax to a public referendum. The sales tax was resoundingly defeated. Anderson actively supported the Montana Constitutional Convention. He later viewed his greatest Gubernatorial accomplishments as the Executive Reorganization, which combined several hundred agencies, boards, commissions, and councils, into 19 Departments; and his establishment of the Board of Investments to remove state funds from low yield bank accounts to place them in higher yield investment accounts. Anderson did not run for re-election due to health problems.
Anderson was also active in many civic and fraternal organizations. He married Evelyn Samson in 1941. They had three children. Forrest Anderson died in Helena on July 20, 1989, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Created as part of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences in 1973, the Environmental Sciences Division remained part of DHES from 1974 to 1990, during which time they were responsible for monitoring air quality and water quality, solid waste management, administering the Subdivision Bureau, and ensuring food and consumer safety, and occupational health. In 1991, though still a part of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, the role of the Environmental Sciences Division was considerably expanded to include: Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Board, a Superfund Section, and an Underground Storage Tanks Section.
The Environmental Sciences Division became its own separate department, renamed the Department of Environmental Quality, in 1995, and was comprised of the following divisions: Director’s Office, Air Quality, Centralized Services, Energy, Environmental Remediation, Reclamation, Waste Management, and Water Quality. Under DHES’s Centralized Services, the Office of Information Technology had been referred to as the Information Services Bureau; after the split in 1995, the ISB became the DEQ, Information Technology Bureau. In 2000, the ITB became the Systems Administration Bureau and the Systems Solutions Bureau. In 2004, the Systems Administration Bureau and the Systems Solutions Bureau were rejoined as Information Technology Services.
What is currently referred to as the Office of Information Technology (OIT) functions as part of the Deputy Director’s office, and exists to provide systems administration, applications development and support services to the department and its regional offices. The office is responsible for the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of comprehensive statewide information technology solutions. Responsibilities include short term and long range planning, management reporting, budgetary planning, resource allocation, and development of policies and procedures. The Office of Information Technology is also responsible for administration of the department's web sites.
The Montana Board of Capitol Commissioners was established by the 1895 Legislature. The Board, consisting of the governor, secretary of state, and attorney general, was given the power to review proposals submitted by contractors for the construction of a capitol building or for modifying an existing building for use as a capitol. To be approved, the building must be in a convenient location, be available by October 1, 1896, be large enough to house all state offices, and be fire-proof, with vaults for the storage of state archives. The state would then lease the building for five years. The Board signed an initial contract with George R. Mann for the building. In 1897 the law was amended to provide for the construction of a permanent capitol building for not more than $300,000. The legislature authorized the cancellation of George R. Mann's contract and the solicitation of new bids. The board was increased to five members to consist of the governor and four citizens appointed by the governor, only one of whom could be from Helena. The 1897 legislature authorized the issuance of thirty year bonds in the amount of $350,000 for the construction of the capitol building. The cornerstone of the capitol was laid July 4, 1899 on land donated by a consortium of Helena real estate men
James Brownlee Rankin was born January 31, 1900, in Denver, Colorado, the son of Reverend James Doig Rankin and Daisy Meloy Rankin. In his college years, Rankin developed a great love for books. Later he also developed an interest in art, particularly western art. This avocation led him to begin the collection of books illustrated by western artists, notably Charles M. Russell and Frederic Remington.
By 1936 Rankin had developed a very strong interest in the work and life of Charles M. Russell. That summer, he decided to research and write a biography of the artist and produce an illustrated catalog of all of Russell's known works. This was his primary goal and the object of his free time until 1940.
Rankin took ads in national and regional newspapers as well as pertinent magazines. From this, he developed a wide range of contacts that had known Russell, knew of him, or owned works by the Montana artist. He made extensive trips to interview individuals and to catalog Russell's art.
Rankin moved to Pasadena, California, in 1939, to be closer to his father and to pursue his teaching and research interests. He married Josephine Crenshaw of New York City in 1940. He never lost his lifelong interest in Russell, but did not continue working on the biography/catalog after that year.
Ultimately he destroyed his manuscript after the publication of a Russell biography by a friend, who Rankin believed, had plagiarized much of his earlier work. The one piece Rankin did publish on Russell was a bibliography of published works illustrated by the artist which appeared in American Book Illustrations in 1938. James Brownlee Rankin died at San Bernardino, California, August 2, 1962.
Charles Marion Russell was born March 19, 1864, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Mary Elizabeth Mead (daughter of Edward Mead) and Charles Silas Russell. He had one sister, Susan Mead Russell (who married T.G. Portis) and brothers: Silas Bent, Edward, Guy, and Wolfert. Silas Bent Russell had a son and daughter, Austin and Isabel. Florence M.N. Russell was Charles M. Russell's stepmother.
At the age of sixteen, Russell’s parents sent him to Montana under the guardianship of a sheepherder from who he soon parted. Working for some time as a cowboy in the West, he continued to sketch, spending his summers on the open range and his winters in various frontier towns, where he often painted pictures in exchange for food or lodging. He sent the original of "Last of the 5000" to Louis Stadler of the Stadler and Kaufman partnership.
In 1896 Russell married Nancy Cooper in Ben Roberts' home at Cascade, Montana. Under her influence and direction he developed from an itinerant cowboy into an artist who painted pictures for a living. The Russell’s adopted a son, Jack Cooper Russell.
By 1920 Russell had achieved financial success and made frequent trips to New York, where he painted for such patrons as Malcomb MacKay and Phillip G. Cole. Russell seldom used models for his paintings or sculpture and took pride in the accuracy of his memory for the details depicted in his scenes of cowboy and Indian life in the West.
For more than a quarter of a century Russell produced works depicting the West as he had known it before the advent of barbed wire, the automobile, etc. He maintained a studio in Great Falls, Montana, and for a brief period in Pasadena, California. Charles M. Russell died October 24, 1926.
James W. Bollinger, William S. Hart, Harry Stanford, and Phil Weinard were among the collectors of works by Russell.
The Montana Live Stock Sanitary Board was established in 19O7 and consisted of three members: the president of the Board of Stock Commissioners, the president of the Board of Sheep Commissioners, and the president of the State Board of Health. The State Veterinarian served as secretary and executive officer of the Board. The Board was empowered to govern quarantines, establish and maintain livestock sanitary regulations, direct and regulate the slaughter of all diseased animals, provide for meat inspection, and provide for the payment of indemnity when required.
In 1921 the legislature increased the size of the Board to include all six members of the Livestock Commission, with the chairman of the Commission serving as chairman of the Board. The Board was also given additional powers, including the power to regulate the importation of livestock, the eradication and control of livestock diseases, and the movement and quarantine of animals infected with contagious diseases within the state. Additional powers were gradually granted by succeeding legislatures. In 1931 the Board got the power to inspect and grade meat; in 1949 the Board assumed the regulation of Montana's rendering plants; and in 1953 the Board began the supervision of garbage feeders and artificial inseminators.
The Montana Veterinary Research Laboratory, at Montana State College in Bozeman, was organized in 1929, as a cooperative effort of the Montana Livestock Sanitary Board, the Montana Experiment Station, the Montana Stockgrowers Association, and the Montana Woolgrowers Association. The laboratory was established to investigate diseases of range cattle and sheep.
Dr. William J. Butler was appointed state veterinary surgeon on March 4, 1913. He resigned in 1948 and was followed by Dr. Howard F. Wilkins (1948-1954) and Dr. Hadleigh Marsh (1954-1956). In 1956 Dr. J.W. Safford became state veterinarian and served until 1973.
The Montana Live Stock Sanitary Board was abolished in 1971, and its functions were transferred to the newly created Board of Livestock, which vested these responsibilities in the Department of Livestock, Animal Health Division, headed by the State Veterinarian.
Elsie P. Johnson was born in 1902 in Fromberg, Montana, daughter of Joseph and Mary (Jedlicka) Pokarney. She attended Dillon Normal College and later taught at Cherry Springs school. In 1924, she married Paul Alfred Johnston in Sheridan, Wyoming and in 1932, the couple moved to Laurel, Montana, where Elsie became a member of the Laurel Methodist Church, the Order of Eastern Star, and the Laurel Women’s Club. She became interested in Montana music after being assigned by the Laurel Women’s Club to look into the history of Montana music for the club’s yearbook. Johnston reached out to the Library of Congress and the Montana Historical Society in search of songs and music about Montana or written by Montana residents. Songs she gathered included “Beautiful Montana,” by A. H. Boucher, “Montana,” (the Montana state song) by Joseph Howard, “The Mountain State” by Frank L. and Minnie Kern, and many others. In addition to collecting Montana music, Johnston also sang in a woman’s group and organized historical music programs that performed Montana songs and provided information on their creators and history. Johnston died in 1997 at the age of 94.
John Neill was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on March 25, 1860, the son of the Reverend Edward D. Neill and Nancy Hall Neill. When John was nine, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed his father consul to Ireland and the family moved to Dublin. After three years in Ireland, the family returned to Minneapolis, Minnesota. John graduated from Delaware College in 1881 and studied law at Columbian College in Washington, D.C. In 1883 he moved to Helena, Montana, where he became involved in real estate development. As a reward for his active work in re-electing President Grover Cleveland in 1892, Neill was appointed Surveyor General of Montana in 1895. In 1898, he became treasurer and manager of the Helena Independent newspaper and five years later purchased the paper. In 1909 Neill became a partner in the Montana Rapid Transit Company's ill-fated attempt to build an inter-urban railroad between Helena and Butte. In addition to his business and political activities, Neill was actively involved in numerous projects for Helena civic betterment, including attempts to expand the Mount Helena Park to include the forest land to the west, a plan to create the State Fairgrounds Boulevard along the current route of Henderson Avenue, development of Wesleyan University, and also work for the Democratic Party. In 1883 John Neill married Margaret G. Evans. The couple had one son, George G.E. Neill. John Neill died in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on March 22, 1912. Margaret G. Evans was born March 3, 1862, in Newark, Delaware, the daughter of George Gillespie Evans and Mary Black Evans. After the birth of her son George in 1884, she moved to Helena to join her husband. She became active in the civic life of Helena, serving as the first Democratic National Committeewoman from Montana, spearheading Helena's Red Cross drive during World War I, and working with several Presbyterian Church women's groups. After her husband's death, she became active in developing many of the real estate interests that she had inherited. She died March 6, 1951, in Helena. George G.E. Neill was born in Newark, Delaware, on October 30, 1884, and came to Helena with his mother shortly afterwards. He graduated from Princeton University in 1907. Many of the friendships he formed there continued throughout his life through his active participation in the Princeton alumni association. In 1908 he began working as bookkeeper for the Helena Independent and was promoted to treasurer two years later. After his father's death in 1912, George gave up management of the newspaper and became more active in real estate promotion. He was a partner with Lewis Penwell in the Capital Investment Company. In 1920 he was appointed Receiver of the Helena Land Office and served until 1923. He later formed the Montana Outdoor Advertising Company and the Montana Properties Company. George Neill was married in March 1952 to Martha Morrison who had a son, John Morrison, and a daughter, Mary Morrison Nolte. George G.E. Neill died in Helena on June 3, 1964.
(Carmen) C. Louise Jarussi was born on October 26, 1919, in Columbus, Montana, to Louis and Carmen Jarussi. Her parents immigrated from Rivisondoli, Italy, in 1907. After finishing high school in Red Lodge, Montana, Jarussi attended the University of Montana where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English and speech, with minors in music and French. On June 23, 1943, Jarussi married John Melvin Cross, whom she met during a speech tournament her senior year at UM. John Cross served in the European Theater during World War II, and when the war ended, the couple settled in Helena, Montana until 1952 when they relocated to Glendive. The couple had six children: Melvin, Gregory, Brian, Justin, Mark, and Catherine.
Cross was active in the American Association of University Women, and in local Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she ran for and was elected a delegate to the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention. Her interest in the Convention stemmed from her concerns related to land reclamation and the environmental impact of strip mining in eastern Montana. Cross served as chair of the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee at the Convention—the only woman to chair an Article Committee. Due in large part to Cross’ efforts, Montana’s Bill of Rights contains a constitutionally protected right to a “clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.” It also provides for land reclamation and water rights. The article was challenged in 1991, but the Montana Supreme Court upheld it.
After the Convention, Cross ran for a seat on the Dawson County Commission, but lost. She remained active politically locally, serving as an election judge and working to establish the Frontier Gateway Museum to preserve eastern Montana history. She was the museum’s first curator.
An ardent environmentalist until she died, Cross was a member of organizations such as the Audubon Society, National Wildlife Foundation, and Northern Plains Resource Council. In 1997, she advocated for the protection of Montana’s largest state park, Makoshika State Park from oil development.
On March 21, 2014, two months before her death, Cross and four other Constitutional Convention delegates, Wade Dahood, Jean Bowman, Michael McKeon and Arlyne Reichert, went to court challenging Supreme Court justice candidate Lawrence VanDyke’s eligibility to run, arguing he was ineligible to run under the constitutional requirement that requires an attorney to be admitted to the practice of law in Montana for 5 years prior to election.
Louise Cross died on May 16, 2014. Her husband, John, preceded her in death on January 25, 1980.
On December 21, 1864 Francis M. Thompson introduced into the Territorial legislature, Council Bill 15 to incorporate the Historical Society of Montana, as a private organization. The purpose of the Society was “…to collect and arrange facts in regard to the early history of this Territory…." The bill was signed into law on February 2, 1865. The Society held its first organizational meeting later that month. Among the incorporators were Granville Stuart, H. L. Hosmer, C. P. Higgins, John Owens, and W. F. Sanders. The Society membership was limited to a few prominent Montana pioneers, who had to be elected by unanimous election by the members.
The Society began collecting reminiscences and other memorabilia of the early pioneers. Tragically, these collections burned in the disastrous 1874 fire in downtown Helena. Immediately after the fire, the Society contacted many of the original pioneers and obtained replacement reminiscences, diaries, and letters. They also began the intensive collection of the territory’s newspapers, publications of government expeditions, artifacts, and other items of interest. The collections were housed in the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse from 1886 until the completion of the new Capitol building in 1902.
The early history of the Society was one of a gradual increase in government involvement. In 1873 the legislature appropriated $150 to buy additional manuscripts and books. By 1887 the Territory was paying rent for housing the library and the salary of the librarian. In 1891 the collections were officially transferred to State control. And two years later the Governor was given the authority to appoint the Board of Trustees. In 1895 the legislature changed the name to “The Historical and Miscellaneous Library”. This name was retained until the 1923 legislature restored the original name. Finally in 1963 the name was changed to its present Montana Historical Society.
A separate building for the Society was planned as early as the mid 1920s, but the Depression, World War II, and other factors delayed the building until 1953 when the Veterans and Pioneers Building was completed. In 1951 K. Ross Toole was hired as the first professional director. His major task was to plan for the new building, and the varied programs which it would enable. Among these programs were a formal museum, art galleries, the library, and a magazine.
The original Historical Society of Montana was governed by a five member Board of Trustees consisting of the President, the Recording Secretary, the Corresponding Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Librarian. Beginning 1891, when the state legislature established the Historical Society of Montana as a state agency, the Board of Trustees was appointed by the Governor. In 1949 the Board was expanded to 15 members. From the Board of Trustees, an Executive Board is chosen consisting of the President, Vice President, and three additional Board members.
During most of its existence, the Board has played a secondary role, leaving the active management of the Society to the paid staff. The functions of the Board consist of overall policy decisions, approval of all deeds, leases, and other legal documents executed by the Society, and other duties as set forth in current legislation.

Charles Benton Power was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on November 9, 1868, the only child of Thomas C. Power and his wife Mary Flanagan Power. While Charles was still an infant, his father moved the family to Fort Benton, Montana, where he established a steamboat and mercantile empire. The family moved to Helena in 1878.
Charlie, as he was always known, graduated from Georgetown College in Washington, D.C., in 1888. He got a second bachelor's degree from Columbia College in New York in 1891 and a law degree from Columbia Law School in 1893. He practiced law in Helena for two years, before going to work in his father's enterprises, including T.C. Power and Brother, the American National Bank, and the various ranches. Eventually he took over management of these companies, and became president on his father's death in 1923.
In December 1902, Charles Power married Mabel Larson, niece and adopted daughter of Peter and Margaret Larson. The Powers had three children: Margaret Power Drum Carrick (b. 1904), Benton Power (b. 1907), and Jane Power Tobin (b. 1912). Mabel Power died July 4, 1918. In 1943 Charles Benton Power married Pauline McGuire Ely. He died November 15, 1953, six days after his 85th birthday.

Norman Winestine was born February 15, 1895, in Wassaic, New York, and was raised in Waterbury, Connecticut. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and did post-graduate work in medieval history at Columbia University and at the newly established Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning in Philadelphia. At Dropsie, Winestine studied Semitic language and Judaism. On April 18, 1918, Winestine married Belle Fligelman, daughter of Herman Fligelman, president and one of the founders of Helena, Montana's New York Dry Goods Company. In 1920, while living in Paris, France, Winestine accepted the offer of the position of general manager of the New York Dry Goods Company, popularly known as the New York Store. The store had been founded in 1882, under the name of H. Loble& Co., by Herman Fligelman and Henry Loble, both Romanian immigrants, and Robert Heller, an Austrian. The store was formally incorporated as the New York Dry Goods Company in 1890. When Winestine arrived in Helena in 1920, only Herman Fligelman of the original owners remained, Henry Loble having died in 1913 and Robert Heller having retired in 1920. The New York Store was destroyed by fire in 1928, but under Winestine's direction was rebuilt and renamed Fligelman's. Four years later, in 1932, founder Herman Fligelman died. Fligelman's was sold in 1958 to the J.M. McDonald Company. After moving to Helena, Winestine joined Congregation Emanu-El, a Jewish reform congregation. It had been reformed in August 1889 and a temple building completed in 1890. In April 1890 the congregation hired its first rabbi, Dr. Samuel Shulman of New York. Starting in 1925, Norman Winestine conducted the services on High Holy Days. Due to a decline in membership, the congregation was no longer able to support the maintenance of a temple, and decided to sell the building to the Montana Relief Commission in 1935. Winestine continued to conduct services for the few remaining members of the congregation, until after World War II.
A postcard or post card is a rectangular piece of thick paper or thin cardboard intended for writing and mailing without an envelope and at a lower rate than a letter. The term Postcard refers to cards which were privately produced and were not sold with postage prepaid. Postcards are visual representations of people and places specific to a particular time, providing a record of changes in geography, graphic and artwork styles, social interests, and social concerns.
Deltiology, or postcard collecting, has been a popular hobby since the late nineteenth century. Germany's Heinrich von Stephan invented the concept of the postal card in 1865, and by 1870 postcards were being privately produced in the United States. The issuance of commemorative postcards at Chicago's World Columbian Exhibition (1893) followed by an act of Congress that allowed cards created by private publishers to be mailed at the same rate as government cards (1898) caused an increase in the production and collection of postcards in the United States.
The deltiology community generally divides the production of postcards in the United States into a few distinct eras. Postcards produced in the Pioneer Era (pre-1898) typically contained advertisements and appeared in urban centers in the East. Private Mailing Card Era (1898-Dec. 24, 1901) postcards had undivided backs and a Private Mailing Card logo. During the Undivided Back Postcard Era (Dec. 24, 1901-March 1, 1907), postcards had an undivided back and a Post Card logo. The Divided Back Era (March 1, 1907-1915), also known as the Golden Age of postcards, featured postcards with space on the verso for both an address and a message. Previously, only the address of the recipient was allowed on the verso. This period marks the apex of the popularity of mailing postcards. World War I, influenza epidemics, and the advent of the telephone caused the decline of the postcard after 1915. During the White Border Era (1915-1930), postcards were often produced with white borders around the screened image. The Linen Card Era (1930-1945) reflects a shift in production towards printing on linen card stock, which gave postcards a textured look and feel. Finally, during the Photochrome Era (1945-present), glossy color postcards became favored.
Until the mid-1970s, most cards produced in the United States were the "standard" size, approximately 3-1/2 x 5 inches. The "continental" size, approximately 4 x 6 inches, was a size that was common in Europe earlier than in the United States, but most of the cards sold in the U.S. since the mid-1970s are this size. Super-sized postcards approximately 5 x 7 inches were published more recently.
The printing on color lithograph postcards varies in quality. Most view cards are based on black-and-white photographs with color added. The printing on these cards often has good detail and deep colors. Greeting cards also are colorful and usually embossed, although sometimes the graphics on these cards can be of poor quality.
Bud Lake was born in Virginia. When he was a young boy his father gave him an archaic stone ax head that he found on the family farm. Bud then spent his free time searching the fields for arrowheads. He graduated from college in 1968 with a degree in business management and spent the majority of his career in emergency services. He lived in Arizona during 1980-1990, and worked as 911 director for the city of Santa Fe and Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) in New Mexico from 1993-2011. When he retired, he moved back to Arizona.
In the 1980’s Bud Lake attended the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo and purchased a book about Crow medicine bundles. That was the beginning of his passion to study the Crow Tribe and collect Crow materials including bead work, rawhide items, toys, horse gear, etc. He spent twenty years going to Crow Fair and talking to tribal elders to learn about the history and culture of the Crow people.
Lake received a copy of Willem Wildschut’s manuscript on Chief Plenty Coups (written in the 1920s) and then began to collect photographs that could be used to illustrate the manuscript for publication. He searched auction houses, talked to collectors, used eBay and other online resources, and attended trade shows and conferences. During 35 years of building the collection, Lake amassed more than 1,500 photographs, primarily of Crow Indians and the Crow Reservation taken before 1940. These photographs are part of the Montana Historical Society’s Photograph Archives collection (Lot #35) and are available for use by researchers.
Beginning in 2002, Bud Lake attended and made presentations at Indian seminars and conferences talking about Crow bead work, dress, and insignias, often illustrating his talks with photographs from his collection. He also created and updated a catalog of individuals who took photographs of the Crow people and their reservation. In 2006 and 2010, Lake produced and financed the Crow Indian Art Symposium in Billings where presentations were made on Crow material culture. He was a member of and volunteer for the Chief Plenty Coups State Park at Pryor.
Randy Brewer was born and raised in the Texas Panhandle. He attended college at the University of Tennessee, Wichita State University, and Eastern New Mexico University. Before retirement, he worked as a physician’s assistant. Brewer collaborated with Bud Lake collecting Crow Indian materials.

The photographs in this collection accompanied a report entitled "Report of Investigation of Sanitary Conditions in Mines, and of the Conditions Under Which the Miners Live in Silver Bow County." This report presented the findings of a study of sanitary conditions in below ground and surface workings of the Butte mines, residences in Butte and Silver Bow County, local dairies, and the county hospital or poor farm. This investigation was probably undertaken by county health officials and was an attempt to determine the causes of wide spread incidence of tuberculosis in Silver Bow County. The data was collected during the years 1908-1912.
The Trout Mine was first developed in 1870 by the Cole Saunders Gold and Silver Mining Company. The company's manager James Patten later formed his own company the Patten Mining Company and operated the mine in the early 1900s. During World War I, the Western Ore and Mining Company produced manganese from the mine. The Trout Mining Company was incorporated under Illinois law in 1922. It was re-incorported under New Jersey law in October 1924 and operated the mine until October 1936. In September 1936 the American Machine and Metals Manufacturing Corporation merged with Trout to form American Machine and Metals Inc. The Trout Mine became the Trout Division of the new company. The new company was headed by P.G. Mumford, while the Trout Division was managed by Charles A. Hyder. In 1947 and again in 1950 the Trout mill burned. In January 1958 a new Trout Mining Company was incorporated to take over the operation of the mine. It became inactive in 1963, though the charter did not expire until 1993.

The Helena Produce and Commission Company was a wholesale outlet dealing in hay, grain, potatoes, flour, feed, butter, cheese, and eggs from 1887 to 1891. It was managed by Daniel Welch and originally located on the corner of Edwards and Clore streets, Helena, Montana.
The office of Superintendent of Public Instruction was created by the 1872 Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly to replace the older office of school commissioner. The Montana Constitution of 1889 made the office elective and defined its functions. In 1959 the Montana Legislative Assembly created the Department of Public Instruction to administer the office under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
The United States Congress passed the Johnson-O'Malley Act in 1934 to provide funding for public school districts on Indian reservations. The payments were in lieu of taxes to compensate for the tax exempt reservation lands. Until 1946 financial arrangements were made between the local Indian agency office and the local school board. In 1946 the Division of Indian Education was established within the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to negotiate contracts directly with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Gradually BIA schools were abandoned in favor of local school board-controlled schools. Starting in 1964 Public Law 874 regulated most of the funding of reservation schools, and Johnson-O'Malley funds were used primarily to fund special projects. Among the supervisors of Indian Education were Knute W. Bergen, William C. Howard, Earl J. Barlow, Dorrance D. Steele, and Robert W. Parsley. In addition superintendents Mary M. Condon, Harriet E. Miller, and Dolores Colburg handled much of the division's affairs directly. From 1975 to 1977 Bill Yellowtail served as assistant supervisor.
The early days of medicine in Montana are discussed by physicians, nurses, nurse educators, emergency medical technicians, and lay health care providers.
John Jacob Thompson was born near Toronto, Canada, in 1862. He moved to North Dakota at the age of twenty-two and then to Great Falls, Montana, in 1890. There he worked as a clerk at the Park Hotel and in a laundry. Thompson established the Great Falls Produce Company in 1893, and operated the business until 1899, when he sold it and established another of similar nature. In 1899 he purchased the Rock Springs coal mine near Sand Coulee. Thompson married Sarah Travers of Owens Sound, Canada, in 1896. The couple had two children, Stewart and Anita. Sarah Travers had two sisters, Margaret Ginste of Dillon, Montana, and Anna of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Great Falls, Montana. John Jacob Thompson died in 1906, and Sarah Travers Thompson died in 1907.
Stewart McKinley Thompson was born in 1896. He attended Great Falls High School and graduated from Montana State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in Bozeman with a degree in electrical engineering in 1921. His wife's name was Maude. Stewart Thompson died in mysterious circumstances near the Canyon Ferry power plant, where he worked, in 1923.
Anita Travers Thompson graduated from Great Falls High School in 1919, attended Montana State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts from 1919 to 1921, and graduated with a B.S. in pharmacy from the University of Michigan in 1924. She was certified as a registered pharmacist in Montana in 1927, at which time she resided in Jordan. She moved to Tacoma, Washington, in 1929, and worked for Pay Less Drugs from 1932 until at least 1968.
The Montana State Highway Commission was created in 1913 by the state Legislative Assembly. The original Commission was composed of three members. In 1917 new legislation altered the organization of the Commission by authorizing the appointment of twelve members according to geographic highway districts. Membership was changed again in 1921 to three members appointed by the Governor and in 1941 to five members, also appointed by the Governor. In 1971 the Commission was renamed the Montana Department of Highways, created by Chapter 7 of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 and implemented by executive order of the Governor on December 16, 1971. The Department of Highways took over all but the advisory functions of the State Highway Commission.
By 1972, the Department consisted of seven divisions: the Legal Division, Personnel Division, Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division. Each division is headed by an administrator. The Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division are furthered sub-divided into bureaus, headed by Chiefs. In 1991, the Department of Highways became the Department of Transportation. This was primarily a name change. However, there were some structural and administrative changes.
The Highway Department, the Department of Highways, and Department of Transportation maintained regional offices in the five commissioner districts: Billings, Butte, Glendive, Great Falls, and Missoula. The District Engineer (later called the District Administrator) was the chief administrative officer in each district office. District office files document the activities of the district administrators, engineers, maintenance crew, and other district office employees. The district offices addressed administrative, functional, and project related issues of their particular area, including: highway needs, current construction projects, HR/training for employees, road design, federal and state aid and grants, reports to the Department of Highways/ Department of Transportation in Helena regarding general maintenance, construction, and area concerns, etc. District administrators held meetings every 6 weeks. Other employees in the district and area offices also attended duty-specific meetings with outside district staff members; including maintenance crew meetings, engineer meetings etc., in order to maintain consistent communication among the districts and with other state agencies regarding programs, projects, and district goals. The files in the district office were kept by the District Engineer/Administrator.
The Helena Woman's Club was formed in 1896 with the purpose of providing its members "intellectual advancement and mutual improvement". Club sponsored programs focused on art, literature, music, biographies, and history. Speakers for these programs included community leaders and club members. The first officers elected were Mrs. E. Sharpe, president; Mrs. W.R. Sanders, vice president; and Mrs. E. F. Wilson, secretary/treasurer. Membership was limited to twenty ladies. New members were elected by the full membership whenever a vacancy occurred. A small number of honorary members were also allowed who could participate in meetings but not vote on officers or membership. The Helena Woman's Club became a member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs in 1901, and a member of the Montana Federation of Women's Club in 1904. The club worked on various civic enrichment projects over the years including offering scholarships to young musicians from the local schools, and serving on the board of the Restoration Committee for the Original Governor's Mansion. The Woman's Club conducted fundraisers to purchase the blue silk damask curtains for the master bedroom in the Governor's Mansion. The club currently meets once a month.

The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day. The first State Legislature convened on November 23, 1889, fifteen days after Montana became a state. Each following Legislature has been numbered sequentially.
The 35th Montana Legislature met from January 7th to March 7th, 1957. The leaders of the Senate were Paul Cannon (D-President), David James (D-President Pro Tempore), David James (D-Majority Leader), and Donovan Worden (R-Minority Leader). The leaders of the House were Eugene Mahoney (D-Speaker), John MacDonald (D-Speaker Pro Tempore), Fred Barrett (D-Majority Leader), and R.F. Juedeman (R-Minority Leader).

To oversee and coordinate this effort, the Montana Women's Bureau was created within the Employment Relations Division in 1974. In addition the Montana Advisory Council on Women was created.
The first Bureau Chief was Sue Bartlett, who served in that post until replaced by Joan Duncan in 1975. Joan Duncan remained in that position until 1981. The Women's Bureau served as a clearing house for access to information regarding grants, discrimination, occupational education and training, sexual harassment, child and health care, and other issues of special interest to female employees. The Bureau published a newsletter, provided job hunting information, produced weekly television news spot, sponsored seminars, conducted surveys, and served as a resource library.
The Bureau lost its funding during the 1981 Legislature after extensive debate over funding shortfalls and possible duplication of services within the Department of Labor.
The Butte Miners' Union (BMU) was established in Butte, Montana, in March 1885, a result of the reorganization of the seven-year-old Butte Workingman's Union. The BMU fought for a minimum wage for miners and a closed shop. With chartered branch affiliates in Granite, Neihart, Castle, and Champion, BMU members took the lead in the establishment of the Western Federation of Miners in 1893.
The Scandinavian Fraternity of America was founded in 1915, as a consolidation of three other organizations, including the Scandinavian Brotherhood. The first convention was held that year in Chicago, Illinois. Like many similar ethnic organizations of the early 1900s, the Scandinavian Fraternity was principally a beneficial group to aid its membership when threatened by sickness, unemployment, or death. It also had a separate category of social members. The organization was open to both women and men, and to their non-Scandinavian spouses. The national organization declined in membership during the 1970s and 1980s.
Capital City Lodge No. 253 of the Scandinavian Fraternity of America was founded in Helena about 1926. It continued to operate until about 1977. The Kalispell Lodge No. 233 (originally the Three Leaf Clover Lodge No. 233) was founded in November 1924. It continued in existence until sometime after 1990.
"Helping to ensure that Montana's land and water resources provide benefits for present and future generations" is the mission of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC). First established in 1971 as a result of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971, the DNRC provides leadership in managing the state's natural resources. It is presently responsible for promoting the stewardship of Montana's water, soil, forest, and rangeland resources; for regulating forest practices and oil and gas exploration and production.
Nine boards and commissions are attached to the department. Six of them—the Board of Land Commissioners, Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission, Board of Oil and Gas Conservation, Board of Water Well Contractors, Flathead Basin Commission, and Montana Grass Conservation Commission—have decision-making authority. The other three—the Resource Conservation Advisory Council, Rangeland Resources Committee, and Drought Advisory Committee—act in an advisory capacity only.
The department is organized into seven divisions: Director's Office, Conservation and Resource Development Division (CARDD), Forestry, Oil and Gas Conservation, Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission, Trust Land Management, and Water Resources. Two of the divisions—the Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission—are attached to the department for administrative purposes only.
The Water Resources Division promotes and coordinates the beneficial use, conservation, protection and development of Montana’s water resources.
The Division carries out its duties for the purpose of promoting the general welfare and prosperity of the people of Montana. Sound coordination of the development and utilization of the state’s waters allows the Division to protect existing uses and to promote adequate future supplies for domestic, industrial, agricultural, recreation, the conservation of water for wildlife, aquatic life and other beneficial uses.
The Water Resources Division is responsible for many programs associated with the uses, development and protection of Montana's water. It manages and maintains the state-owned dams, reservoirs, and canals. The division also develops and recommends in state, interstate, and international water policy to the director, Governor, and legislature. The division consists of eight regional offices and five bureaus: Water Management Bureau, Water Rights Bureau, Adjudication Bureau, State Water Projects Bureau and the Water Operations Bureau.
The 2003 Legislature attached the Flathead Basin Commission to the department for administrative purposes. The Commission is charged to protect the natural resources and environment of the Flathead Basin.
William Simonton Bell was born Feb. 13th, 1894, in Harrisonburg, Virginia. He entered the Polytechnic College of Pennsylvania in January of 1867, graduating with a degree in ministry in June of 1869. Mr. Bell came to Helena, Montana, in 1887 to assume leadership of the Congregational Sunday School and Congregational Home Missionary Society. In 1907 Mr. Bell was hired by the Montana Historical Society to replace Laura Howey as head librarian. He served in that capacity for three years. He then transferred to Spokane, Washington, to become an ordained minister for the Presbyterian Synod of Washington. William married Mary Amelia Kingsbury in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on October 4, 1887. The couple remained in Sioux Falls for a short time, but moved to Helena later in the year. The couple had their first and only child, Martha Bell, on January 18, 1894. William S. Bell died in Baltimore, Maryland, May 23, 1920 Martha was educated in the Helena area grade schools, but completed high school in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She earned a masters degree from Columbia University and a certificate of library science from Simmons College. She served as librarian for many university colleges across the country, but retired from Randolph-Macon Woman's College after 35 years of service. Martha Bell never married. She died on her 102nd birthday, Feb. 13th, 1997, in Roanoke, Virginia.

They were especially interested in the possibility of irrigating the agricultural lands along the Yellowstone River between Glendive and Miles City. The Association's organizers began corresponding with other states that had similar irrigation projects. After raising $6,000 from Custer, Prairie, and Dawson County residents, the group subsequently obtained funds under the National Industrial Recovery Act for a Bureau of Reclamation investigation on the proposed Buffalo Rapids Irrigation Project. Based upon the Bureau's report, the 18,000-acre Glendive Unit (Division No. 1) was organized in 1937, and received a $1,600,000 federal allotment. Construction began that same year on the main canal and work was completed in 1941. Construction of lateral canals was completed two years later. In 1939, a second division of the project, encompassing the Terry, Fallon, and Shirley Units along the Yellowstone's south bank and consisting of 11,600 acres, was approved under the Great Plains Act. However, due to the shortage of materials during World War II, construction of the Fallon Unit was stopped altogether and work on the other two units was permitted only to the extent that materials became available. The Shirley and Terry Units were completed in 1944, but it was not until August 1945 that War Production Board controls on new construction were lifted, and contracts were awarded for the Fallon Unit.
The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was formed as the Conductors' Brotherhood, in 1868. The first convention was held that fall in spite of a threat by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad to fire any conductor who joined. The 1878 convention formally changed the name to the Order of Railway Conductors of America. The national headquarters were established in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. During its early years the order was primarily a fraternal and benevolent association. Beginning in 1885 the Order began negotiating with the railroads concerning wages and working conditions. It also began lobbying Congress to pass hours legislation.
In 1954 the Order changed its name to the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen, in recognition of the long-standing practice of accepting Brakemen into the order. In 1969, the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen merged with three other Brotherhoods to form the United Transportation Union.
The Black Eagle local of ORC was founded in 1894 and remained active through 1963.
Richard Hanners began his manuscript after being hired as an industrial electrician for an aluminum smelter in Columbia Falls, Montana in February 1997. He received a history degree from the University of Montana in 1991. Before moving to Columbia Falls, he worked for a historical research company in Missoula, working primarily with computer databases. Hanners created his own database where he gathered thousands of records on the Columbia Falls aluminum plant for his manuscript.
This manuscript covers the history of aluminum, aluminum production and the aluminum smelter in Columbia Falls. Summary: In 1886, aluminum smelters began cropping up following the discovery of a process (called the Hall-Heroult process) which permitted large scale aluminum production. One of the most prominent aluminum companies in the United States was the Pittsburg Reduction Company, which later changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America, later shortened to Alcoa. By 1930, Alcoa produced and sold nearly 100% of all the aluminum electric transmission cabling in the U.S. By 1941, Alcoa was the only primary aluminum producer in the U.S. After World War II, as the result of a lawsuit, the federal government owned most of the U.S. aluminum industry, thus breaking up the Alcoa monopoly. In 1952, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company (later the Anaconda Company) announced that they would build a new aluminum plant in Columbia Falls, Montana. Fluoride emissions from the smelter polluted the surrounding area, resulting in a lawsuit against the Anaconda Aluminum Company in 1970. By the mid- 1980s, the Anaconda Company’s smelter in Anaconda, along with copper mines in Butte, closed down. In 2009, smelter operations shut down and in 2013 polluted soil around the smelter plant was detected by a EPA contractor. In 2015, Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (formerly the Anaconda Aluminum Company), announced the permanent closure of the aluminum plant in Columbia Falls. The property was placed on the Superfund’s National Priorities List in 2016.
The 1864 Organic Act created Montana Territory and provided a basic government structure for the new territory, including a territorial governor, secretary and three judges appointed by the president of the United States, and a territorial legislature and non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives elected by eligible voters in the territory. The act called for the legislature to meet annually for 40 days, except for the first legislature, which was granted a 60 day session. The territorial governor was to decide the date and places of the first election, apportion the members of the two houses and choose the date and place for the first legislature to meet. Thereafter, the legislature itself was to decide dates for future elections and legislative sessions and apportion seats.
After conducting a census of the territory, which he used to apportion the 7 seats of the Territorial Council and 13 seats of the House of Representatives, Territorial Governor Sidney Edgerton held the first territorial election on October 24, 1864. The first territorial legislature met from December 12, 1864 through February 9, 1865. They passed nearly 100 bills, but did not apportion seats in the legislature for future elections. The legislature contained an even distribution of Republicans and Democrats. Edgerton, a Republican, insisted that members of legislature swear to the "Iron Clad Oath," which included a statement that they had never borne arms against the U.S. Government. J. H. Rogers could not swear to the oath and was forced to resign his seat, creating immediate tension between Edgerton and the members of the legislature.

James Fergus was born October 8, 1813, in Lanarkshire, Scotland. At the age of nineteen he emigrated to Quebec and, three years later, to the United States. He lived in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota where he built and managed saw mills, powder mills, a foundry, and a paper mill, and invested in property. James Fergus married Pamelia Dillin in Moline, Illinois in 1845. The couple had four children: Andrew (b. 1850), Mary Agnes, Luella (married Stephen Collins Gilpatrick), and Lillie (married Frank H. Maury). While in Minnesota in the late 1850s, Fergus became involved in politics and ran for office. In March 1860 he journeyed to Pike's Peak where he unsuccessfully prospected for gold until he returned to Minnesota in September 1861. In the spring of 1862 Fergus traveled with the Fisk Expedition to the Beaverhead gold mines near what was to become Bannack, Montana Territory. Moving to Virginia City in 1863, Fergus had modest success in finding gold. He was elected to serve as judge of the first miners' court and as the city's first recorder, and was appointed the first county commissioner for Madison County. Fergus' family, including his recently married daughter Mary Agnes and his new son-in-law Robert Stavely Hamilton, joined him in Virginia City in 1864. Fergus moved to Helena in 1865, where he engaged in ranching and was elected to two terms as county commissioner and one term in the territorial House of Representatives. Fergus' son Andrew was much involved in the ranching business; he officially bought (for one dollar) one-third of the stock in 1878, and, in 1879, acquired one quarter of James Fergus' property, livestock, and farm machinery. In 1880 James and Andrew Fergus bought land in the Judith Basin on Armells and Box Elder Creeks, and Andrew started ranching there. James Fergus and his wife Pamelia joined Andrew the next year. Eventually they raised cattle, horses, and sheep, and also did some farming. The ranch operation became one of the biggest in the territory, operating first under the name of James Fergus and Son (established in 1879) and later as the Fergus Live Stock and Land Company (established in 1895). James Fergus was elected as a delegate from Meagher County to the 1884 Constitutional Convention and to the territorial Council where he was instrumental in the creation of Fergus County. Pamelia Dillin Fergus died in 1887. James Fergus died in 1902. Andrew Fergus married Hazel Akley in 1910 and continued to ranch at Armells until his death in 1928.

In 1959 Governor Hugo Aaronson vacated the 1888 Queen Anne Mansion at 304 Ewing Street, and moved to the new Executive Mansion at 2 Carson Street. Originally, the Helena Chamber of Commerce undertook the historic preservation and restoration of the old mansion. Soon however, Helena Mayor Dave Lewis and the City Commission negotiated for the Mansion to be leased to the City of Helena so that it could be restored and maintained as a historic museum. To oversee this effort, in 1969 Mayor Lewis appointed the Governors' Old Mansion Restoration Committee. The committee consisted of the following people: Mr. Joe A Maierle (Chairman), Mr. John Schroeder (Co-Chairman), Mr. George Schotte, Mr. Lester Loble II, Mrs. Sherman W. Smith, Mayor Dave Lewis (Ex-Officio member), Mrs. Tim Babcock, Mrs. Sam C. Ford, Mrs. Forrest Anderso, Mrs. Fred Gannon, and Mrs. J.R. Kaiserman.
In 1969, the Legislative Assembly appropriated thirty-five thousand dollars towards initial repairs of the building; these funds were used to restore the exterior. To supplement these funds, the City of Helena filed an application with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for a Historic Preservation Grant, and the Committee worked to secure funds from donors around the State. The Committee and the Chamber also introduced a bill into the 1971 Legislative Assembly for an additional thirty-nine thousand dollars to match Federal funds to complete the restoration at a cost of seventy-eight thousand dollars.
By 1980 the City of Helena was unable to continue management of the Mansion financially. The State terminated the lease to the city and the Montana Historical Society (MHS) took responsibility for restoration, maintenance and management of the Mansion. The Mansion Committee continued to function as the policy and management authority, consistent with the overall policies of the MHS, while the Governors' Original Mansion Restoration Society Board's primary function was to act as a fund-raising entity and sponsor annual events to raise money. The Secret Garden Tour, created in 2005, is now the main fund raising effort of the Original Governor's Mansion Restoration Society Board (now called the Governors' Original Mansion Restoration Society Advisory Council), a volunteer group of Montana citizens dedicated to OGM restoration projects.
Libby Lumber Company, with home offices in Minneapolis, Minnesota, had its principal place of business in Libby, Montana. The firm was incorporated as a retail outlet. In 1916 Libby Lumber Company sold its property to Libby Yards Company which was incorporated to sell merchandise, property, and real estate,, and to operate a general manufacturing and contracting business. Libby Yards had retail operations in many Montana communities including Madoc, East Scobey, Antelope, Froid, Plentywood, Gilman, Great Falls, Kevin, Beaverton, Scobey, Shelby, Brady, Big Sandy, Conrad, Valier, Redstone, Sunburst, Cut Bank, Glendive, Homestead, and Saco.
In 1921 Monarch Lumber Company took over the preferred stock of Libby Yards Company. Monarch Lumber Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware listing its principal place of business in Great Falls, Montana. The first meeting of the company's board of directors was held in 1921 in Minneapolis.
Building Service, Inc. was formed in 1933 at the first meeting of its board of directors in Great Falls. At that meeting it was determined that Building Service, Inc. would purchase stock "now owned or controlled by the Monarch Lumber Company and used in the conduct of its wholesale business," thus becoming the wholesale outlet for Monarch Lumber Company. The main warehouse for Building Service, Inc. was in Great Falls. Employees for the company included Russell (Ben) Wallace, manager; G.H. Rogers and P.V. Eames, presidents in the Minneapolis office; Roy Forney and Gordon F. Mick, managers of the Billings branch warehouse; and F.D. Wilson, assistant treasurer in Great Falls. Building Service, Inc. was liquidated in 1961 when the company sold all its assets to the Boise Cascade Corporation.
Daniel Webster Slayton was born in Steuben County, New York, on November 6, 1862. He attended school in Fairfax, Virginia, where his family lived following the Civil War. Slayton travelled to Montana Territory in 1884 and worked at the Ford sheep ranch near White Sulphur Springs and, later, in a lumber camp near Martinsdale. In 1885 Slayton and his brother Dalon claimed range land near Lavina, Montana. They began raising sheep on a share agreement with the Ford ranch and eventually acquired large herds of sheep and extensive property holdings. Slayton also owned the Slayton Mercantile Company and had interests in the Lavina State Bank and the Citizens State Bank of Roundup. Slayton was a Republican. He served on the Fergus County Board of Commissioners and was elected from that county to the Montana House of Representatives in 1911, and to the Montana Senate from Musselshell County in 1917 and 1919. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for governor in 1920. Slayton married Elizabeth (Lizzie) Ellis of Fairfax, Virginia, on November 8, 1887. The couple had five children; Lydia, Daniel E. (born March 15, 1891), Bert, Ernest, and Ruth. Daniel Webster Slayton died in Lavina on September 8, 1927. Lizzie Ellis Slayton died in 1940.
The Morris State Bank was opened in Pony, Montana, in 1902, with a capital stock of $50,000. The bank moved into a newly constructed building in early 1903. William W. Morris was president of the Morris State Bank until his death in October 19O4. Thomas Duncan served initially as vice president and then succeeded to the presidency in 1905. Following his death that same year, Mary B. Elling became president. Charles E. Morris served as a director in 19O2 and became vice president in 1905. Cashiers for the bank included Philip H. (Harry) Gohn and Fred G. Smith. Other officers included M. M. Duncan, a Virginia City attorney, who served as a director, and Henry J. Schreiber who was a vice president beginning in 1904. By June 1906, the Morris State Bank had achieved deposits in the amount of $200,000 and was conducting business with banks in Montana and throughout the country. A close business relationship existed with the Elling State Bank of Virginia City and the Union Bank and Trust Company of Helena, whose president was George L. Ramsey. The Montana banks were members of the Montana Bankers Association which issued warnings about fraudulent customers in the state and informed banks of pending legislation effecting the banking industry in the state. The officers and directors of the Morris State Bank were businessmen and active members of the Pony community. Several businesses were connected to the bank through these people. Henry Elling and William Morris were partners in Elling and Morris, which had a quartz mill and an electric light plant. Charles E. Morris and James A. Flint, an attorney, were partners in Morris and Flint, a real estate and insurance business, with an office in the Morris State Bank building. Harry Gohn was president of Citizens Telephone Company. Fred Smith was a notary, trustee for the board of education, an insurance agent, and mayor of Pony in 1911. Henry Schreiber ran a mercantile company and served as treasurer for the city. The Morris State Bank closed and went into voluntary liquidation on February 1, 1926. At that time the board of directors borrowed $96,000 from the Elling Estates Company so that all depositors could be paid. The bank then came under the jurisdiction of a liquidating agent.
The Territory of Montana was created by the U.S. Congress on May 26, 1864. In 1866 a constitution was written by Montana residents, but it was never submitted to Congress. Then, in 1883, the Thirteenth Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Montana authorized an election in November 1883 to select delegates to attend a constitutional convention in Helena the following January. Delegates were elected from existing counties and judicial districts. William A. Clark was elected president of the convention. The 1884 Constitution was approved by popular vote of territorial residents. However, this constitution did not receive approval of the U.S. Congress because the majority in Congress belonged to the Republican Party and the voters of Montana Territory had elected primarily Democratic officials. On February 22, 1889, President Grover Cleveland signed enabling legislation known as the Omnibus Statehood Bill providing for constitutional conventions to be called on July 4, 1889, in Montana, Washington, and North and South Dakota territories. The 1889 Constitution, based largely on the earlier effort in 1884, was approved by Congress and Montana became the forty-first state on November 8, 1889.
The Montana Mercantile Company of Dillon, Montana, was incorporated by J.H. Burfeind, O.M. Best, D.T. Chapman, Leonard Eliel, M.L. Davidson, W.A. Jones, and Frank Eliel on January 4, 1893. The company was capitalized at $75,000. These men served variously as the firm's officers. In 1902 M.L. Davidson was president, W.A. Jones was vice-president, and O.M. Best served as secretary-treasurer. In 1910 W.A. Jones was president and O.M. Best secretary. The company's charter of incorporation was extended by W.A. Jones in December 1912. In 1921 Leonard and Frank Eliel, president and secretary respectively, of the Montana Mercantile Company, increased the capitalization of the firm to $150,000. The directors of the corporation at the time of the increase also included Samuel Fay Erwin as treasurer, A.I. Cashmore, and Adolph Eliel. The company's board of directors petitioned to dissolve the corporations in November 1943. During the 1930s the Montana Mercantile Company operated a grocery store, a feed mill, seed and fertilizer retail outlet, and haying operations serving ranchers, farmers, and dairymen in Dillon, Butte, and the Big Hole and Beaverhead valleys.

A native of Pennsylvania, born in 1818, John Owen first came to what is now Montana as a sutler for Colonel Loring's Oregon-bound column. In 1850, he purchased the site of St. Mary's Mission from Jesuit missionaries, and there built his trading post, Fort Owen. Owen operated his post as a trading center for white trappers and Indians of the area, and his fort also served as a way station to an increasing influx of settlers. Fort Owen contained the first commercial grist mill in the area and served other important functions. In 1856, because of his special relationship with the Flathead Indians, Owen was appointed special agent to that tribe and its affiliates. He held this position until 1862. Owen's mind began to fail in the early 1870s, and he was hospitalized in Helena until 1877, when he was transferred to the care of relatives in Philadelphia. He died there on July 12, 1889.
In 1893, the Montana State Legislature authorized the creation of the Montana State School of Mines in Butte, Montana, for the purpose of offering engineering education. The school opened for classes in September 1900 and admitted both men and women. Nathan R. Leonard presided as the first president of the School of Mines. Originally, the school offered two degrees in the areas of mining engineering and electrical engineering.
In 1918, the school was renamed the State School of Mines. In 1919, the Montana Legislature enacted a bill creating the State Bureau of Mines and Metallurgy. The president of the school served as head of the Bureau.
In 1921, George W. Craven became president of the school. Born in Last Chance Gulch in April 1871, Craven obtained a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked at several mining companies before joining the faculty at the School of Mines in 1905. He became the school's first vice-president in 1919, and in 1921, he succeeded C.H. Clapp as president. Craven served as president until 1928.
Over the years, the school adjusted curricula and degree offerings to suit the demands of the time. Graduate degrees were offered beginning in 1929. During World War II, the School of Mines participated in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and provided training for hundreds of Naval officers. The school also underwent a series of name changes. In 1965, it became the Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, and then in the 1990s, it became Montana Tech of the University of Montana. As of 2021, the school's name is Montana Technological University.
The Little Ben Quartz Lode, located south of Harlem, Montana, was first discovered on January 1, 1892, by Robert M. Orman, and contained gold and silver and other precious metals. On August 17, 1893, Orman discovered the August Quartz Lode just north of the Little Ben. In April 1901 Orman deeded his interests in the Little Rockies Unorganized Mining District to Louis V. Bogy, in trust for Thomas C. Power and his heirs. The claim included the Little Ben, the Surprise, and the August. In February 1908 the claims were sold to Louis Goslin, who in turn deeded the properties to the newly incorporated August Mining Company in 1909. The federal government granted claims to the August and Little Ben mines in 1912. The next recorded change in ownership came in the early 1930s when the company was sold to Norman B. Holter of Helena, who reorganized the property as the Little Ben Mining Company. The new company was incorporated on June 3, 1932, with a capital stock of 120,000 no-par value shares. The directors of the company were T.B. Weir, George T. McGee, and James T. Finlen. John J. Mitchke served as the company's secretary-treasurer. The company kept offices in both Helena and Landusky and held over 540 acres of patented and unpatented claims. In 1933 the Little Ben Mining Company increased its capital stock to $600,000, divided into 120,000 shares with a par value of $5.00 each. Managers of the company's mines through the years included Frank B. Bryant, Frank H. MacPherson, P.A. Wickham, and G.C. Worthington. In 1940 the company began to encounter financial problems and in June 1942, all operations at the mines ceased. At that time the Board of Directors held a special meeting with the stockholders and their proxies and authorized the disposition of the property and assets of the corporation. Liquidation was started with the first of three payments to stockholders issued in December 1942. The final payment was issued in October 1944.
The Montana State Board of Hail Insurance was established under SB 16 by the 1917 legislature. The Board was composed of the State Auditor, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Publicity, and three members to be appointed by the Governor from a list submitted by the various organized farmers' societies. The law, however, did not appropriate funds for the Board, instead providing that operating funds would be deducted out of insurance premiums collected along with November taxes. This meant there was no money for the Board to begin functioning. Attorney General Samuel Ford advised the Board to begin operation without funds while waiting a decision on the constitutionality of the law. The Board got over this initial hurdle and has provided the state's farmers with low cost hail insurance over since.
The Legislature established the Department of Public Welfare in 1937, consolidating state welfare activities. The Department was responsible for the administration of all forms of public assistance, including general relief programs and supervision of institutions caring for the dependent, delinquent, or mentally or physically handicapped. In 1971 the Department of Public Welfare was abolished and its functions assumed by the newly created Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS). The SRS assumed the functions of various state agencies, including functions pertaining to vocational rehabilitation and education; the Commission on Aging; and the Council on Human Resources. The SRS administered all forms of public assistance, child protection, and child welfare; gave consultant service to private institutions providing care for the needy, indigent, handicapped, or dependent; developed provisions for services to the blind; supervised county boards of public welfare; and administered all funds allotted for public welfare activities. State government reorganization in 1995 combined the SRS with portions of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences to form the Department of Public Health and Human Services.
Stanley J. Morrow was born in Richland County, Ohio, on May 3, 1843, and moved to Wisconsin early in his childhood. In 1861, he joined the 7th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry as a drummer. Morrow was then transferred into the Veteran Reserve and was stationed at Point Lookout Prison in Maryland as an assistant to renowned Civil War photographer Matthew B. Brady. Brady instructed Morrow in photography and the wet plate process, which Morrow used throughout his career.
Upon exiting the war, Morrow married Isa Ketchum, and the couple moved to Yankton, Dakota, around 1868. Morrow established a photography gallery there and taught Isa the photographic process. When Morrow was away, Isa ran the gallery to fund his photographic expeditions.
In 1876, Stanley Morrow met soldiers returning from General George A. Crook’s expedition in pursuit of the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne. Morrow photographed soldiers reenacting scenes from the starvation march back to the Black Hills and from the Battle of Slim Buttes, and photographed Sioux warriors captured in battle. Morrow became post photographer at Fort Keogh in 1878 and later that year opened a gallery at Fort Custer. In April 1879, while working as photographer at Fort Custer, he accompanied Captain George K. Sanderson and a company of the 11th Infantry on an expedition to Little Bighorn Battlefield to clear the field of animal bones and remark the graves of fallen soldiers.
Stanley Morrow returned to Yankton in 1880, photographing local events including the Great Flood of 1881.When Isa fell ill in 1882, the couple moved to Florida. Stanley J. Morrow died in Dallas, Texas, on December 10, 1921.
The Montana State Highway Commission was created in 1913 by the state Legislative Assembly. The original Commission was composed of three members. In 1917 new legislation altered the organization of the Commission by authorizing the appointment of twelve members according to geographic highway districts. Membership was changed again in 1921 to three members appointed by the Governor and in 1941 to five members, also appointed by the Governor. In 1971 the Commission was renamed the Montana Department of Highways, created by Chapter 7 of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 and implemented by executive order of the Governor on December 16, 1971. The Department of Highways took over all but the advisory functions of the State Highway Commission.
By 1972, the Department consisted of seven divisions: the Legal Division, Personnel Division, Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division. Each division was headed by an administrator. The Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division were furthered sub-divided into bureaus, headed by Chiefs. In 1991, the Department of Highways became the Department of Transportation.
The Maintenance Division oversaw general maintenance throughout the entire Department of Highways/Transportation including flood mitigation and damage repair, installing and maintaining road signs and Montana’s recognized Historical Highway Markers, managing public complaints about road conditions, as well as other maintenance-related projects. The Maintenance Division also worked closely with the district offices, overseeing the districts’ maintenance projects.

The Montana Board of Railroad Commissioners was established by the Montana legislature in 1907. In 1913 the Board of Railroad Commissioners was made ex officio the newly created Montana Public Service Commission. As such, it was given the authority to regulate a variety of public utilities. In 1971 the Montana Board of Railroad Commissioners was abolished and its work was taken over directly by the Public Service Commission.
The Montana State Legislature is made up of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Montana limits the size of the Senate to no fewer than 40 and no more than 50 members and the size of the House of Representatives to no fewer than 80 and no more than 100 members. Each house is responsible for choosing its officers, creating committees and establishing its own rules. The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day. The first State Legislature convened on November 23, 1889, fifteen days after Montana became a state. Each following Legislature has been numbered sequentially.
The 9th Montana Legislature met from January 2nd to March 2nd, 1905. The leaders of the Senate were Edwin Norris (D-President), and Benjamin White (R-President Pro Tempore). The leaders of the House were Wyllis Hedges (R-Speaker), and Marcus Hewett (R-Speaker Pro Tempore).

Carston Conrad Kohrs was born in Wewelsfelth, Holstein, Germany, on August 5, 1835, the son of Carston and Gesche Krause Kohrs. His father, a distiller and brewer, died when Conrad was only seven weeks old. His mother married Claus Bielenberg in 1844. In 1853 Kohrs settled in the United States and learned the meat packing trade. He joined the California gold rush in 1857, and worked a claim near Eureka, before continuing his search for gold on the Frazer River in Canada. He returned to the East, but in 1862 he crossed the plains to Salt Lake, and from there ranged north to the Big Hole and Deer Lodge valleys of what is now Montana. Although he had intended to prospect for gold Kohrs was hired as a butcher and it was in this trade that he found success. He soon began supplying miners and other butchers with meat.
On August 23, 1865, Kohrs bought John Grant's ranch and cattle in the Deer Lodge valley. Kohrs and his half-brother John N. W. Bielenberg are credited with initiating the practice of open-range grazing in central Montana when they moved their herd from Deer Lodge to the Sun River in 1870. By the late 1880s Conrad Kohrs' Pioneer Cattle Company, incorporated in January, 1885, was one of the largest cattle raising operations in the Northwest. In the mid-1910s the Pioneer Cattle Company sold its livestock and retained only the ranches which were run by Bielenberg through the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company until his death.
Kohrs was also interested in mining. In the spring of 1867 he joined with some partners to form what was to become the Rock Creek Ditch and Mining Company. After locating water rights on Rock Creek, the company constructed a ditch and dam in 1870, and sold water to nearby miners. Kohrs bought another ditch opened by the Atlantic Cable Mining Company in 1868, and began the Pioneer Placer Mining Company near Pioneer in 1870. Ownership of the latter company was transferred to the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company in 1923.
Kohrs operated the Deer Lodge ranch and many of his business concerns, including his real estate holdings, in partnership with John Bielenberg. The Kohrs and Bielenberg Realty Company was formed in 1906, with Conrad Kohrs, John Bielenberg, and Kohrs' son-in-law O.Y. Warren as directors. A major holding of the Kohrs and Bielenberg Realty Company included the Higgins Block in Missoula. Another Kohrs-owned business was the Conrad Kohrs Company whose assets included the Treacy, Beveridge, Kohrs, Brazier, and Denver blocks in Helena, as well as the Pioneer, Holland, and Robecker ranches and other properties.
By 1908 most of the Kohrs and Bielenberg ranch, mining, and real estate interests were incorporated as the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company. This holding company was organized in June 1908 with four directors and stockholders: Conrad Kohrs, John Bielenberg, Edward Scharnikow of Deer Lodge, and Conrad's wife Augusta. The Conrad Kohrs Company was a primary stockholder. Samuel McKennan, Kohrs' friend and president of Helena's Union Bank and Trust Company, replaced Kohrs as director of the Conrad Kohrs Company after his death; Anna Boardman, Kohrs' daughter succeeded John Bielenberg. Kohrs and Bielenberg Realty was sold to the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company in 1909 and was dissolved in 1919. The Pioneer Placer Mining Company was sold to the holding company in 1923. In 1930 the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company charter of incorporation expired, and its holdings were transferred to the Conrad Kohrs Company.
On February 23, 1868, Kohrs married Augusta Kruse (1849-1943), a German immigrant who had come to the United States in 1866. They had three children: Anna Catherine (1868-1924), Katharine Christine (1870-1958), and William Kruse Conrad (1879-1901). Conrad Kohrs died on July 23, 1920. John Bielenberg died on June 16, 1922. In 1972 Kohrs' grandson, Conrad Kohrs Warren (b. August 16, 1907) sold the home ranch and outbuildings and 216 acres to the National Park Service, which created the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site.
John N.W. Bielenberg was born in the Duchy of Holstein on May 1, 1846, to Claus and Gesche Krause Kohrs Bielenberg. He immigrated to Davenport, Iowa, with his parents in 1854. In 1864 he moved to the Deer Lodge valley of Montana Territory where he became associated with Conrad Kohrs in ranching. In 1909 he was elected to the Senate of the Montana Legislative Assembly from Powell County. He was director of the Union Bank and Trust Company of Montana in Helena and one of the original directors of the Deer Lodge Bank& Trust Company of Deer Lodge.

This oral history project documented the economic recovery programs initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s. These Depression-era programs - including the Work Projects Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and the resettlement Administration - played a significant economic role in the state of Montana, which was listed as second in per capita receipt of New Deal dollars during the Depression. A large portion of the interviews focused on the lives of the workers involved in the Fort Peck Dam project, including cultural and social life in the area.
James A. Flint was born on May 28, 1867 in Westminister, Vermont, the son of James Johnson Flint and Ellen Susan Marcy Flint. At the age of 21, Flint entered the Kansas University at Lawrence where he earned a law degree. During the 1890s, he opened a law office in Lawrence and practiced there until 1899 when he began travelling. In the fall of 1900 Flint came to Butte, Montana, but stayed less than a year leaving the following spring for Pony, where he established a law office. Shortly thereafter, he entered into a partnership with Charles Morris under the name of Morris and Flint, a firm specializing in mining, real estate, assaying, and insurance. In 1902, Flint was appointed by the Department of the Interior to succeed A.W. Noyes as U.S. Land Commissioner for Madison and Gallatin counties. Flint served in this position for nearly fifteen years. Flint was an active member of the Pony community taking an interest in school issues and serving on the town council. From 1928 to 1943 he operated a law office in Three Forks. Flint retired in 1944 and died on September 2, 1956.
The Socialist Party of America was formed in 1901 by a merger of the Social Democratic party of America and portions of the Socialist Labor Party. In 1903, socialists in Montana elected the mayor, treasurer, police judge and three councilmen in the city of Anaconda. With that impetus, the Socialist Party of Montana spread rapidly, predominantly in Butte and other industrial towns, but also among farmers in many small communities. By 1912, there were members of the party in sixty-seven Montana communities. In 1911, Butte elected a Socialist city government, headed by Mayor Lewis Duncan. With the industrial turmoil in Butte, and with the coming of World War I, the party declined rapidly after 1917.
Alpha Tau Delta is a professional fraternity for persons in collegiate nursing. It was founded February 15, 1921, at the University of California and was incorporated the same year. Through the years more than 30 college chapters were organized.
The purposes of Alpha Tau Delta were: to further higher professional standards for the nursing profession; to inaugurate projects that strengthen the specific field of professional nursing; to develop character and leadership, encourage high ethical standards of professional conduct in which members may develop sound professional philosophies; to encourage excellence of individual performance and develop the highest possible scholastic attainments; to organize the social life of its members as a contributing factor in their educational program, and maintain an intrafraternity spirit of cooperation; and to form a close bond of friendship, fellowship, mutual helpfulness, and understanding among college students in the nursing profession.
Authorized college chapters conferred membership in the fraternity. There were two chapters at Montana State University: Lambda Chapter for academically qualified undergraduate nursing students, and Lambda Pi Chapter for alumnae.
The original charter for the Lambda Chapter was issued to Montana State College on April 27, 1940, when initiation and installation of members also took place. The first annual meeting appears to have been held on June 2, 1956. Divisions of Alpha Tau Delta were organized in Butte, Billings, Bozeman, and Great Falls. In 1982 Alpha Tau Delta was replaced at Montana State University by Montana's Zeta Upsilon Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau.
Lambda Pi Chapter was organized in 1963 with stated purposes: to inaugurate projects that enrich the individual alumnae and specific fields of professional nursing; to assist Lambda Chapter in their stated purposes; and to provide stimulation and guidance to Lambda Chapter. The alumnae chapter elected its own officers and held quarterly meetings.
In response to a perceived threat to the farm and grazing lands of Montana, the 1939 state Legislative Assembly created a State Soil Conservation Committee to "conserve soil resources and control and prevent soil erosion." The committee was composed of seven members, including the director of the state agricultural experiment station, the director of the state extension service, one members of the state grazing commission, one member of the water conservation board, and the commissioner of the state department of agriculture. Two additional members were to be farmers chosen by the governor. The primary duty of the Committee was to supervise and offer assistance to the soil conservation districts established around the state. Soil conservation district could be established by any ten occupiers of land within a given area where there was a need and interest in soil conservation. Conservation districts were considered a government office and were to study soil erosion, educate the public, and take active measures to correct erosion. In 1961 the name of the State Soil Conservation Committee and the name of the conservation districts were changed to reflect the addition of water conservation to their duties. The soil and water conservation districts were to monitor water conservation as well as soil erosion. The name was again changed in 1971, to the State Conservation Commission. Following the reorganization of state government in 1972, oversight of conservation districts was moved from a commission to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. The Conservation District Bureau currently oversees conservation districts and operates in the Conservation and Resource Development Division of the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation.
Michael Reinig, founder of the Reinig Company, was born in Deidesheim, Bavaria, on March 31, 1835, the son of Jacob and Frances Reinig. He learned the baker's trade in his home town and then as a young man left for New York, where he joined an expedition heading for California by way of Havana and the Isthmus of Panama. From California, Reinig traveled to Oregon and Washington. In 1865 he left The Dalles, Oregon, and traveled to Helena, Montana Territory, by way of Spokane and Deer Lodge. He almost immediately went to work for the San Francisco Bakery on State Street and a few months later bought the business. He gradually expanded the operation to include a boarding house and a grocery on the corner of State and Joliet Streets, and eventually added a stable on Warren Street, a coffee business, and a saloon in East Helena. In 1904 Michael decided to take a trip to visit his birthplace in Germany. As part of his preparations he incorporated as the Reinig Company. Management of the company was given to William C. Bardon, who also continued to operate the company after Reinig's death. The store ceased business c. 1958.
In 1869, Michael Reinig married Matilda, a Norwegian native who had come to the United States at age three and had moved to Helena in 1868. They had a son Charles N. Raunig (b.1871) and a daughter Anna (b.1873). Michael was a Mason and was active with the Harmonia Gesang Verein, a German club in Helena. Michael Reinig died September 19, 1909, and Matilda Reinig died June 23, 1934.
Their son Charles N. Reinig was born March 22, 1871. He studied dentistry in Pennsylvania and then practiced in Latin America for several years. He returned to Helena in the mid-1890s and became a partner with Gus Ehrenberg in the Montana Cycle Company and clerked in his father's store until 1900 when he moved to Seattle. After Michael Reinig's death Charles N. Reinig served as president of the company until 1935, but continued to reside in Seattle. He died September 29, 1958, in Winslow, Washington.
William C. Bardon was born in Florrisant, Missouri, June 2, 1870. He moved to Helena in 1889 and went to work as a delivery boy for the Reinig grocery. He gradually rose in the business until he took over management of the store in 1900. He continued to serve as vice-president and manager after Mike Reinig's death in 1909. He became president after Charles N. Reinig resigned in 1935. Bardon, along with other Helena merchants, formed the Merchants Delivery Company as a cooperative arrangement to share delivery services. On September 11, 1907, William married Anna, daughter of Michael and Matilda Reinig. William Bardon died January 24, 1955, and less than four months later his wife Anna died on May 17, 1955.
William Eicke was born in Leibnau, Hanover, Germany in 1828. At the age of 18 he moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and worked as a baker. There he married and had one son. In the Civil War he refused to join the Confederate forces and was imprisoned in Richmond. He bribed his way out and left for California. Leaving his wife and infant son there he joined Michael Reinig at The Dalles, Oregon, and later in Helena. In California his wife heard that he had been killed by Indians at The Dalles and remarried. Eicke worked for the Reinig store and lived with the Reinigs for forty years. He died June 1, 1911.
Most members of the Montana Archaeological Association tended to belong to the Montana Archaeological Society as well, but the MAA being entirely made up of professional archaeologists, they were able to concentrate their efforts onto more specialized areas of interest. Some of the major causes undertaken by the MAA include the Native American Free Exercise of Religion Act, the Burial Bill Act and the Montana Antiquities Act among others. The MAA worked diligently to sponsor laws and to create guidelines for the ethical issues relating to archaeological work. The group worked closely with the Montana State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and in 1991 MAA and SHPO co-sponsored the first annual Archaeology Week in the state of Montana. This recurring event quickly became an important staple in the promotion of public awareness and education relating to local archaeology.
The Montana Archaeological Association found it increasingly difficult to continue its lobbying activities and sponsorship of the Archaeology Week program while relying strictly on volunteers. In 1996, the MAA, having never officially incorporated itself as an organization under Montana state law, elected to dissolve and to delegate all of its interests and activities to the MAS. Since the membership of both groups overlapped, the transition was smooth and the Montana Archaeological Society assumed all responsibility related to the sponsorship of Archaeology Week, as well as a more pronounced role in the political lobbying that had been such an important facet of the MAA. The two groups officially merged together after members approved the decision at their annual spring meetings in 1996.
The Montana State Board of Health was established in 1901. In 1967 the Legislative Assembly created the State Department of Health. The State Board of Health continued in an advisory capacity, but the day-to-day administration of the state laws regarded public health and related matters were relegated to the new department. The State Board of Health became The Department of Health and Environmental Sciences in 1971 with the passage of Governor Anderson’s Executive Reorganization Order 9-71. In 1991, though it remained a part of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, the role of the Environmental Sciences Division was considerably expanded to include: Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Board, a Superfund Section, and an Underground Storage Tanks Section.
The Environmental Sciences Division eventually became its own separate department, renamed the Department of Environmental Quality, in 1995, comprised of the following divisions: Director’s Office, Air Quality, Centralized Services, Energy, Environmental Remediation, Reclamation, Waste Management, and Water Quality.
The public health-related functions of DHES meanwhile fell under the umbrella of a new agency, The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), which, at the time of its creation, was comprised of the following divisions: Child and Family Services, Child Support Enforcement, Disability Services, Health Policy and Services, Mental and Addictive Disorders, Operations and Technology, Quality Assurance, and Senior Support Services.
The DHES Director’s Office was, and is, responsible for administering the various programs overseen by the agency, and drafting and enforcing appropriate policies and procedures throughout all organizational units of the agency.
The Montana Legislative Council was created by the 35th Legislative Assembly in 1957. The Council was composed of six members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House and six members of the Senate appointed by the Senate Committee on Committees. No more than three appointees from each house were to belong to a single party. Appointees served for the length of their term of office or December 31 of the following year, whichever came first. The Council was given the responsibility to "accumulate, compile, analyze, and furnish such information bearing upon matters relating to existing or prospective legislation as may be determined by its own initiative pertaining to important issues of policy and questions of statewide importance...." e.g., consolidation of state bodies, financial administration, efficiency in government, etc. The Council was also to prepare "such bills and resolutions as in its opinion the welfare of the state may require," and present these to the succeeding regular session of the legislature. The Council was given the authority to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and cause depositions of witnesses to be taken. A primary function of the Council is to undertake research, usually on topics assigned by a joint resolution during the previous legislative session but also on topics the Council determines are important. In most cases the Council appoints a subcommittee composed of legislators and/or, less commonly, private citizens which assumes the primary responsibility for directing staff research. Subcommittees submit their findings, recommendations, and legislation to the full Council which may reject, amend, or accept them. All subcommittee reports adopted by the Council are published and distributed before the legislative session. In addition to conducting studies on specific topics, the Legislative Council staff is available to legislators and standing committees during the legislative session to prepare reports and draft bills on any subject of interest to legislators. This service was inaugurated in 1959. In the same year the Council was designated the Montana Commission on Interstate Cooperation whose purpose is to advance cooperation between Montana and other units of government. The Council also maintains a reference library and answers requests for information "in every possible area." In 1973 the Council was reduced in number to four members from each legislative house who served for two years. In addition, a Committee on Priorities, composed of four members of each legislative house, was established to consider resolutions requesting Council studies and other study requests, prepare a list of priorities, and perform other duties. In 1973 the Council was given the responsibility to publish all laws and resolutions passed or adopted by each session, prepare indices for them, and distribute copies to various agencies and repositories. Executive directors of the Council include Eugene C. Tidball, 1957-1965; Donald L. Sorte, 1965-1969; James W. Van Koten, 1969-1971; Rose E. Weber, 1971-1979; and Diana S. Dowling, 1979-1986.
During the early years of the New Deal in the 1930s, water conservation funds became available to the states from the federal government. To take advantage of this opportunity, a special session of the Montana Legislative Assembly convened in late 1933 and created the State Water Conservation Board to channel both state and federal money into small irrigation projects. An individual farmer who wanted to build and irrigation facility petitioned the Board and, if his proposal was accepted, the Board built the project and the farmer reimbursed the state. By 1952, the State Water Conservation Board had built 173 projects throughout the state.
In 1965 the Board assumed the functions of the State Engineer and the Carey Land Act Board. In 1967 the Montana Water Resources Board was created to assume the duties of the State Water Conservation Board, and to coordinate all water resource development programs around the state. Other duties included the administration of weather modification laws and the preparation of a comprehensive inventory of the state's water resources and a multiple use water plan for the state.
In 1971, as part of the general reorganization of state government, the Water Resources Board was abolished and its functions taken over in 1972 by the Water Resources Division of the Department of Natural Resources and by the Board of Natural Resources and Conservation.
The Carey Land Act Board was the successor to the State Arid Land Grant Commission [RS 31]. The Board was set up by the 1903 Legislative Assembly, after the Commission was abolished. The bill authorized the Board to undertake projects for reclaiming land granted to the state under the federal Carey Land Act of 1894. Initially the Board was restricted to completing three projects begun by the Arid Land Grant Commission: District 1 near Billings, District 2 near Big Timber, and District 4, known as the Dearborn Canal. The 1905 Legislative Assembly expanded the objectives of the Board, allowing it to undertake new projects. Among these new projects were the Bynum Project, the Conrad-Valier Project, the Teton Project, and numerous smaller projects. The Carey Land Act Board was abolished in 1965 and its duties transferred to the State Water Conservation Board.
Thomas Teakle was born on April 14, 1878, in Scotland, Iowa. He was educated in Iowa schools and received a degree from the Iowa State Teachers Normal School in 1904, and a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa in 1910, majoring in history and political science. In 1911 Teakle moved to Idaho to be principal of Pocatello High School. He returned to Des Moines, Iowa, the following year and taught high school there until 1919. He also wrote a book, The Spirit Lake Massacre, which was published in 1918. In 1919, Teakle returned to the West, this time to teach history at Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Washington. He retired from this position in 1946 at the age of 68.
Following his retirement, Teakle began collecting historical data from newspapers in Oregon, Montana, and Idaho, typing articles dealing with pioneer life, mines, range life, Indian life, railroad development, etc. These typescripts were arranged by subject and bound. The volumes were donated to Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, by the terms of Teakle's will. Teakle also collected published books concerning cowboy and range life, the collection numbering more than 1000 volumes. This book collection was donated to the Montana Historical Society in Helena following Teakle's death.
Teakle was also very active in organizing the Spokane Posse of The Westerners organization and served the group in a variety of capacities. In 1967 Teakle was awarded the title of "Historian Emeritus" by the Eastern Washington Historical Society. Teakle died in Spokane on June 24, 1969.
The Conrad-Stanford Company was incorporated in October 1902, in Helena, Montana, by William G. Conrad, James T. Stanford, and Thomas Curry in order to buy the assets of the First National Bank of Helena and the Merchants National Bank from receiver Eugene T. Wilson. These assets included uncollected accounts and notes, many town lots in the Helena area, several houses, and several large mining and ranching properties, including the Spokane Ranch and Water Company, the Beaver Creek Ditch Company, and the Crevasse Mountain Mining Company. The purchase of these assets in November 1902 formed the basis for the Conrad-Stanford Company's wide-ranging real estate business. William Muth served as the company's agent. Most of the property obtained from the banks was sold, but selected ranch and mine properties were retained and operated for several years. In 1911, the Conrad-Stanford Company ventured into the banking business, organizing the Conrad Trust and Savings Bank. The Conrad-Stanford Company ceased its Helena real estate business in 1915 and voluntarily liquidated the bank in the early 1920s.
Grace Vance was born around 1873 in LaGrange, Iowa, the daughter of Andrew M. and Ellen Cooper Vance. She received a degree in literature from the University of Michigan. She moved to Choteau, Montana, in the mid 1890s to work as a teacher. In June of 1898 she married John E. Erickson, a Choteau attorney. The couple moved to Kalispell in 1915. John E. Erickson served two full terms as Governor (1924-1933) and, following his re-election to a third term, resigned to replace Thomas J. Walsh, in the U.S. Senate. He was replaced by James W. Murray in 1934. Grace Vance Erickson was active in the Democratic Party, the Montana Natural History Association, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Presbyterian Church. She was an active amateur historian, anthropologist and archaeologist and was involved with the preservation of historic sites. She died July 16, 1962.
Alice Melvina Narveson was born in Alstad, Wisconsin, on December 8, 1889, the first child of Knute and Julia (Holt) Narveson. About 1907 Alice began working for her uncle T. J. Anderson's boarding house in Belgrade, Minnesota. After studying secretarial skills at night school she was promoted to bookkeeper for her uncle's department store. Alice met Oswald Edwin Susag, a fellow employee, and they were married October 18, 1911.
In 1916, Oswald Susag homesteaded 160 acres of land 16 miles south of Scobey, Montana. Alice, the couple's two small children, and Alice's sister and brother moved to the homestead in 1917. During World War I, Alice and her neighbors organized a Ladies Aid Society to sew bandages for the Army.
Oswald and Alice Susag raised wheat and oats of their dryland farm and also ran the Kahle post office. The Susags were able to maintain their farm through the drought and depression by supplementing their income by selling butter and eggs in Scobey. The Susags retired from active farming in the late 1950s and their son Ralph took over management of the farm.
Oswald Susag died on January 28, 1971. Alice continued to live on the farm until moving to Scobey in 1979. She died in Scobey February 5, 1987, at the age of 97. [based on biographical sketch by daughter Pearl Susag Craft and son Ralph Waldo Susag.]
The Society for Industrial Archaeology was founded in October of 1971 in order to "bring together [those] who share a common interest in the archaeology of industry, engineering and technology." SIA's North American headquarters are at the Department of Social Sciences at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan. Montana's SIA chapter is named after Frank Klepetko, metallurgist and designer of Montana's two largest smelters - the Washoe Reduction Works in Anaconda, and the Boston and Montana Smelter in Great Falls. The Klepetko Chapter was established on February 22nd, 1986; it was the first SIA chapter west of the Mississippi. Among the officers elected at this inaugural meeting were President Mark Fiege, Vice President Fred Quivik, Secretary/Treasurer Dale Martin, Program Coordinator Mary McCormick, and Newsletter Editor Arthur Dolman. Since its inception, the Klepetko Chapter has had a consistent membership of around 50, produces a semi-annual newsletter, and visits historically significant industrial sites around the state at least once a year. Both the national organization and the state chapter also offer process tours of operating industrial facilities like sawmills, hydroelectric plants, gold mines and mills, oil refineries, and sugar beet processing plants. The Montana Chapter is dedicated to documenting, preserving, and interpreting historical industrial sites and artifacts.
James Hamilton Mills was born in New Lisbon, Ohio, on December 21, 1837. In April 1861, at the age of 23, Mills enlisted in Company G of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Reserves (Fortieth Pennsylvania Infantry). Through the course of some 27 engagements, Mills was promoted from private to brevet lieutenant colonel before he was mustered out of service in June 1864. On May 24, 1866, Mills traveled from Omaha, Nebraska, to Helena, Montana, arriving on August 12. He initially joined in a company attempting to open a hydraulic claim at Emigrant Gulch, but the effort had to be abandoned because of a lack of provisions. Following this venture, Mills moved to Virginia City, where he was offered the position of editor of The Montana Post. He remained with the Post in Virginia City and Helena until the paper failed in July 1869. At that time, he moved to Deer Lodge and opened the offices of The New Northwest, a newspaper he published and edited until November 1891. James Mills was a lifelong Republican and many times filled important appointed positions. In 1884, he was appointed secretary of the territory by President Hayes. Five years later, after declining nomination to attend the state constitutional convention, Mills accepted the duties of collector of internal revenue for the Montana-Idaho-Utah district, a position he held until February 1893. During the following four years, he served as commissioner of the state Bureau of Agriculture, Labor and Industry. In addition, he was the appointed receiver to the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1895 and to the Helena Consolidated Water Company in 1897. James H. Mills died on September 5, 1904.
Chinese Americans in Butte
Chinese immigrants first came to Butte, Montana, in great numbers in the late 1860’s, attracted by work in placer gold mines and later by railroad construction projects. By the late 1880’s, nearly 2,500 Chinese Americans reportedly resided in Butte, and by the early 1900’s, Butte’s Chinatown had become well-established. As the gold mining boom ended and the railroads were completed, Butte’s Chinese were forced out of their jobs by discriminatory laws and ordinances meant to discourage cheap labor. In addition, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barred Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States. By the 1890’s, Butte’s Chinese residents were turning to work in the service industry.
One of the first Chinese districts in Butte arose in the Galena-Mercury neighborhood between Colorado and Arizona streets. Here, Dr. Huie Pock practiced Eastern medicine and ran a mercantile, while numerous other Chinese Americans operated general stores, laundries, noodle parlors, and herb shops. The early Chinese in Butte held onto much of their cultural heritage. They built places of worship, and many retained the dress and traditions of their homeland. In addition, they embraced some new world institutions, such as the Chinese Baptist Mission, established on Mercury Street in 1892. Some Chinese businesses thrived during this period despite growing hostile sentiment toward Chinese immigrants. However, during the first quarter of the 20th century, the Chinese population in Butte began to decline as Chinese Americans sought work in larger cities like San Francisco with flourishing Chinatowns.
By the early 1940’s, the population of Chinese in Butte had dwindled to just a few families. One of these families was the Chinn family. Albert (Yu Fong) Chinn had immigrated to America by 1912, settling in Butte with his wife, Lou, and daughter, Katherine. Albert became a merchant and by 1930 he had fathered nine children. He lived with his family at 21 West Mercury St. The Chinn family retained ownership of what are today two of the last remaining and best-preserved buildings of Butte’s Chinatown: the Wai Chong Tai Company building (15 West Mercury) and the Mai Wah Noodle Parlor building (17 West Mercury). William Chinn, a son of Albert Chinn, owned the buildings in the 1940’s, and rented the ground floor of 17 West Mercury to Paul Eno. Eno ran a lock and repair shop out of the building from late 1940’s until his death in 1986. His parents were Martha and Edgar Eno.
Martin D. Hudtloff family
Martha Eno and her family, the Hudtloff’s, moved to Butte from Wisconsin in the early 1890’s. Martha married Edgar Eno in 1901, and the couple had five children: Paul, Edward, Florentine, William, and Helen. Upon Edgar’s death in 1946, Martha moved to Vancouver, WA, to live with her son, Edward.
Martha’s brother was Martin D. Hudtloff. In 1893, Hudtloff began serving as pastor of the new St. Mark German Lutheran Church in Butte, a position he would hold for over 40 years. The congregation laid the cornerstone for their present church at the corner of Silver and Montana streets in June 1907. Martin was married to Julia Detloff, the daughter of Prussian immigrants William and Wilhelmina Detloff. Martin and Julia had five children: Walter W. G. (1894-1916), Arthur G. (1895-1968), Esther H. (1898-1950), Dorothy (1900-1908), and Martin J. (1902-1969). Dorothy died of spinal meningitis at age seven, and Walter died of a lingering illness at 22.
Arthur G. Hudtloff attended a year at the University of Montana (1914-1915). By 1916, he had moved to Seattle to study at the University of Washington, and was residing next to the campus at 4339 11th Ave NE. After graduation, Arthur served for some time in the U.S. Navy, and rose to at least the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. He later moved to Tacoma, Washington, where he became the first superintendent of schools in the Clover Park School District in Lakewood, Washington. A middle school in Lakewood, Washington, a suburb of Tacoma, now bears his name.
Esther Hudtloff married Lloyd Sowders and settled in Detroit.
Martin J. Hudtloff graduated from the University of Montana and moved to Washington, D.C., where he served as Director of the Transportation Service Division for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Martin died in 1969 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
Julia’s mother, Wilhelmina Detloff, lived with the Hudtloff’s in Butte after her husband William died, and later settled in Spokane, Washington, with her nephew, George Detloff, and his family.
The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation Conservation Districts, Bureau, under the guidance of Linda Brander, developed the From the Ground Up Oral History Project in 2012 as a way to highlight the role of women in agriculture and conservation as an essential thread in the fabric of Montana's settlement and history. Working with local DNRC conservation districts, the program works with students, educators, and community leaders, providing training and guidance to local residents,520 teachers, and students as they prepare to conduct interviews. Interviews are then conducted with women in the local agricultural community.
Interviewers also included local conservation district administrators, and oral history project director Linda Brander. For more information on the project, please visit the Conservation Districts Bureau page on the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation website.
Dr. Richard Buswell was born in Helena, Montana on January 24, 1945 to Howard and Agatha Virginia Arnaud Buswell. He graduated from Helena High School in 1963, publishing some of his early photographs in the Nugget, the Helena High School newspaper. Between 1963 and 1966 he attended Carroll College, graduating magna cum laude with a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Biology. He earned his medical degree from Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland in 1970. A year later he purchased his first camera, a Nikkormat, and began taking photographs of Montana ghost towns, mining camps, and homesteads. In 1974 he married Sue Ann Vinkovich, and the couple would have three children: Erica, Stephanie, and Timothy. Dr. Buswell has presented over thirty solo and group exhibitions across the nation. He has also published several collections of his photographic work, including a book entitled, "Echoes: A Visual Reflection."
Lee Silliman was a high school physics, chemistry, and mathematics instructor for forty-three years. He was also the part-time photo archivist for the Powell County Museum and Arts Foundation in Deer Lodge for twenty-six years. He began his work with photography in 1979, and built his own darkroom in 1983. Silliman has assembled and circulated fifteen different exhibitions that have been displayed in more than ninety institutions throughout Montana and ten other states since 1988.
Leverett S. Ropes was born in Ishpeming, Michigan, on July 21, 1868, the son of Julius and Eunice Rouse Ropes. Julius Ropes was a drug store owner and chemist, who did analytical work for many of the Ishpeming region's mines. He was also the developer of the Ropes Mine, a gold property. Leverett Ropes studied mining geology under his father's tutelage and then attended Michigan College of Mining and Technology, graduating in 1893.
Leverett Ropes' early professional work was in the field of corundum mining and milling. He spent several years in North Carolina and Georgia and a year in Comberemere, Ontario, working with corundum. Using this experience he secured employment with the Montana Corundum Company to develop their mine near Gallatin Gateway. However, his real goal was to move to Montana to get into the quartz mining industry. During the next few years he worked for a number of different mining companies in Montana including the Montana Coal and Coke Company at Gardiner, the Jardine Mining Company at Jardine, the Bald Butte Gold Mining Company at Marysville, the Bullion Mine at Basin, and the Alta Mine at Wickes. In addition to his mining work Ropes worked on the construction of Mystic, Lake Dam near Bozeman and Hauser Dam near Helena. He also served briefly as a mineral inspector for the U.S. General Land Office from 1908 to 1910, and for the U.S. Forest Service in the fall of 1930.
In 1910 Ropes began doing private consulting work in partnership with Robert McIntyre. He incorporated under the name Intermountain Engineering-Development Company in 1919 to seek outside capital to finance Montana mining ventures. In July 1928 Ropes lost all of his mining records, reports, correspondence, survey notes, etc. in the fire which destroyed the Bailey Block and several other buildings in downtown Helena. Since his ability to interest investors in Montana mining properties was based on his extensive knowledge of these properties, the loss of his records crippled his work. During the 1930s and 194Os he gradually rebuilt his files, based partly on memory and partly on re-examination of many properties.
Leverett S. Ropes married Eleanor Husk Deal of Franklin, North Carolina, on December 12, 1894. The couple had four children: Dorothy, John, Judith, and Leverett. Leverett S. Ropes died on May 27, 1953.
James Upson Sanders was born on July 12, 1859, in Akron, Ohio, the first of five sons of Wilbur Fisk Sanders and Harriet Peck Fenn Sanders. In 1863, the family moved overland to Bannack, Idaho Territory. James Sanders attended public schools in Helena, Montana, and then, in 1878, went with his younger brother Wilbur to Phillips Academy at Exeter, New Hampshire. In 1881, he attended law school at Columbia. After graduating in 1884, he returned to Montana and joined his father's law firm. Sanders practiced law thirty-eight years. Upon his retirement in 1922, Sanders became librarian of the Montana Historical Society. He also served as secretary of the Society of Montana Pioneers for twenty-six years. James U. Sanders died as the result of an automobile accident on April 17, 1923.
The 1864 Organic Act created Montana Territory and provided a basic government structure for the new territory, including a territorial governor, secretary and three judges appointed by the president of the United States, and a territorial legislature and non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives elected by eligible voters in the territory. The act called for the legislature to meet annually for 40 days, except for the first legislature, which was granted a 60 day session. The territorial governor was to decide the date and places of the first election, apportion the members of the two houses and choose the date and place for the first legislature to meet. Thereafter, the legislature itself was to decide dates for future elections and legislative sessions and apportion seats.
After conducting a census of the territory, which he used to apportion the 7 seats of the Territorial Council and 13 seats of the House of Representatives, Territorial Governor Sidney Edgerton held the first territorial election on October 24, 1864. The first territorial legislature met from December 12, 1864 through February 9, 1865. They passed nearly 100 bills, but did not apportion seats in the legislature for future elections. The legislature contained an even distribution of Republicans and Democrats. Edgerton, a Republican, insisted that members of legislature swear to the "Iron Clad Oath," which included a statement that they had never borne arms against the U.S. Government. J. H. Rogers could not swear to the oath and was forced to resign his seat, creating immediate tension between Edgerton and the members of the legislature.

Alexander McKay was an early miner and pioneer in the Alder Gulch, Montana, area. He was born on May 15, 1832, in Glasgow, Scotland, and immigrated to the United States in 1854. The McKays spent their first years in this country in the South. In the late 1850s they moved to the Denver area following mining opportunities. They then moved to Bannack, in what was to become Montana Territory, with the first gold rush in 1862. In July of 1863, with the gold discoveries in Alder Gulch, McKay moved from Bannack to Virginia City. The following year, he moved on to Bivens Gulch where he purchased numerous mining claims with his Alder Gulch earnings. His Biven's Gulch claim employed up to 15 men at its height. He invested his mining fortune in farm lands in the Madison Valley, settling his family in Virginia City. The family did well in Virginia City. Alexander McKay participated as a life long Republican in local politics and economic development. In 1889 Mr. and Mrs. McKay moved to the Old Sarge Hall grist mill, near Sheridan, Montana. They remained at that site until their deaths.
In 1860 Alex McKay was married to Caroline Hanson in Kansas. Their first child, Flora, was born in 1861 near Denver, Colorado. In 1863, their second child Mary, was born in Virginia City. Flora and Mary attended Virginia City grade schools, then attended Iowa State College, where Flora received a degree of medicine and Mary a degree in music and art. Flora married Dr. C.A. McNulty in 1884. She later recieved a doctor of science degree from the Women's Medical College of Chicago, and a Master of Arts from Iowa College in 1893. Both Mary and Flora spent most of their lives in the Virginia City-Sheridan area and were very active in local social and religious organizations. Upon the death of their father, they helped Caroline McKay manage the family estate.
Alex McKay died in 1922. Caroline Hansen McKay died in 1917. Flora McKay McNulty and Mary McKay [Herhold, Bothwell] Swayze died within weeks of each other in 1945.
Andrew Braid Cook was born on February 2, 1864, in Dundee, Wisconsin, the son of Cornelius and Margaret A. (Braid) Cook. After finishing his education in the public schools of Racine, Wisconsin, Cook attended the Spencerian Business College in Milwaukee and then became a bookkeeper for Charles J. Russell's coffee business in Milwaukee.
In 1883 he moved to Montana, where he held a variety of jobs over the next few years. He worked briefly shipping cattle for the 79 Ranch, as a clerk in the Blue Front Store in Billings, as a mule-skinner for a survey party on the Crow Indian Reservation, and as baggage master for the newly opened Northern Pacific Railroad office in Helena. He gained experience in railroad building working for Hugh Kirkendall and Peter Larson and for W.H. Guthrie and Company, including building the Wickes tunnel on the Montana Central Railroad south of Helena.
In 1889 he opened a real estate office in Missoula, in partnership with Frank W. McConnell. After McConnell, Cook and Company dissolved in 1892, Cook continued the business under his own name. He continued to manage his Missoula real estate holdings for the rest of his life, while devoting his major attention to his other occupations.
A.B. Cook was elected Montana State Auditor in 1892 and served one term. While serving as State Auditor he also established his own railroad construction business in partnership with Martin Wolfson. They negotiated a contract with the Northern Pacific to build a spur to the Parrot Smelter at Whitehall. Around 1905, Cook's Montana Concrete Construction Company got contracts in Livingston, Dillon, and Bozeman to do sidewalk work. He built the dam and irrigation canal system at Bynum Reservoir for the Teton Cooperative Reservoir Company.
As Cook, Deeks, and Hinds, and as the Toronto Construction Company he worked on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In 1912 under South Dakota law, he incorporated the Cook Construction Company with Alexander McKenzie and L.L. Stephens. They opened an office in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a branch office in Montreal, Canada. Among the contracts this company obtained were the building of the Montreal Aqueduct, and the rebuilding of the Halifax, Nova Scotia, terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, following a freighter explosion in 1917. The Cook Construction Company dissolved in 1921.
A.B. Cook, however, was best known as a Hereford cattle rancher. In 1907 he bought the Flying U Ranch at Bynum from F. Augustus Heinze and began to develop the prize-winning Hereford cattle herd which became the passion of his later life. He bought the beginnings of his herd from the John Wellcome Estate in Waterloo, Iowa. With the herd came George Sim who oversaw Cook's breeding program for many years. Around 1912, Cook moved his cattle operation to the Missouri River Valley north of Townsend. He bought three ranches there: the Dunleavy and Rorvig ranches near the outlet of Confederate Creek, and the Bedford Ranch on the west side of the river. He later added Sheep Ranch in Meagher County, the Newland Creek Ranch, the Hevey Ranch, and several smaller pieces. During the 1910s he also was a partner with Alexander McKenzie in the Stiles Cattle Company which had extensive holdings on the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota. In October 1928, after losing a major lawsuit, Cook was forced to sell his herd. He died a month later on November 24, 1928.
In April, 1908, A.B. Cook married Mary Morgan Pettingell, a native of Bowling Green, Kentucky. While quite young Mary had married Frank Hervey Pettingell, with whom she had two children: Frank Hervey and Mary Agnes. That marriage ended in divorce. A.B. Cook adopted Mary's children, giving them his last name. The Cooks had one daughter Gloria, born in 1916.
Frank Hervey Cook was born in 1899 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, graduating in 1919. He assisted his adopted father on the ranch, and on the death of A.B. Cook operated the ranch on a smaller scale. In 1931 he married Lena (Sally) Gosnell Finley, heiress of the Gosnell oil fortune. She died of a heart ailment August 5, 1933. With the flooding of much of the Cook ranch property by Canyon Ferry Reservoir in 1953, Cook moved the Dunleavy house to the Bedford Ranch north of Townsend. Frank Hervey Cook was murdered there, in an apparent robbery attempt, on November 22, 1970.
Norman Winestine was born February 15, 1895, in Wassaic, New York, and was raised in Waterbury, Connecticut. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and did post-graduate work in medieval history at Columbia University and at the newly established Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning in Philadelphia. At Dropsie, Winestine studied Semitic language and Judaism. On April 18, 1918, Winestine married Belle Fligelman whom he met in Washington, D.C., while working for the Hoover Food Administration. She was the daughter of Herman Fligelman, president and one of the founders of Helena, Montana's New York Dry Goods Store. In 1920 Winestine accepted the offer of the position of general manager of the New York Store and moved to Helena. He managed the store until his retirement in 1958. In Helena, Winestine was active in the Congregation Emanu-El, a Jewish reform congregation. Winestine was also involved with the Montana Institute of the Arts and the Montana Historical Society. He was appointed to the Board of the latter organization by Governor John Bonner in 1949, and served as its president. Norman Winestine died on April 4, 1986.
Belle Fligelman was born in Helena in 1891. She attended Helena schools, graduating from high school in 1909. She then attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and during her senior year was elected president of the Women's Self-Governing Student Body. In 1914 she returned to Helena to work as a reporter for the Independent. The following year she was hired to manage and edit the weekly Montana Progressive , published by the state's Progressive Party. It was during this time that she became involved in the successful congressional campaign of Jeannette Rankin. She accompanied Rankin to Washington, D.C., and was employed to write news releases. Throughout her life, Belle Winestine was active in polities supporting movements such as women's suffrage, the Equal Rights Amendment, world peace, etc. In 1932 she unsuccessfully ran for the Montana Senate with her main campaign issue being the creation of a state children's bureau. She was also a prolific writer of short stories, children's stories, plays, and poetry, some of which were published. Belle Winestine died in April 1985.
Norman and Belle Winestine had three children: Minna, Judith, and Henry.
The Montana State Highway Commission was created in 1913 by the state Legislative Assembly. The original Commission was composed of three members. In 1917 new legislation altered the organization of the Commission by authorizing the appointment of twelve members according to geographic highway districts. Membership was changed again in 1921 to three members appointed by the Governor and in 1941 to five members, also appointed by the Governor. In 1971 the Commission was renamed the Montana Department of Highways, created by Chapter 7 of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 and implemented by executive order of the Governor on December 16, 1971. The Department of Highways took over all but the advisory functions of the State Highway Commission.
By 1972, the Department consisted of seven divisions: the Legal Division, Personnel Division, Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division. Each division was headed by an administrator. The Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division were furthered sub-divided into bureaus, headed by Chiefs. In 1991, the Department of Highways became the Department of Transportation.
The Highway Department, the Department of Highways, and Department of Transportation maintained regional offices in five districts: Billings, Butte, Glendive, Great Falls, and Missoula. The District Engineer (later called the District Administrator) was the chief administrative officer in each district office. District office files document the activities of the district administrators, engineers, maintenance crew, and other district office employees. The district offices addressed administrative, functional, and project related issues of their particular area, including: highway needs, current construction projects, training for employees, road design, federal and state aid and grants, and reports to the Department of Highways/Department of Transportation in Helena.
Corette and Corette was a Butte, Montana, law firm founded in 1934 by John E. Corette and his son, Robert D. Corette. Another son, John E. Corette, Jr., joined the firm at a later date. In addition to the firm, with its largely corporate clientele (including the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and Montana Power Company), the Corettes were involved in a number of other enterprises; these included the Metals Bank and Trust Company, Butte; the Mayflower Mining Company; the West Mayflower Mining Company; the Capital Laundry Company, Helena; the New Method Laundry Company, Butte; and the C. and F. Teaming and Trucking Company. Corette and Corette was later renamed Corette, Smith and Dean. John Earl Corette was admitted to the Montana Bar on December 5, 1903, and was first associated with the Butte law firm of Forbis and Evans. When John Forbis retired and L.O. Evans became chief counsel for the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1914, Corette carried on the practice under his own name. In the early 1900s, Corette was active in the important mining litigation of the region and was considered a specialist in mining law. As the mining litigation decreased, he developed a general business law practice, and he became a successful corporate lawyer. From 1920 until his death, Corette was general counsel in Montana for the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and beginning in 1940, he served as counsel for the Northern Pacific Railway Company in charge of all legal work for that company in western Montana. John E. Corette died on March 19, 1949.
Frances Dummer Logan Merriam was born December 24, 1899, in Chicago, Illinois. She was the daughter of William and Ethel Dummer. Frances Dummer attended Francis W. Parker High School in Chicago, graduating in 1917. She entered college at the University of Wisconsin, where she received Phi Beta Kappa honors, and graduated in 1921. Following graduation from college, Frances Dummer taught school for three years in San Diego, California, 1921-1924. In 1926, she was awarded a diploma as a psychiatric social worker from the New York School of Social Work. Shortly thereafter, she returned to her home state and was employed for ten months at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research. She continued her work in education while working in the Winnetka, Illinois, public schools as an education counselor, 1926-1931. While employed there, she met and married Simon Rae Logan, then Assistant Superintendent of Schools. The Logans continued living in Winnetka, while raising a son, Francis, and a daughter, Katharine. Mrs. Logan later served as a co-director of the Chicago Metropolitan Council of Civil Defense (Chicago Council of Social Work), 1942-1946. In 1946, when her husband retired, Frances Logan moved with him to a farm/homestead near Charlo, Montana. She remained active in political life, serving as Montana's First District Democratic Congressional Committeewoman, 1962-1964. For three years, she also served as the state's Democratic National Committeewoman. Frances Logan was also a charter member of the Committee for Paradise Dam, an organization that promoted the construction of Paradise and Knowles Dams in western Montana, in 1957, and later served as its Executive Secretary, 1959-1965. Her husband died in 1970, and in 1974 she married Harold G. Merriam, University of Montana English professor emeritus.
The United States Adjutant General is the chief administrative officer within the military, and in this context specifically the Army. When a National Guard unit becomes activated and Federalized, this is the office which will handle all of the administrative functions of the unit. The 41st Infantry Division was activated on September 16, 1940 from the National Guard Division of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. It served in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War and participated in the New Guinea, Southern Philippines, and Papuan campaigns. The Division also served on occupation duty for a brief period of time but only rarely throughout the war did it operate as a complete unit. Its three infantry regiments (162nd, 163rd, and 186th) were most often detached on separate operations and in many cases took on the designation of a specified task force.
J. Hugo Aronson was born in Gallstad, Sweden on September 1, 1891, a son of Aron Johanson (1856-1927), a tenant farmer, and Rika Ryding Johannsen (1857-1940). The Johannsens had five children: Anna, Karl, Julia, John Hugo, and Erik Johannsen Aronson. Anna Aronson married Karl Skold and the couple had three children: Gunnar, Karin, and Allan. Julia Aronson Joseffson had two sons. Sven Johanson was also a nephew of J. Hugo Aronson.
J. Hugo Aronson was educated in the public schools of Gallstad, Sweden. He left school at the age of 14 to work. Hugo came to the United States from Sweden in 1911, penniless, except for the $25.00 immigration fee required. His brothers and sisters remained residents of Sweden. After working at various jobs through thirty-eight states, Hugo arrived in Columbus, Montana in 1914. While working for Frank Young in Columbus he got the nickname "The Galloping Swede." In 1915 Hugo filed for a 320-acre homestead in Elk Basin.
On December 8, 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Army at Billings and served as a private with the 20th Engineers in France. On June 3, 1919, while in France with the American Expeditionary Forces, Aronson married Matilda Langane, who was in charge of the French-American Red Cross group and had been one of premier Georges Clemenceau’s secretaries. He was honorably discharged on July 17, 1919, as a private first class at Hoboken, New Jersey.
Aronson returned to Columbus with his wife and rented a farm which he operated while working in the oil fields at Elk Basin, Wyoming. In January 1923, Hugo went to Sunburst, Montana where he was a tool dresser, or driller’s helper, for a drilling company. In 1924, another rig-builder, Roy Berrey, and Hugo became partners in the Sunburst Construction Company. It was a profitable business but only after a year Roy decided to sell Hugo out. Hugo then operated his own rig-building outfit under his own name and started advertising as "The Galloping Swede." Matilda was the bookkeeper. He added a trucking business to the rig-building company, and at the time Hugo was the largest rig-builder in Montana. When oil was discovered in Kevin-Sunburst fields in Montana, Hugo built the first building in Oilmont. In 1928 he founded Gallop City near Conrad. It was the largest of the oil-fields camps, a community which boasted 500 inhabitants.
Hugo and Matilda Aronson traveled to Sweden and France to visit family in 1924. That same year, they traveled to Glacier National Park and Waterton. They also visited California, Nevada, and Utah.
Matilda died in Paris, France in 1936 of cancer.
On September 25, 1944, J. Hugo Aronson married Rose McClure in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Rose McClure Aronson was born in Mondovi, Washington in 1904, the daughter of rancher Evan McClure and Bertha Brink McClure. An educator, she was superintendent of schools in Glacier County at the time of her marriage. The Aronsons had one daughter, Rika Berthevan Aronson, who was born in Cut Bank on December 13, 1945. She married Gary Robert Mogolis and the couple had two children: Joani Michele (born Oct. 1, 1967) and John Robert.
Aronson's political career began with his election as Cut Bank City Alderman in 1934. A Republican, he served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives as a member from Glacier County (1939-1944), and for the next eight years was a member of the Montana State Senate, also representing Glacier County. Aronson served on the board of directors of the Montana Motor Transport Association for many years. He was also a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (V.F.W.) and the American Legion. He was a member of the Algeria Temple, Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, Blue Lodge, York Rite, and Scottish Rite Masonic bodies.
J. Hugo Aronson was elected governor of Montana on November 4, 1952. George Gosman was elected lieutenant governor. Other executive officers included Attorney General Arnold Olsen, Secretary of State Sam W. Mitchell, and Superintendent of Public Instruction Mary M. Condon. Hugh Adair was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Montana; Alex Stephenson, Chief of the Highway Patrol; and Wesley Castles was Aronson's executive secretary.
Aronson was elected to a second term in 1956. Democrat Paul Cannon was elected lieutenant governor. Edna J. Hinman served as Clerk of the Supreme Court; Forrest H. Anderson as Attorney General; Harriett Miller as Superintendent of Public Instruction; and S.H. Mitchell was the Adjutant General.
As Governor, Hugo battled over oil and gas leasing that arose out of the discovery of oil in the Williston Basin in 1951; he worked for better schools, for prisoner rehabilitation, for oil conservation, and for highway development. In 1959, a new governors' residence was built and the Aronsons became the first family to reside there.
Following his second term as governor, the Aronsons retired to Bigfork, Montana. Rose Aronson died February 25, 1968 and J. Hugo Aronson's death came on the tenth anniversary of his wife's, February 25, 1978, at the age of 86.
The Planning Survey of the State Highway Commission was established in 1936, jointly financed by the state and the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads. Also known as the Planning Survey Division, it was charged with developing any and all types of data that would be beneficial for highway planning. In order to fulfill that responsibility the Division was structured into three principal sections: Traffic, Mapping, and Statistics. The Traffic Section was given the responsibility of collecting data concerning the movement of motor vehicles on state highways, county roads, and city streets. The data was collected by means of both permanent and portable counters, as well as by visual counts and classifications. In addition to traffic counting, the Traffic Division was given a number of other functions including the weighing of trucks to obtain statistical information; the reporting of the number of accidents by location, type of accident, and economic cost; special urban transportation surveys for cities; origin destination surveys; and parking surveys. The Mapping Section was to prepare state highway maps, county maps, and city plats. The Mapping Section was also to collect data concerning county roads and to maintain a continuing inventory of all such roads in each county, including the type of surface of each road as well as mileages. The Mapping Section also performed special drafting of charts, graphs, and special exhibits. The Statistical Section was responsible for the compilation and reporting of a variety of financial and statistical data pertaining to highways, roads, and streets throughout Montana. These data were reported in published format and were also included in the summaries prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads for all states. The name of the Montana Highway Planning Survey was changed in 1966 to the Planning Survey Section, and, in 1971 following the statewide reorganization, became the Planning and Research Bureau under the new Department of Higlaways.
The Montana Wheat Research and Marketing Committee was established in 1967 as the advisory committee for the Division of Wheat Research and Marketing. The Division was responsible for conducting research into all phases of wheat culture, production, and marketing. The Committee, consisting of 20 members, advised the Division on policy and also functioned as the research and development arm. The program was financed by a special tax on wheat.
Representative John N. Rodgers introduced HB Memorial 7 in December 1866 that sought federal funds for a territorial penitentiary in Montana. In January 1867 funding was approved and the penitentiary opened in Deer Lodge in July 1871. It was relinquished to Montana Territory in 1873, and taken over by the federal government once again in 1874. The penitentiary became a state institution in 1889, when Montana achieved statehood.
The state contracted with former prison guard Frank Conley and Colonel Thomas McTague to operate the penitentiary from 1890 to 1908, with Conley as warden. In 1909 the state hired Conley as warden, a position he held until 1921. Conley instituted an extensive trusty program in which many prisoners worked outside the prison walls. Prison work crews built roads in western Montana and constructed buildings at the Montana State Hospital for the Insane and the Montana State Tuberculosis Sanitarium, as well as making many improvements to the prison itself. In 1921 Governor Joseph Dixon initiated an investigation of Conley's alleged use of state monies for personal gain; this investigation led to Conley's dismissal.
Conditions at the prison deteriorated in the decades that followed Conley's dismissal. The trusty program was largely abandoned due to the depressed economy and the concomitant protest by free labor against prisoners working outside the prison. Additionally, few industries had been developed within the prison, leaving many inmates idle. Overcrowding and the decay of the physical plant contributed to poor living conditions at the prison.
In 1957 an investigation of prison conditions conducted by Kenyon J. Scudder reported appalling and potentially explosive conditions at the prison. Later that year a "disturbance" did occur during which hostages were taken. A large scale riot occurred in 1959. The prison was made part of the Department of Institutions in 1963. A new prison was constructed in 1979 outside of Deer Lodge.
The Board of Territorial Prison Commissioners (later the Board of Prison Commissioners) was established in 1867, consisting of three elected members holding office for two years. The commissioners had "full and exclusive control over all the territorial prison grounds, buildings, prisoners, prison labor, prison property and all other things belonging or pertaining to said prison," and established "rules, regulations and by-laws" to govern the prison. The commissioners met every three months. An 1893 law removed prisoners from the commissioners' control, empowered the Board to appoint the warden, and established the Board as consisting of the governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general, with two members constituting a quorum. In 1907 the Board was given the power to approve or disapprove parole for prisoners recommended by the governor. In 1913 the governor was given the power to appoint the warden, and the Board was given jurisdiction over persons receiving suspended sentences. In 1955 the Board's jurisdiction over paroles and suspended sentences was delegated to the State Board of Pardons. Legislation establishing the Board of State Prison Commissioners was not included in the 1972 constitution; the Board was formally abolished in 1974.
The State Board of Pardons was established in 1891, consisting of the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the state auditor. The Board was required to convene if the governor granted a pardon, remitted a fine or forfeiture, or commuted a punishment. The Board would then cause a notice of a hearing concerning the case to be published in a newspaper in the county in which the crime was committed and notify the concerned county attorney, district judge, and sheriff. Subsequent to the hearing the Board would file its decision with the secretary of state. In 1955 the Board membership was changed to three members appointed by the governor to terms of six years. The appointees were given the responsibility of administering the executive clemency, probation, and parole system. The Board was made part of the Department of Institutions in 1971.
Edgar Samuel Paxson was born on April 25, 1852 in East Hamburg, New York to William Hamilton and Christina Humbleton Paxson. At the completion of primary school, his parents sent him to a Quaker boarding school called Friends' Institute. Edgar went to into business with his father painting carriages, lettering, and sign painting.
Edgar married Laura Millicent Johnson at Orchard Park, New York in June 4, 1874. A little over a year later their first child, Loren a son, was born and Paxson left his wife and infant child in New York to head west. Working various jobs, Paxson found himself in Montana where continued to live the life of a frontiersman and served for a time as a scout during the Nez Perce War. Finding steady employment in Deer Lodge, Montana, at his old trade, he sent for his wife and son who joined him in 1879. When work became scarce in Deer Lodge, Paxson accepted a commission in Butte, MT to paint a large mural and moved his family there in 1881 to complete the work. He and Laura had three more children after she joined him in Montana, Lelia, Harry, and Robert.
Paxson joined the Montana National Guard as a private and spent ten years as an active guardsman retiring with the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Paxson became an ardent supporter for war against Spain with the sinking of the USS Maine. He enlisted in April 1898 for two years and mustered into service on May 7 in Helena as 1st Lieutenant, Company G, First Montana Infantry. The Montana guardsmen shipped out for the Philippines on July 18. His son Harry also served as a private in Company G as a musician. Paxson contracted malaria shortly after his arrival in the Philippines and due to the severity of the illness military command released him from active service and shipped him home. Once back in Butte, he received his honorable discharge from the Montana Volunteer Infantry on December 2, 1898. While he convalesced, Edgar began working on his Custer painting, completing his canvas titled Custer's Last Battle on the Little Big Horn in 1899. He and Laura also waited and worried about their son Harry. Although the war with Spain had all but concluded in the Philippines by the time the 1st Montana Volunteers arrived war broke out in early 1899 between the Filipino Insurgents and the U.S. liberates delaying the return of the Montanans. During the fighting Harry Paxson served as bugler and courier for General George Crook. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the return of the 1st Montana Volunteers, the city of Butte commissioned Paxson to design a large triumphal arch and sculpt a statue called Peace for the top to welcome and commemorate their return in October 1899.
Paxson's fulltime painting career began with his return from the Spanish-American War with exhibitions in Chicago, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis (1904), as well as the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon (1905). That same year the Montana State Legislature passed a "resolution of appreciation" in recognition of his exhibit in Portland. The family moved to Missoula in 1906 where Paxson built a studio next to their residence. Six years later the Missoula County Commissioners engaged Paxson to paint eight murals for the county courthouse—Arrival of Father Ravalli at Fort Owen, Lewis and Clark's Camp at Lolo Creek, A Montana Roundup, The Flatheads in Buffalo Country, Lewis' Party Crossing the Clark Fork, Flatheads Leaving Their Bitterroot Home, Governor Steven's Treaty with the Pend D'Oreilles, Flatheads, and Kootenai at Council Grove, and Early Transportation.
With the expansion of the Montana capital in 1912, Paxson, Charles M. Russell, and R.E. DeCamp, all Montana artists, received commissions to produce murals for the new wings based on subjects selected by Governor Joseph K. Toole. Paxson, responsible for the murals in the House of Representatives, painted the six murals that hang in the lobby today: After the Whiteman's Book, The Border Land, Lewis at Black Eagle Falls, Pierre de La Verendrye, Lewis and Clark at Three Forks, and Surrender of Chief Joseph.
The popularity he enjoyed as an artist peaked 1900-1915, after that period he did not receive any more major commissions and as his popularity waned his health also began to fail. Further complicating his health was the unexpected death of his son Harry in January 1910. Electrocuted while working on a dredge near Butte, twenty-nine-year-old Harry left behind a wife and two young sons. Despite his declining health and personal tragedy, Paxson experienced a high point in his career during this time and sales of his painting remained strong although he received little publicity outside of Montana. After 1915 his popularity as an artist began to subside and major commissions and sales dried up but Paxson remained dedicated to his art and even as his health declined he continued to paint.
Contemporary newspaper accounts attributed his health issues with an accident that occurred during his return voyage from the Philippines when the ship he was on encountered a typhoon. Struck by a wave in the storm and thrown against a spar, Paxson suffered an internal injury that plagued him for the remainder of his life. This didn't keep him for volunteering for military service when the United State declared war in April 1917 against Germany but his days of active service were over.
Edgar S. Paxson died November 9, 1919 at the age of 67 at his home in Missoula. His friend Charlie Russell wrote "his work tells me that he loved the Old West, and those who loved her I count as friends." His wife Laura died almost twenty years to the day. They are both interred at the Missoula Cemetery.
In 1951 the Montana Legislative Assembly created the Office of State Controller to assume the duties of the state accountant. The controller was appointed by the governor for an eight year term and was directed to establish a system of financial control, install a uniform accounting and reporting system, examine appropriation requests, and submit a revised and final budget to the legislature. The controller was also the ex-officio state purchasing agent.
The 1963 legislature created a Department of Administration to provide "a more coordinated, responsible, efficient and economical organization by centralizing and consolidating the general administrative and fiscal functions of state government into one department." The state controller was made the chief executive of the department, with divisions for accounting, purchasing, architecture and engineering, and general services. The controller became responsible for centralized mailing and telephone systems for state government, allocation of office space, custodial care of the Capitol and other state property, records management for state records, preparation of building programs, appointments of architects, supervision of construction and renovation of state buildings, disposal of state property (including the Montana Centennial Train), purchasing of major equipment for state agencies, and distribution of surplus commodities.
The controller also oversaw several advisory bodies including a council to create construction standards for state buildings (this later became the Building Code Council), a fiscal coordinating committee, a personnel study committee, the State Board of Review which studied pro rata charges, and a committee on data processing equipment which worked to coordinate the selection of computer systems and equipment in state government. As a result of this latter committee, a Data Processing Division was created within the Department of Administration. A Management Systems Unit was also created and worked to produce the Statewide Budget and Accounting System (SBAS) that went into operation in 1972.
As a result of the Executive Reorganization Act passed in 1971, the Department of Administration was reconstituted and the title state controller was changed to director.
Those serving as state controller included W.F. Koch, Walter Anderson, Ralph Kenyon, Doyle B. Saxby, H.F. (Mike) Weggenbaum, and Jack Crosser.
Republican state legislator and a member of the Missoula School District 1 Board of Trustees for 21 years was born in Montgomery, Minnesota, on October 15, 1892. She attended Valley City Teachers College in Valley City, North Dakota, in Domestic Science. On graduation Bess taught school for six years; four years in North Dakota and was principal at Stanford Montana and then on to teach high school chemistry in St. Maries Idaho. When it became evident that her teaching salary was not enough to support herself she decided to give up teaching and went to work for the Milwaukee Road. She worked for the railroad in St. Maries and Spokane, Washington for the next six years. On November 9, 1925 she married Dr. Dallas J. Reed and moved to Missoula shortly thereafter. The couple had one son, Dallas J. Reed, Jr.
From the time Bess arrived in Missoula in 1925, she was committed to public affairs. She led local and state chapters of the PTA (Parent Teachers Association). Bess was the secretary of the Montana Society for Crippled Children for eight years, and Missoula County's Girls State Chairwomen for 19 years. For 17 years she was the executive secretary of the Community Chest (the United Way predecessor) and served on the Board of Directors of the Missoula Chamber of Commerce. As a member of the Missoula Business and Professional Women's Club she was voted Women of the Year in 1952 and was their State President in 1964 and in 1976 was their Women in History in their Statewide Bi-Centennial book. On March 27, 1971, the Missoula Chamber of Commerce declared Bess Reed Day. Altogether Bess worked for the city of Missoula for 52 years.
In her four years in the Legislature 1951-1953 and 1961, Bess took a particular interest in education and health and was an active proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment. She was chairwomen of Education and Public Health, Morals and Safety Committee, Mines and Mining, State Boards and Institutions, Ways and Means, Banking and Insurance, and Conservation and Development. Lands.
Bess Reed died at the age of 91 in Missoula, Montana on June 4, 1984.
Dr. Dallas J. Reed, Missoula chiropractor, was born in Butte, Montana on April 16, 1891. He was employed by the Milwaukee Railroad in 1907 where he worked as a timekeeper. He remained with the railroad company until 1917, when he enlisted in Spokane, Washington and was sent to France. He was first stationed in a French headquarters office, and then saw action with the second division at Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood and Soissons. In Soissons he was wounded just after going over the top, and was only one of 28 survivors of his company of 238 men. He returned to his employment with the Milwaukee Road in 1919, remaining in the work until 1921, when he entered the National College of Chiropractic in Chicago. After his graduation in 1924, he practiced in Whitehall, Montana for a year, moving to Missoula in 1925. He died on April 29, 1944 after a long illness.
The Board of Game and Fish Commissioners was established in March of 1895 to oversee licensing and hunting practices in the state. The Board was comprised of three commissioners, appointed by the Governor and was empowered to appoint a State Fish and Game Warden. The warden also served as secretary and business agent of the Board. The first warden was chosen in 1898. The Board was abolished in 1901, but the functions were assumed by the State Fish Commissioners in 1907. The State Fish Commissioners consisted of a the Warden and two commissioners. By 1911 two more commissioners were added. In 1921 the third Fish and Game Commission formed with five commissioners entrusted to elect the State Warden. In 1972 the Department of Fish and Game was established. It was renamed the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in 1979.
The People's Voice, a cooperative newspaper, was founded in 1939, by H.S. "Cap" Bruce with the backing of farm coop and labor leaders. Bruce, a veteran newspaperman, saw the need for an independent state-wide paper after the established press failed to report adequately on the 1937 state legislature's defeat of liberal measures. Bruce's newly formed Educational Co-operative Publishing Company bought a press and, in December 1939, began publication of The People's Voice . The Voice covered both local and national issues, taking strong stands on the issues of public power, protection of public lands, establishment of farmers' cooperatives, the abolition of capital punishment, minimum wage, and other labor union concerns. In spite of its small circulation, the paper's political influence was considerable. In November 1948, associate editor Harry L. Billings, assisted by his wife Gretchen, succeeded Bruce as managing editor. After Billings retired in 1968, Bennett Hansen took over the Voice's management, but financial difficulties forced the paper to cease publication shortly thereafter.
Warren Russell McGee was born in Livingston, Montana, on September 7, 1914, the second child of Howard E. and Mildred (Reeves) McGee. He graduated from Park County High School in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression. As a young man, he took whatever work he could find, including dish washing for a road construction crew on the Beartooth Highway, laboring on the Fort Peck Dam, and construction work on Dunraven Pass in Yellowstone National Park. In 1936 he began his lifetime work for the Northern Pacific Railway, as a brakeman. He was drafted into the Army Air Force in March 1942 and served as a maintenance man in a photo reconnaisance squadron in the Solomon's and Saipan. After his discharge from the military in September 1945, he returned to work for the Northern Pacific Railway. He worked his way up to conductor and continued to work for the Northern Pacific, Burlington Northern, and Amtrak until his retirement on October 31, 1975.
McGee was chairman from 1960 until 1970 of the Livingston Anti-Merger Committee, which was dedicated to opposing the creation of the Burlington Northern Railroad. He was also an outspoken advocate of the continuation of rail service to Montana communities. McGee made two unsuccessful campaigns for public office, first in 1966 when he ran for the Legislature, and again in 1971 when he ran as a delegate to the Montana Constitutional Convention. In spite of his two defeats he remained very active with the Montana Democratic Party.
During his service in World War II, McGee became an expert photographer. He combined that skill with his love of trains into a hobby of railroad photography. He compiled one of the most complete photo documentations of locomotives in existence.
In September 1946, McGee married Bernice Lavold, daughter of Knute and Helen (Berg) Lavold of Big Timber. They had one son, Howard, who died in an automobile accident at the age of 22. Bernice shared Warren's passion for politics and railroads, writing many letters to the editor. She was active in the community as a Cub Scout den mother, as a founder of Livingston's Meals on Wheels Program, as a board member for the Livingston Memorial Hospital, and numerous other community projects. She died February 15, 2001.
William L. Ford graduated from the University of Michigan law school in 1900 and began practicing law in White Sulphur Springs, Montana, in the same year. In 1904, he ran for Meagher County attorney and was defeated by N.B. Smith. In 1905, he became the city attorney and clerk, and in 1906 was elected county attorney, a position he held through 1912. He decided not to run for re-election in November of that year due to his father's illness. He devoted his time to running his father's ranch near White Sulphur Springs, and by 1913 had formed a partnership with Richard Manger. In 1918 or 1919 Ford renewed his law practice. He was elected district judge as a Republican in 1920. He had been active in the Masons and the Republican Party before his election, having been appointed county chairman of the Roosevelt Memorial Association in 1919 and chairman of the Republican Ways and Means Committee for Meagher County in 1920. William Ford married Margaret Young on December 25, 1907.
Carl August Linn joined William Ford's law office in March 1912. While retaining the name of "Ford and Linn," Linn began operating as the firm's sole attorney when Ford turned his attention to ranching in 1912. Linn was elected county attorney in November 1912.
Ford and Linn acted as collection agents for out-of-state and in-state firms and individuals. They also handled cases involving property disputes, water rights, sales of horses, claims involving the Montana Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad, divorce, probate, assault, etc., and collected rents for out-of-town landlords.
Brothers Abraham L. and Edward I. Goodkind, and Meyer and Charles Wise operated a wholesale wine, liquor, and cigar business in Helena, Montana, from 1890 or 1891 until 1896 when the Wise brothers left the business. The Goodkind brothers continued their operation until Edward died on May 11, 1916. Abraham continued the operation with Edward's widow, Margaret L., until 1918. Abraham and Margaret then went into the loan business until 1922, when Margaret moved to Los Angeles. Subsequently, Arthur Ward joined Goodkind in the loans and securities business. Goodkind moved to Chicago in the 1930s. His business changed to the rental of, primarily, commercial property. The company's name was Goodkind Estate for at least the years 1950 to 1953, and Goodkind Associates from 1954 to at least 1969. Arthur Ward acted as Goodkind's agent in Helena until 1958. Goodkind Associates rented property in Helena, Billings, Butte, Forsyth, Helena, Miles City, and other towns in Montana.
The Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences was given the responsibility, under the 1967 Session Laws, to license hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, and related institutions. Included in this function are the approval of new facilities, expansion of facilities, changes in classification, and inspection for adherence to standards. The Health Services and Medical Facilities Division and its Licensing and Certification Bureau also act as the agents for the United States Health Care Financing Administration in approving health care facilities for Medicare patients. Among the reasons a health care facility's license or Medicare approval can be revoked are failure to meet minimum standards of construction and fire safety, failure to provide sufficient medical staff with the proper qualifications, conviction of a felony by the hospital manager, mistreatment or neglect of patients, and financial inadequacy.

The firm was owned by Leopold Auerbach of San Francisco and his brother, William Jacob Auerbach of Helena, who managed the firm. Originally known as Auerbach and Greenhood, the name changed shortly after William Auerbach arrived in Helena around 1869.

On June 28, 1880, William Auerbach was killed in a New York City train accident.
Burton Kendall Wheeler was born February 27, 1882, at Hudson, Massachusetts. After his public schooling and a period of work in the Boston area, Wheeler attended the University of Michigan. He received his law degree in 1905. In October 1905, he settled in Butte, Montana, and began work as a clerk for an established lawyer. The following year, Wheeler went into practice on his own. In 1910, he was elected to serve in the Montana House of Representatives as a Democrat from Silver Bow County. While in the legislature, Wheeler supported the candidacy of Thomas J. Walsh for Senator. For this support, Walsh arranged to have Wheeler appointed U.S. District Attorney for Montana in 1913. He served in this capacity throughout World War I and was the subject of much controversy for his actions in protecting the right of dissent. He resigned in 1918 to avert a possible Walsh defeat.
In 1920, Wheeler was defeated by Joseph M. Dixon in a bitter campaign for governor, but two years later, he was elected U.S. Senator. He held this Senate seat until his defeat in the primary election of 1946. During his Senate career, Wheeler was a constant foe of the "interests" and was chiefly responsible for the exposure and investigation of graft in the Department of Justice (1924-1925). Wheeler was an early supporter of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Interstate Commerce Committee. However, in 1937, Wheeler broke with the administration over Roosevelt's unsuccessful bid to "pack" the Supreme Court. His opposition to Roosevelt was again of major importance as a member of the America First Committee and as a supporter of non-involvement in the European war, which began in 1939. Wheeler, because of his widespread support in the Democratic party, was considered a major contender for the presidential nomination in 1940, until Roosevelt announced for a third term. He was strongly considered as a running mate with Roosevelt that year, but refused to accept the nomination. Wheeler again supported non-involvement in 1945-1946, when he opposed the United Nations and loans to our allies after the war.
After his defeat for reelection to the Senate by Leif Erickson in the 1946 primary, Wheeler retired to private law practice in partnership with his son Edward, in Washington, D.C. Burton K. Wheeler died in 1975, at age 93.
The 1972 Montana Constitution required the legislature to "... provide procedures requiring each local government unit or combination of units to review its structure and submit one alternative form of government to the qualified electors ..." by 1976. Local governments were assisted in their endeavors by the Montana State Commission on Local Government.
The Deer Lodge City Government Study Commission was one of 182 city, town, and county local government study commissions, each of which consisted of at least three unpaid members elected in nonpartisan elections held in November 1974. The Commission conducted a review of the Deer Lodge government and recommended the "strong mayor and weak council" form of government as an alternative form of government, as well as consolidation of the city police department with the county sheriff's office. Both recommendations were rejected by the voters in a November 1976 election.
John Shober was born in Loudon County, Virginia, on January 5, 1832. After attending law school in Cincinnati, Shober was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1852. In 1854 he began practicing law in Minnesota where he participated in the organization of Dodge County. In 1858 Shober moved to Yankton, Dakota Territory. While in Yankton he was elected to the Territorial Council, serving as its president in 1862. Shober participated in the initial formation of the Dakota Territory after his election to the Territorial Council. He served as the Council's president in 1862.
In 1864 Shober joined the Sully Expedition and travelled to Montana Territory, arriving in Helena by September, 1864. He mined in Nelson and Holmes Gulches, while beginning his law practice in Helena. In 1865 he ran for district attorney and defeated Cornelius Hedges. He won that office again in 1867. That year Shober also formed a law partnership with Thomas J. Lowry. Shober, an ardent Democrat with pro-Confederate sympathies during the Civil War, was elected a member of the 1866 Constitutional Convention. In 1894 Shober was elected to the Fourth Legislative Assembly as a Populist.
Shober invested in mining and ranching properties. The Elkhorn Mining Company (established in 1883) and the Montana Mining and Improvement Company (established in 1887) were two of his larger investments. Shober was a pioneer in the formulation of mining and water rights law. John H. Shober never married and was cared for in his old age by his niece Harriet Shober Nolan. Shober died in Helena on August 22, 1925.
John H. Shober, Jr. was born in Dexter, Iowa, about 1870. He was the son of Nerva and Herod Shober and the nephew of John H. Shober. He worked on his father's farm, attended Rathbun's Business College in Omaha, Nebraska (1888-1890), and entered the feed business with his father in Dexter in 1891.
In 1900 Shober left Iowa and settled on his uncle John Shober's ranch near Townsend, Montana. He continued to manage his uncle's property for a number of years, and after the death of his uncle and his sister Harriet Shober Nolan (1929), he moved to Helena where he entered the real estate business. John H. Shober never married. He died in 1952.
Harriet Shober was born in Dodge County, Minnesota, in the early 1850s and moved to Dexter, Iowa, when she was sixteen years old. The teaching certificates she earned between 1876 and 1885 enabled her to teach in the Adair County, Iowa, schools.
In 1887 Harriet moved to Helena, Montana Territory, and lived with her uncle John H. Shober. In 1894 she married Cornelius B. Nolan, a Helena attorney, and involved herself in Helena's social affairs. Harriet Nolan, like her uncle, was active in Democratic politics and served as Democratic National Committeewoman for several years.
Harriet Shober Nolan died at Lake McDonald, Montana, on August 23, 1929.
Dola Wilson was born in Gaffney, South Carolina, in 1891, the son of Charles and Elizabeth Wilson. He came to Miles City, Montana, in 1912, and worked on a ranch for three years. He then worked for the Milwaukee Road. In 1934 he bought the Blue Ribbon Bar and re-named it the Range Riders Bar and Restaurant. To decorate his establishment he collected photographs of prominent area stockmen. In 1944 he began to compile biographical materials about the stockmen and attempted to expand the number of photographs. He hired Charles M. Boucher, a retired newspaperman, to research and write the biographical material. He retired in 1957 and his son Dola Jr. took over the bar. Dola Wilson Sr. died in November, 1972. Charles M. Boucher was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, on July 16, 1864, the son of William F. Boucher. When Charles was two and a half, his father died leaving his mother with 5 young children. The family moved to her parents' farm at Terwood, Pennsylvania. In 1885 he graduated from Girard College, an institution endowed by financier Stephen Girard to educate white male orphans. The following year he apprenticed as a pattern maker. In 1892 he headed west to Nebraska. He went to work for his brother-in-law George Conn's Ogallala Record and Baxton Pilot. The following year year he moved to Miles City, Montana, and worked as a reporter, first for the Yellowstone Journal and later for the \ul Miles City Star. After his retirement he was engaged by Dola Wilson to write biographical sketches of the cowboys and ranchers whose photographs were in the Range Riders Bar and Cafe. He died in 1954.
The Montana State Legislature is made up of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Montana limits the size of the Senate to no fewer than 40 and no more than 50 members and the size of the House of Representatives to no fewer than 80 and no more than 100 members. Each house is responsible for choosing its officers, creating committees and establishing its own rules. The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day. The first State Legislature convened on November 23, 1889, fifteen days after Montana became a state. Each following Legislature has been numbered sequentially.
The 57th Montana Legislature met from January 3rd to April 21st, 2001. There were 18 standing committees in the Senate, 16 standing committees in the House, and 6 Joint Appropriations Committees. The leaders of the Senate were Tom Beck (R-President), Walter McNutt (R-President Pro Tempore), Fred Thomas (R-Majority Leader), and Steve Doherty (D-Minority Leader). The leaders of the House were Dan McGee (R-Speaker), Doug Mood (R-Speaker Pro Tempore), Paul Sliter (R-Majority Leader), and Kim Gillan (D-Minority Leader).

The National Typographical Union was established in 1852 as the major union in the printing trade. In 1874 it became the International Typographical Union with several Canadian locals. The first Montana local union was formed in Helena in 1867. Gradually additional local unions were established in cities across the state. Initially, the Helena local functioned as the de facto state organization. The Montana Typographical Conference was formed in 1929 to coordinate the work of the local unions. The objectives of the conference included organizing the printing trade around the state, promoting the training of printers, urging buyers of printed material to patronize union shops, encouraging cooperation among locals, and assisting them in contract negotiations. During the Depression and war years the conference was largely inactive. After World War II, the conference became a leading factor in the printers' union statewide. It became actively involved in apprenticeship programs, in training in new printing technologies, in relations with the Montana State AFL-CIO, and contract discussions. Although membership in the local unions was declining rapidly due to new technology, the conference remained vigorous into the early 1980s. The Montana Typographical Conference folded about 1984. After briefly considering a merger with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Typographical Union was absorbed into the Communications Workers of America in 1987.

This date will allow the researcher to find the prisoner description sheet on State Microfilm 36, where the description sheets are arranged by date received at the prison. Researchers are advised to provide the archivist with all possible variations of the prisoner's name.
