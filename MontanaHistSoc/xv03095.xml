      <p>From World War I through the Persian Gulf War, Montana has ranked in
		  the highest percentile nationally in the number of its citizens serving as
		  military personnel. These numbers include nearly 5,000 women since 1940 and as
		  well as a substantial number of Montanan tribal members. Montana played a
		  significant role in American military strategies during the Cold War, due to
		  the presence of Malmstrom Air Force Base and its numerous missile silos. This
		  project was started in 1993 to record the experiences of those who served in
		  the military forces and the families and communties who were impacted by the
		  service.</p>

      <p>This project consists of 109 interviews recording the experiences of
