      <p> Bower Brothers Sheep Company owned and operated in partnership one of the largest sheep
        companies in the state of Montana. Originally from New York, two of the Bowers, Arthur and
        Edward, arrived in 1880 to homestead on Surprise Creek located in the Judith Basin near
        Stanford, Montana. In September of that year, they made two purchases of sheep near Deer
        Lodge and drove the flock, numbering 1052 head, to their ranch. A third brother, Calvin,
        arrived from the East in 1881 and was taken into the firm which became known as Bower
        Brothers Sheep Company. The Bowers gradually increased their holdings, purchasing water
        rights, buying out homesteads, and leasing government lands. At one point, their 50,000
        acres, extending toward Arrow Creek and Denton, ran more than 90,000 head of sheep annually.
        The wool from these flocks was freighted to Fort Benton and then East where it was in great
        demand by the large manufacturing houses. The company's holdings were sold in October 1907,
        to J.B. Long Company. </p>

      <p> Records. 1880-1907. .2 linear foot. This collection consists of a small quantity of
        correspondence and three bound volumes. One volume, a land book, is a record of the holdings
        of the Bower Brothers Sheep Company, providing such information as the locations of Bower
        land (the book contains plats showing townships and ranges), acreage, leases, improvements,
        survey status, and if the land was taxable. The two other volumes are records of sheep and
        wool which provide a seasonal record of the company's flocks, including counts, losses,
        purchases, prices, sales, pounds of wool, pelts sold, and the name of the herder. These
        materials were kept by Arthur W. Bower and were preserved by George M. Fowler who worked for
        the Bower Brothers Sheep Company as bookkeeper and purchasing agent. </p>
