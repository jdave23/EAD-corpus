      <p> William Simonton Bell was born Feb. 13th, 1894, in Harrisonburg,
		  Virginia. He entered the Polytechnic College of Pennsylvania in January of
		  1867, graduating with a degree in ministry in June of 1869. Mr. Bell came to
		  Helena, Montana, in 1887 to assume leadership of the Congregational Sunday
		  School and Congregational Home Missionary Society. In 1907 Mr. Bell was hired
		  by the Montana Historical Society to replace Laura Howey as head librarian. He
		  served in that capacity for three years. He then transferred to Spokane,
		  Washington, to become an ordained minister for the Presbyterian Synod of
		  Washington. William married Mary Amelia Kingsbury in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
		  on October 4, 1887. The couple remained in Sioux Falls for a short time, but
		  moved to Helena later in the year. The couple had their first and only child,
		  Martha Bell, on January 18, 1894. William S. Bell died in Baltimore, Maryland,
		  May 23, 1920 Martha was educated in the Helena area grade schools, but
		  completed high school in Harrisonburg, Virginia. She earned a masters degree
		  from Columbia University and a certificate of library science from Simmons College. She served as librarian for many university colleges across the
		  country, but retired from Randolph-Macon Woman's College after 35 years of
		  service. Martha Bell never married. She died on her 102nd birthday, Feb. 13th,
		  1997, in Roanoke, Virginia. </p>
