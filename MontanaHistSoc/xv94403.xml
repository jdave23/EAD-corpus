      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p> William L. Ford graduated from the University of Michigan law school in 1900 and began
        practicing law in White Sulphur Springs, Montana, in the same year. In 1904, he ran for
        Meagher County attorney and was defeated by N.B. Smith. In 1905, he became the city attorney
        and clerk, and in 1906 was elected county attorney, a position he held through 1912. He
        decided not to run for re-election in November of that year due to his father's illness. He
        devoted his time to running his father's ranch near White Sulphur Springs, and by 1913 had
        formed a partnership with Richard Manger. In 1918 or 1919 Ford renewed his law practice. He
        was elected district judge as a Republican in 1920. He had been active in the Masons and the
        Republican Party before his election, having been appointed county chairman of the Roosevelt
        Memorial Association in 1919 and chairman of the Republican Ways and Means Committee for
        Meagher County in 1920. William Ford married Margaret Young on December 25, 1907.</p>
      <p> Carl August Linn joined William Ford's law office in March 1912. While retaining the name
        of "Ford and Linn," Linn began operating as the firm's sole attorney when Ford turned his
        attention to ranching in 1912. Linn was elected county attorney in November 1912. </p>
      <p> Ford and Linn acted as collection agents for out-of-state and in-state firms and
        individuals. They also handled cases involving property disputes, water rights, sales of
        horses, claims involving the Montana Railroad Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad,
        divorce, probate, assault, etc., and collected rents for out-of-town landlords. </p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The collection includes general correspondence (1900-192O, undated), subject files (1948,
        undated), and miscellany (1917-1919).</p>
      <p> The collection consists almost entirely of the outgoing and incoming correspondence,
        arranged chronologically, of William L. Ford and Carl August Linn in their capacity as
        private attorneys. There is some correspondence directed to them, and to which they
        responded, as county attorneys. Also included in the correspondence are a few incoming
        letters (1904) to Max Waterman (Ford's predecessor as county attorney) and from Ford's
        brother Arthur and his sister Ida. The rest of the correspondence is from clients, other
        attorneys, judges, the Montana attorney general, and landlords whose properties Ford and
        Linn handled.</p>
      <p> The subject file concerns the Meagher County Health Council, an organization established
        by the Meagher County Planning Board to persuade a physician and dentist to take up practice
        in Meagher County, sponsor a health clinic, sponsor health education programs, etc. </p>
      <p> The miscellany consists of William Ford's Mason membership cards and a receipt for Ford's
        attorney annual license tax.</p>
