tack for Crow horses, Crow insignias, and photographers of the Crow people. Materials he collected and used for presentations, including notes, illustrations, and information
from a variety of sources, were all compiled into notebooks and identified by the name of the presentation. </p>

<p>This oral history project focused on the experiences of women who
have operated farms and/or ranches in Montana during all or a portion of their life captured in 37 interviews.
Each interview includes an audio recording and/or a typed transcript. You can
find the transcripts on the DNRC Conservation Districts' Bureau Website.</p>
<p> This oral history project builds community memories by
recording and preserving the oral histories of women ranchers and farmers. The
stories capture a look at their past and a glimpse into their daily lives as they
work and care for the land and animals. While each woman has a unique experience, a
number of common topics are discussed in all the oral histories. These topics
include what a typical day on the ranch/farm looks like, being a wife of a
rancher/farmer and raising their families on ranches/farms, working as a family to
operate the ranch/farm their involvement in their local communites, the community
schools they attended as children, the link between ranching and conservation, how
members of the agricultural community can strengthen ties with the public, what
role they feel women play in agriculture, and what the term "sense of place" means
to them.</p>
