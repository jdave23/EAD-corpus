<p> The Montana Student Nurses' Association
(MSNA) is a statewide voluntary membership organization composed of students
enrolled in nursing education programs, leading to licensing as registered
nurses, as well as already registered nurses continuing their education toward
a baccalaureate degree. Prior to 1947 student nurses attended annual
conventions of the Montana Nurses Association (MNA). In 1947 they formed their
own organization, an affiliate of the National Student Nurses Association
(NSNA). During the first years students developed bylaws and a structure for
the operation of the organization and held two statewide meetings a year, one
of which was held in conjunction with MNA. Since the 1950's a "Student Nurse of
the Year" award is given annually by MNA which recognizes a student for
outstanding nursing qualities, leadership ability, scholastic achievement and
contributions to MSNA. By 1952 all schools of nursing in the state were
represented in MSNA with a membership close to 100. Membership increased to 244
by 1960.. They published a newsletter, "White Caps" highlighting activities of
students in the several schools In 1998 the name of the newsletter was changed
to "Heart Beats" which had previously been the name of the MSU, Billings
chapter newsletter. Several nursing students attended NSNA conventions during
the 1950s but participation dropped during the 1960's and 1970's as hospital
schools of nursing closed. Interest in MSNA increased during the 1980's and
today there is a viable organization with chapters at the state's two
collegiate nursing programs, Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman and
Carroll College in Helena. At both the national and state levels, students now
plan programs and activities focusing on issues that affect them as students
and future members of the nursing profession. Several MSNA members have served
as officers of the national organization, including Wendy Blakley elected
secretary in 1974; Lynne Riley elected to the Board of Directors; and Julie
McGee, elected president 1992. </p>

<p> Elizabeth Lochrie was born July 1, 1890, in Deer Lodge, Montana, to
Frank and Mary Davey. Her father was an electrician for the City of Butte, and
her mother was a musician, dietician and teacher. She had three younger
brothers, Joe, Tom, and Clarence. She was educated in Deer Lodge and Butte,
later attending the Pratt Institute, in Brooklyn, N.Y. for teacher training.
Her impressive art education includes instruction from Wienold Reiss, Dorothy
Pucinneli, and Victor Arnotoff. </p>
<p> Mrs. Lochrie's art career spans from the 1920s to the 1950s. Her
patrons included the U.S. Treasury Department, the State of Montana, the Ford
Motor Company, New York Life Insurance Company, and the First National Bank of
Seattle. During 1924-1925 she painted eighteen children's murals for the
Montana State Hospital at Galen, Montana. After 1931 she specialized in Native
American portraits, particularly of Blackfoot tribal members, having produced
more that a thousand water colors, oils, murals, and sculptures. In 1937 she
won the Treasury Department's competition to paint a mural for the new Dillon
post office with "News from the States" depicting the arrival of mail to that
community in 1869. From 1937 to 1939 Lochrie also painted historic murals in
the post offices at Burley and Saint Anthony, Idaho. She studied with Wienold
Reiss at Glacier National Park and from 1936 to 1939 she was staff artist for
the Great Northern Railroad in Glacier National Park. Her artistic honors also
include arts show in New York City and at the prestigious Whitney Museum in
Wyoming.</p>
<p> Elizabeth Lochrie's ties to the Native American tribes in Montana
extended beyond her artwork. She frequently used the fees charged for her
lectures to purchase clothing and other necessaries for needy members of
Montana's tribes, especially the Blackfoot. She was adopted by the Blackfeet
and given the name Netchitaki which translates to "Woman Alone on Her Way".</p>
<p> Elizabeth Davey married Arthur James Lochrie on June 14, 1913. The
couple had two daughters, Betty Jane and Helena; and one son, Arthur James, Jr.
Elizabeth Lochrie died in 1981. </p>

<p> Bower Brothers Sheep Company owned and operated in partnership one of the largest sheep
companies in the state of Montana. Originally from New York, two of the Bowers, Arthur and
Edward, arrived in 1880 to homestead on Surprise Creek located in the Judith Basin near
Stanford, Montana. In September of that year, they made two purchases of sheep near Deer
Lodge and drove the flock, numbering 1052 head, to their ranch. A third brother, Calvin,
arrived from the East in 1881 and was taken into the firm which became known as Bower
Brothers Sheep Company. The Bowers gradually increased their holdings, purchasing water
rights, buying out homesteads, and leasing government lands. At one point, their 50,000
acres, extending toward Arrow Creek and Denton, ran more than 90,000 head of sheep annually.
The wool from these flocks was freighted to Fort Benton and then East where it was in great
demand by the large manufacturing houses. The company's holdings were sold in October 1907,
to J.B. Long Company. </p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Lee Metcalf was born in 1911 in Stevensville, Montana. He attended
Montana State University for one year and transferred to Stanford University
where he majored in history and economics. He graduated from Montana State
University law school in 1936 and entered private practice. He was elected
representative to the 25th Montana Legislative Assembly from Ravalli County in
the same year. In 1937 Metcalf resigned from the legislature to accept
appointment as a Montana assistant attorney general.</p>
<p>During his tenure as an assistant attorney general, Metcalf campaigned
extensively for Attorney General Harrison Freebourn who was seeking election to
the U.S. Senate in the 1940 primary. During this period Metcalf also
represented the Montana State Congress of Industrial Organizations Council from
1938 until 1941. In 1941, following Freebourn's defeat in the primary, Metcalf
returned to private practice in Hamilton. Metcalf enlisted in the army in 1942
and was later commissioned. Following the war he served as a military
government officer in Germany where he helped set up the civilian court and
occupation police system. He also supervised repatriation and drafted the
ordinances for and supervised local elections. </p>
<p>Metcalf was elected associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in
1946, where he served until he was elected to the United States House of
Representatives in 1952, succeeding Mike Mansfield in Montana's First (Western)
Congressional District. After serving four terms in the House, Metcalf was
elected to the Senate in 1960, succeeding James E. Murray.</p>
<p>Although Metcalf is best known for his work to protect the natural
environment and regulate utilities, he composed and supported a wide variety of
legislation. His prodigious legislative accomplishments are testimony to his
parliamentary acumen.</p>
<p>Lee Metcalf worked throughout his career to protect the nation's
natural resources from both wanton exploitation and destruction. He was an
early proponent of water and air pollution control; research on the harmful
effects of pesticides, strip mining, and highway construction; regulation of
timber cutting and grazing; alternative energy development; and many other
conservation issues. His efforts to preserve the nation's wild lands and rivers
were productive and lauded by national conservation organizations. As a
long-time member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Metcalf helped
establish many wildlife refuges.</p>
<p>While Lee Metcalf was an ardent protector of the natural environment,
he believed in the responsible development of resources. He supported rural
cooperative efforts, public power projects, and diverse types of assistance to
independent workers in agriculture and minerals.</p>
<p>Metcalf advocated the use of government resources to redress the
injustices of an imperfect society and to broaden and strengthen access to
information for all individuals. He proposed and worked for legislation
concerning Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and veterans' benefits; aid
to libraries, schools and small businesses; minimum wage laws; work safety
laws; job training programs; consumer protection; and the return of control
over their own lives to Native Americans.</p>
<p>Metcalf's long, adverserial relationship with the Montana Power
Company and other utilities stemmed from his belief that the power industry
held a monopolistic, unregulated control of an essential product. Lee Metcalf's
and Vic Reinemer's book Overcharge delineates their position that the utilities
exert tremendous influence throughout American society, yet are not subject to
the democratic election process and are controlled by a small group of
profiteers.</p>
<p>Closely related to Metcalf's efforts to regulate utility companies was
his opposition to the growth of "corporate statism." Especially in his capacity
as chairman of the Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting,
Management, and Expenditure (later Reports, Accounting, and Management), and in
close association with Vic Reinemer, Metcalf worked for disclosure of
meaningful information, such as interlocking directorships, regarding corporate
activity in regulated industries.</p>
<p>Congressional colleagues respected Lee Metcalf's thorough knowledge of
the workings of government, knowledge which he used astutely throughout his
career. In 1959 Metcalf helped establish the Democratic Study Group, an
organization which instructed, mobilized, and coordinated liberal Democrats. As
a member of the Government Operations Committee, Metcalf worked for many years,
especially after Watergate activities spotlighted such concerns, to reorganize
government to improve its efficiency and honesty.</p>
<p>Lee Metcalf enjoyed the cooperation of an able staff. He also provided
experience to as many interns, the majority of whom were Montanans, as his time
and office space would allow.</p>
<p>Vic Reinemer joined Metcalf's staff in 1961 and worked closely with
him until Metcalf's death. Reinemer was born in Circle, Montana, in 1923, and
graduated from Montana State University with a B.A. in journalism in 1948. He
worked as a newspaper editor in Washington, D.C., for Freedom amp; Union
Magazine in 1950 and 1951, and in North Carolina for the Charlotte News from
1950 until 1955. From 1955 until 1960 Reinemer worked as executive secretary
for Senator Murray and then served until 1973 in the same position for Senator
Metcalf. From 1973 until Metcalf's death in 1978, Reinemer was staff director
of the Senate Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting,
Management, and Expenditures, which changed its name in 1975 to Reports,
Accounting, and Management. Reinemer concentrated his energies on utility
regulation and corporate ownership reporting.</p>
<p>Other long-time influential staff members include Merrill "Brit"
Englund, Metcalf's administrative assistant, who worked for United Press
Internatinnal and the Associated Press in Helena for six years before joining
Metcalf's staff in 1953; Peggy McLaughlin, personal secretary, who worked for
the Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Montana Attorney
General, and for Senator Murray before beginning her years with Metcalf; and
Dorothy Tannenbaum, legislative assistant with special knowledge of education
and Native American affairs. Ted Roe replaced Vic Reinemer as executive
secretary in 1973. These staff members' contribution to Metcalf's work can most
easily be noted by the many letters in the collection which they composed.</p>
<p>Lee Metcalf married Donna Hoover in 1938. He died in January 1978
during what he declared would be his last Senate term.</p>

between Collins and Choteau. He then went into ranching, raising cattle,
horses, sheep, and wheat on a desert land claim half way between Choteau and
Bynum. He was involved in the Teton Co-operative Reservoir Company, the Brady
Townsite Company, and the Brady Irrigation Company. He served two terms as
president of the Montana Wool Growers Association, and one term as president of
the Montana Livestock Production Credit Association. Larson was also active in
Republican politics. He served as assessor of Teton County from 1900 to 1904,
was in the state Senate from 1911 to 1921 and from 1927 to 1937, and ran for
the U.S. Senate in 1936. While in the Legislature, Larson sponsored the bill
splitting Teton County into three counties; introduced the first Blue Sky Law,
regulating the sale of stocks; and helped establish the 19th Judicial District.
Larson was active in several fraternal orders, including the Masons, the
Knights Templar, the Helena Consistory of the Scottish Rite, the Algeria Shrine
Temple, the Red Cross of Constantine, and the Royal Order of Jesters. Larson
married Helen Stowe in 1902. They had two daughters Alva Gertrude and Harriet
Helen. Alva married Wilfred Armstrong, who succeeded Larson in managing the
ranch; Harriett married the noted Choteau author A.B. Guthrie Jr. Thomas O.

<head>Historical Note:</head>
<p> In 1876 Walker Brothers, a Salt Lake City, Utah, mining and banking firm, hired Marcus
Daly to investigate silver mining properties in Butte, Montana. The Walkers and Daly
purchased the Alice Mine and incorporated as the Alice Gold and Silver Mining Company. Daly
served as general superintendent until he sold his interest in the company in 1880.</p>
<p> That same year he bought the Anaconda Mine, located by Michael Hickey in October 1875.
Hickey, unable to keep up annual assessment work on the mine, had sold half interest in it
to Charles Larabie, a banker. Larabie brought in Daly as a third partner to sink a shaft.
Daly got an option from his partners to purchase the property for $30,000 and tried to
interest the Walker Brothers in investing in it. When they declined, Daly went to San
Francisco and secured the backing of James Haggin, George H. Hearst, and Lloyd Tevis. The
four men operated the mine under a partnership arrangement as a silver property. The small
quantities of copper which the mine produced were shipped to Swansea, Wales, for processing.
In late 1882 a rich copper vein was struck.</p>
<p> As copper became the main product of the mine, Daly decided to build his own smelter
instead of continuing the expensive procedure of shipping ore to Wales. He located a
suitable site on Warm Springs Greek, twenty six miles west of Butte. He officially platted
the new town of Anaconda on October 27, 1883, and began the construction of what became
known as the Upper Works. Transportation of the Butte ores to the new smelter was provided
by the narrow-gauge Montana Railway. This railroad, under the name Montana Union Railway,
was later operated jointly by the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific companies. The original
500-ton capacity mill, completed in 1884, quickly became inadequate and, within two years,
was expanded to 1000 tons. During the early years, only the initial stages of treatment were
done at the Anaconda Reduction Works, with the concentrated ore still being shipped to Wales
for refining. To eliminate this necessity, Daly built an experimental electrolytic refinery,
completed in 1888. He also built a second reduction plant, known as the Lower Works, a mile
east of the Upper Works. Fire destroyed this plant shortly after its completion. Daly
quickly rebuilt on an even larger scale.</p>
<p> While Daly was developing the Anaconda Reduction Works, he was also expanding the basis of
his mining operations. Until 1891 the Haggin-Hearst-Tegin-Daly syndicate had operated its
Montana properties as a partnership under the name Anaconda Gold and Silver Mining Company.
In January 1891 when it incorporated as the Anaconda Mining Company, the company owned four
groups of mines: the Anaconda Group, the Mountain Consolidated Group, the Union Consolidated
Group, and the Anglo-Saxon Group. Daly, Hearst, and Tegin owned only the minimum shares
required by law. Haggin held the remainder in trust. The Anaconda Mining Company reinvested
all profits in building its facilities instead of giving dividends.</p>
<p> From 1891 to 1895 the Anaconda Mining Company began the process of consolidating its
control over its services and sources of raw materials. Angered by the Montana Union
Railway's high charges and inefficient service, Daly built his own railroad, the Butte,
Anaconda, and Pacific, to connect the smelter with the mines. The Big Blackfoot Milling
Company and the Bitter Root Development Company were created as allied companies to provide
Anaconda with needed timber. The Castner Coal and Coke Company, with Daly as a minor
stockholder, provided the company with coal. The Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company was
formed to meet the smelter's foundry and hardware needs. When a larger smelter was needed to
meet increased treatment requirements at Anaconda, the Washoe Copper Company was created to
build the New Reduction Works, which was then operated by Anaconda under a lease
arrangement. </p>
<p> In 1895 the company was again reorganized, this time as the Anaconda Copper Mining
Company, with a capitalization of $30,000,000. Haggin's trust-held properties were
transferred to the new company and, over the next year, several of the allied companies were
brought in as subsidiaries. </p>
<p> In 1899 H.H. Rogers and A.C. Burrage, officers of the Standard Oil Company and
stockholders in the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, urged the union of all Butte mining
operations under one holding company. In April 1899 the Amalgamated Copper Company was
formed to acquire the stock of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company and its subsidiary
companies including the Big Blackfoot Milling Company, the Bitter Root Development Company,
the Diamond Coal and Coke Company, the Tuttle Manufacturing and Supply Company, and the
Washoe Copper Company. In addition, the Amalgamated acquired several other previously
unallied Butte mining companies including the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and
Silver Mining Company and the Parrot Silver and Copper Company. The Amalgamated Copper
Company was simply a holding company and was not involved in management of the various
companies, which continued to operate independently. The most important of the companies
brought under the Amalgamated umbrella was the Boston and Montana. It owned several
important mining claims in Butte (including the Mountain View and East Colusa) and a smelter
in Great Falls. This smelter, built in 1892, duplicated many of the facilities in Anaconda,
handling all levels of ore processing from concentration to refining. </p>
<p> In 1910 the Anaconda Copper Mining Company took over most of the other companies in the
Amalgamated Copper Company, all Amalgamated subsidiaries becoming departments within
Anaconda. One of the most important results of this reorganization was that it allowed the
two major reduction works at Anaconda and Great Falls to coordinate their operations.
Anaconda continued to handle the early stages of concentrating and smelting, while Great
Falls gradually phased out these operations and specialized in refining. All stages prior to
refining were finally eliminated from Great Falls in 1919. At the same time, Great Falls
increased its refining capacity by the addition of an electrolytic zinc plant. In 1915 the
Amalgamated Copper Company ended its corporate existence.</p>
<p> During the period that Anaconda Copper Mining Company was consolidating its Montana
operations, it was also expanding towards its goal of controlling copper "from mine to
consumer." In 1913 the company acquired the International Smelting and Refining Company,
which owned smelters at Tooele, Utah, and Miami, Arizona, as well as the Raritan Copper
Works in New Jersey. In 1922 Anaconda bought the American Brass Company in Waterbury,
Connecticut, one of the major producers of finished copper products. Also in the early
192Os, Anaconda invested in Chile, acquiring the Chuquicamata copper mine from the
Guggenheim family, as well as the smaller, but important, Potrerillos mine. It acquired from
the heirs of Georg von Giesche a large zinc treatment plant at Katowice, Poland. In 1928
W.A. Clark's heirs sold his Montana companies to Anaconda. In 1955, in recognition of the
wide range of corporate operations, the company name was changed to The Anaconda Company. </p>
<p> The company prospered during World War II and the years following. Several ambitious
projects, including the Greater Butte Project to expand underground operations and the
Berkeley Pit to commence surface mining, were undertaken. In 1971, however, Chile
nationalized the Chuquicamata and other American-owned mines. This, along with low copper
prices brought about a financial crisis. Forced to meet financial deadlines in New York, the
company sold its entire lumber operation, including thousands of square miles of Montana
timber land and the Bonner mill, to Champion International. This liquidation, however, did
not solve the company's financial problems, and in 1979 the company was purchased by the
Atlantic-Richfield Company (ARCO). Over the next few years, ARCO shut down its entire
Montana operation, including the Berkeley Pit in Butte, the Anaconda Smelter, and the Great
Falls Refinery. </p>

<p> Cornelius B. Nolan was born December 24, 1855, in County Limerick, Ireland. He was
educated in Dublin. In the fall of 1873, at seventeen, Nolan immigrated to the United
States. Nolan settled in Oswego, New York, where he worked as a day laborer with a railroad
section crew, while pursuing his studies at Oswego Academy. In 1877, Nolan moved to Port
Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and worked in a tannery for two years. A year later, he went to St.
Louis, Missouri, to visit his brother, Thomas. He remained there five years studying law in
Roger Foster's law office and at the St. Louis Law School. In 1884, he was admitted to the
practice of law in the Missouri courts. After a brief period working as a stenographer for
an agricultural house in Chicago, Nolan moved to Montana to become private secretary to the
general manager of the freight and passenger service of the Northern Pacific Railroad.
However, not long after his arrival in Montana, he resigned his railroad position to become
official court reporter for the First Judicial District of Montana, which included Lewis and
Clark, Jefferson, and Beaverhead counties. Reporting for Judges N.W. McConnell and Henry L.
Blake, Nolan received training which was of great value in his subsequent career. Nolan was
elected County Attorney of Lewis and Clark County in 1889. Chosen on the Democratic ticket,
he held the position by re-election for five years. In 1896, he was elected Attorney General
of Montana. During this four-year term, Nolan took charge of a special grand jury
investigation of the alleged bribery of legislators. In 1910, Nolan was elected to the
Montana House of Representatives and served one term. While County Attorney, Nolan began to
build a private law practice that would eventually become an extensive civil and criminal
practice. Initially he worked with John Bean and then, between 1901 and 1904, he was a
partner with attorney Albert I. Loeb. In 1906, he formed a partnership with Senator Thomas
J. Walsh, which expanded to include William Scallon. In addition to his law work, Nolan
invested in mining and real estate, acquiring ranch properties in Broadwater, Park, and
Wheatland counties. He was also an active participant in many organizations. He served, with
the rank of colonel, on General Toole's staff in the state militia. He also belonged to
several fraternal organizations, serving as Masonic Grand Master in 1909. In 1894, Nolan
married Harriet Shober. Harriet, niece of Helena attorney John H. Shober, Sr., was a native
of Dodge County, Minnesota. During the 1870s and 1880s, she had taught in the public schools
of Adair County, Iowa. In 1887, she moved to Helena, Montana, to live with her uncle. After
her marriage to Cornelius Nolan, she became active in Helena community projects, Democratic
Party politics, and the work of the American Red Cross. Cornelius Nolan died in Butte on
June 24, 1922, and his wife Harriet died seven years later, August 23, 1929, at Lake
McDonald. </p>

<p> John E. Dougherty was born in Perth, Ontario, Canada, in 1841. He taught school near
Ottawa for four years. In 1870 he came to Montana Territory and taught school for a year. In
1871 he bought Billy Quinn's general store in Radersburg, which at that time was a bustling
mining town. The J.E. Dougherty store sold general merchandise and farm implements to the
local farmers and miners, until it closed in 1886. In addition to the store, Dougherty had a
farm in the Crow Creek valley. Daugherty married Eliza Jane Clark on February 7, 1875. They
had three children. John E. Dougherty died in an accident in 1905. </p>

<p> The Montana State Board of Health was created by the state legislature in 1901. One of the
first diseases the Board was asked to study was Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (also known as
tick fever, since the disease is spread by wood ticks) which was occurring in the Bitterroot
Valley. Early work with the disease was done by Dr. T.D. Tuttle of the State Board of
Health and Dr. Howard T. Ricketts, who was sponsored by the American Medical Association in
1906, and by the Montana legislature in succeeding years. Work on ticks and their control by
"dipping" domestic animals and the killing of rodents upon which tick lived was done at
Montana Agricultural College and Experiment Station in Bozeman by Dr. R.A. Cooley. In 1913
the Montana State Board of Entomology was created and charged with studying Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever and methods for its control. The Board was composed of the secretary of the
State Board of Health (serving as chairman), the state veterinarian, and the state
entomologist (serving as secretary). During the years from 1913 to 1931, the membership of
the Board was W.F. Cogswell, W.J. Butler, and R.A. Cooley. Dr. Cooley also conducted tick
research in Africa in the 1920s. R.R. Parker served as assistant entomologist and conducted
field research on ticks from 1915 until 1922. Throughout the early years of research on tick
fever, representatives from the United States Public Health Service worked in Montana in
cooperation with the State Board of Health and the State Board of Entomology. In 1927 the
Montana Legislative Assembly appropriated $60,000 for the construction of a laboratory in
Hamilton to provide facilities for the study of the disease and the search for vaccines to
prevent the disease. In 1930 the state Boards assisted in the formation of the Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever Committee composed to representatives from other states having
documented cases of the disease. This committee requested that the United States Public
Health Service "take over and assume full control of investigations of tick-borne, human
diseases." In 1932 the laboratory facilities at Hamilton were sold to the federal government
and work on tick fever was continued by federal employees. </p>

<p>Arlyne Estelle Cohn was born on January 14, 1926 in Buffalo, New York to Charles and Anne Cohn. Her interest in politics began early in life,
and she aspired to one day run for U.S. Congress but then realized she would have to mortgage her house to finance a campaign.
While attending the University of Buffalo’s Cadet Nurses Training program, Arlyne met her future husband Harold “Rick” Reichert,
on December 25, 1942. They married in 1945 after he returned from serving overseas in the U.S. military. The couple moved to Great Falls and had five children:
Cheryl, Greg, Robert, Claire, and Roger. Reichert did not continue her nursing training because at that time married women were not accepted for training
at either hospital in Great Falls.
</p>
<p>In 1967, Reichert began working at the McLaughlin Research Institute with Dr. Jack Stimpfling as the executive secretary and technical editor
of the Transplantation Journal. Reichert’s involvement in local government began after she moved to Great Falls and served as a Library Trustee
and President of the Friends of the Great Falls Public Library. She was also a member of the League of Women Voters, serving on both the Local and State Boards.
</p>
<p>In 1970, Reichert ran for the Montana state legislature and lost, but the following year, was elected as a 1972 Constitutional Convention delegate.
She served on the Legislative Committee and pushed for a unicameral legislature, although Montana voters decided against it when the new Constitution was ratified. </p>
<p>After the Convention, Reichert remained active in Great Falls local government. She participated in getting the local government structure changed
from a mayor-alderman form to commission-manager system. In 1974, she was elected to the Cascade County Study Commission. She also served as a
legislative analyst for television news and Regional Vice President of the National Municipal League. </p>
<p>In 1979, Reichert was elected to the Montana State House of Representatives and served one term. During that time, she worked on the topics of a
unicameral legislature and separation of powers. Reichert retired as Assistant Director of the McLaughlin Institute in 1989. Arlyne Reichert remains
active in local politics and historic preservation efforts, including preservation of the Great Falls 10th Street Bridge. Her efforts to save the bridge
led her to establish Preservation Cascade, Inc., which she serves on as secretary-treasurer. She also served as a National Civic League council member
and on the Montana Capitol Restoration Committee. </p>
<p>Her husband passed away from cancer in 1968.</p>

<p> The original Helena Cemetery Association was incorporated on June 11, 1887, by Andrew J.
Fisk, Ansalem J. Davidson, William Muth, and others, in response to a lack of space
available in existing cemeteries. A year later the Helena City Council appointed a committee
to study the matter. In May 1890, after several years of considering various proposals for
locations and facilities, F.R. Wallace, as trustee for the City of Helena, purchased the
present site of the cemetery from Evan and Amelia Harris for $22,220. In August 1890 a
second Helena Cemetery Association was incorporated by P.D. Grommon, John B. Clayberg, A.M.
Thornburgh and E.C. Richards to acquire land; improve and beautify it; lay out and construct
lots, roadways, and water systems; sell lots; and all other acts "connected with the
maintenance and operation of a Cemetery..." The Association was incorporated for $250,000
and stockholders included many of the most prominent names in Helena society. One of the
first acts of the new Association was to purchase the property for the cemetery from trustee
F.R. Wallace, for "$1 and other valuable considerations" among which was the full $250,000
worth of capital stock. Wallace then transferred back to the Association $61,000 worth of
stock to be sold as needed to finance improvements. One such improvement was a street
railway to the site, constructed by Peter Winne. Under the leadership of Winne, who became
President in December 1892, the association developed the site, installed a water system,
planted trees and shrubs, and sold lots. A permanent Endowment Fund and a Perpetual Care and
Improvement Fund were also established.</p>
<p> The Helena Cemetery was renamed the Forestvale Cemetery around 1901. The Helena Cemetery
Association's corporate charter expired in 1910, but the affairs of the Association were
never formally closed. The Association continued to meet until 1913. Secretary and Manager
Henry Winter had by this time acquired, through direct ownership and proxies, control of
over 99% of the stock. He assumed personal management of the property. In May 1918, in
response to rapidly rising lot prices, poor maintenance, and accusations of mismanagement,
William Muth and other trustees of the Permanent Care and Improvement Fund and Endowment
Fund filed suit against Henry Winter and other trustees to force them to account for the
funds. Muth and other lot owners and relatives of people buried in the cemetery met in June
of 1919 to form a new association. They selected the name Forestvale Cemetery Association
and proceeded to file a condemnation suit to force Winter to sell the property. The court
eventually set the price at $35,000 and the property was conveyed to the Forestvale Cemetery
Association. Over the years the endowment funds which were based on a percentage of the
original lot purchase prices became inadequate to maintain the cemetery, which fell into
serious disrepair.</p>
<p> In 1965 a concerted effort was made to clean up the grounds by removing excess trees and
shrubs, improving the irrigation system, filling sunking plots, etc. However by the late
1980s the cemetery was again in poor condition. In a special election on April 2, 1991,
School District #1 voted to fund a cemetery district to provide permanent upkeep by Lewis
and Clark County. </p>

<p> The 1st Regiment of Montana Volunteers was formed in July 1867 by executive order of
Governor Green Clay Smith. The formation of the regiment was in response to the perceived
increased threat of attacks by Sioux and other tribes. The regiment was divided into nine
companies under the general command of Col. Thomas Thoroughman. He was directed by the
governor to "send out from time to time such forces as may be deemed necessary to chastise
marauding and guerilla bands of Indians." Quartermaster and Commissary officers were
appointed to secure needed supplies. By August, Neil Howie had taken command of the forces.

<p> The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America was founded in 1881 by Peter J. McGuire and Gustav Luebkert.
In April of that year the two men formed a provisional committee and started
the newspaper The Carpenter to promote the idea of a national union of
carpenters. The first convention of the Brotherhood was held in Chicago in
August of 1881. Like many unions of the period the Brotherhood grew out of a
tradition of social democracy and socialism. The early preamble reflected this
in its call for a "Cooperative Commonwealth" with trade unions as its
cornerstone. The union's immediate goals included wage and hour demands and
death and sickness benefits. The union grew rapidly; its 1881 membership of
2000 expanded to 50,000 by 1890, and 100,000 by 1900. In May 1889 an
organizational meeting was held in Anaconda, Montana, to form a local
carpenters' union. The first formal meeting of the new Local #88, of the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America was held on June 6, 1889 by
nine charter members. Anthony Blise was elected president and George Owen,
recording secretary. The reform ideology of the national union was reflected in
the local bylaws, the preamble to which stated that "We hold it as a sacred
duty to posterity to use our utmost endeavor to replace the present wage system
by cooperative industry and to claim our inalienable right to the means of
living which are inherent in the soil." The Anaconda local bylaws fined members
for patronizing Chinese businessmen. Both the preamble and the anti-Chinese
clause were eliminated in later bylaws. The union's main concerns were
promoting the eight hour day, protecting wages, providing sick and death
insurance, enforcing union shop conditions, and protecting the jurisdiction of
the union against other unions. In 1915 the carpenters formed a statewide
organization, the Montana State Council of Carpenters, to coordinate the work
of all the locals in Montana. The carpenters' union was also active in the
Montana State Federation of Labor, the Montana State AFL-CIO, the Montana State
Apprenticeship Council, and the Non-ferrous Metals Council. The latter was a
joint negotiating team of unions in the regional copper industry.

<p>John Wilson Fulton was born in Massachusetts on October 26, 1872, the son of Charles
J. and Mary Anne (Wilson) Fulton. About 1892 he moved to Helena, Montana, with his
father, where they invested in mining properties. Their investments included the Big
Ox Mining Company, the Plymouth Gold Mining Company at Gould, and other mines. The
Big Ox Mining Company firm was incorporated on October 16, 1896 by John, Charles, and
M.A.H. Fulton. They purchased the mining properties of the Big ox Mining and
Reduction Company near Marysville, Montana. The company operated the Big Ox Mine and
the Golconda Mine until about 1916, when the corporate charter expired. On May 17,
1920, John and Charles re-incorporated under the same name. The company went
bankrupt and in 1926 the Fultons organized Montana Mines (an Express Trust) to buy
the properties at sheriff's sales. They continued to operate the properties until
the mid 1930s. The Northern Angora Goat Company was formed as the Northern Angora
Goat &amp; Live Stock Co. in 1900. The company's home office was the Pittsburgh Block
in Helena, Montana, with the Mohair Sales Depot and Eastern Office in Boston,
Massachusetts. The original officers included Charles W. Hoffman of Bozeman as
president, W.C. Bailey as vice-president, George F. Thompson of Washington, D.C., as
treasurer, Herbert Hammond of Chicago, Illinois, as secretary, and John Wilson
Fulton of Helena, as manager. By 1904 Charles J. Fulton, took over the position as
manager. He held this position until his death in February 1928. John continued to
manage the company after his father's death. The firm advertised itself as the
"largest breeders of long mohair Angoras in America," and promoted the goats as a
new farm industry. C.J. John Wilson Fulton worked for the company from its office in
the Pittsburg Block until his death on April 17, 1966. He was preceded in by his

<p> State officers for the Young Democratic Club of Montana were first elected in 1933. The
organization was affiliated with the Young Democratic Clubs of America. The purpose of the
organization was to contribute to the growth and influence of the Democratic Party, to
develop leadership, and to maintain and promote harmony within the party ranks. The
membership was organized in county clubs of Young Democrats chartered by the Executive
Committee of the Young Democratic Club of Montana. Officers were elected for one year by a
majority vote of delegates to the annual state convention. Elected officers included a
president, a vice-president, a secretary, and a treasurer. Members in good standing of any
chartered club were eligible to hold state offices provided they were over twenty-one and
under thirty-five years of age. The State Executive Committee was composed of two state
committeemen and two state committeewomen elected by county clubs from each congressional
district, the elected officers of the organization, and the state's representatives
("national committeeman and committeewoman") appointed to attend the annual convention of
the Young Democratic Clubs of America. State and national annual conventions were governed
by votes of members of chartered clubs. The major activity of the state organization between
1936 and 1938 was to promote memberships in local county chartered clubs. County clubs held
meetings and sponsored social events to raise funds to defray the cost of charter membership
to the Young Democratic Club of Montana. In 1936 Gail Meagher Brown of Helena became
secretary of the Young Democratic Club of Montana. In 1937 she was appointed committeewoman
to the national organization, as Montana's representative. In 1938 Gail Brown also served as

<p> The 1983 Montana Legislative Assembly passed Senate Joint Resolution 21 recognizing the
approaching Montana Statehood Centennial and urging the governor to make recommendations to
the 1985 Legislative Assembly on formal centennial observances. In response to this
resolution, Governor Ted Schwinden appointed Lieutenant Governor George Turman to coordinate
the official response. Turman concentrated on three areas: volunteer citizen involvement,
interagency cooperation, and communication with other centennial states in the region. To
encourage citizen participation, Turman created "The Eighty-Niners", a volunteer
organization with local chapters around the state. The Eighty-Niners solicited suggestions
concerning possible celebrations, published a newsletter, and its local affiliates sponsored
many local events. The Centennial Commission sponsored several projects among which were the
issuing of special Centennial license plates to finance grants for local projects; the
Century Citizens Project, honoring Montanans who would be 100 years old by 1989; and the
Centennial Acres Project, selling certificates of "ownership" in several State Parks and
sites. The main focus of the work of the Centennial Office, however, became the licensing of
officially sanctioned products, events, and projects. The Office received 1,068 applications
for licensing, most of which were approved. These applications included museum exhibits,
musical events, parades, rodeos, plays, pageants, tree plantings, art work, books, belt
buckles, lapel pins, baseball caps, etc. Money from license plate sales funded a small
number of grants to worthy projects. The Centennial celebration's grand finale was the
Centennial Ball held in Helena November 11, 1989. The final event of the year-long
celebration was the burying of a time capsule on January 23, 1990. </p>

<p> J.H. McKnight and Company was founded by Joseph Hempstead McKnight during the years
following 1870. McKnight, originally from Dubuque, Iowa, came west in the 1860s in the
company of Thomas C. Power, a business associate. Before forming his own company, McKnight
worked as clerk at sutler stores at Fort Buford, at Camp Cook on the Judith River, and at
Fort Benton, where he arrived in August 1866. In 1871, McKnight, assisted by the financial
backing of T.C. Power, took charge of the trading post at Fort Shaw, Montana. Fort Shaw,
located at Sun River Crossing twenty miles above the mouth of the Sun River, was established
in 1867. An infantry post, it served as the regimental headquarters in the military
department of the Territory of Montana. It was designed to protect settlers and prospectors,
to prevent the invasion of Blackfeet treaty land, and to keep the route between Fort Benton
and the Helena gold fields open. As the licensed post trader, J.H. McKnight and Company
served the military, plus trappers, area settlers, Indian agents from the Blackfeet Agency,
and the Northwest Mounted Police of Canada. In its operation, J.H. McKnight and Company was
very closely connected with T.C. Power and Brother at Fort Benton, the two owners being
personal friends and business allies throughout McKnight's life. The firms supplied each
other, shared orders, provided transportation for commodities, and conferred on the prices
and availability of goods. In 1887, McKnight sold the Fort Shaw traders' post and moved his
operation to Great Falls. There, J.H. McKnight and Company served as "wholesale and retail
grocers and dealers in agricultural implements, wagons, harness, and building materials," at
the corner of Central Avenue and Third Street in the McKnight Block. The organization of the
firm was formalized in 1894 when bylaws were adopted, stock was issued, and the name was
altered to J.H. McKnight Company. Originally there were only four stockholders: T.C. Power
and J.H. McKnight (499 shares each) and F. George Heldt and C.B. Power (one share each).
These men also served as the Company's Board of Trustees, alternating the offices of the
Board among themselves. When McKnight died on January 20, 1903, the other three trustees
continued the business until the expiration of the J.H. McKnight Company charter on June 4,
1914. At that time the corporation was dissolved and all company property was sold, with the
assets of the firm totaling more than $108,000. This money was dispersed to the
corporation's stockholders. </p>

<p> The Montana Attorney General was originally authorized under the Organic Act of 1864 which
established Montana as a territory. The 1889 Constitution established the office as an
elective executive office. The duties of the Attorney General included prosecuting and
defending all cases to which the State or any county was a party; enforcing judgements
reached in such cases; supervising county attorneys; giving opinions on legal issues to
state agencies, the legislature, and county officials; to bid on property in the name of the
state; and to serve ex officio on a variety of boards and commissions including the Board of
Examiners, the Board of Land Commissioners, the Board of Education, the Board of
Equalization, the Board of State Prison Commissioners, the Board of Pardons, and others.
While the specifics of the duties have changed over the years, the general principal
that the Attorney General is the attorney for the state, has remained constant. As the
complexities of state government have increased the Attorney General has acquired a staff of
Assistant Attorneys General to handle most of the work. Many of these are assigned to
specific agencies. Among the Attorneys General during the period of these records were
Albert J. Galen (1905-1913), S.C. Ford (1917-1921), L.A. Foot (1924-1933), Harrison J.

<p> The 1972 Montana Constitution required the legislature to "...provide procedures requiring
each local government unit or combination of units to review its structure and submit one
alternative form of government to the qualified electors ... " by 1976. The 1974 legislature
accordingly established the nine-member State Commission on Local Government. Harold Gerke
chaired the Commission, and George Boulisman was the director until July 1974 when Dale
Harris assumed that position. In its three year existence the Commission was required to:
make a detailed study of local government structure, powers, services, and finances, and
state-local relations; prepare a revised code of local government law; consult and assist
local government study commissions; publicize the voter review of local government; and
publish reports and make recommendations to the governor and legislature. The legislature
concurrently funded community education projects to be carried out by such bodies as the
University of Montana's Bureau of Government Research, Montana State University's
Cooperative Extension Service, the Montana Chamber of Commerce, and the League of Women
Voters of Montana.</p>
<p> One hundred eighty-two city, town, and county local government study commissions,

<p> The Montana Power Company was incorporated on December 12, 1912, as a result of a
merger of the Butte Electric and Power Company, the Madison River Power Company, the
United Missouri River Power Company, and the Billings and Eastern Montana Power
Company. The merger was brought about by John D. Ryan, head of the Anaconda Copper
Mining Company, and John G. Morony, president of the First National Bank of Great
Falls. Each of the constituent companies had been formed as the result of mergers of
earlier companies.</p>
<p> The Butte Electric and Power Company, was formed in 1901 to take over the assets and
liabilities of the Butte Lighting and Power Company, which was, in turn, the
successor to several local Butte power generating plants, including the Brush
Electric Light and Power Company, the Silver Bow Electric Light Company, the Butte
Electric Light and Power Company, the Silver Bow Electric Light and Power Company,
the Butte General Electric Company, the Phoenix Electric Company, the Butte Gas
Light and Coke Company, and others. The Butte Electric and Power Company's properties
also included a hydro-electric power station on the Big Hole River from The Montana
Power Transmission Company, successor to the Big Hole Improvement Company; and a
majority interest in several Great Falls companies including the Great Falls Street
Railway Company, the Boston and Great Falls Electric and Power Company, and the
Great Falls Electric Properties.</p>
<p> The Missouri River Electric and Power Company, was organized in 1911, as a successor
to the United Missouri River Power Company (UMRPC), which had gone into
receivership. The UMRPC was itself a merger of the Missouri River Power Company, the
Capital City Power Company, and the Helena Power Transmission Company. By 1912 the
successor company owned most of the hydro-electric facilities on the Missouri River,
including the first Canyon Ferry Dam completed in 1898 by the Helena Water and
Electric Power Company; the Hauser Dam built in 1907 by the Helena Power
Transmission Company; and the Holter Dam, begun around 1907 by the Capital City
Power Company; and, due to financial difficulties, not completed until after the
merger into Montana Power Company.</p>
<p> The Madison River Power Company was organized in 1905 by Butte Electric and Power
Company interests to take over the Nunn power plant on the Madison River from The
Power Company. The Madison River Power Company also constructed the Lower Madison
Development in 1906 and transmission lines to Butte. In addition the Company
acquired the Bozeman Electric Light Company, the Bozeman Street Railway Company, the
Gallatin Light, Power and Railway Company, and the Livingston Water Power
Company.</p>
<p> The Billings and Eastern Montana Power Company was organized in 1908 to take over
various power developments along the Yellowstone River, including the Yegan Brothers
properties, the Yellowstone River Power Company, the Billings Water Power Company,
the Montana Trading Company, and the Big Timber Electric Light and Power
Company.</p>
<p> After the organization of the Montana Power Company in 1912, the company continued
to consolidate power developments around the state. In 1929 several major systems
were acquired. The Missoula Public Service Company, was a merger of the Missoula
Light and Water Company and the Missoula Street Railway Company both developed by
William A. Clark. The various Helena properties which had been consolidated under
the Helena Gas and Electric Company in 1927, also became part of Montana Power
Company in 1929. A third major acquisition in 1929 was the Thompson Falls Power
Company, including its predecessor the Northwestern Development Company. The Great
Falls Townsite Company, the Great Falls Power Company, and the Great Falls Street
Railway Company were all acquired by Montana Power Company between 1931 and 1936.
The last major system acquired before World War II was the Union Electric Company of
Dillon, which included the properties of its predecessors the Rife Electric Company
and the Dillon Electric Light and Power Company. In addition, many local utilities
were added for which there are no records in this collection.</p>

<p> The Montana Juvenile Justice Advisory Council was established by Governor Forrest Anderson
in August 1972, to examine existing juvenile legislation and juvenile correctional
facilities, and to recommend revisions in the law. Governor Anderson stressed the need to
examine the constitutional rights of juveniles in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision expanding those rights. Governor Anderson appointed Associate Justice Frank Haswell
to head the Council and Doug Chase, Harold Hanser, Paul Hatfield, Jeremiah Johnson, Helen
Kampfe, Mike McLean, Frank Sennett, John Thomas, and Robert Wilson as Council members. Terry
Wallace and Steve Nelson were hired as staff. In April 1973 the Council published a
discussion draft of its proposed Montana Youth Act and solicited comments from legal experts
and the public. As a result of these comments the draft was revised and in November a second
draft Montana Youth Act was published. Governor Thomas Judge re-appointed the Council in
July 1973 to continue its work. As a result, two bills were introduced into the second
session of the 43rd Legislative Assembly (1974): HB 797 to revise the law relating to
abused, neglected, and dependent children; and HB 798, the Montana Youth Justice Act. Both
passed into law. </p>

<p>The Eastmont Human Services Center was established at Glendive in 1967
by the 40th Legislature. The center operated two facilities for lodging
residents, a 40 bed cottage and a 15 bed cottage. The 15 bed cottage (Cottage
II) originally housed residents under a five-day program where developmentally
disabled students were bussed from the surrounding areas to the center for
training classes during the week. Gradually, these students were integrated
into the school system in their own communities. </p>
<p>By the 1980s, the purpose of the center was to provide residential and
day training to people with severe developmental disabilities through an
on-going seven-day program. The seven-day program includes people who range in
age from fifteen to over sixty years. The majority of these residents
transferred to the center from the Montana Developmental Center and required 24
hour supervision. Course instruction included academics, home living,
perceptual training, social awareness, recreation and physical education,
speech therapy, and pre-vocational training. Residents occupied fifty-two of
the center's fifty-five beds at June 30, 1986.</p>
<p>The center closed in 2003 due to budget concerns. Authority was then
transferred to the Montana State Department of Corrections where it was
transformed into a DUI treatment center.</p>

<p> The University of Montana at Missoula was established in 1893. In 1913 Montana's higher
education system was unified under the name University of Montana, and the name of the
university at Missoula was changed to State University of Montana. In 1965 the name of the
statewide office was changed to Montana University System. Under the system were the
University of Montana at Missoula (formerly Montana State University), Montana State
University at Bozeman (formerly Montana State College), Western Montana College at Dillon
(formerly Montana State Normal School), Eastern Montana College at Billings, and Northern
Montana College at Havre. </p>

<head>Biographical Information</head>
<p>Forrest H. Anderson was born in Helena, Montana, on January 20, 1913,
the son of Oscar Anderson, a Swedish immigrant, and his wife Mary O'Keefe, an
Irish immigrant. He attended public schools in Helena, and then studied pre-law
at the University of Montana in Missoula. He got his law degree from Columbus
University in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Anderson was admitted to practice before the Montana Supreme Court in
1938. He was elected to the Montana legislature in 1942, and also served as
Lewis and Clark County Attorney. He was elected to the Montana Supreme Court in
1952 and served 4 years, before running for Montana Attorney General in 1956.
He was re-elected as Attorney General three times. During the 1959 State Prison
riot, he personally negotiated with the prisoners in helping to resolve the
conflict. In 1968 he defeated incumbent Governor Tim Babcock, largely on an
anti-sales tax platform. His slogan was "Pay More, What For?"</p>
<p>Anderson's one term as Governor was filled with controversy, but made
significant accomplishments. The early years of his administration were
dominated by conflict with Frank Dunkle, Fish and Game Commissioner, and the
Fish and Game Commission, over the direction of the Commission on environmental
issues and on fisherman and hunter access issues. In 1971 the Legislature
deadlocked over a sales tax. Anderson called two special sessions to deal with
the issue, and finally resorted to putting the tax to a public referendum. The
sales tax was resoundingly defeated. Anderson actively supported the Montana
Constitutional Convention. He later viewed his greatest Gubernatorial
accomplishments as the Executive Reorganization, which combined several hundred
agencies, boards, commissions, and councils, into 19 Departments; and his
establishment of the Board of Investments to remove state funds from low yield
bank accounts to place them in higher yield investment accounts. Anderson did
not run for re-election due to health problems.</p>
<p>Anderson was also active in many civic and fraternal organizations. He
married Evelyn Samson in 1941. They had three children. Forrest Anderson died
in Helena on July 20, 1989, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

<p>Created as part of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences in 1973, the
Environmental Sciences Division remained part of DHES from 1974 to 1990, during which time
they were responsible for monitoring air quality and water quality, solid waste management,
administering the Subdivision Bureau, and ensuring food and consumer safety, and
occupational health. In 1991, though still a part of the Department of Health and
Environmental Sciences, the role of the Environmental Sciences Division was considerably
expanded to include: Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a Petroleum Tank Release
Compensation Board, a Superfund Section, and an Underground Storage Tanks Section. </p>
<p>The Environmental Sciences Division became its own separate department, renamed the
Department of Environmental Quality, in 1995, and was comprised of the following divisions:
Director’s Office, Air Quality, Centralized Services, Energy, Environmental Remediation,
Reclamation, Waste Management, and Water Quality. Under DHES’s Centralized Services, the
Office of Information Technology had been referred to as the Information Services Bureau;
after the split in 1995, the ISB became the DEQ, Information Technology Bureau. In 2000, the
ITB became the Systems Administration Bureau and the Systems Solutions Bureau. In 2004, the
Systems Administration Bureau and the Systems Solutions Bureau were rejoined as Information
Technology Services.</p>
<p>What is currently referred to as the Office of Information Technology (OIT) functions as
part of the Deputy Director’s office, and exists to provide systems administration,

The office is responsible for the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of
comprehensive statewide information technology solutions. Responsibilities include short
term and long range planning, management reporting, budgetary planning, resource allocation,
and development of policies and procedures. The Office of Information Technology is also
responsible for administration of the department's web sites.</p>

<p> The Montana Board of Capitol Commissioners was established by the 1895 Legislature. The
Board, consisting of the governor, secretary of state, and attorney general, was given the
power to review proposals submitted by contractors for the construction of a capitol
building or for modifying an existing building for use as a capitol. To be approved, the
building must be in a convenient location, be available by October 1, 1896, be large enough
to house all state offices, and be fire-proof, with vaults for the storage of state
archives. The state would then lease the building for five years. The Board signed an
initial contract with George R. Mann for the building. In 1897 the law was amended to
provide for the construction of a permanent capitol building for not more than $300,000. The
legislature authorized the cancellation of George R. Mann's contract and the solicitation of
new bids. The board was increased to five members to consist of the governor and four
citizens appointed by the governor, only one of whom could be from Helena. The 1897
legislature authorized the issuance of thirty year bonds in the amount of $350,000 for the
construction of the capitol building. The cornerstone of the capitol was laid July 4, 1899
on land donated by a consortium of Helena real estate men </p>

<p>James Brownlee Rankin was born January 31, 1900, in Denver, Colorado, the son of Reverend
James Doig Rankin and Daisy Meloy Rankin. In his college years, Rankin developed a great
love for books. Later he also developed an interest in art, particularly western art. This
avocation led him to begin the collection of books illustrated by western artists, notably
Charles M. Russell and Frederic Remington. </p>
<p>By 1936 Rankin had developed a very strong interest in the work and life of Charles M.
Russell. That summer, he decided to research and write a biography of the artist and produce
an illustrated catalog of all of Russell's known works. This was his primary goal and the
object of his free time until 1940. </p>
<p>Rankin took ads in national and regional newspapers as well as pertinent magazines. From
this, he developed a wide range of contacts that had known Russell, knew of him, or owned
works by the Montana artist. He made extensive trips to interview individuals and to catalog
Russell's art.</p>
<p>Rankin moved to Pasadena, California, in 1939, to be closer to his father and to pursue his
teaching and research interests. He married Josephine Crenshaw of New York City in 1940. He
never lost his lifelong interest in Russell, but did not continue working on the
biography/catalog after that year. </p>
<p>Ultimately he destroyed his manuscript after the publication of a Russell biography by a
friend, who Rankin believed, had plagiarized much of his earlier work. The one piece Rankin
did publish on Russell was a bibliography of published works illustrated by the artist which
appeared in American Book Illustrations in 1938. James Brownlee Rankin died at San
Bernardino, California, August 2, 1962.</p>
<p>Charles Marion Russell was born March 19, 1864, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Mary Elizabeth
Mead (daughter of Edward Mead) and Charles Silas Russell. He had one sister, Susan Mead
Russell (who married T.G. Portis) and brothers: Silas Bent, Edward, Guy, and Wolfert. Silas
Bent Russell had a son and daughter, Austin and Isabel. Florence M.N. Russell was Charles M.
Russell's stepmother.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, Russell’s parents sent him to Montana under the guardianship of a
sheepherder from who he soon parted. Working for some time as a cowboy in the West, he
continued to sketch, spending his summers on the open range and his winters in various
frontier towns, where he often painted pictures in exchange for food or lodging. He sent the
original of "Last of the 5000" to Louis Stadler of the Stadler and Kaufman partnership.</p>
<p>In 1896 Russell married Nancy Cooper in Ben Roberts' home at Cascade, Montana. Under her
influence and direction he developed from an itinerant cowboy into an artist who painted
pictures for a living. The Russell’s adopted a son, Jack Cooper Russell. </p>
<p>By 1920 Russell had achieved financial success and made frequent trips to New York, where
he painted for such patrons as Malcomb MacKay and Phillip G. Cole. Russell seldom used
models for his paintings or sculpture and took pride in the accuracy of his memory for the
details depicted in his scenes of cowboy and Indian life in the West. </p>
<p>For more than a quarter of a century Russell produced works depicting the West as he had
known it before the advent of barbed wire, the automobile, etc. He maintained a studio in
Great Falls, Montana, and for a brief period in Pasadena, California. Charles M. Russell
died October 24, 1926.</p>
<p>James W. Bollinger, William S. Hart, Harry Stanford, and Phil Weinard were among the
collectors of works by Russell.</p>

<p> The Montana Live Stock Sanitary Board was established in 19O7 and consisted of three
members: the president of the Board of Stock Commissioners, the president of the Board of
Sheep Commissioners, and the president of the State Board of Health. The State Veterinarian
served as secretary and executive officer of the Board. The Board was empowered to govern
quarantines, establish and maintain livestock sanitary regulations, direct and regulate the
slaughter of all diseased animals, provide for meat inspection, and provide for the payment
of indemnity when required. </p>
<p>In 1921 the legislature increased the size of the Board to include all six members of the
Livestock Commission, with the chairman of the Commission serving as chairman of the Board.
The Board was also given additional powers, including the power to regulate the importation
of livestock, the eradication and control of livestock diseases, and the movement and
quarantine of animals infected with contagious diseases within the state. Additional powers
were gradually granted by succeeding legislatures. In 1931 the Board got the power to
inspect and grade meat; in 1949 the Board assumed the regulation of Montana's rendering
plants; and in 1953 the Board began the supervision of garbage feeders and artificial
inseminators. </p>
<p>The Montana Veterinary Research Laboratory, at Montana State College in Bozeman, was
organized in 1929, as a cooperative effort of the Montana Livestock Sanitary Board, the
Montana Experiment Station, the Montana Stockgrowers Association, and the Montana
Woolgrowers Association. The laboratory was established to investigate diseases of range
cattle and sheep.</p>
<p> Dr. William J. Butler was appointed state veterinary surgeon on March 4, 1913. He resigned
in 1948 and was followed by Dr. Howard F. Wilkins (1948-1954) and Dr. Hadleigh Marsh
(1954-1956). In 1956 Dr. J.W. Safford became state veterinarian and served until 1973. </p>
<p>The Montana Live Stock Sanitary Board was abolished in 1971, and its functions were
transferred to the newly created Board of Livestock, which vested these responsibilities in
the Department of Livestock, Animal Health Division, headed by the State Veterinarian. </p>

<p> John Neill was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on March 25, 1860, the son of the Reverend
Edward D. Neill and Nancy Hall Neill. When John was nine, President Ulysses S. Grant
appointed his father consul to Ireland and the family moved to Dublin. After three years in
Ireland, the family returned to Minneapolis, Minnesota. John graduated from Delaware College
in 1881 and studied law at Columbian College in Washington, D.C. In 1883 he moved to Helena,
Montana, where he became involved in real estate development. As a reward for his active
work in re-electing President Grover Cleveland in 1892, Neill was appointed Surveyor General
of Montana in 1895. In 1898, he became treasurer and manager of the Helena Independent
newspaper and five years later purchased the paper. In 1909 Neill became a partner in the
Montana Rapid Transit Company's ill-fated attempt to build an inter-urban railroad between
Helena and Butte. In addition to his business and political activities, Neill was actively
involved in numerous projects for Helena civic betterment, including attempts to expand the
Mount Helena Park to include the forest land to the west, a plan to create the State
Fairgrounds Boulevard along the current route of Henderson Avenue, development of Wesleyan
University, and also work for the Democratic Party. In 1883 John Neill married Margaret G.
Evans. The couple had one son, George G.E. Neill. John Neill died in Hot Springs, Arkansas,
on March 22, 1912. Margaret G. Evans was born March 3, 1862, in Newark, Delaware, the
daughter of George Gillespie Evans and Mary Black Evans. After the birth of her son George
in 1884, she moved to Helena to join her husband. She became active in the civic life of
Helena, serving as the first Democratic National Committeewoman from Montana, spearheading
Helena's Red Cross drive during World War I, and working with several Presbyterian Church
women's groups. After her husband's death, she became active in developing many of the real
estate interests that she had inherited. She died March 6, 1951, in Helena. George G.E.
Neill was born in Newark, Delaware, on October 30, 1884, and came to Helena with his mother
shortly afterwards. He graduated from Princeton University in 1907. Many of the friendships
he formed there continued throughout his life through his active participation in the
Princeton alumni association. In 1908 he began working as bookkeeper for the Helena
Independent and was promoted to treasurer two years later. After his father's death in 1912,
George gave up management of the newspaper and became more active in real estate promotion.
He was a partner with Lewis Penwell in the Capital Investment Company. In 1920 he was
appointed Receiver of the Helena Land Office and served until 1923. He later formed the
Montana Outdoor Advertising Company and the Montana Properties Company. George Neill was

<p>(Carmen) C. Louise Jarussi was born on October 26, 1919, in Columbus, Montana, to Louis and Carmen Jarussi. Her parents immigrated from Rivisondoli, Italy,
in 1907. After finishing high school in Red Lodge, Montana, Jarussi attended the University of Montana where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English
and speech, with minors in music and French. On June 23, 1943, Jarussi married John Melvin Cross, whom she met during a speech tournament her senior year at UM.
John Cross served in the European Theater during World War II, and when the war ended, the couple settled in Helena, Montana until 1952 when they relocated to Glendive.
The couple had six children: Melvin, Gregory, Brian, Justin, Mark, and Catherine.</p>
<p>Cross was active in the American Association of University Women, and in local Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she ran for and was elected a delegate
to the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention. Her interest in the Convention stemmed from her concerns related to land reclamation and the environmental impact
of strip mining in eastern Montana. Cross served as chair of the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee at the Convention—the only woman to chair an Article Committee.
Due in large part to Cross’ efforts, Montana’s Bill of Rights contains a constitutionally protected right to a “clean and healthful environment in Montana
for present and future generations.” It also provides for land reclamation and water rights. The article was challenged in 1991, but the Montana Supreme Court upheld it.</p>
<p>After the Convention, Cross ran for a seat on the Dawson County Commission, but lost. She remained active politically locally, serving as an election judge
and working to establish the Frontier Gateway Museum to preserve eastern Montana history. She was the museum’s first curator. </p>
<p>An ardent environmentalist until she died, Cross was a member of organizations such as the Audubon Society, National Wildlife Foundation,
and Northern Plains Resource Council. In 1997, she advocated for the protection of Montana’s largest state park, Makoshika State Park from oil development.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2014, two months before her death, Cross and four other Constitutional Convention delegates, Wade Dahood, Jean Bowman, Michael McKeon and Arlyne Reichert,

<p>On December 21, 1864 Francis M. Thompson introduced into the Territorial legislature,
Council Bill 15 to incorporate the Historical Society of Montana, as a private organization.
The purpose of the Society was “…to collect and arrange facts in regard to the early history
of this Territory…." The bill was signed into law on February 2, 1865. The Society held its
first organizational meeting later that month. Among the incorporators were Granville
Stuart, H. L. Hosmer, C. P. Higgins, John Owens, and W. F. Sanders. The Society membership
was limited to a few prominent Montana pioneers, who had to be elected by unanimous election
by the members.</p>
<p> The Society began collecting reminiscences and other memorabilia of the early pioneers.
Tragically, these collections burned in the disastrous 1874 fire in downtown Helena.
Immediately after the fire, the Society contacted many of the original pioneers and obtained
replacement reminiscences, diaries, and letters. They also began the intensive collection of
the territory’s newspapers, publications of government expeditions, artifacts, and other
items of interest. The collections were housed in the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse from
1886 until the completion of the new Capitol building in 1902.</p>
<p> The early history of the Society was one of a gradual increase in government involvement.
In 1873 the legislature appropriated $150 to buy additional manuscripts and books. By 1887
the Territory was paying rent for housing the library and the salary of the librarian. In
1891 the collections were officially transferred to State control. And two years later the
Governor was given the authority to appoint the Board of Trustees. In 1895 the legislature
changed the name to “The Historical and Miscellaneous Library”. This name was retained until
the 1923 legislature restored the original name. Finally in 1963 the name was changed to its
present Montana Historical Society.</p>
<p> A separate building for the Society was planned as early as the mid 1920s, but the
Depression, World War II, and other factors delayed the building until 1953 when the
Veterans and Pioneers Building was completed. In 1951 K. Ross Toole was hired as the first
professional director. His major task was to plan for the new building, and the varied
programs which it would enable. Among these programs were a formal museum, art galleries,
the library, and a magazine.</p>
<p> The original Historical Society of Montana was governed by a five member Board of Trustees
consisting of the President, the Recording Secretary, the Corresponding Secretary, the
Treasurer, and the Librarian. Beginning 1891, when the state legislature established the
Historical Society of Montana as a state agency, the Board of Trustees was appointed by the
Governor. In 1949 the Board was expanded to 15 members. From the Board of Trustees, an
Executive Board is chosen consisting of the President, Vice President, and three additional
Board members.</p>
<p> During most of its existence, the Board has played a secondary role, leaving the active
management of the Society to the paid staff. The functions of the Board consist of overall
policy decisions, approval of all deeds, leases, and other legal documents executed by the
Society, and other duties as set forth in current legislation.</p>

<p> Charles Benton Power was born in Dubuque, Iowa, on November 9, 1868, the only child of
Thomas C. Power and his wife Mary Flanagan Power. While Charles was still an infant, his
father moved the family to Fort Benton, Montana, where he established a steamboat and
mercantile empire. The family moved to Helena in 1878.</p>
<p> Charlie, as he was always known, graduated from Georgetown College in Washington, D.C., in
1888. He got a second bachelor's degree from Columbia College in New York in 1891 and a law
degree from Columbia Law School in 1893. He practiced law in Helena for two years, before
going to work in his father's enterprises, including T.C. Power and Brother, the American
National Bank, and the various ranches. Eventually he took over management of these
companies, and became president on his father's death in 1923.</p>
<p> In December 1902, Charles Power married Mabel Larson, niece and adopted daughter of Peter
and Margaret Larson. The Powers had three children: Margaret Power Drum Carrick (b. 1904),
Benton Power (b. 1907), and Jane Power Tobin (b. 1912). Mabel Power died July 4, 1918. In

<p> Norman Winestine was born February 15, 1895, in Wassaic, New York, and was raised in
Waterbury, Connecticut. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and did
post-graduate work in medieval history at Columbia University and at the newly established
Dropsie College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning in Philadelphia. At Dropsie, Winestine
studied Semitic language and Judaism. On April 18, 1918, Winestine married Belle Fligelman,
daughter of Herman Fligelman, president and one of the founders of Helena, Montana's New
York Dry Goods Company. In 1920, while living in Paris, France, Winestine accepted the offer
of the position of general manager of the New York Dry Goods Company, popularly known as the
New York Store. The store had been founded in 1882, under the name of H. Loble &amp; Co., by
Herman Fligelman and Henry Loble, both Romanian immigrants, and Robert Heller, an Austrian.
The store was formally incorporated as the New York Dry Goods Company in 1890. When
Winestine arrived in Helena in 1920, only Herman Fligelman of the original owners remained,
Henry Loble having died in 1913 and Robert Heller having retired in 1920. The New York Store
was destroyed by fire in 1928, but under Winestine's direction was rebuilt and renamed
Fligelman's. Four years later, in 1932, founder Herman Fligelman died. Fligelman's was sold
in 1958 to the J.M. McDonald Company. After moving to Helena, Winestine joined Congregation
Emanu-El, a Jewish reform congregation. It had been reformed in August 1889 and a temple
building completed in 1890. In April 1890 the congregation hired its first rabbi, Dr. Samuel
Shulman of New York. Starting in 1925, Norman Winestine conducted the services on High Holy
Days. Due to a decline in membership, the congregation was no longer able to support the
maintenance of a temple, and decided to sell the building to the Montana Relief Commission
in 1935. Winestine continued to conduct services for the few remaining members of the
congregation, until after World War II. </p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>A postcard or post card is a rectangular piece of thick paper or thin
cardboard intended for writing and mailing without an envelope and at a lower
rate than a letter. The term Postcard refers to cards which were privately
produced and were not sold with postage prepaid. Postcards are visual
representations of people and places specific to a particular time, providing a
record of changes in geography, graphic and artwork styles, social interests,
and social concerns.</p>
<p>Deltiology, or postcard collecting, has been a popular hobby since the
late nineteenth century. Germany's Heinrich von Stephan invented the concept of
the postal card in 1865, and by 1870 postcards were being privately produced in
the United States. The issuance of commemorative postcards at Chicago's World
Columbian Exhibition (1893) followed by an act of Congress that allowed cards
created by private publishers to be mailed at the same rate as government cards
(1898) caused an increase in the production and collection of postcards in the
United States.</p>
<p>The deltiology community generally divides the production of postcards
in the United States into a few distinct eras. Postcards produced in the
Pioneer Era (pre-1898) typically contained advertisements and appeared in urban
centers in the East. Private Mailing Card Era (1898-Dec. 24, 1901) postcards
had undivided backs and a Private Mailing Card logo. During the Undivided Back
Postcard Era (Dec. 24, 1901-March 1, 1907), postcards had an undivided back and
a Post Card logo. The Divided Back Era (March 1, 1907-1915), also known as the
Golden Age of postcards, featured postcards with space on the verso for both an
address and a message. Previously, only the address of the recipient was
allowed on the verso. This period marks the apex of the popularity of mailing
postcards. World War I, influenza epidemics, and the advent of the telephone
caused the decline of the postcard after 1915. During the White Border Era
(1915-1930), postcards were often produced with white borders around the
screened image. The Linen Card Era (1930-1945) reflects a shift in production
towards printing on linen card stock, which gave postcards a textured look and
feel. Finally, during the Photochrome Era (1945-present), glossy color
postcards became favored.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1970s, most cards produced in the United States were the
"standard" size, approximately 3-1/2 x 5 inches. The "continental" size,
approximately 4 x 6 inches, was a size that was common in Europe earlier than
in the United States, but most of the cards sold in the U.S. since the
mid-1970s are this size. Super-sized postcards approximately 5 x 7 inches were
published more recently.</p>
<p>The printing on color lithograph postcards varies in quality. Most
view cards are based on black-and-white photographs with color added. The
printing on these cards often has good detail and deep colors. Greeting cards
also are colorful and usually embossed, although sometimes the graphics on
these cards can be of poor quality.</p>

<p>Bud Lake was born in Virginia. When he was a young boy his father gave him an archaic stone ax head that he found on the family farm. Bud then spent his
free time searching the fields for arrowheads. He graduated from college in 1968 with a degree in business management and spent the majority of his career
in emergency services. He lived in Arizona during 1980-1990, and worked as 911 director for the city of Santa Fe and Bernalillo County (Albuquerque) in
New Mexico from 1993-2011. When he retired, he moved back to Arizona. </p>
<p>In the 1980’s Bud Lake attended the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo and purchased a book about Crow medicine bundles. That was the beginning of his passion to
study the Crow Tribe and collect Crow materials including bead work, rawhide items, toys, horse gear, etc. He spent twenty years going to Crow Fair and talking
to tribal elders to learn about the history and culture of the Crow people.</p>
<p>Lake received a copy of Willem Wildschut’s manuscript on Chief Plenty Coups (written in the 1920s) and then began to collect photographs that could be used to
illustrate the manuscript for publication. He searched auction houses, talked to collectors, used eBay and other online resources, and attended trade shows and
conferences. During 35 years of building the collection, Lake amassed more than 1,500 photographs, primarily of Crow Indians and the Crow Reservation taken
before 1940. These photographs are part of the Montana Historical Society’s Photograph Archives collection (Lot #35) and are available for use by researchers.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2002, Bud Lake attended and made presentations at Indian seminars and conferences talking about Crow bead work, dress, and insignias, often illustrating
his talks with photographs from his collection. He also created and updated a catalog of individuals who took photographs of the Crow people and their reservation.
In 2006 and 2010, Lake produced and financed the Crow Indian Art Symposium in Billings where presentations were made on Crow material culture. He was a member of
and volunteer for the Chief Plenty Coups State Park at Pryor. </p>
<p>Randy Brewer was born and raised in the Texas Panhandle. He attended college at the University of Tennessee, Wichita State University, and Eastern New Mexico University.
Before retirement, he worked as a physician’s assistant. Brewer collaborated with Bud Lake collecting Crow Indian materials.</p>

<p> The Trout Mine was first developed in 1870 by the Cole Saunders Gold
and Silver Mining Company. The company's manager James Patten later formed his
own company the Patten Mining Company and operated the mine in the early 1900s.
During World War I, the Western Ore and Mining Company produced manganese from
the mine. The Trout Mining Company was incorporated under Illinois law in 1922.
It was re-incorported under New Jersey law in October 1924 and operated the
mine until October 1936. In September 1936 the American Machine and Metals
Manufacturing Corporation merged with Trout to form American Machine and Metals
Inc. The Trout Mine became the Trout Division of the new company. The new
company was headed by P.G. Mumford, while the Trout Division was managed by
Charles A. Hyder. In 1947 and again in 1950 the Trout mill burned. In January
1958 a new Trout Mining Company was incorporated to take over the operation of
the mine. It became inactive in 1963, though the charter did not expire until
1993. </p>

<p> The office of Superintendent of Public Instruction was created by the 1872 Montana
Territorial Legislative Assembly to replace the older office of school commissioner. The
Montana Constitution of 1889 made the office elective and defined its functions. In 1959 the
Montana Legislative Assembly created the Department of Public Instruction to administer the
office under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>
<p> The United States Congress passed the Johnson-O'Malley Act in 1934 to provide funding for
public school districts on Indian reservations. The payments were in lieu of taxes to
compensate for the tax exempt reservation lands. Until 1946 financial arrangements were made
between the local Indian agency office and the local school board. In 1946 the Division of
Indian Education was established within the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction
to negotiate contracts directly with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. Gradually BIA
schools were abandoned in favor of local school board-controlled schools. Starting in 1964
Public Law 874 regulated most of the funding of reservation schools, and Johnson-O'Malley
funds were used primarily to fund special projects. Among the supervisors of Indian
Education were Knute W. Bergen, William C. Howard, Earl J. Barlow, Dorrance D. Steele, and
Robert W. Parsley. In addition superintendents Mary M. Condon, Harriet E. Miller, and

John Jacob Thompson was born near Toronto, Canada, in 1862. He moved to North
Dakota at the age of twenty-two and then to Great Falls, Montana, in 1890.
There he worked as a clerk at the Park Hotel and in a laundry. Thompson
established the Great Falls Produce Company in 1893, and operated the business
until 1899, when he sold it and established another of similar nature. In 1899
he purchased the Rock Springs coal mine near Sand Coulee. Thompson married
Sarah Travers of Owens Sound, Canada, in 1896. The couple had two children,
Stewart and Anita. Sarah Travers had two sisters, Margaret Ginste of Dillon,
Montana, and Anna of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Great Falls, Montana. John
Jacob Thompson died in 1906, and Sarah Travers Thompson died in 1907.</p>

<p>The Montana State Highway Commission was created in 1913 by the state
Legislative Assembly. The original Commission was composed of three members. In
1917 new legislation altered the organization of the Commission by authorizing
the appointment of twelve members according to geographic highway districts.
Membership was changed again in 1921 to three members appointed by the Governor
and in 1941 to five members, also appointed by the Governor. In 1971 the
Commission was renamed the Montana Department of Highways, created by Chapter 7
of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 and implemented by executive order
of the Governor on December 16, 1971. The Department of Highways took over all
but the advisory functions of the State Highway Commission. </p>
<p>By 1972, the Department consisted of seven divisions: the Legal
Division, Personnel Division, Centralized Services Division, Engineering
Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the
Maintenance Division. Each division is headed by an administrator. The
Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross
Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division are furthered sub-divided
into bureaus, headed by Chiefs. In 1991, the Department of Highways became the
Department of Transportation. This was primarily a name change. However, there
were some structural and administrative changes. </p>
<p>The Highway Department, the Department of Highways, and Department of
Transportation maintained regional offices in the five commissioner districts:
Billings, Butte, Glendive, Great Falls, and Missoula. The District Engineer
(later called the District Administrator) was the chief administrative officer
in each district office. District office files document the activities of the
district administrators, engineers, maintenance crew, and other district office
employees. The district offices addressed administrative, functional, and
project related issues of their particular area, including: highway needs,
current construction projects, HR/training for employees, road design, federal
and state aid and grants, reports to the Department of Highways/ Department of
Transportation in Helena regarding general maintenance, construction, and area
concerns, etc. District administrators held meetings every 6 weeks. Other
employees in the district and area offices also attended duty-specific meetings
with outside district staff members; including maintenance crew meetings,
engineer meetings etc., in order to maintain consistent communication among the
districts and with other state agencies regarding programs, projects, and
district goals. The files in the district office were kept by the District

<p> In 1932, a group of eastern Montana farmers, ranchers, and businessmen formed the
Mid-Yellowstone Recovery Association to investigate ways of ameliorating the
prevailing drought conditions. They were especially interested in the possibility of
irrigating the agricultural lands along the Yellowstone River between Glendive and
Miles City. The Association's organizers began corresponding with other states that
had similar irrigation projects. After raising $6,000 from Custer, Prairie, and
Dawson County residents, the group subsequently obtained funds under the National
Industrial Recovery Act for a Bureau of Reclamation investigation on the proposed
Buffalo Rapids Irrigation Project. Based upon the Bureau's report, the 18,000-acre
Glendive Unit (Division No. 1) was organized in 1937, and received a $1,600,000
federal allotment. Construction began that same year on the main canal and work was
completed in 1941. Construction of lateral canals was completed two years later. In
1939, a second division of the project, encompassing the Terry, Fallon, and Shirley
Units along the Yellowstone's south bank and consisting of 11,600 acres, was
approved under the Great Plains Act. However, due to the shortage of materials
during World War II, construction of the Fallon Unit was stopped altogether and work
on the other two units was permitted only to the extent that materials became
available. The Shirley and Terry Units were completed in 1944, but it was not until
August 1945 that War Production Board controls on new construction were lifted, and
contracts were awarded for the Fallon Unit. </p>

<p>The Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen was formed as the
Conductors' Brotherhood, in 1868. The first convention was held that fall in
spite of a threat by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad to fire any
conductor who joined. The 1878 convention formally changed the name to the
Order of Railway Conductors of America. The national headquarters were
established in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. During its early years the order was
primarily a fraternal and benevolent association. Beginning in 1885 the Order
began negotiating with the railroads concerning wages and working conditions.
It also began lobbying Congress to pass hours legislation.</p>
<p>In 1954 the Order changed its name to the Order of Railway Conductors

<p>Richard Hanners began his manuscript after being hired as an industrial electrician
for an aluminum smelter in Columbia Falls, Montana in February 1997. He received a
history degree from the University of Montana in 1991. Before moving to Columbia
Falls, he worked for a historical research company in Missoula, working primarily
with computer databases. Hanners created his own database where he gathered
thousands of records on the Columbia Falls aluminum plant for his manuscript.</p>
<p> This manuscript covers the history of aluminum, aluminum production and the aluminum
smelter in Columbia Falls. Summary: In 1886, aluminum smelters began cropping up
following the discovery of a process (called the Hall-Heroult process) which
permitted large scale aluminum production. One of the most prominent aluminum
companies in the United States was the Pittsburg Reduction Company, which later
changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America, later shortened to Alcoa. By
1930, Alcoa produced and sold nearly 100% of all the aluminum electric transmission
cabling in the U.S. By 1941, Alcoa was the only primary aluminum producer in the
U.S. After World War II, as the result of a lawsuit, the federal government owned
most of the U.S. aluminum industry, thus breaking up the Alcoa monopoly. In 1952,
the Anaconda Copper Mining Company (later the Anaconda Company) announced that they
would build a new aluminum plant in Columbia Falls, Montana. Fluoride emissions from
the smelter polluted the surrounding area, resulting in a lawsuit against the
Anaconda Aluminum Company in 1970. By the mid- 1980s, the Anaconda Company’s smelter
in Anaconda, along with copper mines in Butte, closed down. In 2009, smelter
operations shut down and in 2013 polluted soil around the smelter plant was detected
by a EPA contractor. In 2015, Columbia Falls Aluminum Company (formerly the Anaconda
Aluminum Company), announced the permanent closure of the aluminum plant in Columbia
Falls. The property was placed on the Superfund’s National Priorities List in 2016.

<p>The 1864 Organic Act created Montana Territory and provided a basic government structure for the new territory, including a territorial governor, secretary and three judges appointed by the president of the United States, and a territorial legislature and non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives elected by eligible voters in the territory. The act called for the legislature to meet annually for 40 days, except for the first legislature, which was granted a 60 day session. The territorial governor was to decide the date and places of the first election, apportion the members of the two houses and choose the date and place for the first legislature to meet. Thereafter, the legislature itself was to decide dates for future elections and legislative sessions and apportion seats.</p>
<p>After conducting a census of the territory, which he used to apportion the 7 seats of the Territorial Council and 13 seats of the House of Representatives, Territorial Governor Sidney Edgerton held the first territorial election on October 24, 1864. The first territorial legislature met from December 12, 1864 through February 9, 1865. They passed nearly 100 bills, but did not apportion seats in the legislature for future elections. The legislature contained an even distribution of Republicans and Democrats. Edgerton, a Republican, insisted that members of legislature swear to the "Iron Clad Oath," which included a statement that they had never borne arms against the U.S. Government. J. H. Rogers could not swear to the oath and was forced to resign his seat, creating immediate tension between Edgerton and the members of the legislature.</p>

<p> James Fergus was born October 8, 1813, in Lanarkshire, Scotland. At the age of nineteen he
emigrated to Quebec and, three years later, to the United States. He lived in Wisconsin,
Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota where he built and managed saw mills, powder mills, a foundry,
and a paper mill, and invested in property. James Fergus married Pamelia Dillin in Moline,
Illinois in 1845. The couple had four children: Andrew (b. 1850), Mary Agnes, Luella
(married Stephen Collins Gilpatrick), and Lillie (married Frank H. Maury). While in
Minnesota in the late 1850s, Fergus became involved in politics and ran for office. In March
1860 he journeyed to Pike's Peak where he unsuccessfully prospected for gold until he
returned to Minnesota in September 1861. In the spring of 1862 Fergus traveled with the Fisk
Expedition to the Beaverhead gold mines near what was to become Bannack, Montana Territory.
Moving to Virginia City in 1863, Fergus had modest success in finding gold. He was elected
to serve as judge of the first miners' court and as the city's first recorder, and was
appointed the first county commissioner for Madison County. Fergus' family, including his
recently married daughter Mary Agnes and his new son-in-law Robert Stavely Hamilton, joined
him in Virginia City in 1864. Fergus moved to Helena in 1865, where he engaged in ranching
and was elected to two terms as county commissioner and one term in the territorial House of
Representatives. Fergus' son Andrew was much involved in the ranching business; he
officially bought (for one dollar) one-third of the stock in 1878, and, in 1879, acquired
one quarter of James Fergus' property, livestock, and farm machinery. In 1880 James and
Andrew Fergus bought land in the Judith Basin on Armells and Box Elder Creeks, and Andrew
started ranching there. James Fergus and his wife Pamelia joined Andrew the next year.
Eventually they raised cattle, horses, and sheep, and also did some farming. The ranch
operation became one of the biggest in the territory, operating first under the name of
James Fergus and Son (established in 1879) and later as the Fergus Live Stock and Land
Company (established in 1895). James Fergus was elected as a delegate from Meagher County to
the 1884 Constitutional Convention and to the territorial Council where he was instrumental
in the creation of Fergus County. Pamelia Dillin Fergus died in 1887. James Fergus died in
1902. Andrew Fergus married Hazel Akley in 1910 and continued to ranch at Armells until his
death in 1928. </p>

Commissioners, Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission, Board of Oil and Gas Conservation,
Board of Water Well Contractors, Flathead Basin Commission, and Montana Grass Conservation
Commission—have decision-making authority. The other three—the Resource Conservation
Advisory Council, Rangeland Resources Committee, and Drought Advisory Committee—act in an
advisory capacity only.</p>
<p>The department is organized into seven divisions: Director's Office, Conservation and
Resource Development Division (CARDD), Forestry, Oil and Gas Conservation, Reserved Water
Rights Compact Commission, Trust Land Management, and Water Resources. Two of the
divisions—the Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Reserved Water Rights Compact
Commission—are attached to the department for administrative purposes only.</p>
<p>The Director’s Office carries out the department’s mission and statutory responsibilities
by administering, managing, planning, and evaluating total agency performance. The director
oversees the development of appropriate policies and procedures throughout all
organizational units of the agency and makes sure the structure supports optimum efficiency,
consistency and capability for planning, consultation and decision-making.</p>

<p>In 1959 Governor Hugo Aaronson vacated the 1888 Queen Anne Mansion at
304 Ewing Street, and moved to the new Executive Mansion at 2 Carson Street.
Originally, the Helena Chamber of Commerce undertook the historic preservation
and restoration of the old mansion. Soon however, Helena Mayor Dave Lewis and
the City Commission negotiated for the Mansion to be leased to the City of
Helena so that it could be restored and maintained as a historic museum. To
oversee this effort, in 1969 Mayor Lewis appointed the Governors' Old Mansion
Restoration Committee. The committee consisted of the following people: Mr. Joe
A Maierle (Chairman), Mr. John Schroeder (Co-Chairman), Mr. George Schotte, Mr.
Lester Loble II, Mrs. Sherman W. Smith, Mayor Dave Lewis (Ex-Officio member),
Mrs. Tim Babcock, Mrs. Sam C. Ford, Mrs. Forrest Anderso, Mrs. Fred Gannon, and
Mrs. J.R. Kaiserman.</p>
<p>In 1969, the Legislative Assembly appropriated thirty-five thousand
dollars towards initial repairs of the building; these funds were used to
restore the exterior. To supplement these funds, the City of Helena filed an
application with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for a Historic
Preservation Grant, and the Committee worked to secure funds from donors around
the State. The Committee and the Chamber also introduced a bill into the 1971
Legislative Assembly for an additional thirty-nine thousand dollars to match
Federal funds to complete the restoration at a cost of seventy-eight thousand
dollars.</p>
<p>By 1980 the City of Helena was unable to continue management of the
Mansion financially. The State terminated the lease to the city and the Montana
Historical Society (MHS) took responsibility for restoration, maintenance and
management of the Mansion. The Mansion Committee continued to function as the
policy and management authority, consistent with the overall policies of the
MHS, while the Governors' Original Mansion Restoration Society Board's primary
function was to act as a fund-raising entity and sponsor annual events to raise
money. The Secret Garden Tour, created in 2005, is now the main fund raising
effort of the Original Governor's Mansion Restoration Society Board (now called
the Governors' Original Mansion Restoration Society Advisory Council), a

Henry J. Schreiber who was a vice president beginning in 1904. By June 1906,
the Morris State Bank had achieved deposits in the amount of $200,000 and was
conducting business with banks in Montana and throughout the country. A close
business relationship existed with the Elling State Bank of Virginia City and
the Union Bank and Trust Company of Helena, whose president was George L.
Ramsey. The Montana banks were members of the Montana Bankers Association which
issued warnings about fraudulent customers in the state and informed banks of
pending legislation effecting the banking industry in the state. The officers
and directors of the Morris State Bank were businessmen and active members of
the Pony community. Several businesses were connected to the bank through these
people. Henry Elling and William Morris were partners in Elling and Morris,
which had a quartz mill and an electric light plant. Charles E. Morris and
James A. Flint, an attorney, were partners in Morris and Flint, a real estate
and insurance business, with an office in the Morris State Bank building. Harry
Gohn was president of Citizens Telephone Company. Fred Smith was a notary,
trustee for the board of education, an insurance agent, and mayor of Pony in
1911. Henry Schreiber ran a mercantile company and served as treasurer for the

constitution was written by Montana residents, but it was never submitted to Congress. Then,
in 1883, the Thirteenth Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Montana authorized an
election in November 1883 to select delegates to attend a constitutional convention in
Helena the following January. Delegates were elected from existing counties and judicial
districts. William A. Clark was elected president of the convention. The 1884 Constitution
was approved by popular vote of territorial residents. However, this constitution did not
receive approval of the U.S. Congress because the majority in Congress belonged to the
Republican Party and the voters of Montana Territory had elected primarily Democratic
officials. On February 22, 1889, President Grover Cleveland signed enabling legislation
known as the Omnibus Statehood Bill providing for constitutional conventions to be called on
July 4, 1889, in Montana, Washington, and North and South Dakota territories. The 1889

sutler for Colonel Loring's Oregon-bound column. In 1850, he purchased the site of St.
Mary's Mission from Jesuit missionaries, and there built his trading post, Fort Owen. Owen
operated his post as a trading center for white trappers and Indians of the area, and his
fort also served as a way station to an increasing influx of settlers. Fort Owen contained
the first commercial grist mill in the area and served other important functions. In 1856,
because of his special relationship with the Flathead Indians, Owen was appointed special
agent to that tribe and its affiliates. He held this position until 1862. Owen's mind began
to fail in the early 1870s, and he was hospitalized in Helena until 1877, when he was
transferred to the care of relatives in Philadelphia. He died there on July 12, 1889. </p>

<p>In 1893, the Montana State Legislature authorized the creation of the Montana State School of Mines in Butte, Montana, for the purpose of offering engineering education. The school opened for classes in September 1900 and admitted both men and women. Nathan R. Leonard presided as the first president of the School of Mines. Originally, the school offered two degrees in the areas of mining engineering and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>In 1918, the school was renamed the State School of Mines. In 1919, the Montana Legislature enacted a bill creating the State Bureau of Mines and Metallurgy. The president of the school served as head of the Bureau.</p>
<p>In 1921, George W. Craven became president of the school. Born in Last Chance Gulch in April 1871, Craven obtained a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked at several mining companies before joining the faculty at the School of Mines in 1905. He became the school's first vice-president in 1919, and in 1921, he succeeded C.H. Clapp as president. Craven served as president until 1928.</p>
<p>Over the years, the school adjusted curricula and degree offerings to suit the demands of the time. Graduate degrees were offered beginning in 1929. During World War II, the School of Mines participated in the V-12 Navy College Training Program and provided training for hundreds of Naval officers. The school also underwent a series of name changes. In 1965, it became the Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, and then in the 1990s, it became Montana Tech of the University of Montana.

<p> The Little Ben Quartz Lode, located south of Harlem, Montana, was first discovered on
January 1, 1892, by Robert M. Orman, and contained gold and silver and other precious
metals. On August 17, 1893, Orman discovered the August Quartz Lode just north of the Little
Ben. In April 1901 Orman deeded his interests in the Little Rockies Unorganized Mining
District to Louis V. Bogy, in trust for Thomas C. Power and his heirs. The claim included
the Little Ben, the Surprise, and the August. In February 1908 the claims were sold to Louis
Goslin, who in turn deeded the properties to the newly incorporated August Mining Company in
1909. The federal government granted claims to the August and Little Ben mines in 1912. The
next recorded change in ownership came in the early 1930s when the company was sold to
Norman B. Holter of Helena, who reorganized the property as the Little Ben Mining Company.
The new company was incorporated on June 3, 1932, with a capital stock of 120,000 no-par
value shares. The directors of the company were T.B. Weir, George T. McGee, and James T.
Finlen. John J. Mitchke served as the company's secretary-treasurer. The company kept
offices in both Helena and Landusky and held over 540 acres of patented and unpatented
claims. In 1933 the Little Ben Mining Company increased its capital stock to $600,000,
divided into 120,000 shares with a par value of $5.00 each. Managers of the company's mines
through the years included Frank B. Bryant, Frank H. MacPherson, P.A. Wickham, and G.C.
Worthington. In 1940 the company began to encounter financial problems and in June 1942, all
operations at the mines ceased. At that time the Board of Directors held a special meeting
with the stockholders and their proxies and authorized the disposition of the property and
assets of the corporation. Liquidation was started with the first of three payments to
stockholders issued in December 1942. The final payment was issued in October 1944. </p>

<p> The Montana State Board of Hail Insurance was established under SB 16 by the 1917
legislature. The Board was composed of the State Auditor, the Commissioner of Agriculture
and Publicity, and three members to be appointed by the Governor from a list submitted by
the various organized farmers' societies. The law, however, did not appropriate funds for
the Board, instead providing that operating funds would be deducted out of insurance
premiums collected along with November taxes. This meant there was no money for the Board to
begin functioning. Attorney General Samuel Ford advised the Board to begin operation without
funds while waiting a decision on the constitutionality of the law. The Board got over this
initial hurdle and has provided the state's farmers with low cost hail insurance over since.

<p> Carston Conrad Kohrs was born in Wewelsfelth, Holstein, Germany, on August 5, 1835, the
son of Carston and Gesche Krause Kohrs. His father, a distiller and brewer, died when Conrad
was only seven weeks old. His mother married Claus Bielenberg in 1844. In 1853 Kohrs settled
in the United States and learned the meat packing trade. He joined the California gold rush
in 1857, and worked a claim near Eureka, before continuing his search for gold on the Frazer
River in Canada. He returned to the East, but in 1862 he crossed the plains to Salt Lake,
and from there ranged north to the Big Hole and Deer Lodge valleys of what is now Montana.
Although he had intended to prospect for gold Kohrs was hired as a butcher and it was in
this trade that he found success. He soon began supplying miners and other butchers with
meat. </p>
<p>On August 23, 1865, Kohrs bought John Grant's ranch and cattle in the Deer Lodge valley.
Kohrs and his half-brother John N. W. Bielenberg are credited with initiating the practice
of open-range grazing in central Montana when they moved their herd from Deer Lodge to the
Sun River in 1870. By the late 1880s Conrad Kohrs' Pioneer Cattle Company, incorporated in
January, 1885, was one of the largest cattle raising operations in the Northwest. In the
mid-1910s the Pioneer Cattle Company sold its livestock and retained only the ranches which
were run by Bielenberg through the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company until his
death. </p>
<p>Kohrs was also interested in mining. In the spring of 1867 he joined with some partners to
form what was to become the Rock Creek Ditch and Mining Company. After locating water rights
on Rock Creek, the company constructed a ditch and dam in 1870, and sold water to nearby
miners. Kohrs bought another ditch opened by the Atlantic Cable Mining Company in 1868, and
began the Pioneer Placer Mining Company near Pioneer in 1870. Ownership of the latter
company was transferred to the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company in 1923. </p>
<p>Kohrs operated the Deer Lodge ranch and many of his business concerns, including his real
estate holdings, in partnership with John Bielenberg. The Kohrs and Bielenberg Realty
Company was formed in 1906, with Conrad Kohrs, John Bielenberg, and Kohrs' son-in-law O.Y.
Warren as directors. A major holding of the Kohrs and Bielenberg Realty Company included the
Higgins Block in Missoula. Another Kohrs-owned business was the Conrad Kohrs Company whose
assets included the Treacy, Beveridge, Kohrs, Brazier, and Denver blocks in Helena, as well
as the Pioneer, Holland, and Robecker ranches and other properties. </p>
<p>By 1908 most of the Kohrs and Bielenberg ranch, mining, and real estate interests were
incorporated as the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company. This holding company
was organized in June 1908 with four directors and stockholders: Conrad Kohrs, John
Bielenberg, Edward Scharnikow of Deer Lodge, and Conrad's wife Augusta. The Conrad Kohrs
Company was a primary stockholder. Samuel McKennan, Kohrs' friend and president of Helena's
Union Bank and Trust Company, replaced Kohrs as director of the Conrad Kohrs Company after
his death; Anna Boardman, Kohrs' daughter succeeded John Bielenberg. Kohrs and Bielenberg
Realty was sold to the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company in 1909 and was
dissolved in 1919. The Pioneer Placer Mining Company was sold to the holding company in
1923. In 1930 the Kohrs and Bielenberg Land and Livestock Company charter of incorporation
expired, and its holdings were transferred to the Conrad Kohrs Company. </p>
<p>On February 23, 1868, Kohrs married Augusta Kruse (1849-1943), a German immigrant who had
come to the United States in 1866. They had three children: Anna Catherine (1868-1924),
Katharine Christine (1870-1958), and William Kruse Conrad (1879-1901). Conrad Kohrs died on
July 23, 1920. John Bielenberg died on June 16, 1922. In 1972 Kohrs' grandson, Conrad Kohrs
Warren (b. August 16, 1907) sold the home ranch and outbuildings and 216 acres to the
National Park Service, which created the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. </p>
<p>John N.W. Bielenberg was born in the Duchy of Holstein on May 1, 1846, to Claus and Gesche
Krause Kohrs Bielenberg. He immigrated to Davenport, Iowa, with his parents in 1854. In 1864
he moved to the Deer Lodge valley of Montana Territory where he became associated with
Conrad Kohrs in ranching. In 1909 he was elected to the Senate of the Montana Legislative
Assembly from Powell County. He was director of the Union Bank and Trust Company of Montana
in Helena and one of the original directors of the Deer Lodge Bank &amp; Trust Company of
Deer Lodge. </p>

year. Through the years more than 30 college chapters were organized.</p>
<p> The purposes of Alpha Tau Delta were: to further higher professional standards for the
nursing profession; to inaugurate projects that strengthen the specific field of
professional nursing; to develop character and leadership, encourage high ethical standards
of professional conduct in which members may develop sound professional philosophies; to
encourage excellence of individual performance and develop the highest possible scholastic
attainments; to organize the social life of its members as a contributing factor in their
educational program, and maintain an intrafraternity spirit of cooperation; and to form a
close bond of friendship, fellowship, mutual helpfulness, and understanding among college
students in the nursing profession.</p>
<p> Authorized college chapters conferred membership in the fraternity. There were two
chapters at Montana State University: Lambda Chapter for academically qualified
undergraduate nursing students, and Lambda Pi Chapter for alumnae.</p>
<p> The original charter for the Lambda Chapter was issued to Montana State College on April
27, 1940, when initiation and installation of members also took place. The first annual
meeting appears to have been held on June 2, 1956. Divisions of Alpha Tau Delta were
organized in Butte, Billings, Bozeman, and Great Falls. In 1982 Alpha Tau Delta was replaced
at Montana State University by Montana's Zeta Upsilon Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau.</p>
<p> Lambda Pi Chapter was organized in 1963 with stated purposes: to inaugurate projects that
enrich the individual alumnae and specific fields of professional nursing; to assist Lambda
Chapter in their stated purposes; and to provide stimulation and guidance to Lambda Chapter.
The alumnae chapter elected its own officers and held quarterly meetings.</p>

<p> In response to a preceived threat to the farm and grazing lands of Montana, the 1939 state
Legislative Assembly created a State Soil Conservation Committee to "conserve soil resources
and control and prevent soil erosion." The committee was composed of seven members,
including the director of the state agricultural experiment station, the director of the
state extension service, one members of the state grazing commission, one member of the
water conservation board, and the commissioner of the state department of agriculture. Two
additional members were to be farmers chosed by the governor. The primary duty of the
Committee was to supervise and offer assistance to the soil conservation districts
established around the state. Soil conservation district could be established by any ten
occupiers of land within a given area where there was a need and interest in soil
conservation. Conservation districts were considered a government office and were to study
soil erosion, educate the public, and take active measures to correct erosion. In 1961 the
name of the State Soil Conservation Committee and the name of the conservation districts
were changed to reflect the addition of water conservation to their duties. The soil and
water conservation districts were to monitor water conservation as well as soil erosion. The
name was again changed in 1971, to the State Conservation Commission. Following the
reorganization of state government in 1972, oversight of conservation districts was moved
from a commission to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. The Conservation
District Bureau currently oversees conservation districts and operates in the Conservation

<p> Michael Reinig, founder of the Reinig Company, was born in Deidesheim, Bavaria, on March 31, 1835, the son of
Jacob and Frances Reinig. He learned the baker's trade in his home town and then as a young man left for New York,
where he joined an expedition heading for California by way of Havana and the Isthmus of Panama. From California,
Reinig traveled to Oregon and Washington. In 1865 he left The Dalles, Oregon, and traveled to Helena, Montana
Territory, by way of Spokane and Deer Lodge. He almost immediately went to work for the San Francisco Bakery on State
Street and a few months later bought the business. He gradually expanded the operation to include a boarding house and
a grocery on the corner of State and Joliet Streets, and eventually added a stable on Warren Street, a coffee business,
and a saloon in East Helena. In 1904 Michael decided to take a trip to visit his birthplace in Germany. As part of his
preparations he incorporated as the Reinig Company. Management of the company was given to William C. Bardon, who also
continued to operate the company after Reinig's death. The store ceased business c. 1958.</p>
<p> In 1869, Michael Reinig married Matilda, a Norwegian native who had come to the United States at age three
and had moved to Helena in 1868. They had a son Charles N. Raunig (b.1871) and a daughter Anna (b.1873). Michael was a
Mason and was active with the Harmonia Gesang Verein, a German club in Helena. Michael Reinig died September 19, 1909,
and Matilda Reinig died June 23, 1934. </p>
<p>Their son Charles N. Reinig was born March 22, 1871. He studied dentistry in Pennsylvania and then practiced
in Latin America for several years. He returned to Helena in the mid-1890s and became a partner with Gus Ehrenberg in
the Montana Cycle Company and clerked in his father's store until 1900 when he moved to Seattle. After Michael Reinig's
death Charles N. Reinig served as president of the company until 1935, but continued to reside in Seattle. He died
September 29, 1958, in Winslow, Washington.</p>
<p>William C. Bardon was born in Florrisant, Missouri, June 2, 1870. He moved to Helena in 1889 and went to work
as a delivery boy for the Reinig grocery. He gradually rose in the business until he took over management of the store
in 1900. He continued to serve as vice-president and manager after Mike Reinig's death in 1909. He became president
after Charles N. Reinig resigned in 1935. Bardon, along with other Helena merchants, formed the Merchants Delivery
Company as a cooperative arrangement to share delivery services. On September 11, 1907, William married Anna, daughter
of Michael and Matilda Reinig. William Bardon died January 24, 1955, and less than four months later his wife Anna died
on May 17, 1955. </p>
<p>William Eicke was born in Leibnau, Hanover, Germany in 1828. At the age of 18 he moved to Baltimore, Maryland,

was imprisoned in Richmond. He bribed his way out and left for California. Leaving his wife and infant son there he
joined Michael Reinig at The Dalles, Oregon, and later in Helena. In California his wife heard that he had been killed
by Indians at The Dalles and remarried. Eicke worked for the Reinig store and lived with the Reinigs for forty years.

<p>Most members of the Montana Archaeological Association tended to belong to the Montana Archaeological Society as well, but the
MAA being entirely made up of professional archaeologists, they were able to
concentrate their efforts onto more specialized areas of interest. Some of the
major causes undertaken by the MAA include the Native American Free Exercise of
Religion Act, the Burial Bill Act and the Montana Antiquities Act among others.
The MAA worked diligently to sponsor laws and to create guidelines for the
ethical issues relating to archaeological work. The group worked closely with
the Montana State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and in 1991 MAA and SHPO
co-sponsored the first annual Archaeology Week in the state of Montana. This
recurring event quickly became an important staple in the promotion of public
awareness and education relating to local archaeology.</p>
<p>The Montana Archaeological Association found it increasingly difficult
to continue its lobbying activities and sponsorship of the Archaeology Week
program while relying strictly on volunteers. In 1996, the MAA, having never
officially incorporated itself as an organization under Montana state law,
elected to dissolve and to delegate all of its interests and activities to the

and the Montana Archaeological Society assumed all responsibility related to
the sponsorship of Archaeology Week, as well as a more pronounced role in the
political lobbying that had been such an important facet of the MAA. The two

created the State Department of Health. The State Board of Health continued in an advisory
capacity, but the day-to-day administration of the state laws regarded public health and
related matters were relegated to the new department. The State Board of Health became The
Department of Health and Environmental Sciences in 1971 with the passage of Governor
Anderson’s Executive Reorganization Order 9-71. In 1991, though it remained a part of the
Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, the role of the Environmental Sciences
Division was considerably expanded to include: Natural Resource Damage Assessment, a
Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Board, a Superfund Section, and an Underground Storage
Tanks Section. </p>
<p>The Environmental Sciences Division eventually became its own separate department, renamed
the Department of Environmental Quality, in 1995, comprised of the following divisions:
Director’s Office, Air Quality, Centralized Services, Energy, Environmental Remediation,
Reclamation, Waste Management, and Water Quality.</p>
<p>The public health-related functions of DHES meanwhile fell under the umbrella of a new
agency, The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), which, at the time of
its creation, was comprised of the following divisions: Child and Family Services, Child
Support Enforcement, Disability Services, Health Policy and Services, Mental and Addictive
Disorders, Operations and Technology, Quality Assurance, and Senior Support Services.</p>
<p>The DHES Director’s Office was, and is, responsible for administering the various programs
overseen by the agency, and drafting and enforcing appropriate policies and procedures
throughout all organizational units of the agency.</p>

<p> The Montana Legislative Council was created by the 35th Legislative Assembly in 1957. The
Council was composed of six members of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker
of the House and six members of the Senate appointed by the Senate Committee on Committees.
No more than three appointees from each house were to belong to a single party. Appointees
served for the length of their term of office or December 31 of the following year,
whichever came first. The Council was given the responsibility to "accumulate, compile,
analyze, and furnish such information bearing upon matters relating to existing or
prospective legislation as may be determined by its own initiative pertaining to important
issues of policy and questions of statewide importance...." e.g., consolidation of state
bodies, financial administration, efficiency in government, etc. The Council was also to
prepare "such bills and resolutions as in its opinion the welfare of the state may require,"
and present these to the succeeding regular session of the legislature. The Council was
given the authority to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and cause
depositions of witnesses to be taken. A primary function of the Council is to undertake
research, usually on topics assigned by a joint resolution during the previous legislative
session but also on topics the Council determines are important. In most cases the Council
appoints a subcommittee composed of legislators and/or, less commonly, private citizens
which assumes the primary responsibility for directing staff research. Subcommittees submit
their findings, recommendations, and legislation to the full Council which may reject,
amend, or accept them. All subcommittee reports adopted by the Council are published and
distributed before the legislative session. In addition to conducting studies on specific
topics, the Legislative Council staff is available to legislators and standing committees
during the legislative session to prepare reports and draft bills on any subject of interest
to legislators. This service was inaugurated in 1959. In the same year the Council was
designated the Montana Commission on Interstate Cooperation whose purpose is to advance
cooperation between Montana and other units of government. The Council also maintains a
reference library and answers requests for information "in every possible area." In 1973 the
Council was reduced in number to four members from each legislative house who served for two
years. In addition, a Committee on Priorities, composed of four members of each legislative
house, was established to consider resolutions requesting Council studies and other study
requests, prepare a list of priorities, and perform other duties. In 1973 the Council was
given the responsibility to publish all laws and resolutions passed or adopted by each
session, prepare indices for them, and distribute copies to various agencies and
repositories. Executive directors of the Council include Eugene C. Tidball, 1957-1965;
Donald L. Sorte, 1965-1969; James W. Van Koten, 1969-1971; Rose E. Weber, 1971-1979; and
Diana S. Dowling, 1979-1986. </p>

<p>During the early years of the New Deal in the 1930s, water
conservation funds became available to the states from the federal government.
To take advantage of this opportunity, a special session of the Montana
Legislative Assembly convened in late 1933 and created the State Water
Conservation Board to channel both state and federal money into small
irrigation projects. An individual farmer who wanted to build and irrigation
facility petitioned the Board and, if his proposal was accepted, the Board
built the project and the farmer reimbursed the state. By 1952, the State Water
Conservation Board had built 173 projects throughout the state.</p>
<p>In 1965 the Board assumed the functions of the State Engineer and the
Carey Land Act Board. In 1967 the Montana Water Resources Board was created to
assume the duties of the State Water Conservation Board, and to coordinate all
water resource development programs around the state. Other duties included the
administration of weather modification laws and the preparation of a
comprehensive inventory of the state's water resources and a multiple use water
plan for the state.</p>
<p>In 1971, as part of the general reorganization of state government,
the Water Resources Board was abolished and its functions taken over in 1972 by
the Water Resources Division of the Department of Natural Resources and by the
Board of Natural Resources and Conservation.</p>
<p>The Carey Land Act Board was the successor to the State Arid Land
Grant Commission [RS 31]. The Board was set up by the 1903 Legislative
Assembly, after the Commission was abolished. The bill authorized the Board to
undertake projects for reclaiming land granted to the state under the federal
Carey Land Act of 1894. Initially the Board was restricted to completing three
projects begun by the Arid Land Grant Commission: District 1 near Billings,
District 2 near Big Timber, and District 4, known as the Dearborn Canal. The
1905 Legislative Assembly expanded the objectives of the Board, allowing it to
undertake new projects. Among these new projects were the Bynum Project, the
Conrad-Valier Project, the Teton Project, and numerous smaller projects. The
Carey Land Act Board was abolished in 1965 and its duties transferred to the
State Water Conservation Board.</p>

to the West, this time to teach history at Lewis and Clark High School in
Spokane, Washington. He retired from this position in 1946 at the age of
68.</p>
<p>Following his retirement, Teakle began collecting historical data from
newspapers in Oregon, Montana, and Idaho, typing articles dealing with pioneer
life, mines, range life, Indian life, railroad development, etc. These
typescripts were arranged by subject and bound. The volumes were donated to
Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, by the terms of Teakle's will.
Teakle also collected published books concerning cowboy and range life, the
collection numbering more than 1000 volumes. This book collection was donated
to the Montana Historical Society in Helena following Teakle's death.</p>
<p>Teakle was also very active in organizing the Spokane Posse of The

<p> The Conrad-Stanford Company was incorporated in October 1902, in Helena, Montana, by
William G. Conrad, James T. Stanford, and Thomas Curry in order to buy the assets of the
First National Bank of Helena and the Merchants National Bank from receiver Eugene T.
Wilson. These assets included uncollected accounts and notes, many town lots in the Helena
area, several houses, and several large mining and ranching properties, including the
Spokane Ranch and Water Company, the Beaver Creek Ditch Company, and the Crevasse Mountain
Mining Company. The purchase of these assets in November 1902 formed the basis for the
Conrad-Stanford Company's wide-ranging real estate business. William Muth served as the
company's agent. Most of the property obtained from the banks was sold, but selected ranch
and mine properties were retained and operated for several years. In 1911, the
Conrad-Stanford Company ventured into the banking business, organizing the Conrad Trust and
Savings Bank. The Conrad-Stanford Company ceased its Helena real estate business in 1915 and
voluntarily liquidated the bank in the early 1920s. </p>

<p>Chinese Americans in Butte</p>
<p>Chinese immigrants first came to Butte, Montana, in great numbers in the late 1860’s,
attracted by work in placer gold mines and later by railroad construction projects. By the
late 1880’s, nearly 2,500 Chinese Americans reportedly resided in Butte, and by the early
1900’s, Butte’s Chinatown had become well-established. As the gold mining boom ended and the
railroads were completed, Butte’s Chinese were forced out of their jobs by discriminatory
laws and ordinances meant to discourage cheap labor. In addition, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion
Act barred Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States. By the 1890’s, Butte’s
Chinese residents were turning to work in the service industry.</p>
<p>One of the first Chinese districts in Butte arose in the Galena-Mercury neighborhood
between Colorado and Arizona streets. Here, Dr. Huie Pock practiced Eastern medicine and ran
a mercantile, while numerous other Chinese Americans operated general stores, laundries,
noodle parlors, and herb shops. The early Chinese in Butte held onto much of their cultural
heritage. They built places of worship, and many retained the dress and traditions of their
homeland. In addition, they embraced some new world institutions, such as the Chinese
Baptist Mission, established on Mercury Street in 1892. Some Chinese businesses thrived
during this period despite growing hostile sentiment toward Chinese immigrants. However,
during the first quarter of the 20th century, the Chinese population in Butte began to
decline as Chinese Americans sought work in larger cities like San Francisco with
flourishing Chinatowns.</p>
<p>By the early 1940’s, the population of Chinese in Butte had dwindled to just a few
families. One of these families was the Chinn family. Albert (Yu Fong) Chinn had immigrated
to America by 1912, settling in Butte with his wife, Lou, and daughter, Katherine. Albert
became a merchant and by 1930 he had fathered nine children. He lived with his family at 21
West Mercury St. The Chinn family retained ownership of what are today two of the last
remaining and best-preserved buildings of Butte’s Chinatown: the Wai Chong Tai Company
building (15 West Mercury) and the Mai Wah Noodle Parlor building (17 West Mercury). William
Chinn, a son of Albert Chinn, owned the buildings in the 1940’s, and rented the ground floor
of 17 West Mercury to Paul Eno. Eno ran a lock and repair shop out of the building from late
1940’s until his death in 1986. His parents were Martha and Edgar Eno.</p>
<p>Martin D. Hudtloff family</p>
<p>Martha Eno and her family, the Hudtloff’s, moved to Butte from Wisconsin in the early
1890’s. Martha married Edgar Eno in 1901, and the couple had five children: Paul, Edward,
Florentine, William, and Helen. Upon Edgar’s death in 1946, Martha moved to Vancouver, WA,
to live with her son, Edward.</p>
<p>Martha’s brother was Martin D. Hudtloff. In 1893, Hudtloff began serving as pastor of the
new St. Mark German Lutheran Church in Butte, a position he would hold for over 40 years.
The congregation laid the cornerstone for their present church at the corner of Silver and
Montana streets in June 1907. Martin was married to Julia Detloff, the daughter of Prussian
immigrants William and Wilhelmina Detloff. Martin and Julia had five children: Walter W. G.
(1894-1916), Arthur G. (1895-1968), Esther H. (1898-1950), Dorothy (1900-1908), and Martin
J. (1902-1969). Dorothy died of spinal meningitis at age seven, and Walter died of a
lingering illness at 22.</p>
<p>Arthur G. Hudtloff attended a year at the University of Montana (1914-1915). By 1916, he
had moved to Seattle to study at the University of Washington, and was residing next to the
campus at 4339 11th Ave NE. After graduation, Arthur served for some time in the U.S. Navy,
and rose to at least the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. He later moved to Tacoma,
Washington, where he became the first superintendent of schools in the Clover Park School
District in Lakewood, Washington. A middle school in Lakewood, Washington, a suburb of
Tacoma, now bears his name. </p>
<p>Esther Hudtloff married Lloyd Sowders and settled in Detroit.</p>
<p>Martin J. Hudtloff graduated from the University of Montana and moved to Washington, D.C.,
where he served as Director of the Transportation Service Division for the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. Martin died in 1969 and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
<p>Julia’s mother, Wilhelmina Detloff, lived with the Hudtloff’s in Butte after her husband
William died, and later settled in Spokane, Washington, with her nephew, George Detloff, and

<p> Leverett S. Ropes was born in Ishpeming, Michigan, on July 21, 1868, the son of
Julius and Eunice Rouse Ropes. Julius Ropes was a drug store owner and chemist, who
did analytical work for many of the Ishpeming region's mines. He was also the
developer of the Ropes Mine, a gold property. Leverett Ropes studied mining geology
under his father's tutelage and then attended Michigan College of Mining and
Technology, graduating in 1893.</p>
<p> Leverett Ropes' early professional work was in the field of corundum mining and
milling. He spent several years in North Carolina and Georgia and a year in
Comberemere, Ontario, working with corundum. Using this experience he secured
employment with the Montana Corundum Company to develop their mine near Gallatin
Gateway. However, his real goal was to move to Montana to get into the quartz mining
industry. During the next few years he worked for a number of different mining
companies in Montana including the Montana Coal and Coke Company at Gardiner, the
Jardine Mining Company at Jardine, the Bald Butte Gold Mining Company at Marysville,
the Bullion Mine at Basin, and the Alta Mine at Wickes. In addition to his mining
work Ropes worked on the construction of Mystic, Lake Dam near Bozeman and Hauser
Dam near Helena. He also served briefly as a mineral inspector for the U.S. General
Land Office from 1908 to 1910, and for the U.S. Forest Service in the fall of 1930. </p>
<p>In 1910 Ropes began doing private consulting work in partnership with Robert
McIntyre. He incorporated under the name Intermountain Engineering-Development
Company in 1919 to seek outside capital to finance Montana mining ventures. In July
1928 Ropes lost all of his mining records, reports, correspondence, survey notes,
etc. in the fire which destroyed the Bailey Block and several other buildings in
downtown Helena. Since his ability to interest investors in Montana mining
properties was based on his extensive knowledge of these properties, the loss of his
records crippled his work. During the 1930s and 194Os he gradually rebuilt his
files, based partly on memory and partly on re-examination of many properties.</p>

<p>The 1864 Organic Act created Montana Territory and provided a basic government structure for the new territory, including a territorial governor, secretary and three judges appointed by the president of the United States, and a territorial legislature and non-voting representative to the U.S. House of Representatives elected by eligible voters in the territory. The act called for the legislature to meet annually for 40 days, except for the first legislature, which was granted a 60 day session. The territorial governor was to decide the date and places of the first election, apportion the members of the two houses and choose the date and place for the first legislature to meet. Thereafter, the legislature itself was to decide dates for future elections and legislative sessions and apportion seats.</p>
<p>After conducting a census of the territory, which he used to apportion the 7 seats of the Territorial Council and 13 seats of the House of Representatives, Territorial Governor Sidney Edgerton held the first territorial election on October 24, 1864. The first territorial legislature met from December 12, 1864 through February 9, 1865. They passed nearly 100 bills, but did not apportion seats in the legislature for future elections. The legislature contained an even distribution of Republicans and Democrats. Edgerton, a Republican, insisted that members of legislature swear to the "Iron Clad Oath," which included a statement that they had never borne arms against the U.S. Government. J. H. Rogers could not swear to the oath and was forced to resign his seat, creating immediate tension between Edgerton and the members of the legislature.</p>

including building the Wickes tunnel on the Montana Central Railroad south of
Helena. </p>
<p>In 1889 he opened a real estate office in Missoula, in
partnership with Frank W. McConnell. After McConnell, Cook and Company
dissolved in 1892, Cook continued the business under his own name. He continued
to manage his Missoula real estate holdings for the rest of his life, while
devoting his major attention to his other occupations. </p>
<p>A.B. Cook was
elected Montana State Auditor in 1892 and served one term. While serving as
State Auditor he also established his own railroad construction business in
partnership with Martin Wolfson. They negotiated a contract with the Northern
Pacific to build a spur to the Parrot Smelter at Whitehall. Around 1905, Cook's
Montana Concrete Construction Company got contracts in Livingston, Dillon, and
Bozeman to do sidewalk work. He built the dam and irrigation canal system at
Bynum Reservoir for the Teton Cooperative Reservoir Company.</p>
<p>As Cook, Deeks, and Hinds, and as the Toronto Construction Company he
worked on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In 1912 under South Dakota law, he
incorporated the Cook Construction Company with Alexander McKenzie and L.L.
Stephens. They opened an office in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a branch office in
Montreal, Canada. Among the contracts this company obtained were the building
of the Montreal Aqueduct, and the rebuilding of the Halifax, Nova Scotia,
terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, following a freighter explosion in
1917. The Cook Construction Company dissolved in 1921. </p>
<p>A.B. Cook,
however, was best known as a Hereford cattle rancher. In 1907 he bought the
Flying U Ranch at Bynum from F. Augustus Heinze and began to develop the
prize-winning Hereford cattle herd which became the passion of his later life.
He bought the beginnings of his herd from the John Wellcome Estate in Waterloo,
Iowa. With the herd came George Sim who oversaw Cook's breeding program for
many years. Around 1912, Cook moved his cattle operation to the Missouri River
Valley north of Townsend. He bought three ranches there: the Dunleavy and
Rorvig ranches near the outlet of Confederate Creek, and the Bedford Ranch on
the west side of the river. He later added Sheep Ranch in Meagher County, the
Newland Creek Ranch, the Hevey Ranch, and several smaller pieces. During the
1910s he also was a partner with Alexander McKenzie in the Stiles Cattle
Company which had extensive holdings on the Standing Rock Reservation in North
and South Dakota. In October 1928, after losing a major lawsuit, Cook was
forced to sell his herd. He died a month later on November 24, 1928.</p>
<p>In
April, 1908, A.B. Cook married Mary Morgan Pettingell, a native of Bowling
Green, Kentucky. While quite young Mary had married Frank Hervey Pettingell,
with whom she had two children: Frank Hervey and Mary Agnes. That marriage
ended in divorce. A.B. Cook adopted Mary's children, giving them his last name.
The Cooks had one daughter Gloria, born in 1916. </p>
<p>Frank Hervey Cook was
born in 1899 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He attended St. Paul's School in
Concord, New Hampshire, graduating in 1919. He assisted his adopted father on
the ranch, and on the death of A.B. Cook operated the ranch on a smaller scale.
In 1931 he married Lena (Sally) Gosnell Finley, heiress of the Gosnell oil
fortune. She died of a heart ailment August 5, 1933. With the flooding of much
of the Cook ranch property by Canyon Ferry Reservoir in 1953, Cook moved the
Dunleavy house to the Bedford Ranch north of Townsend. Frank Hervey Cook was
murdered there, in an apparent robbery attempt, on November 22, 1970.

<p>The Montana State Highway Commission was created in 1913 by the state Legislative Assembly.
The original Commission was composed of three members. In 1917 new legislation altered the
organization of the Commission by authorizing the appointment of twelve members according to
geographic highway districts. Membership was changed again in 1921 to three members
appointed by the Governor and in 1941 to five members, also appointed by the Governor. In
1971 the Commission was renamed the Montana Department of Highways, created by Chapter 7 of
the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 and implemented by executive order of the Governor
on December 16, 1971. The Department of Highways took over all but the advisory functions of
the State Highway Commission.</p>
<p>By 1972, the Department consisted of seven divisions: the Legal Division, Personnel
Division, Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division, Gross
Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division. Each division was headed by an
administrator. The Centralized Services Division, Engineering Division, Motor Pool Division,
Gross Vehicle Weight Division, and the Maintenance Division were furthered sub-divided into
bureaus, headed by Chiefs. In 1991, the Department of Highways became the Department of
Transportation. </p>
<p>The Highway Department, the Department of Highways, and Department of Transportation
maintained regional offices in five districts: Billings, Butte, Glendive, Great Falls, and
Missoula. The District Engineer (later called the District Administrator) was the chief
administrative officer in each district office. District office files document the
activities of the district administrators, engineers, maintenance crew, and other district
office employees. The district offices addressed administrative, functional, and project
related issues of their particular area, including: highway needs, current construction
projects, training for employees, road design, federal and state aid and grants, and reports
to the Department of Highways/Department of Transportation in Helena. </p>

<p>The United States Adjutant General is the chief administrative officer within the military, and in this context specifically the Army. When a National Guard unit becomes activated and Federalized, this is the office which will handle all of the administrative functions of the unit. The 41st Infantry Division was activated on September 16, 1940 from the National Guard Division of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. It served in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War and participated in the New Guinea, Southern Philippines, and Papuan campaigns. The Division also served on occupation duty for a brief period of time but only rarely throughout the war did it operate as a complete unit.

<p>J. Hugo Aronson was born in Gallstad, Sweden on September 1, 1891, a
son of Aron Johanson (1856-1927), a tenant farmer, and Rika Ryding Johannsen
(1857-1940). The Johannsens had five children: Anna, Karl, Julia, John Hugo,
and Erik Johannsen Aronson. Anna Aronson married Karl Skold and the couple had
three children: Gunnar, Karin, and Allan. Julia Aronson Joseffson had two sons.
Sven Johanson was also a nephew of J. Hugo Aronson.</p>
<p>J. Hugo Aronson was educated in the public schools of Gallstad,
Sweden. He left school at the age of 14 to work. Hugo came to the United States
from Sweden in 1911, penniless, except for the $25.00 immigration fee required.
His brothers and sisters remained residents of Sweden. After working at various
jobs through thirty-eight states, Hugo arrived in Columbus, Montana in 1914.
While working for Frank Young in Columbus he got the nickname "The Galloping
Swede." In 1915 Hugo filed for a 320-acre homestead in Elk Basin.</p>
<p>On December 8, 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Army at Billings and
served as a private with the 20th Engineers in France. On June 3, 1919, while
in France with the American Expeditionary Forces, Aronson married Matilda
Langane, who was in charge of the French-American Red Cross group and had been
one of premier Georges Clemenceau’s secretaries. He was honorably discharged on
July 17, 1919, as a private first class at Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Aronson returned to Columbus with his wife and rented a farm which he
operated while working in the oil fields at Elk Basin, Wyoming. In January
1923, Hugo went to Sunburst, Montana where he was a tool dresser, or driller’s
helper, for a drilling company. In 1924, another rig-builder, Roy Berrey, and
Hugo became partners in the Sunburst Construction Company. It was a profitable
business but only after a year Roy decided to sell Hugo out. Hugo then operated
his own rig-building outfit under his own name and started advertising as "The
Galloping Swede." Matilda was the bookkeeper. He added a trucking business to
the rig-building company, and at the time Hugo was the largest rig-builder in
Montana. When oil was discovered in Kevin-Sunburst fields in Montana, Hugo
built the first building in Oilmont. In 1928 he founded Gallop City near
Conrad. It was the largest of the oil-fields camps, a community which boasted
500 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Hugo and Matilda Aronson traveled to Sweden and France to visit family
in 1924. That same year, they traveled to Glacier National Park and Waterton.
They also visited California, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
<p>Matilda died in Paris, France in 1936 of cancer.</p>
<p>On September 25, 1944, J. Hugo Aronson married Rose McClure in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. Rose McClure Aronson was born in Mondovi, Washington in
1904, the daughter of rancher Evan McClure and Bertha Brink McClure. An
educator, she was superintendent of schools in Glacier County at the time of
her marriage. The Aronsons had one daughter, Rika Berthevan Aronson, who was
born in Cut Bank on December 13, 1945. She married Gary Robert Mogolis and the
couple had two children: Joani Michele (born Oct. 1, 1967) and John Robert.</p>
<p>Aronson's political career began with his election as Cut Bank City
Alderman in 1934. A Republican, he served three terms in the Montana House of
Representatives as a member from Glacier County (1939-1944), and for the next
eight years was a member of the Montana State Senate, also representing Glacier
County. Aronson served on the board of directors of the Montana Motor Transport
Association for many years. He was also a member of the Veterans of Foreign
Wars (V.F.W.) and the American Legion. He was a member of the Algeria Temple,
Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, Blue Lodge, York Rite, and
Scottish Rite Masonic bodies.</p>
<p>J. Hugo Aronson was elected governor of Montana on November 4, 1952.
George Gosman was elected lieutenant governor. Other executive officers
included Attorney General Arnold Olsen, Secretary of State Sam W. Mitchell, and
Superintendent of Public Instruction Mary M. Condon. Hugh Adair was the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Montana; Alex Stephenson, Chief of the Highway
Patrol; and Wesley Castles was Aronson's executive secretary.</p>
<p>Aronson was elected to a second term in 1956. Democrat Paul Cannon was
elected lieutenant governor. Edna J. Hinman served as Clerk of the Supreme
Court; Forrest H. Anderson as Attorney General; Harriett Miller as
Superintendent of Public Instruction; and S.H. Mitchell was the Adjutant
General.</p>
<p>As Governor, Hugo battled over oil and gas leasing that arose out of
the discovery of oil in the Williston Basin in 1951; he worked for better
schools, for prisoner rehabilitation, for oil conservation, and for highway
development. In 1959, a new governors' residence was built and the Aronsons
became the first family to reside there. </p>
<p>Following his second term as governor, the Aronsons retired to
Bigfork, Montana. Rose Aronson died February 25, 1968 and J. Hugo Aronson's
death came on the tenth anniversary of his wife's, February 25, 1978, at the
age of 86.</p>

<p> The Planning Survey of the State Highway Commission was established in 1936, jointly
financed by the state and the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads. Also known as the Planning Survey
Division, it was charged with developing any and all types of data that would be beneficial
for highway planning. In order to fulfill that responsibility the Division was structured
into three principal sections: Traffic, Mapping, and Statistics. The Traffic Section was
given the responsibility of collecting data concerning the movement of motor vehicles on
state highways, county roads, and city streets. The data was collected by means of both
permanent and portable counters, as well as by visual counts and classifications. In
addition to traffic counting, the Traffic Division was given a number of other functions
including the weighing of trucks to obtain statistical information; the reporting of the
number of accidents by location, type of accident, and economic cost; special urban
transportation surveys for cities; origin destination surveys; and parking surveys. The
Mapping Section was to prepare state highway maps, county maps, and city plats. The Mapping
Section was also to collect data concerning county roads and to maintain a continuing
inventory of all such roads in each county, including the type of surface of each road as
well as mileages. The Mapping Section also performed special drafting of charts, graphs, and
special exhibits. The Statistical Section was responsible for the compilation and reporting
of a variety of financial and statistical data pertaining to highways, roads, and streets
throughout Montana. These data were reported in published format and were also included in
the summaries prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads for all states. The name of the
Montana Highway Planning Survey was changed in 1966 to the Planning Survey Section, and, in
1971 following the statewide reorganization, became the Planning and Research Bureau under
the new Department of Higlaways. </p>

<p> Representative John N. Rodgers introduced HB Memorial 7 in December 1866 that sought
federal funds for a territorial penitentiary in Montana. In January 1867 funding was
approved and the penitentiary opened in Deer Lodge in July 1871. It was relinquished
to Montana Territory in 1873, and taken over by the federal government once again in
1874. The penitentiary became a state institution in 1889, when Montana achieved
statehood. </p>
<p>The state contracted with former prison guard Frank Conley and Colonel Thomas McTague
to operate the penitentiary from 1890 to 1908, with Conley as warden. In 1909 the
state hired Conley as warden, a position he held until 1921. Conley instituted an
extensive trusty program in which many prisoners worked outside the prison walls.
Prison work crews built roads in western Montana and constructed buildings at the
Montana State Hospital for the Insane and the Montana State Tuberculosis Sanitarium,
as well as making many improvements to the prison itself. In 1921 Governor Joseph
Dixon initiated an investigation of Conley's alleged use of state monies for
personal gain; this investigation led to Conley's dismissal. </p>
<p>Conditions at the prison deteriorated in the decades that followed Conley's
dismissal. The trusty program was largely abandoned due to the depressed economy and
the concomitant protest by free labor against prisoners working outside the prison.
Additionally, few industries had been developed within the prison, leaving many
inmates idle. Overcrowding and the decay of the physical plant contributed to poor
living conditions at the prison. </p>
<p>In 1957 an investigation of prison conditions conducted by Kenyon J. Scudder reported
appalling and potentially explosive conditions at the prison. Later that year a
"disturbance" did occur during which hostages were taken. A large scale riot
occurred in 1959. The prison was made part of the Department of Institutions in
1963. A new prison was constructed in 1979 outside of Deer Lodge. </p>
<p>The Board of Territorial Prison Commissioners (later the Board of Prison
Commissioners) was established in 1867, consisting of three elected members holding
office for two years. The commissioners had "full and exclusive control over all the
territorial prison grounds, buildings, prisoners, prison labor, prison property and
all other things belonging or pertaining to said prison," and established "rules,
regulations and by-laws" to govern the prison. The commissioners met every three
months. An 1893 law removed prisoners from the commissioners' control, empowered the
Board to appoint the warden, and established the Board as consisting of the
governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general, with two members
constituting a quorum. In 1907 the Board was given the power to approve or
disapprove parole for prisoners recommended by the governor. In 1913 the governor
was given the power to appoint the warden, and the Board was given jurisdiction over
persons receiving suspended sentences. In 1955 the Board's jurisdiction over paroles
and suspended sentences was delegated to the State Board of Pardons. Legislation
establishing the Board of State Prison Commissioners was not included in the 1972
constitution; the Board was formally abolished in 1974. </p>
<p>The State Board of Pardons was established in 1891, consisting of the secretary of
state, the attorney general, and the state auditor. The Board was required to
convene if the governor granted a pardon, remitted a fine or forfeiture, or commuted
a punishment. The Board would then cause a notice of a hearing concerning the case
to be published in a newspaper in the county in which the crime was committed and
notify the concerned county attorney, district judge, and sheriff. Subsequent to the
hearing the Board would file its decision with the secretary of state. In 1955 the
Board membership was changed to three members appointed by the governor to terms of
six years. The appointees were given the responsibility of administering the
executive clemency, probation, and parole system. The Board was made part of the
Department of Institutions in 1971. </p>

<p>Edgar Samuel Paxson was born on April 25, 1852 in East Hamburg, New York to William
Hamilton and Christina Humbleton Paxson. At the completion of primary school, his parents
sent him to a Quaker boarding school called Friends' Institute. Edgar went to into business
with his father painting carriages, lettering, and sign painting.</p>
<p>Edgar married Laura Millicent Johnson at Orchard Park, New York in June 4, 1874. A little
over a year later their first child, Loren a son, was born and Paxson left his wife and
infant child in New York to head west. Working various jobs, Paxson found himself in Montana
where continued to live the life of a frontiersman and served for a time as a scout during
the Nez Perce War. Finding steady employment in Deer Lodge, Montana, at his old trade, he
sent for his wife and son who joined him in 1879. When work became scarce in Deer Lodge,
Paxson accepted a commission in Butte, MT to paint a large mural and moved his family there
in 1881 to complete the work. He and Laura had three more children after she joined him in
Montana, Lelia, Harry, and Robert. </p>
<p>Paxson joined the Montana National Guard as a private and spent ten years as an active
guardsman retiring with the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Paxson became an ardent supporter for
war against Spain with the sinking of the USS Maine. He enlisted in April 1898 for two years
and mustered into service on May 7 in Helena as 1st Lieutenant, Company G, First Montana
Infantry. The Montana guardsmen shipped out for the Philippines on July 18. His son Harry
also served as a private in Company G as a musician. Paxson contracted malaria shortly after
his arrival in the Philippines and due to the severity of the illness military command
released him from active service and shipped him home. Once back in Butte, he received his
honorable discharge from the Montana Volunteer Infantry on December 2, 1898. While he
convalesced, Edgar began working on his Custer painting, completing his canvas titled
Custer's Last Battle on the Little Big Horn in 1899. He and Laura also waited and worried
about their son Harry. Although the war with Spain had all but concluded in the Philippines
by the time the 1st Montana Volunteers arrived war broke out in early 1899 between the
Filipino Insurgents and the U.S. liberates delaying the return of the Montanans. During the
fighting Harry Paxson served as bugler and courier for General George Crook. Meanwhile, in
anticipation of the return of the 1st Montana Volunteers, the city of Butte commissioned
Paxson to design a large triumphal arch and sculpt a statue called Peace for the top to
welcome and commemorate their return in October 1899.</p>
<p>Paxson's fulltime painting career began with his return from the Spanish-American War with
exhibitions in Chicago, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis (1904), as well as
the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon (1905). That same year the Montana State
Legislature passed a "resolution of appreciation" in recognition of his exhibit in Portland.
The family moved to Missoula in 1906 where Paxson built a studio next to their residence.
Six years later the Missoula County Commissioners engaged Paxson to paint eight murals for
the county courthouse—Arrival of Father Ravalli at Fort Owen, Lewis and Clark's Camp at Lolo
Creek, A Montana Roundup, The Flatheads in Buffalo Country, Lewis' Party Crossing the Clark
Fork, Flatheads Leaving Their Bitterroot Home, Governor Steven's Treaty with the Pend
D'Oreilles, Flatheads, and Kootenai at Council Grove, and Early Transportation. </p>
<p>With the expansion of the Montana capital in 1912, Paxson, Charles M. Russell, and R.E.
DeCamp, all Montana artists, received commissions to produce murals for the new wings based
on subjects selected by Governor Joseph K. Toole. Paxson, responsible for the murals in the
House of Representatives, painted the six murals that hang in the lobby today: After the
Whiteman's Book, The Border Land, Lewis at Black Eagle Falls, Pierre de La Verendrye, Lewis
and Clark at Three Forks, and Surrender of Chief Joseph. </p>
<p>The popularity he enjoyed as an artist peaked 1900-1915, after that period he did not
receive any more major commissions and as his popularity waned his health also began to
fail. Further complicating his health was the unexpected death of his son Harry in January
1910. Electrocuted while working on a dredge near Butte, twenty-nine-year-old Harry left
behind a wife and two young sons. Despite his declining health and personal tragedy, Paxson
experienced a high point in his career during this time and sales of his painting remained
strong although he received little publicity outside of Montana. After 1915 his popularity
as an artist began to subside and major commissions and sales dried up but Paxson remained
dedicated to his art and even as his health declined he continued to paint. </p>
<p>Contemporary newspaper accounts attributed his health issues with an accident that occurred
during his return voyage from the Philippines when the ship he was on encountered a typhoon.
Struck by a wave in the storm and thrown against a spar, Paxson suffered an internal injury
that plagued him for the remainder of his life. This didn't keep him for volunteering for
military service when the United State declared war in April 1917 against Germany but his
days of active service were over.</p>
<p>Edgar S. Paxson died November 9, 1919 at the age of 67 at his home in Missoula. His friend
Charlie Russell wrote "his work tells me that he loved the Old West, and those who loved her
I count as friends." His wife Laura died almost twenty years to the day. They are both
interred at the Missoula Cemetery.</p>

<p> In 1951 the Montana Legislative Assembly created the Office of State Controller to assume
the duties of the state accountant. The controller was appointed by the governor for an
eight year term and was directed to establish a system of financial control, install a
uniform accounting and reporting system, examine appropriation requests, and submit a
revised and final budget to the legislature. The controller was also the ex-officio state
purchasing agent. </p>
<p> The 1963 legislature created a Department of Administration to provide "a more
coordinated, responsible, efficient and economical organization by centralizing and
consolidating the general administrative and fiscal functions of state government into one
department." The state controller was made the chief executive of the department, with
divisions for accounting, purchasing, architecture and engineering, and general services.
The controller became responsible for centralized mailing and telephone systems for state
government, allocation of office space, custodial care of the Capitol and other state
property, records management for state records, preparation of building programs,
appointments of architects, supervision of construction and renovation of state buildings,
disposal of state property (including the Montana Centennial Train), purchasing of major
equipment for state agencies, and distribution of surplus commodities.</p>
<p> The controller also oversaw several advisory bodies including a council to create
construction standards for state buildings (this later became the Building Code Council), a
fiscal coordinating committee, a personnel study committee, the State Board of Review which
studied pro rata charges, and a committee on data processing equipment which worked to

<p> The People's Voice, a cooperative newspaper, was founded in 1939, by H.S. "Cap" Bruce with
the backing of farm coop and labor leaders. Bruce, a veteran newspaperman, saw the need for
an independent state-wide paper after the established press failed to report adequately on
the 1937 state legislature's defeat of liberal measures. Bruce's newly formed Educational
Co-operative Publishing Company bought a press and, in December 1939, began publication of
The People's Voice . The Voice covered both local and national issues, taking strong stands
on the issues of public power, protection of public lands, establishment of farmers'
cooperatives, the abolition of capital punishment, minimum wage, and other labor union
concerns. In spite of its small circulation, the paper's political influence was
considerable. In November 1948, associate editor Harry L. Billings, assisted by his wife
Gretchen, succeeded Bruce as managing editor. After Billings retired in 1968, Bennett Hansen
took over the Voice's management, but financial difficulties forced the paper to cease
publication shortly thereafter. </p>

1914, the second child of Howard E. and Mildred (Reeves) McGee. He graduated
from Park County High School in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression.
As a young man, he took whatever work he could find, including dish washing for
a road construction crew on the Beartooth Highway, laboring on the Fort Peck
Dam, and construction work on Dunraven Pass in Yellowstone National Park. In
1936 he began his lifetime work for the Northern Pacific Railway, as a
brakeman. He was drafted into the Army Air Force in March 1942 and served as a
maintenance man in a photo reconnaisance squadron in the Solomon's and Saipan.
After his discharge from the military in September 1945, he returned to work
for the Northern Pacific Railway. He worked his way up to conductor and
continued to work for the Northern Pacific, Burlington Northern, and Amtrak
until his retirement on October 31, 1975.</p>
<p> McGee was chairman from 1960 until 1970 of the Livingston Anti-Merger
Committee, which was dedicated to opposing the creation of the Burlington
Northern Railroad. He was also an outspoken advocate of the continuation of
rail service to Montana communities. McGee made two unsuccessful campaigns for
public office, first in 1966 when he ran for the Legislature, and again in 1971
when he ran as a delegate to the Montana Constitutional Convention. In spite of
his two defeats he remained very active with the Montana Democratic Party.</p>
<p> During his service in World War II, McGee became an expert
photographer. He combined that skill with his love of trains into a hobby of
railroad photography. He compiled one of the most complete photo documentations
of locomotives in existence.</p>
<p> In September 1946, McGee married Bernice Lavold, daughter of Knute
and Helen (Berg) Lavold of Big Timber. They had one son, Howard, who died in an
automobile accident at the age of 22. Bernice shared Warren's passion for

practicing law in White Sulphur Springs, Montana, in the same year. In 1904, he ran for
Meagher County attorney and was defeated by N.B. Smith. In 1905, he became the city attorney
and clerk, and in 1906 was elected county attorney, a position he held through 1912. He
decided not to run for re-election in November of that year due to his father's illness. He

Brothers Abraham L. and Edward I. Goodkind, and Meyer and Charles Wise operated
a wholesale wine, liquor, and cigar business in Helena, Montana, from 1890 or
1891 until 1896 when the Wise brothers left the business. The Goodkind brothers
continued their operation until Edward died on May 11, 1916. Abraham continued
the operation with Edward's widow, Margaret L., until 1918. Abraham and
Margaret then went into the loan business until 1922, when Margaret moved to
Los Angeles. Subsequently, Arthur Ward joined Goodkind in the loans and
securities business. Goodkind moved to Chicago in the 1930s. His business
changed to the rental of, primarily, commercial property. The company's name
was Goodkind Estate for at least the years 1950 to 1953, and Goodkind
Associates from 1954 to at least 1969. Arthur Ward acted as Goodkind's agent in

<p> The Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences was given the responsibility,
under the 1967 Session Laws, to license hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes,
and related institutions. Included in this function are the approval of new facilities,
expansion of facilities, changes in classification, and inspection for adherence to
standards. The Health Services and Medical Facilities Division and its Licensing and
Certification Bureau also act as the agents for the United States Health Care Financing
Administration in approving health care facilities for Medicare patients. Among the reasons
a health care facility's license or Medicare approval can be revoked are failure to meet
minimum standards of construction and fire safety, failure to provide sufficient medical
staff with the proper qualifications, conviction of a felony by the hospital manager,
mistreatment or neglect of patients, and financial inadequacy. Licensing and Certification
Bureau staff inspect each hospital, nursing home, and home care agency on a regular basis.
Any inadequacies in significant areas of performance have to be corrected before the license
can be renewed. </p>

<p> Burton Kendall Wheeler was born February 27, 1882, at Hudson, Massachusetts. After
his public schooling and a period of work in the Boston area, Wheeler attended the
University of Michigan. He received his law degree in 1905. In October 1905, he
settled in Butte, Montana, and began work as a clerk for an established lawyer. The
following year, Wheeler went into practice on his own. In 1910, he was elected to
serve in the Montana House of Representatives as a Democrat from Silver Bow County.
While in the legislature, Wheeler supported the candidacy of Thomas J. Walsh for
Senator. For this support, Walsh arranged to have Wheeler appointed U.S. District
Attorney for Montana in 1913. He served in this capacity throughout World War I and
was the subject of much controversy for his actions in protecting the right of
dissent. He resigned in 1918 to avert a possible Walsh defeat.</p>
<p>In 1920, Wheeler was defeated by Joseph M. Dixon in a bitter campaign for governor,
but two years later, he was elected U.S. Senator. He held this Senate seat until his
defeat in the primary election of 1946. During his Senate career, Wheeler was a
constant foe of the "interests" and was chiefly responsible for the exposure and
investigation of graft in the Department of Justice (1924-1925). Wheeler was an
early supporter of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, and served as chairman of
the powerful Senate Interstate Commerce Committee. However, in 1937, Wheeler broke
with the administration over Roosevelt's unsuccessful bid to "pack" the Supreme
Court. His opposition to Roosevelt was again of major importance as a member of the
America First Committee and as a supporter of non-involvement in the European war,
which began in 1939. Wheeler, because of his widespread support in the Democratic
party, was considered a major contender for the presidential nomination in 1940,
until Roosevelt announced for a third term. He was strongly considered as a running
mate with Roosevelt that year, but refused to accept the nomination. Wheeler again
supported non-involvement in 1945-1946, when he opposed the United Nations and loans
to our allies after the war.</p>
<p> After his defeat for reelection to the Senate by Leif Erickson in the 1946 primary,
Wheeler retired to private law practice in partnership with his son Edward, in
Washington, D.C. Burton K. Wheeler died in 1975, at age 93. </p>

<p> The National Typographical Union was
established in 1852 as the major union in the printing trade. In 1874 it became
the International Typographical Union with several Canadian locals. The first
Montana local union was formed in Helena in 1867. Gradually additional local
unions were established in cities across the state. Initially, the Helena local
functioned as the de facto state organization. The Montana Typographical
Conference was formed in 1929 to coordinate the work of the local unions. The
objectives of the conference included organizing the printing trade around the
state, promoting the training of printers, urging buyers of printed material to
patronize union shops, encouraging cooperation among locals, and assisting them
in contract negotiations. During the Depression and war years the conference
was largely inactive. After World War II, the conference became a leading
factor in the printers' union statewide. It became actively involved in
apprenticeship programs, in training in new printing technologies, in relations
with the Montana State AFL-CIO, and contract discussions. Although membership
in the local unions was declining rapidly due to new technology, the conference
remained vigorous into the early 1980s. The Montana Typographical Conference
folded about 1984. After briefly considering a merger with the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Typographical Union was absorbed
into the Communications Workers of America in 1987. </p>
