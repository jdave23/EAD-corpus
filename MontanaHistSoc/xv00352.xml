      <p>The Montana State Legislature is made up of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Constitution of Montana limits the size of the Senate to no fewer than 40 and no more than 50 members and the size of the House of Representatives to no fewer than 80 and no more than 100 members. Each house is responsible for choosing its officers, creating committees and establishing its own rules. The Montana Legislature meets for 90 days every odd numbered year, beginning the first Monday in January, or the following Wednesday if the first Monday is New Years Day. The first State Legislature convened on November 23, 1889, fifteen days after Montana became a state. Each following Legislature has been numbered  sequentially.</p> 
      <p>The 7th Montana Legislature met from January 7th to March 7th, 1901. The leaders of the Senate were Frank Higgins (D-President), and G.H. Stanton (D-President Pro Tempore). The leaders of the House were Frank Corbett (D-Speaker), and John Baker (D-Speaker Pro Tempore).</p>
