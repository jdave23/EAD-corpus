      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Thomas Teakle was born on April 14, 1878, in Scotland, Iowa. He was
		  educated in Iowa schools and received a degree from the Iowa State Teachers
		  Normal School in 1904, and a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa in
		  1910, majoring in history and political science. In 1911 Teakle moved to Idaho
		  to be principal of Pocatello High School. He returned to Des Moines, Iowa, the
		  following year and taught high school there until 1919. He also wrote a book,
		  The Spirit Lake Massacre, which was published in 1918. In 1919, Teakle returned
		  to the West, this time to teach history at Lewis and Clark High School in
		  Spokane, Washington. He retired from this position in 1946 at the age of
		  68.</p>
      <p>Following his retirement, Teakle began collecting historical data from
		  newspapers in Oregon, Montana, and Idaho, typing articles dealing with pioneer
		  life, mines, range life, Indian life, railroad development, etc. These
		  typescripts were arranged by subject and bound. The volumes were donated to
		  Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, by the terms of Teakle's will.
		  Teakle also collected published books concerning cowboy and range life, the
		  collection numbering more than 1000 volumes. This book collection was donated
		  to the Montana Historical Society in Helena following Teakle's death.</p>
      <p>Teakle was also very active in organizing the Spokane Posse of The
		  Westerners organization and served the group in a variety of capacities. In
		  1967 Teakle was awarded the title of "Historian Emeritus" by the Eastern
		  Washington Historical Society. Teakle died in Spokane on June 24, 1969.</p>
