		  Photograph Archivist Matthew M. Peek.  It results from his work on a Council of Library and Information Resources grant project 
		  to process and provide access to the Lee Metcalf Photograph and Film Collections.
		  The materials in this collection were used or created by Peek in order to help
		  identify and describe the photograph and film collections of Senator Lee
		  Metcal, held by the MHS Photograph Archives. Additionally, the materials were
		  used and created in order to, as part of the grant project, promote the role of
		  Senator Lee Metcalf in various events whose fiftieth anniversaries were
		  commemorated in 2014. These events include the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
		  Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 (War on Poverty bill), the 1964 Wilderness
		  Act, and the 1964 Montana Territorial Centennial Train. </abstract>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Lee Metcalf was born in 1911 in Stevensville, Montana. He attended
		  Montana State University for one year and transferred to Stanford University
		  where he majored in history and economics. He graduated from Montana State
		  University law school in 1936 and entered private practice. He was elected
		  representative to the 25th Montana Legislative Assembly from Ravalli County in
		  the same year. In 1937 Metcalf resigned from the legislature to accept
		  appointment as a Montana assistant attorney general.</p>
      <p>During his tenure as an assistant attorney general, Metcalf campaigned
		  extensively for Attorney General Harrison Freebourn who was seeking election to
		  the U.S. Senate in the 1940 primary. During this period Metcalf also
		  represented the Montana State Congress of Industrial Organizations Council from
		  1938 until 1941. In 1941, following Freebourn's defeat in the primary, Metcalf
		  returned to private practice in Hamilton. Metcalf enlisted in the army in 1942
		  and was later commissioned. Following the war he served as a military
		  government officer in Germany where he helped set up the civilian court and
		  occupation police system. He also supervised repatriation and drafted the
		  ordinances for and supervised local elections. </p>
      <p>Metcalf was elected associate justice of the Montana Supreme Court in
		  1946, where he served until he was elected to the United States House of
		  Representatives in 1952, succeeding Mike Mansfield in Montana's First (Western)
		  Congressional District. After serving four terms in the House, Metcalf was
		  elected to the Senate in 1960, succeeding James E. Murray.</p>
      <p>Although Metcalf is best known for his work to protect the natural
		  environment and regulate utilities, he composed and supported a wide variety of
		  legislation. His prodigious legislative accomplishments are testimony to his
		  parliamentary acumen.</p>
      <p>Lee Metcalf worked throughout his career to protect the nation's
		  natural resources from both wanton exploitation and destruction. He was an
		  early proponent of water and air pollution control; research on the harmful
		  effects of pesticides, strip mining, and highway construction; regulation of
		  timber cutting and grazing; alternative energy development; and many other
		  conservation issues. His efforts to preserve the nation's wild lands and rivers
		  were productive and lauded by national conservation organizations. As a
		  long-time member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, Metcalf helped
		  establish many wildlife refuges.</p>
      <p>While Lee Metcalf was an ardent protector of the natural environment,
		  he believed in the responsible development of resources. He supported rural
		  cooperative efforts, public power projects, and diverse types of assistance to
		  independent workers in agriculture and minerals.</p>
      <p>Metcalf advocated the use of government resources to redress the
		  injustices of an imperfect society and to broaden and strengthen access to
		  information for all individuals. He proposed and worked for legislation
		  concerning Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and veterans' benefits; aid
		  to libraries, schools and small businesses; minimum wage laws; work safety
		  laws; job training programs; consumer protection; and the return of control
		  over their own lives to Native Americans.</p>
      <p>Metcalf's long, adverserial relationship with the Montana Power
		  Company and other utilities stemmed from his belief that the power industry
		  held a monopolistic, unregulated control of an essential product. Lee Metcalf's
		  and Vic Reinemer's book Overcharge delineates their position that the utilities
		  exert tremendous influence throughout American society, yet are not subject to
		  the democratic election process and are controlled by a small group of
		  profiteers.</p>
      <p>Closely related to Metcalf's efforts to regulate utility companies was
		  his opposition to the growth of "corporate statism." Especially in his capacity
		  as chairman of the Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting,
		  Management, and Expenditure (later Reports, Accounting, and Management), and in
		  close association with Vic Reinemer, Metcalf worked for disclosure of
		  meaningful information, such as interlocking directorships, regarding corporate
		  activity in regulated industries.</p>
      <p>Congressional colleagues respected Lee Metcalf's thorough knowledge of
		  the workings of government, knowledge which he used astutely throughout his
		  career. In 1959 Metcalf helped establish the Democratic Study Group, an
		  organization which instructed, mobilized, and coordinated liberal Democrats. As
		  a member of the Government Operations Committee, Metcalf worked for many years,
		  especially after Watergate activities spotlighted such concerns, to reorganize
		  government to improve its efficiency and honesty.</p>
      <p>Lee Metcalf enjoyed the cooperation of an able staff. He also provided
		  experience to as many interns, the majority of whom were Montanans, as his time
		  and office space would allow.</p>
      <p>Vic Reinemer joined Metcalf's staff in 1961 and worked closely with
		  him until Metcalf's death. Reinemer was born in Circle, Montana, in 1923, and
		  graduated from Montana State University with a B.A. in journalism in 1948. He
		  worked as a newspaper editor in Washington, D.C., for Freedom amp; Union
		  Magazine in 1950 and 1951, and in North Carolina for the Charlotte News from
		  1950 until 1955. From 1955 until 1960 Reinemer worked as executive secretary
		  for Senator Murray and then served until 1973 in the same position for Senator
		  Metcalf. From 1973 until Metcalf's death in 1978, Reinemer was staff director
		  of the Senate Government Operations Committee's Subcommittee on Budgeting,
		  Management, and Expenditures, which changed its name in 1975 to Reports,
		  Accounting, and Management. Reinemer concentrated his energies on utility
		  regulation and corporate ownership reporting.</p>
      <p>Other long-time influential staff members include Merrill "Brit"
		  Englund, Metcalf's administrative assistant, who worked for United Press
		  Internatinnal and the Associated Press in Helena for six years before joining
		  Metcalf's staff in 1953; Peggy McLaughlin, personal secretary, who worked for
		  the Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Montana Attorney
		  General, and for Senator Murray before beginning her years with Metcalf; and
		  Dorothy Tannenbaum, legislative assistant with special knowledge of education
		  and Native American affairs. Ted Roe replaced Vic Reinemer as executive
		  secretary in 1973. These staff members' contribution to Metcalf's work can most
		  easily be noted by the many letters in the collection which they composed.</p>
      <p>Lee Metcalf married Donna Hoover in 1938. He died in January 1978
		  during what he declared would be his last Senate term.</p>
