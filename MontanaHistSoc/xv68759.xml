      <p>This oral history project documented the economic recovery programs initiated by President
        Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s. These Depression-era programs - including the
        Work Projects Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and the resettlement
        Administration - played a significant economic role in the state of Montana, which was
        listed as second in per capita receipt of New Deal dollars during the Depression. A large
        portion of the interviews focused on the lives of the workers involved in the Fort Peck Dam
        project, including cultural and social life in the area. </p>

      <p>The project, conducted between 1987 and 1989, includes 122 interviews with people involved
        in agricultural programs, commerce, cultural development, Native American culture, labor,
        work projects, or state and county government. A large portion of the interviews focused on
        the lives of the workers involved in the Fort Peck Dam project, including cultural and
