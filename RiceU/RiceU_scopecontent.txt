<p>The Wheeler materials include biology lecture and laboratory notes, correspondence, an autobiography and a scrapbook. The bulk of this collection are two bound copies of the notes from the biology classes that George Wheeler took as a student at the Rice Institute through the years 1915 to 1918. His professors from these classes are the ones that make up all the correspondence in this manuscript collection. While at Rice, Wheeler enrolled in the following courses, which include both lectures and laboratory work: Elementary Biology (lecture: J. Huxley, lab: H. Muller and J. Davies), Cellular Biology (lecturer and lab: H. Muller), Heredity and Evolution (lecturers: H. Muller and E. Altenburg, lab: H. Muller) and Morphology of Animals (lecturer and lab: H. Muller). Please note, on the inside cover of the lecture notes, Wheeler pasted a postcard sent to him by Julian Huxley.</p><p>Wheeler kept in touch with three of his undergraduate professors from the Rice Institute - Huxley, Muller and Davies - during and well after his graduation. In the letters from Huxley, Wheeler received continuing advice, career counseling and encouragement from his former academic advisor. Huxley left the Rice Institute in 1916 to fight in the First World War and was stationed on the Italian front where he wrote several letters to Wheeler expressing his nostalgic feelings for Rice which persists in his later correspondence. The letters from Muller and Davies equally express fond memories of Wheeler and Rice Institute and provide Wheeler with motivation for his career and gossip on affairs at Rice.</p><p>In 1986, Wheeler authored a brief autobiography of his early career in biology entitled <emph render="italic">My Association with William Morton Wheeler. </emph>In this work, he describes vividly the reasons why he became a biologist, his studies and experiences at Rice Institute and his work at Harvard's Bussey Institute.</p><p>Also included with George Wheeler's records is the memory book that he maintained during his stay at Rice Institute. In this scrapbook, Wheeler kept photographs of the biology staff, field trips and the campus, as well as newspaper and magazine clippings and memorabilia from social events.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection contains business papers, correspondence, photographs, and memorabilia of the James Lockhart Autry family. Among the business papers are correspondence and legal briefs from the terms Autry served as general counsel to the Texas Company, president of Fidelity Trust Company, and vice-president and general counsel of the American Republics Corporation. </p><p>Family papers include correspondence from Autry's grandfather Micajah Autry (1792-1836) to his wife describing his travels to Texas. Micajah Autry came to Texas to fight in the revolution and died at the Alamo. Autry's father, James Lockhart Autry, served as Speaker of the House of Representatives in Mississippi and practiced law in partnership with Lucius Cincinnatus Lamar. A number of papers deal with this aspect of his career as well as his service in the Confederate Army in which he attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was killed at the Battle of Murfreesboro on December 31, 1862. Also included are correspondence from Autry's mother, Jeanie Valliant Autry Brown to her immediate family. </p><p>The bulk of the collection pertains to James Lockhart Autry II's business papers, legal papers, numbered files, personal papers, memorabilia, and papers dealing with administration of his estate. </p> </scopecontent>

<p>The F. Curtis Michel Scientist-Astronaut Papers consist of 68 linear feet of material organized into two series, Academic Papers (1951-1979) and NASA Papers (c. 1963-1981). The collection includes correspondence, memos, technical handbooks, training manuals, course and seminar notes, photographs, and a great variety of ephemera, including a flight jacket with NASA emblem. Extensive scientific research material in the collection (seminar notes, scholarly publications, and such) provide a good overview of contributions from the academic community to NASA's various endeavors. The collection has interest not only for the extensive material concerning Michel's work in the Scientist-Astronaut program, but also for glimpses into the administrative workings of NASA and the tensions between various groups involved with the space program. Michel's candid observations and reflections both during his years as an astronaut and after his resignation offer an unusual look at a complex institution and the gifted individuals whose lives were caught up in it.</p><p>Series I: Academic Papers contains material from Michel's days as a graduate student in physics at California Institute of Technology and correspondence and research materials pertaining to his academic position at Rice University. Of particular interest is the early correspondence between Michel and officials at NASA concerning his interest in and later application to the Scientist-Astronaut Program. A number of newspaper clippings from 1963 concerning plans for the program and Michel's interest in it are also helpful in documenting the new directions underway in the national space effort toward lunar flight and research.</p><p>Of equal interest is material from the period following Michel's resignation in August, 1965. Correspondence and clippings reveal an intense ongoing critique of manned space flight programs, with debate between members of the scientific community and NASA over how to balance the demands of scientific research with those of technical flight proficiency.</p><p>Series II: NASA Papers, is divided into seventeen sub-series. The Correspondence sub-series consists of correspondence about the Scientist-Astronaut Program, personal correspondence, letters to and from the public, and administrative and travel material. The sub-series is especially valuable in documenting Michel's experience with NASA, including his application for admission to the Scientist-Astronaut Program, astronaut work assignments and training, pertinent clippings about NASA, early doubts about continuing in the program, and factors leading to his resignation in 1969. The last three folders contain manuscript notes for a book discussing his NASA experiences, and also his response to a Space Program Advisory Council study of the Scientist-Astronaut program, which was conducted in 1974-75, accompanied by a copy of the resulting report.</p><p>Astronaut Training and Familiarization gives a good overview of the many technical and scientific areas in which an astronaut was expected to develop proficiency. Areas included geology and astronomy, Gemini Program familiarization, flight training, and the Apollo Program.</p><p>The Gemini Program, Apollo Program, Surveyor Program, and Space Station sub-series include material from four NASA programs, with good coverage of experiments conducted and samplings of scientific publications contributing to these programs, while the Technical and Scientific Publications gives an idea of the variety of material produced between 1950 and 1970 relating to space research.</p><p>Included in the Oversize Materials is a commemorative album, large photographs, and assorted newspapers and publications. Photographs of the various groups of astronauts are found in the Photograph sub-series, including Group 4, Michel's group of Scientist-Astronauts, and a number of photographs of Michel in his role as an astronaut. Geologic scenes and various technical subjects make up the remainder of the sub-series, along with an astronaut training film.</p><p>The final subseries, Memorabilia, contains a wide variety of material collected by Michel during his affiliation with NASA. Boxes 67 and 68 hold commemorative plaques, medallions and insignia, certificates, postal envelopes, launch invitations, calendars, and assorted other items.</p><p>Series III: Includes NASA photographs, records, correspondence, and a partial flight plan; World Book Encyclopedia materials; and news clippings</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection documents Huxley's role as a synthesizer and educator who influenced thinking in many areas, including studies of taxonomy and relative growth, pioneering work in ethology, and important writing in the early twentiety-century synthesis of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian theory. His belief that evolution was not only biological but social and cultural as well led to interests in eugenics, population control, conservation and humanist movements. Linking scientists, science and other fields and science and the public, Huxley corresponded with such scientists, artists, writers and social figures as Kenneth Clark, J.B.S. Haldane, H.J. Muller, Bertrand Russell, Stephen Spender and H.G. Wells. Other materials found in the papers include original writings, publications of others, organizational, conference and travel materials, personal diaries, photographs and memorabilia.</p><p>Correspondence forms approximately one-third of the papers. It exemplifies the shape of the collection as a whole in that its volume increases steadily from the early years onward, peaking in the 1950s and 1960s and diminishing sharply during the times of Sir Julian's depressions. The most substantive part of the collection, the correspondence, not only includes letters from many twentieth-century intellectual, social and cultural leaders, but also provides the most information about Sir Julian and his myriad activities. Sir Julian's own writings -- published and unpublished - comprise another one-third of the collection.</p> </scopecontent>

They are rich in information of both personal and scientific nature. From his youth, there are notebooks of biological drawings, bird-watching notes, class notes and essays. The pocket diaries of the later period contain appointments, itineraries and observations about activities in which he was involved at various times. Those notebooks from Huxley's Oxford and University of London period also contain faculty lists and university schedules.</p><p>Of particular interest are the journals kept by Huxley throughout his life which provide a wealth of biographical material.

This series is particularly rich because it details the development of his thought and conveys the variety of his interests. There are poems and short stories written when he was a young man, notes on scientific work and classroom lectures given during the period when he taught biology. (N.B. Among these are a series of lectures he prepared while at Rice.) The series also contains manuscripts and/ or typed copies of articles, book reviews, drafts of letters to editors and public lectures. Of special interest are the manuscripts for the Romanes Lecture (1943), the Kalinga Prize Speech (1953), the Lasker Award Address (1959) and the John Danz Lecture (1962); and those of The Science of Life, The Humanist Frame, From an Antique Land and both volumes of Huxley's autobiography, Memories.</p><p>The manuscripts, typescripts and notes are in chronological order. However, many of the notes and manuscript fragments are on undated scraps of paper and some are almost illegible. Therefore, although the greatest care has been taken to ascertain the date for each fragment, it was impossible to accurately place each manuscript or note. The researcher should bear this in mind when using these materials.</p></scopecontent>

The organizations represented here reflect Huxley's varied interest in biology, humanism, eugenics and population control and conservation. Occasionally files overlap: the founding of the World Wildlife Fund is documented in the "Nature Conservancy" and "World Wildlife Fund" files; the Galapagos Island expedition is recorded in the Royal Society's Pacific Expedition Committee minutes and in the "Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Islands" file. Most items fall in the 1940-1966 period.</p><p>Some organizations, such as the Royal Society and Eugenics Society, have fairly complete runs of material over a period of years; most, however, such as the Naples Zoological Station, are represented by only a few documents, or, as in the case of Unesco, several unrelated items spanning many years of sporadic collecting. Two files with perhaps the most original and complete materials are those concerning the Unesco "History of the Social and Cultural Development of Mankind" for the years 1948-1966 and a discussion group active in the 1950s, the "Idea Systems Group." Organizations which solicited Sir Julian's support also have material in this series - such as the Religious Society of Families, a eugenically-based community in the United States.</p><p>Government publications and publications sponsored by an organization but authored by individuals are in the MANUSCRIPTS, PUBLICATIONS AND ADDRESSES BY OTHERS series.

<p>Walter Gardner Hall has been a man of many parts--most of them seemingly incongruous. He has been a successful banker and a champion of the liberal wing of the Texas Democratic Party. He has had important social and business ties with the conservative Houston <emph render="doublequote">establishment</emph> and at the same time has been a close friend of such <emph render="doublequote">anti-establishment</emph> figures as John Henry Faulk. Through the political wars of the 1950's and 1960's, Hall managed to remain on good terms personally and politically with both Lyndon B. Johnson and Ralph W. yarborough, the oft-feuding leaders of the Texas Democrats on a national level. Within the 25 shelf feet of the Hall Papers there is a record of these diverse associations.</p><p>Contained within these papers as well is much information on the men and women with whom Hall corresponded. Among the most notable politicians are Lyndon Johnson, Ralph Yarborough, Sam Rayburn, Minnie Fisher Cunningham, Jim Wright, and Hubert Humphrey. Hall often served as an access route from the people of the Gulf Coast to these politicians, and his letters to the lesser-known folk of his area are equally interesting. Walter Hall, though, has been more than a political animal; his papers reflect extremely close ties with his sons and with friends such as J. R. Parten, George <emph render="doublequote">Heap</emph> Alexander, W. A. Cooper, Fagan Dickson, and Ralph Yarborough.</p><p>Besides speaking of politics and Hall's feelings for other human beings, these papers say much about Walter Hall himself. Hall is the piece of the puzzle which makes these incongruous parts fit together into an understandable whole. His ability to accept divergent opinion if honestly held and to work within the practical limits of a situation reveal some of the reasons for his political and economic success. At the same time, his political values and his position in the midrange between political officials and the voting public illustrate why the American system of government has worked as well as it has.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Osterhout Family Papers detail the lives of John Patterson Osterhout and his family in
Texas and in Central America during the latter half of the nineteenth and the early
twentieth centuries. This collection primarily consists of the correspondence, professional
records and personal effects of the Osterhout family.</p>
<p>The first series follows the personal life and professional career of John Osterhout from
his schooldays and teaching career in Pennsylvania to his death in Belton, Texas in 1903.
With respect to his personal correspondence, the collection holds many of the letters that
John sent as well as those that he received; thus, it is increasingly easy to explore the
day to day affairs and concerns of the man. Outside of the social value of these papers,
John Osterhout's records hold a great deal of information on a variety of subjects such as
the American Civil War, legal issues, state and national politics, Indian raids, slavery and
the Texas Revolution.</p>
<p>The second series contains Paul Osterhout's personal and professional records. They
chronicle his life from his academic career at Baylor College and the Jefferson Medical
College in Pennsylvania, through his stay in Central America and his return to Texas. Paul's
letters from school provide a good look at life in a boarding school and an out-of-town
university. The records, especially the correspondence, from Nicaragua, Colombia and Panama
detail a number of topics from running a plantation, to being an American in a foreign
country, to combating yellow fever, to lengthy descriptions of the political changes and
turmoil that Nicaragua and Colombia endured in the later 1800's and early 1900's.</p>
<p>Since the records of John and Paul Osterhout make up the bulk of the papers, they have been
placed in their own series. The third series is dedicated to the other members of the
Osterhout family and general family materials. The letters of Gertrude and Ora Osterhout, as
well as Gertrude's journal, provide information on the daily affairs of the all female
boarding school, Baylor Female College. The letters of Junia (Roberts) Osterhout generally
are either to or from her siblings in other states. Jeremiah's correspondence is solely from
his stay with his brother Paul in Nicaragua and sheds some more light on the political
affairs of the country in 1894. The Wade family papers, which were added to the Osterhout
family papers when Ora married into the Wade family, are dated from the 1860's and give more
evidence on the American Civil War.</p>
<p>The Osterhout's were active Baptists and with their collection came a number of printed
materials concerning the Baptist religion in Texas in the later half of the nineteenth
century. Also included in this series are letters of standing for various individuals that
moved to new Baptist communities. These letters give testimony to the good standing of the
persons within their old church community.</p>
<p>The last series is made up of a number of architectural plans for houses that were designed
by P. Herbert. It is assumed that they may be some of the homes that the Osterhouts resided
in; however, as there is no information about these plans, it is difficult to be sure for
whom these homes were designed. A few of the houses have their complete plans including the
front and side exteriors, the various floors, the roofs and the foundation plans. Other
houses are only partially complete.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers of the American mathematician, historian of science, and teacher, Salomon Bochner, begin with his career in Germany, receiving a D.Phil from the University of Berlin and teaching mathematics at the University of Munich. At an early age he established a considerable reputation in Europe for his work in harmonic analysis. In 1933 he joined the mathematics faculty of Princeton University, where he remained until 1968. Although he continued his work in harmonic analysis while at Princeton, he also achieved much fame in the fields of several complex variables, probability theory, and in the history and philosophy of science. His last years were spent as the Edgar Odell Lovett Professor of Mathematics at Rice University. Even though he continued to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses in mathematics at Rice, his scholarly work there was principally historical.</p><p>The collection consists of correspondence, manuscripts produced in the preparation of articles, books and lectures, financial and legal documents, and printed material in the form of off-prints and books. Bochner's correspondents included many of the most distinguished scholars of the twentieth century. Their letters complement the scholarly works found in the collection, and both series reflect the profundity and breadth of Bochner's ideas and interests and the influence he exerted in the realm of mathematics and history.</p><p>Salomon Bochner's papers were donated to Rice University and placed in Fondren Library's Woodson Research Center in 1982 by his daughter, Deborah Bochner Kennel. On 11 May she donated five record storage boxes from his home in Houston, and she arranged to have sent on 12 October an additional thirty-four boxes from the Mathematics Department of Princeton University. Along with the manuscripts came a great number of books. Only those books which were either written by Bochner or annotated by him have been retained with the papers. The remainder were given to the Fondren Library to be distributed among its regular collections.</p><p>Roughly half of the collection consists of correspondence and the manuscripts produced in preparation for a tremendous number of scholarly works. These two sections correspond with each other chronologically in that the bulk of the material in each falls between 1968 and 1981, the years Bochner spent at Rice University. The rest of the collection is less significant but potentially useful. The financial and legal manuscripts provide some detail on the practical affairs of an American academic, and the thirty-six linear feet of off-prints, which make up part of the collection, reflect Bochner's varied scholarly interests and may prove useful to the researcher when references to such works appear in the manuscripts.</p><p>The collection as received was almost completely unorganized, and a chronological or an alphabetical arrangement was used according to the nature of the various categories that emerged during processing. The number of items in each box and file is given in brackets. Separate descriptions for each series precede its inventory.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_02564485593678eaf71571eca086b9f4"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p><emph render="bolditalic">See Index to Correspondents for a list of correspondents, as they are not listed individually here. </emph> </p><p>Although correspondence makes up only about sixteen per cent of the entire collection, it contains some of the most valuable research material. Of course some of the letters deal with personal, practical, legal, and financial affairs, but many by both Bochner and his colleagues discuss scholarly matters in such detail and at such length that they could almost be considered unpublished works, amply demonstrating the profundity and breadth of Bochner's ideas and interests and the influence he exerted in the realm of mathematics and the history of science. His correspondents included many of the most distinguished scholars of the twentieth century from such diverse disciplines as art, classics, mathematics, linguistics, biology, physics, philosophy, and history.</p><p>Chronologically, the bulk of the correspondence falls within the period from 1968 to 1982 when Bochner was at Rice University. Any documents attached to a letter were not separated; therefore, any single item may contain any number of leaves of both correspondence and other related material. The letters are arranged into two sections: incoming in alphabetical order and outgoing in chronological order. Because almost all of the letters are dated, one may locate a correspondent who wrote to Bochner in both Part I of the Index of Correspondents and the papers themselves, and use the date on the letters to follow the correspondence into the chronological files. Similarly, because Bochner kept carbon or photographic copies of almost all of his letters, one interested in a particular period of Bochner's life or work may begin with the chronological arrangement and follow the trail of individual correspondents of interest within the alphabetical section. Those to whom Bochner wrote have been listed in Part II of the Index of Correspondents.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_59e87f3761660b818b2270cc525e49c5"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Manuscripts of scholarly works make up a large and significant gathering of research material. Bochner wrote many versions of his many articles and books. These files reveal the evolution of his thought from handwritten notes to the completed manuscript. Most items are full of deleted paragraphs, insertions, and marginal comments. A great majority of his publications after his arrival in the United States in 1932 are represented here. Moreover, some of the works found here were never published: the handwritten notes to lectures, articles and books that were started but never finished, and a major book which Bochner was near completing upon his death. The title given each file follows as closely as possible Bochner's own label for the item or the name of the eventual publication to which it pertained. The entire series is arranged in alphabetical order by title. Among items of the same title, an attempt was made to arrange them according to the chronology of their creation, not publication, in order to reveal the sequence of revisions. When it was possible to ascertain an exact date, it was given in the inventory. A printout of all of the bibliographical citations to Bochner's publications in chronological order is in the control file of the collection and is available to researchers upon request.</p></scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_d80215de4472062e1a833561a8fa123d"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This series is comprised of legal and financial documents, personal references, and photographs. The legal and financial documents include wills, publishing and consultant contracts, diplomatic papers, personal bills, high school and university transcripts, military records, receipts, royalty statements, diplomas, certificates, insurance claims, and medical records. Arranged in chronological order from 1914 to 1981, they provide some early biographical data regarding Bochner's education in Poland and Germany, his citizenship, and his military service during World War I. They also give a glimpse of his financial dealings with publishers, particularly Princeton University Press.</p><p>The personal references from teachers and employers were written in the form of general statements concerning Bochner's moral and academic characteristics rather than as true letters to specific individuals.

<p>The Edward Knoblock collection comprises 45 folders of correspondence received by Knoblock between the years 1904 and 1936, relating to theater in Great Britain during the early 20th century. Correspondence relates to British theater in the early 20th century.</p><p>Most of Knoblock's correspondents in this collection are well-known literary figures of the day, or prominent managers and producers from the world of the theatre. Some of these are: Sir Arthur Wing Pinero (1855-1934), the English dramatist and actor; J.B. Priestley (1894- ), the Yorkshire born novelist, essayist, playwright and critic; all the members of the literary Sitwell family, especially, Edith (1887-1964), Osbert (1892-1969), and Sacheverell (1897- ); Sir Hugh Walpole (1884-1941) the New Zealand born novelist and son of the bishop of Edinburgh; Sir Charles Wyndham (1863-1913), the English actor and stage manager; David Belasco (1854-1931), the San Francisco born New York stage manager and producer; Arnold Bennett (1867-1931), the famous English novelist and dramatist of the 'Five Towns' region; Noel Coward (1899- ), the playwright, actor, and composer; English actors, Sir John Gielgud, born in 1904, and Sir Charles Hawtrey (1858-1923); statesman, and first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsey MacDonald (1866-1937); novelist, journalist, and critic, Compton MacKenzie (1883- ); and, Cyril Maude (1863-1951), the English actor, co-manager of the Haymarket theatre in London (1896-1905) and manager and builder of the Playhouse until 1915.</p><p>Owing to the volume of correspondence from him contained in the collection, Sir William Nicholson (1872-1949) deserves a special mention. Nicholson was principally a portrait painter, although he also devoted time to painting figure subjects, still life and open-air studies. He was also a wood engraver and designed posters along with his brother-in-law James Pryde under the name of the Beggarshot Brothers. A series of woodcuts were published including, The Square Book of Animals (1896), and An Almanac of Twelve Sports (1898), this latter being produced in collaboration with Rudyard Kipling. Most of Nicholson's letters to Knoblock are accompanied by small illustrations of some kind, and the collection concludes with ten miscellaneous sketches by this artist.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>Baker College material, teaching and History Dept. records, academic and scholarly correspondence, notes and drafts of books, articles, and lectures, as well as a quantity of Renaissance-Reformation subject files document the faculty and scholarly activities of Charles Garside Jr. (1927-1987). These papers cover the period 1953 to 1987. This represents roughly the second half of Garside's life or, from another perspective, from about the time he began his history Ph.D. work at Yale onward.</p><p>The papers bulk in the Teaching Records and Material series with Renaissance - Reformation subject files. These subject files can be further subdivided into two types: course specific subject files and non-course specific subject files. It is likely that these subject files were created for either of two needs: teaching purposes or as the result of research towards a particular book or article. It is also seems likely that if a subject file was created out of research purposes, once the book or article was published the file would be added to the rest, simply as more lecture source material. These subject files contain primarily handwritten and typed notes with some reprint material.</p><p>The papers bulk again in the series Scholarly Papers with notes, drafts, and correspondence concerning the many books, articles, reviews, papers, speeches and lectures published or presented by Garside. The papers also well represent the fact that Garside was a member of numerous history and Renaissance-Reformation oriented professional organizations/scholarly societies. Garside served as President of The American Society for Reformation Research for several years and much of the material here is correspondence.</p><p>The Garside papers contain very little of a personal nature. The most important material here being several folders of personal correspondence and some address books. Garside was a man of such high scholarship, so intensely devoted to teaching and university life, that if were not for original order it would be difficult to distinguish his personal correspondence from his scholarly correspondence. A few photographs, a number of recipes in a variety of handwritings and some poetry in Garside's handwriting provide some small insight into his nature and life outside the walls of academia.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This material consists of six handwritten pages by J.B. Harris dated December 16, 1863, recounting the capture of his battalion of confederate cavalry outside of New Iberia, Louisiana. Harris begins by informing the reader of the contents of letter followed by a two paragraph introduction to the situation. It is at this time that the writer begins to write in verse. There are twelve stanzas discussing the succession of events during the capture of Green's Texas Brigade. The stanzas are predominately four lines long with the rhyme being mainly the last syllable always exterior with no interior rhyme. The poem mentions various officers referring to them with an assumption of the reader's familiarity. The style of the poem is reminiscent of a ballad and ends with the actual capture of the brigade and its forced transit to New Orleans, Louisiana. </p><p>The document continues with a two-paragraph letter signed by June B. Harris paying tribute to his comrades and discussing the actions of a particular Union officer that he perceived to have conducted himself inappropriately considering the disadvantages the Confederate soldiers were faced with. The second paragraph of J.B. Harris's letter is dedicated to the formal demonstration of gratuity for the Union soldiers' overall leniency and forbearance whilst dealing with their captives. A small paragraph then notes the destruction of Confederate records of the events by the 2nd Illinois. Then a six paragraph essay initialed J.B.H. and called Incidents of the Race narrates the events of the day, oscillating between technical language regarding the brigade and colloquialisms describing the Union soldiers and the battle. </p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection includes a bound volume of twenty-eight letters and a boxed photocopy. The vast majority of the correspondence is from Ms. Kezia Payne DePelchin to her sister, Sallie Payne, describing her experience as a volunteer nurse from late August to mid-November during the 1878 yellow fever epidemic. The letters explain DePelchin's motivations for traveling to Memphis and joining the Howard Association as a volunteer nurse, her experiences as a nurse, the reactions of Memphis society to the work of female nurses, and the difficulties of her occupation. The letters also recount the spread and effects of the epidemic, and chronicle her travels through Tennessee and into Mississippi and Alabama as she followed the illness and responded to need. Letters to her sister from 1879, after her return home, are present as well. Also included in the volume were letters to DePelchin from E. Kate Heckle. Heckle, who was also a Houston resident and a friend of DePelchin, had nursed in several epidemics and responded to the same call for assistance from the Howard Assocation, volunteering from September through October. DePelchin and Heckle proceeded separately to Memphis, and saw each other sporadically through their stays. Heckle wrote several letters to DePelchin describing her own experiences and difficulties.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection consists of an original manuscript diary by Elizabeth Craw, which contains entries from 1833-1841. The diary recounts in short, sporadic entries her 1833 journey from Cleveland, Ohio, to Saint Augustine, Texas to see her soldier fiancé, Samuel Evans. Craw writes of the methods and difficulties of their long trek on horseback, along the Mississippi and Red Rivers, and across Louisiana bayous. After Craw and her future in-laws arrived in Texas, the entries stop until March 20, 1836, when the diary indicates that Evans was killed at the Alamo. The journal shows that Craw opened a small school in her house in Saint Augustine in 1837. In much of her journal after this, Craw expresses her despair through poems and passages. In 1841, Craw writes in Cleveland that she had "come back to die in the home of my father/ and sit 'neath the blossoms that mock my decay/ And thus my fond memory the sad harvest gathers/ of friendships and loves that have long passed away."</p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_519251422ea9b5a9a1b74c6b48a7a357"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>William Allen Haynes was an inveterate collector, saving everything from cattle bulletins to the dietary cure for gonorrhea. From 1901-1917 Haynes was primarily interested in ranching, and his papers proved considerable information on range conditions in central Texas, the cattle markets in Ft. Worth, and his efforts to build up and maintain his ranch through the use of numerous loans and mortgages. </p><p>About 1918 Haynes obtained an interest in the Leon Valley Oil Company, and for the next few years he received extensive correspondence from his brother Robert on the ups and downs of the oil business. From 1919 to about 1935, Haynes' business papers cover a much wider spectrum than in previous years. Besides ranching and oil, the papers deal with land speculation, litigation concerning land titles, and banking. Of special interest in the papers is the correspondence concerning Haynes' efforts to keep the troubled First National Bank of Killeen open. From 1929 to 1935 Haynes served as the president of this bank, and corresponded with prominent Texas bankers as well as Governor Miriam and Jim Ferguson. </p><p>The papers for 1935 to 1952 show a decline in Haynes' business activity. The primary importance of this segment of the collection is the information it gives on the cattle market in Fort Worth, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Illinois. Besides business records the Haynes collection contains personal bank records, private correspondence and material pertaining to Bell County Politics from1914 to 1922. </p><p>Typical contents: Court Summons, Real Estate Advertisements, Bank Loan Application and General Correspondence, Receipts for Various Business Purchases, Bail Bonds, Jury Summons, Official Complaint Forms, Criminal Subpoena Forms, Livestock Manuals, Farmer's Bulletins and Advertisements, Life Insurance Forms, Political Messages, Bank Deposit Slips, Tax Receipts, Warrant of Arrest Form.</p></scopecontent>

<p>The collection consists of the form letter sent from Thomas W. Hotchkiss regarding the effects of women's suffrage, as well as the responses from public officials in states that had previously adopted the measure. The form letter, dated September 27, 1915, was sent to public officials in hopes of soliciting responses to the opposition to suffrage. Hotchkiss' letter asked if women began to neglect their homes, if the social fabric had been damaged, if undesirable women are active, and how one should respond to the argument that voting women should be expected to defend her country. </p><p>Twenty-seven public officials responded, including the Governor of Alaska, the Executive Secretary of California, the Governor of Illinois, the Attorney General of Utah, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Colorado, the Secretary of State and the Chief Justice of Washington, and the Governor, Chief Justice, and Secretary of State of Kansas. From Montana, the Governor, Chief Justice, Secretary of the Department of the Attorney General, and the Secretary of State all responded. In Nevada, the Governor, Chief Justice, Attorney General, and Secretary of State also sent responses, as did the Governor, Chief Justice, Secretary of State, and State Librarian of Oregon. The Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Deputy Secretary of State of Wyoming also wrote in response to the survey. The responses, which were of varying length and enthusiasm, were all in support of women's suffrage. </p> </scopecontent>

<p>These records include the original William Marsh Rice murder trial records, and the estate records of Rice, founder of Rice Institute, now Rice University. These records relate to the formation of the idea of the Rice Institute and the activities of its first Board of Trustees in the years before Mr. Rice's death and to the Institute's formative years just after his death. The outcomes of the legal proceedings documented in these records, which related to significant financial resources and real estate, played the critical role in the creation of Rice Institute. A small amount of Rice's personal and business papers are also present.</p><p>See Series descriptions in the Detailed Description of the Collection for more information.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_0d7de82ae72746a2afebceccc76a6e47"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>These cases are filed chronologically based on each case's beginning date. Major cases include cases challenging William Marsh Rice's late wife's will and William Marsh Rice's murder trial. Each generally includes correspondence, notes, and legal documents such as testimony, exhibits, trial documents, affidavits, releases, published versions of the trials, and newsclippings.</p><p>The first case is that of William Marsh Rice vs. Orren T. Holt, executor of Mrs. Elizabeth Baldwin Rice's estate, 1896-1902, regarding Rice's challenge to his wife's will. This trial began while W.M. Rice was living and continued after his death. Mrs. Rice's will assumed that the couple's property was divisible equally under Texas' community property law, and would have given away significant funds and lands, including the land on which Rice University sits today. W.M. Rice and his representatives proved that the couple were actually residents of new York and not Texas, making Mrs. Rice's will essentially null. The lawyer for Mrs. Rice's executor, Orren T. Holt, was Albert T. Patrick, who features as the defendant in the Rice murder trial. This case was settled in 1903 for $200,000.</p><p>The second case is William Marsh Rice's murder trial, People of the State of NY vs. Patrick, 1900-1902. The evidence available here includes medical and handwriting experts' testimony, as well as the original glass plate negatives of Rice's real and alleged signatures used to prove Patrick's forgery of the 1900 Wm. M. Rice will, which benefited Patrick greatly and essentially scrapped significant plans for the Rice Institute, thereby proving Patrick's motive for the murder. Patrick was convicted and went to prison, but only a few years later was pardoned and released.</p><p>Adele Baldwin vs. W. M. Rice Jr. &amp; executors of Rice will, 1886-1908, the last large case in this series, relates to Mrs. Elizabeth Baldwin Rice's heirs challenging the executors of W.M. Rice's estate and is essentially a continuation of William Marsh Rice vs. Orren T. Holt. In November 1905, the case was decided, then appealed. Attorneys included Arthur Turnure of NY, for administrators of estate of E.B. Rice; William B. Hornblower, Atty. for estate of Wm. M. Rice (Hornblower, Byrne, Miller &amp; Potter, of NY); and Oran Holt, Houston representative for E.B. Rice estate, with A.T. Patrick as his NY legal representative (up until the time of his trial and incarceration).</p></scopecontent>

<p>These materials reflect the daily business of Rice University Chairman of the Board Bill Barnett, including correspondence, reports, publications and newsclippings. As board chair, Barnett led the strengthening of the university's governance, moving from the two-tiered board to a single-tier board enlarged to 25 trustees. Under his leadership, the board elected a far more diverse group of trustees with representation from all parts of the country; the university amended its charter to allow for the use of debt financing, which led to the largest building and modernization program in the campus's history; and the university's endowment grew from $1.7 billion to $3.4 billion.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of several hundred typed pages and many photographs, deals with the early immigration of Germans into Texas (ca. 1835-1860). Clyde H. Porter of Kansas City, Missouri collected the material and then sent about a dozen copies of his work to various libraries and individuals. Oswald Mueller of Houston received the material and donated this collection to Rice University. </p><p>The main portion of the material focuses on the families of Dresel and Spiess. Gustav Dresel (1818-1848) came to Texas in 1837, and while in Galveston, served as business agent of the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants into Texas. His brother Julius (1816-1891) immigrated to Texas in the fall of 1848 and settled near Sisterdale on the Guadalupe River. This collection contains an English translation of his "Sisterdale Diary." In this diary, Julius Dresel describes his immigration from Germany to Texas, his life as a farmer, and several encounters with Indians.</p><p>The collection contains both a notebook containing some of Hermann Spiess' personal papers and a group of interesting letters sent to his family in Germany. In his personal papers, he describes his appointment as General Commissioner of the Adelsverein (Association of Noblemen) in Texas, as well as the monetary and organizational difficulties that this association faced. He goes on to describe a gunfight as well as several court trials he was involved in, all regarding the rightful ownership and occupation of Nassau Plantation in Fayette County. In his letters to his family in Germany he describes the land, climate, growing conditions, and community of New Braunfels. Spiess writes often to his sister, telling her how important education is for her children, and also expressing his personal opinions regarding American and German politics and Christianity. </p><p> The collection also contains letters from Ernst and Ida Kapp, settlers of Sisterdale, a company contract of the "German Colonization Company," and numerous photographs of people mentioned throughout the papers. </p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of a series of letters and a map annotated by Mr. Atwood concerning his archaeological findings in the Galveston Bay area. In these letters, Mr. Atwood relates his knowledge of aboriginal spoil banks and other archaeological findings to Hardin Craig Jr. (librarian at Fondren Library) as well as H. A. Bernard of Shell Development Company and a Forest Supervisor in Louisiana. Also included in the collection is a map covered in marks which Mr. Atwood reveals in his letters to be Indian measurements, and that he has discovered that there was much more Indian activity in the area than previously thought by archaeologists. The area described is Stephen Creek. </p><p>Stephen Creek is at the junction of State Highway 156 and Farm Road 224 on Lake Livingston, seventy-five miles north of Houston in northeastern San Jacinto County. The nearby creek was named after Miles G. Stephen, a Georgia native who moved to the area after having first lived in what would become Polk County. Other early settlers who moved to the area before 1842 included Jim Hopkins, Arnett Harrell, and Dan Sellers. Most residents were small farmers who grew cotton and corn and raised hogs. The Stephen Creek post office opened in 1915 and was closed in 1954. The community's population was estimated to be twenty through the early 1960s. Since the completion of Lake Livingston Stephen Creek has grown. Still more residents live in the Holiday Shore development, which offers recreational opportunities on the lake. In 1990 the population of Stephen Creek was 135.

<scopecontent id="aspace_3b57699124004ee358ab3ca1d83530e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This Addendum includes roughly one hundred fifty letters written between 1934 and 1982 to Ira Gruber's mother (Mary Louise Dempsey Gruber, 1909-1983). Ira Gruber and his wife, Patricia Sanderford Gruber (1929- ) wrote two-thirds of these letters to his "Mom." Their children—Anna, Talarah, and Conrad Gruber—wrote most of the remainder, all except a few letters from his mother's brothers Roger, James, and Donald Dempsey to their sister, "Lou." Some of Ira's and his wife's letters are addressed to both his mother and his younger sister, "Mary Lou" (Mary Louise Gruber Pollack, 1949- ).. His mother left only three drafts of replies: one to her son and two to the head of her daughter's school.</p>
<p/>
<p>Ira's letters to his mother were written while he was a student at Duke University, an officer in the U. S. Navy, a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Early American History and Culture, and a member of the history departments at Duke, the College of William and Mary, Occidental College, and Rice University. Taken together, Ira's letters complement his Academic Career Papers at Rice—providing glimpses of his reading, the academic advice he gave to his sister and children, and, especially, the research and writing he did between 1965 and 1980 when he published his first book and more than a dozen articles and lectures.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of circa 700 color prints stolen from the journals Ibis (the journal of the British Ornithologists' Union) and Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, owned by the Fondren Library. The prints date from 1859-1915 and feature birds, bird eggs, bird nests and other animals. The prints were recovered after Blumberg's 1991 arrest and returned to Fondren Library. The bags in which they are stored are the bags which Blumberg used for them. The folder names for the bags reflect his labeling on the bags. Theft correspondence and research dates from 1980-2004 and represents the Fondren Library's efforts to cooperate with and assist in the Blumberg investigation.
Additionally, Series III includes plates recovered from other unidentified sources, probably unrelated to the thefts from Ibis and the Journal of Zoology. These prints were found in the collections at the Woodson Researcher Center with no provenance information, but are similar in nature to the other plates in this collection, and so are being included here.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of photographs and printed materials concerning the Panama Canal and the Isthmus of Panama, collected by William E. Tragsdorf. Series I, the photographs, is made up of three small albums, 5-1/2 x 7 inches, and sixteen large, mostly 8 x 10 inch, loose photographs, all black and white. The small albums are numbered 1, 2, and 6 and are marked with particular dates in 1905 or 1906. Most of the small photographs are marked "W.E.T.," indicating that they were taken by Tragsdorf. Two that lack this mark may be of the photographer himself. The photographs in these albums, sixteen in each, are scenes of places and people in Panama that give an idea of how the area looked before the canal was built. The men pictured in business attire are obviously individuals who came to work or visit during the construction. Most of the 8 x 10 photographs document stages of the project. Those that are dated are marked 1908, 1910, 1911, 1922, and 1933.</p><p>Series II, a scrapbook, contains material collected, apparently by Tragsdorf, in keeping with his lifelong interest in the Isthmus of Panama. The earliest document is a photocopy of a fourteen-page pamphlet titled "A Few Words for the Traveller over the Isthmus of Panama," apparently published in 1851 with a topographic map of the area. A second photocopy is of a seventeen-page narrative by Julius H. Pratt titled "To California by Panama in '49." "49" in the title refers to the 1849 gold rush. Next are eleven 8-1/2 x 10-1/2 inch color plates showing ships passing through the completed canal and scenes around it. Another item is a twenty-two-page pamphlet, 7-3/4 x 8-7/8 inches, titled "Following the Floating Road: One of the World's Greatest Travel Thrills." One of its photographs is dated January 1933. The final item is an article from The New York Times Magazine of August 12, 1934, titled "In 1934 as in 1914, the Canal is an Epic."</p><p>The materials in the Tragsdorf Panama Canal Zone Photograph Collection reflect not only fascination with and appreciation of the engineering feat that the building of the canal was, but also a deep interest in the history of attention paid to the Isthmus of Panama. Along with photographs taken by Tragsdorf himself are a photocopy of an 1851 text written for travelers over the Isthmus and another of a narrative about going to California in 1849 by way of Panama. Altogether the collection documents an individual's lifelong fascination with being part of the work that transformed the Canal Zone into the pathway of the Panama Canal.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of postcards featuring Rice Institute and Rice University, gathered from various sources. The largest segment is an album in which are mounted 35 3-1/2" x 5-1/2" color scenes identified by the donor as the first cards made following the change of Rice's name from Institute to University. They were all made after July 1, 1960 and most in 1961. This album was a gift to Rice from Damon D. Hickey, class of 1964. The remainder of the collection consists of loose cards of varying sizes and dates. Most are 3-1/2" x 5-1/2", but the most recent are 4" x 6". The latter feature images of buildings "inside" contemporary graphic lettering. The smaller scenic cards have labels identifying buildings at either Rice Institute or Rice University. Three cards are not pictorial of Rice, two of which report a football score (Rice 7, A&amp;M 6), and one which juxtaposes images of the mascots of Rice and the University of Texas.

Illuminated vellum manuscript leaf with an unusual and especially appealing historiated initial showing King Ahasuerus, Esther, and Mordecai, all connected by a hangman's rope, from a Bible in Latin. Text from the opening through the first three chapters of Esther. (Paris, middle third of the 13th century) 248 x 152 mm. (9.75" x 6"). Double column, 55 lines of text in a very small, pleasing gothic book hand. Capitals struck with with red, chapter numbers and headlines in red and blue, two prominent chapter initials in red or blue with elaborate penwork in the same two colors, and one side with a fine historiated initial telling the story of Esther and Mordecai, the main part of the captial in three compartments (measuring, together, approxiamtely 60 x 8 mm) at the top of the column and with a marginal extender stretching the entire length of the text. Faint marginal discoloration, minor soiling and rumpling, generally in nearly fine condition.</p><p>This is a remarkably engaging early Bible leaf with an initial that is replete with narrative communicated in an unusually imaginitive visual manner. The Book of Esther tells the story of how the faithful court official Mordecai is saved from being ahnged at the ahnds of the Persian king Ahasuerus' treacherous minister Haman. And it tells of the successful attempt made by the Jewish queen Esther to save her people from Haman's edict of extermination, an order prompted by the fact that Mordecai, a Jew, refuses to prostrate himself in Haman's presence. Our initial seems to conflate the two stories in a clever and artful way. In the bottom compartment of the long initial "I," we see Mordecai, dressed only in tatters from waist to knees, with a noose around his neck. He is done entirely in white against a magenta background, a depiction that suggests his impending lifelessness (there is also a tiny dragon nipping at his feet). The rope stretches upward through the floow of the middle compartment and into the top compartment, where the regally attired king sits with both hands grasping the deadly cord. A good firm tug, and Mordecai is dead. But in the crucial middle compartment sits Esther, who also grasps the rope in such a way as to provide the critical slack necessary to save the would-be victim. As in seen here, the historiation of Bibles produced during the 13th century tends to relate to the text in some specific way (though there are also a certain proportion of generic figures). What is infrequently seen is the incorporation of multiple elements of the story. And what is even more uncommon is the case, as here, where the artist takes imaginitive liberties with his subject in an effective visual wayin order to emphasize something grand and inherently difficult to portray - like a queen saving her people.

<scopecontent id="aspace_0a5589348ab58a020d0c1b479c992844"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Description provided by dealer:
Illuminated vellum manuscript with a fine historiated initial showing scenes from the life of King David and with a decorative border including a hunting scene. Text from Psalm 1:1 - 2:8. Southern Netherlands [possibly Saint-Omer], late 13th century, 140x102mm (5.5"x4"). Single column, 19 lines in an excellent gothic liturgical hand. Versal initials in red or blue, three line blue initial on verso with wispy red penwork elaboration in the form of delicately drawn ivy leaves extending into three margins (slightly trimmed at the top). RECTO with a wonderfully animated 12-line historiated "B" (60 x 55mm) in pink and white tracery, the initial on a ground of blue and pink knotwork, the upper compartment containing a miniature of King David harping in his palace (the towers of which poke through into the head margin), and the lower compartment showing the young David about to behead the giant Goliath, who is attired in a tunic and chainmail, both scnese in colors on a burnished gold ground, the initial with branching leafy border extending into all four margins, the border composed of blue and pink bars with twining leaves and berries in pink, blue and orange at the corners, a bas-de-page scene of a hunter with a horn and bow accompanied by two hounds pursuing a leaping stag, one blue bird flying up along the fore-edge margin and another perched atop the initial, pecking at a berry, a delightful lion dozing on the very top of the text, his improbably long tail extending down 13 lines. Gold mostly lost now (revealing white gesso), script a little difficult to read beacuse of fading or erosion, a number of very tiny holes where ink has eaten through the vellum, other minor defects, but none of these imperfections fatal, the vellum generally well preserved, and the original appeal of the dynamic leaf still largely intact.</p><p>This is the extremely charming opening leaf of a very fine early gothic Psaltrer with spirited decoration, doubtless made for lay use. The scene in the lower margin shows a stag hunt, probably very familiar from the world of a patron. The subject and composition of the Beatus initial, with two scenes from David's life, became characteristic of the Southern Netherlands, especially in Ghent and Saint-Omer (cf. G. Haselhoff, "Die Psalterillustration im 13. Jahrhundert," pp. 112-122, and K. Carlvant, "Manuscript Painting in Thirteen-Century Flanders, Bruges, Ghent and the Circle of the COunts," p. 341.) The theme of Psalm 1 is the triumph of righteousness over evil, and the beheading of Goliath was an appropriate motif. Smililarly, the lion, crouching at the upper right here, had been a common theme for Psalm 1 in romanesque Psalters. The delicate style loosely resembles that of the manuscripts clustered around the Psalter of Guy de Dampierre (Brussels, B.R., MS 10607), ca. 1265-70, but it was imitated elsewhere, including at Saint-Omer (ibid., chapter 9, pp. 137-44).

<scopecontent id="aspace_ac8a4f59449061c30ede2199e0a3664b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Dealer description: Mounted on a later sheet of vellum. A large rectangular miniature depicting the Virgin Mary on her deathbed, surrounded by the Apostles, this enclosed by a wide and ornate bar border in pink and blue with gold tracery, the frame outlined in burnished gold and with floral cornerpieces in colors and gold, this within a full floral border filled many leaves and flowers in color and gold. All four ruled margins trimmed away (with some loss at each edge), minor flaking of gold from cornerpieces and from the green robe of an Apostle, otherwise in fine condition. </p><p>The scene here is affecting and beautifully rendered, with much detail. The pale Virgin lies in her pink and blue robes on a fine bedstead with rich red pillows and counterpane embroidered in gold, one hand lifted in benediction. Saint Joan hovers by the head of the bed, while Saint Peter in a blue and gold cape administers the last rites. Two other Apostles kneel on the green tessellated floor beside the bed, while the others crowd into the stone bedroom with mullioned windows and vaulted red ceiling. It is the very definition of a gentle death, surrounded by loved ones, assured of salvation - the type of end aspired to by the Christians who used this prayer book. Although the perspective in the foreground is too rudimentary to make us believe that the Virgin is actually taking up space on an actual bed, the depth of the inner chamber is convincing, and the delicate faces are all extremely well done.

<p>This collection is a subset of a wider gathering of Roy M. Huffington's personal and professional papers. The materials here reflect his time as Ambassador to Austria and the many connections made during his appointment. It includes office records, reports, correspondence, and photographs from the American embassy in Austria, as well as records from the Salzburg Institute, Geological Society of America Foundation, and the American Austrian Foundation. </p><p>Series are composed of records mostly in their original order, though some records were rearranged to reflect their significance or to create more intuitive groupings. While the first series pertains specifically to Huffington's service as Ambassador to Austria, all but one of the subsequent series are based on particular organizations, such as the Salzburg Seminar and the Council of American Ambassadors. Users of this collection should bear in mind that while Huffington's involvement with most of these organizations began due to his service as Ambassador, his interest and involvement in them continued well past the end of his appointment, and consequently the bulk of the records of these series were not generated during that time.</p> </scopecontent>

<head>Original Introduction and Arrangement</head>
<p>INTRODUCTION
In mid-December, 1992, architectural historian Barrie Scardino and I met with Houston Endowment President, Joe Nelson, on the fifth floor of the Bankers Mortgage Building, in what was once Jesse Jones's office. At that time, Ms. Scardino and I were assigned the job of creating an archive from a maze of documents and photographs that had been retrieved from the building's faded green file cabinets, old painted safes and walk-in vaults. Little did we know that the stacks of plain, white bankers boxes arrayed before us were filled with treasures from Houston's past and would reveal rare insight into Mr. Jones's public, business and personal lives.

Houston Endowment had recently moved its offices to the Texas Commerce Tower and had emptied Bankers Mortgage Building of its few remaining tenants, leaving behind these remarkable relics for Ms. Scardino and I to organize and preserve. We established a work space in that same fifth floor office, in the vacant, ten story building on Main Street Mr. Jones built back in 1908 for the Texas Company. As the mass of material slowly took form, our awareness of Mr. Jones's philosophies, achievements and contributions also began to emerge.

About one year later, we moved the evolving archive to Houston Endowment's new office and went to work in one of the conference rooms. Ms. Scardino completed her portion of the project in May of 1994, and, before leaving, created an index to the archive's personal papers. I remained and continued to work on the Foundation's exhibit, which I began soon after we moved into the new building. In January of 1995, it was decided that similar material, housed in temporary storage, should be included in the collection's corporate and property records. (Folders containing this material have stars on the left corner to distinguish them from the more specifically categorized and refined original material.) Now that this task has been accomplished, the archive is complete.

The accompanying indexes are general guides to provide easy access to the collection's documents. The alphabetically listed corporate and property records may not adhere to that arrangement within a box due to the material's varying shapes and sizes. An explanation of certain entries in the corporate and property indexes follows:

BOOK OF ACCOUNT--includes ledgers and journals

DATES--indicate the age range of documents within each entry, even though they may relate to an event that occurred on a specific date, such as a loan or sale

Franchise and income tax dates indicate the years taxes were incurred

Gaps in dates indicate missing documents

Stock book dates indicate the years during which stock was issued

Articles of incorporation dates indicate the day the corporate officers signed the incorporation papers (articles of incorporation sometimes appear as a separate document; may appear in the front of the minute book; or, if there are two or more minute books, may appear with the dissolution certificate in the last book)

Dissolution certificate dates indicate the day the state issued the certificate

VARIOUS DOCUMENTS--includes contracts, correspondence, deeds, inventories, maps and receipts

VARIOUS BUILDINGS, VARIOUS CORPORATIONS, VARIOUS PROPERTIES-
Includes documents involving two or more entities

In the Texas counties where Mr. Jones conducted significant building programs, the property records have been sub-divided into city blocks with their corresponding buildings. Because Mr. Jones invested primarily in Harris County, the volume and scope of the material dictated that the collection be further divided by leagues, surveys, additions and sub-divisions as well as blocks. Only property records involving New York City are organized by address.

This collection embodies a large part of Houston's history. It includes documents involving Stephen F. Austin, the Allen Brothers and, from the more recent past, many notable people, buildings and events. It includes papers from M. T. Jones's vast lumber empire, the business that fueled his nephew Jesse's profound impact on Houston's development and growth. This archive also encompasses the source of one of Mr. Jones's most lasting legacies, Houston Endowment Inc., a legacy that perpetuates his positive influence on our world today.

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection includes the wealth of documentation identified from across the United States and beyond and assembled for the purpose of the publication of the Papers of Jefferson Davis, a 14-volume set, funded by the NHPRC, and other activities and persons, beginning in the 1960s and running through 2015. Many of the speeches and letters published in the edition, either in full or summarized, are present in this collection as photocopies or on microfilm. Not every document featured in the edition is currently represented here, as many were on microfilm on loan from the owning repositories for one-time reference use by the project, and such reels have been returned to the owning repositories.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_4b897b037e5dc7a2a94eb287968c6d57"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>All of the Jefferson Davis documents at the Woodson Research Center are copies except those in the Jefferson Davis Letters and related materials (MS 005, Woodson Research Center). </p><p>The document files include everything the Jefferson Davis Project received in photocopy form, but only a relatively small percentage of prints from documents on microfilm.</p><p>The document files are in chronological order by year.month.day, each in a manila envelope. Conjecturally dated items are filed at the end of the month or year. Documents from the
secretary of war period (1853 - 1857) that cannot be reliably dated are filed at the end of 1857.
Also check in "n.d." at the end of document files.</p><p>The 3x5 pale yellow control slips in the envelopes may or may not reflect the copy actually used in the edition, but are useful for summaries.</p><p>In addition to items to and from Jefferson Davis, the document files include the correspondence of Varina Howell Davis, Joseph E. Davis, and other family members. There are also letters of others about the Davises and contemporary issues. Some small collections of
non-Jefferson/Varina Davis letters are in the genealogy files and vertical files. Two examples in the vertical files: William Preston Johnston letters and Dorsey Papers, the latter since folded
into the Davis Collection at the Museum of the Confederacy (Davis was executor and heir of the Dorsey estate)–see numbers 2905-3081 in the checklist. In the genealogy files: Lise Mitchell Papers and
Josie Alexander Collection.</p><p>The copies come from hundreds of repositories and private owners. Many Davis collections - for example, those held by the Museum of the Confederacy (now located at the Va. Hist. Soc.), Tulane, Library of Congress, Duke, Transylvania, and the U. of Alabama - number in the hundreds or thousands. </p><p>There are typed item by item inventories in the three ring binders for dozens of repositories. They are often helpful in identifying specific letters (where they may be filed, for example) and in determining ownership. </p><p>We cannot allow the copying of any manuscripts except those owned by the Rice University, Davis family members, Library of Congress, and the National Archives. Only if the researcher secured permission from the owner, whether repository or individual, can a copy be made from our copy. Copying of typescripts, transcriptions, and printed versions is permitted.</p><p>Many privately owned documents have entered or re-entered the marketplace since we secured our copies (see 89.2.2, to Martin W. Philips). Likewise, entire collections have been deaccessioned and sold, among them the Forbes Magazine Collection and the Dallas Historical Society collection of Davis / John H. Reagan letters.</p><p>Many other names of collections and repositories have changed. Examples: "Confederate Museum" became Museum of the Confederacy and is now part of the American Civil War Museum; "Chicago Historical Society" is now the Chicago History Museum. The Gilder / Lehrman Collection moved from the Pierpont Morgan Library to the New York Historical Society.</p><p>All copies received from the Filson Club (Filson Historical Society, Louisville) were returned to the Filson as a condition of use. Some were transcribed and the typescripts are in the document files.</p><p>Ownership of the originals sometimes changes, in which case the envelope usually has multiple copies of the same item. See 80.11.22, to Capen, for an example of copies received from two different owners.</p><p>Most prints of documents from microfilm made with old wet process microfilm reader/printers were discarded.</p><p>Not all transcriptions in envelopes were prepared by Davis Project staff. In general, those on yellow or blue paper were. Except for the letters printed in full in the edition, most have not been proofread.
Sometimes there is more than one document in an envelope–enclosure, letter or transmittal, letters on the same subject, for examples. The other letters are identified on the envelope and identified as "f/w" (filed with) in the database. See 61.6.13 from Harris. It happens occasionally that we don't have either the transmittal letter or that one is a photocopy and the other is on film or vice versa.</p><p>Variant versions of the same item are filed together - sender's copy, recipient's copy, printed version, etc.</p><p>Two documents from the same writer on the same day are filed together.
Occasionally, a "permission to print" document is filed with the letter: 74.12.2, Varina to J. W. Garrett is an example. Otherwise, permission authorizations are in the correspondence files.</p><p>"cat." on a document envelope means only an autograph dealer's catalog description is within. </p><p>Sometimes there is a manuscript copy on microfilm.
"cat. only" means we do not have a manuscript copy.</p><p>"print" and "print only"–same as "cat." and "cat. only"</p><p>"lost letters" on envelope: one of the letters stolen from Davis' library in Mississippi in 1863 [most of them, eventually turned over to William T. Sherman, form the core of the Davis Collection in the Library of Congress] </p><p>"Rowland" on envelope: printed in the 1923 edition of Davis' papers</p><p>"Private Ls" or "Priv Letters" or a variation of same means Hudson Strode's edition. His transcriptions are not accurate, so use with care.
"DP 6:253.54" on envelope: printed in our edition, Davis Papers, volume 6, pages 253 to 254</p><p>"Addenda, Vol. 9" on envelope: arrived after publication of volume in which it belongs chronologically and in time to be included in Addenda section of Volume 9, but not necessarily selected for inclusion in that Addenda section.</p><p>All documents are recorded in spreadsheets, accessible to Woodson staff for reference purposes.</p></scopecontent>

Some, especially those relating to Davis family genealogy or to specific events in Davis' life, are now in the genealogy and vertical files.</p><p>Many newspapers represented in these files are now available in digital format, but most-- particularly those from smaller markets--are not.</p><p>Fondren Library has cataloged the Davis Project's collection of newspapers on microfilm, notably pre-1861 Mississippi papers and Richmond papers of 1861-65, likewise the collection of pre-1861 city directories on fiche.</p></scopecontent>

In a couple of cases, there are vertical files on women under their husbands' names (Inez, for instance). In the vertical files, husbands' names are sometimes first, mainly because that's usually how to find people on censuses. Always wise to check the 3x5 slips (document and reference) for all surnames.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_de3f5b85da28916313e72fda66cbfcc3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>[Individual folders to be listed soon.]</p><p>Many family members in the genealogical charts (Vols. 1 and 4 appendixes and online) do not have biographical sketches in the edition.</p><p>Divided into separate folders for Jefferson's parents and siblings in birth order (Matilda #8 died young). The folders are a hodge-podge of information, compiled over fifty years and derived from printed sources and primary documents; there are also primary documents in the files, such as gravestone photographs. Vertical files and the 3x5 slips (information and
document control slips) also should be consulted about individuals.</p><p>Some family members--Joseph E. Davis, for example--have vertical files in addition to information in the genealogy folders. Joseph E. Davis' probate file is filed with genealogy since it involves so many relatives.</p><p>There are many repeated and similar names in the family: Mary Ellen, Ellen Mary, Lucinda Jane, Jane Lucinda, Hugh Robert, Robert Hugh, for example, as well as several namesakes of Joseph Emory and Jefferson Davis.</p><p>There are allied materials such as folders for the Howell family, on Davis' first and second marriages, Varina Howell Davis, Varina Anne Davis, [great-niece] Lise Mitchell's journal (Tulane), published and unpublished Davis family histories, and other collections of family papers, including contemporary letters.</p></scopecontent>

Jones, Mary Custis Lee are examples), individuals with aliases or who changed their names, nicknames and names by which they were known, which was often the middle name.

<p>This scrapbook was created by James S. Waters' wife Pauline Lackner Waters to document his time in service, both in training and on the battlefield. It includes memorabilia such as Waters' Officer's Record Book, Battle Insignia, Overseas Service Chevrons, documents recording his vaccination, and receipts from purchases made at the Ordnance Store. Many of the pages contain photos showing Waters' training at Camp Bullis in Texas, his time abroad in France and Germany, and--rarely--his time on leave. The majority of the scrapbook is taken up by newspaper clippings containing news of either the 90th division (of which James Waters was a part), or broader news about World War I as it developed during Waters' time serving. Mrs. Waters also included newspaper clippings that explain the battle insignias of many different divisions--the 90th division prominently displayed alongside Waters' own insignia, as well as several of the telegrams that Waters sent her, letters of permission and commendation sent to Waters by authority figures, and the Christmas letter that Waters sent home to his family in 1918.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection includes biographical information about individuals in the Ayers, Brown, McCarty, Martin, Diller, Boettner, Crump, Raynor, Ball, Freytag and Bergeson, families, among others. The bulk of the collection involves people and events ranging from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century. </p><p>The collection of photographs, letters, business records, war memorabilia, vintage fashion wardrobe, costumes, books, oral history interview, and objects of art serve to document the life and times of the Ayers family and allied families. Photo-journals, scrapbooks, real estate and legal documents, maps, as well as wardrobe items created by, for, and about the allied families cover their personal and professional lives. The kinship networks cover a geographic range from the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states to the Midwest, and into the Deep South of the 19th and early 20th century. Venturing from family careers in banking, medicine, and textiles, a branch of the family migrated South and pursued commerce and professions including Southern agriculture, church ministries, and academia. This branch of the Ayers, Brown, and Martin families moved from Illinois to Mississippi just before the U.S. officially entered World War I. The collection includes material from the kinship network of the allied families as family members moved within the New Jersey/New York region, the Midwest, the American Great Plains and the Deep South from the 19th century into the 1960s.
Well-preserved original materials, as well as copies, serve as evidence of a narrative and material history of the allied families' land, houses, commercial businesses, professions, personal possessions, travels, and holdings, as well as information about various sources of income and assets. Business and personal records document the transfers and the chain of possession of both assets and material collections as they were inherited and inventoried in successive generations. References and materials related to the artistic, literary, and philanthropic work of family members are cross-referenced to other collections.</p><p>An 1889 wedding quilt in a crazy-quilt pattern of silk ribbons, velvet, and other textile materials is well preserved, along with the names and faces of each young woman (friends of the bride) who contributed the material and labor. </p><p>Several Ayers family members served in The Great War/World War I, and the collection contains photographic, telegraphic, textile, and other documentation of the military service, including documentation of experiences in training, domestic and foreign assignments, medals, uniforms, repatriation and return to civilian life. </p><p>Due to a family interest in photography and photographic equipment, the Ayers collection contains a chronological sampling of various types of photography (tin type, negative and positive, sepia toned, black and white, color, slides, and various types and sizes of prints, many numbered, indexed and/or with the identifying tags or labels from exhibits. The photography is the work product of several family members.
Aspects of commercial agriculture are detailed in the records of the Ayers family short-lived venture into Southern plantation ownership. The documentation of their management, losses, real estate holdings, labor and leasing practices, capital investments, environmental and natural disaster conditions, transportation and commerce is provided in some detail.</p><p>Records from careers in academia, civil engineering, medicine, the Presbyterian ministry, banking, transportation, art history and philanthropy are interspersed throughout the collection. College and university material including yearbooks, notebooks, academic papers, and photography from several institutions in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi - primarily in the first half of the 20th century - are included. Flooding along the Mississippi River basin is documented and commented upon.
Diaries, sermons, tape recordings, an oral history interview, calendars, legal documents, receipts, and letters connect various people to their inventories of ration books, vintage cigar boxes, recipes, magazines, wedding and funeral items, political affiliations, sermons, and academic report cards through the decades. Travels (in war, for business, for medical rehabilitation, leisure, and scouting) ranging from the World War I era through the 1950s are well documented by private photography and letters, as well as commercial postcards, marked maps, brochures, and receipts. Skeleton keys, inventories of furnishings, scripts and playbills, costumes, a bust, art exhibit brochures, souvenirs and published literature mark the artistic output of the family members, as well as consumer taste. The oral history interview extends through the Vietnam War era and the disaster of Hurricane Katrina, as experienced in Mississippi by the interviewee.</p> </scopecontent>

This collection would be useful for any researcher interested in the confluence of Judaism and Feminism, or the development of Jewish organizations in Texas.

<p>This collection contains newsprint, photographs, documents such as membership lists and
pamphlets, and groups of memorabilia such as t-shirts and matchboxes as well as unique items
— a matzah cover, a dedicated gavel, and a ceramic planter in the shape of a shoe, as well
as an oral history conducted with Libby Marvins by staff with the Houston Jewish History
Archive in 2018. The materials are in good condition and range in date from 1940 to 2018.
The collection would be a useful resource for researchers interested in local institutions
and events, especially congregation Emanu El and its affiliated youth organizations, such as
B'nai B'rith Women and Boy Scouts. With its brightly-colored T-shirts and unique memorabilia
items, the collection would be ideal for exhibition. Though named for Libby and Edward
Marvins, the materials (with the exception of the matzah cover, a family heirloom, and the
dedicated gavel) are more relevant to a study of the Jewish community in Houston than a
specific study of the Marvins family.</p>

The materials are in good condition, and range in date from 1944 to 1963, with one undated picture of Bob Hope, personally signed. This collection is both a stunning example of Jewish culture and tradition surrounding the bar mitzvah, the coming-of-age ritual in the Jewish faith, and a personal historic record of the Nathan family timeline. Many of the pictures are identified as relatives or other community figures. It also contains a Sakowitz credit card belonging to Marilyn Nathan, but issued to Mr. and Mrs. Martin Nathan before women could get credit in their own names. Researchers may find that the collection is limited in its mostly photographic content, though the scrapbook also contains a certificate of service and single news clipping with the date of the bar mitzvah on it.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>Two boxes of Houston Hadassah membership directories and three scrapbooks containing newsletters, photographs, newsclippings, postcards, event invitations, and campaign buttons document membership in the organization from 1955 to 1965 and 1993 to 2002, as well as some of the activities members of the Houston Chapter of Hadassah participated in from 1970 to 1976, sans 1974, and 1981-1982. </p><p>Of particular interest are the contents of the membership directories which inlcude, not only membership information but the history of Hadassah, current projects undertaken in Israel, board members information, a message from the president of Hadassah, and a number of advertisements. Both scrapbooks are informative; however, scrapbook #2 is of particular interest due to the amount of material it contains. It is over 120 pages which include newsletters, news clippings, invitations, postcards, memorabilia, and photographs -- including a photo of Hadassah board members with Mayor Hofheinz when he signed the proclaimation for "Hadassah Day" and a group photo of past presidents. </p><p>The pages have been removed from both scrapbooks and each page has been placed in mylar sleeves to preserve the attached materials. The scrapbooks' original order was maintained. Both scrapbooks have been digitized.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Leon Nad Family Archive contains one program from San Jacinto High School's Night Class exercises, and photographs of Nad family members, including Leon and his father Irving. The materials are in good condition and range in date from the early 1900s to 1964. Researchers interested in the Nad family's contributions to the Houston Jewish community or the impact Leon had on national tax policy would find the collection interesting, though small and formed mainly of photographs.</p> </scopecontent>
