<p>No biographical information about the diary's author is available. The diary was found in Saarburg by the donor, who arrived to the German town during World War II with occupation troops. According to donor's letter, the town was deserted at the time of the diary's discovery. </p><p><emph render="bold">Saarburg</emph> is a small town of the Trier-Saarburg district in the Rhineland-Palatinate state of Germany, on the banks of the Saar River in the hilly country a few kilometers upstream from the Saar's junction with the Moselle. This area is part of a fascinating landscape replete with significant historical places in Germany. The area borders (from the north and clockwise) North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Baden-Württemberg, France, Saarland, Luxembourg and Belgium.</p><p>The history of the city begins with the construction of the now-ruined castle by Graf Siegfried of Luxembourg in 964. It received its town charter in 1291. The city has a bell foundry, the Glockengießerei Mabilion, which has been in operation since the 1770s, and as of 2003 the only one in Germany that makes bronze bells. The area around Saarburg is noted for the cultivation of Riesling grapes.</p><p>Information about the Saarburg and its region compiled from several entries found in www.wikipedia.com.</p>  </bioghist>
