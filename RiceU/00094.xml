    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Adams Dix was born July 24, 1798, in New Hampshire. He received a classical education and then served in the army, rising to the rank of major. He went on to study law, became an attorney, and in 1826 married Catharine Morgan. They eventually had seven children. Dix resigned from the army and moved to New York State, where he managed family properties and entered politics, serving in a number of positions. In 1845, he was elected to fill a term in the United States Senate, where he participated in international affairs. Dix later served briefly as postmaster and then as secretary of the treasury and in 1861 was commissioned major-general by President Lincoln, serving during the Civil War in administrative positions, including as head of the Department of Maryland. After the war he became minister to France from 1866-69 and then withdrew from political life for a time, serving as president of two railroads and practicing law in New York City. In 1872, Dix was elected governor of New York and served one term. He retired, but served in various civic activities. Dix was also the author of several books. He died April 21, 1879 in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>
