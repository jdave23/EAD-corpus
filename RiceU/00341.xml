    <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>J.H. Bastide, is probably John Henry Bastide, a British army officer and military engineer. In 1711, while still a boy, he was commissioned an ensign. He remained a lieutenant for well over 20 years, perhaps in part because of his decision to serve as a military engineer. At the time of this letter (May 1743), he was in Boston, aiding Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts in the construction of local fortifications. During the Seven Years War, he assisted in the defense of the fortress Louisbourg located at the site of a French settlement in Nova Scotia on Ile Royale now known as Cape Breton Island. He went on to become a lieutenant-general in April 1770. His name does not appear on the 1771 War Office list of officers, so he may have died in 1770.
