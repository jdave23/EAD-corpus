    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Born in 1933, Peter Gardner grew up in Cleveland. He attended Haverford College in Pennsyylvania receiving a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a Master's degree in Music.</p><p>From the late 1950s to the early 1960s, he toured the United States and Europe with his then wife, Isabelle Ganz, under the stage name The Gardners. They recorded two albums, entitled "Peter and Isabel; The Gardners" (1962) and "Folksongs Far and Near" (1963).</p><p>The couple eventually settled in Houston in 1962, when Peter Gardner became the Director of Adult Activities at the Jewish Community Center. In this role, he organized a seasonal folk music series. Starting in 1965 and ending in 1966, he hosted the KRBE show "The Sampler" from his home at 716 W. Alabama in Houston. </p><p>During this time period, he opened up his home to pickin' parties where folk singers Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt met. The Jewish Community Center folk series influenced a generation of Houston folk musicians with performances by John A. Lomax, Jr., Lightnin' Hopkins, and Mance Lipscomb.</p><p>In 1969, Peter Gardner moved to the Boston area. He became a practicing psychotherapist, as well as a consultant. He lived in the area until he passed in 1993.</p>  </bioghist>
