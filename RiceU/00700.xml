    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Records of the activities of Rice University students have been captured in scrapbooks by alumni since the opening of the Institute in 1912. The scrapbooks in the collection contain ephemera reflecting the stimulating life on campus, including photographs, correspondence, invitations, newsclippings, tickets, etc, related to academic, social, sports, and arts events and organizations. The materials in these scrapbooks help document the change in the community as Rice grew from the Institute out on the prairie to a world class university surrounded by a major metropolitan area. The collection also includes scrapbooks of the Treasurer's Office beginning in 1907 as the Institute was being planned and scrapbooks from various other Rice departments and Rice-related events.</p>  </bioghist>
