<p>The Thomas E. Bartmess Air Medal was presented posthumously to his widow, Eleanor Bartmess (who became Eleanor Riordan in May 1948).  The medal was one of four presented to wartime aviators' family members at a November 3, 1943, ceremony at Ellington Field.  The four men were at the time listed as casualties of World War II aerial combat.  Lt. Bartmess had been killed; the other three were prisoners of war.</p><p>Thomas Bartmess was a Houston native and a graduate of San Jacinto High School and Rice Institute.  He was a member of the class of 1940 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  He was navigator on the Liberator "Little Beaver" from October 1942 until the time of his death.  He was first reported missing after the Allied raid on Kiel and other Belgian cities but was later reported as having been killed in action.</p><p>		-source: "Women Given Awards for Men Listed as Casualties" by Flora Gordon Shoss, The Houston Post, Nov. 7, 1943.</p>  </bioghist>
