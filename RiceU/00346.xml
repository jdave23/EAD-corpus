    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Robert Crain authored this letter to the public in order to describe what happened during a gunfight on September 19, 1827. Crain's statement was written in response to a newspaper article that he claimed contained false information, and this statement was his way of telling his side of the story. </p><p>According to Crain, he was asked to attend a duel between his friend Dr. Maddox and his opponent, S.L. Wells, at a location near Natchez, Mississippi. After the duel ended (with no deaths or wounds), a gunfight broke out among the supporters of each dueler, who had been watching the fight. James "Jim" Bowie attended the duel in support of his friend S.L. Wells, and ended up fighting in the brawl that ensued with his soon-to-be famous Bowie knife. The brawl ended with the deaths of General Cuny and Major Norris Wright, and several other men, including Robert Crain, were wounded.</p>  </bioghist>
