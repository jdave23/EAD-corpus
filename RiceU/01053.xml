<p>
The Texas Jewish Feminist Conference was a an event held under the purview of the Houston branch of the American Jewish Committee, a Jewish advocacy group highly regarded by the global Jewish Community. Held annually, the Conference seeks to build a sense of community among Jewish feminists, expand awareness of issues at a local, national, and global level, and to offer a forum to explore current writing and research on Judaism, women, and feminism.
</p>
<p>
The Keynote speaker at the 1992 Conference and source of the collection materials, Sandra Block has served a host of community organizations and institutions, including time as a member of Emanu El's board of trustees and former chair of its Social Action Committee, vice president of the American Jewish Committee, volunteer for AARP, chair of Yom Limmud for the Bureau of Jewish Education, board member of Jewish Family Service and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Greater Houston, vice president of Interfaith Ministries, board mem­ber of the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston, co-founder of the Sex Offense Staff, as well as a consultant, trainer and facilitator for United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. Block has been honored for her outstanding volunteer service and leadership by United Way, and has received the Nachtigall-Talley Award for Outstanding Leadership and Vol­unteer Services by Inter­faith Ministries, Harry Caplovitz Award for Community Leadership, and the President's Award from the American Jewish Committee.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains materials related to the Texas Jewish Feminist Conference, including pamphlets, a timeline, and correspondence providing an overview, as well as newsprint and speaking notes, including Sandra Block's opening speech. The materials range in date from 1984 to 1992, and are in good condition. This collection would be useful for any researcher interested in the confluence of Judaism and Feminism, or the development of Jewish organizations in Texas. Though it represents a small subset of the American Jewish Committee, it is not representative of the larger whole—a vast history, which has spanned a century of Jewish development on national and global fronts, involving issues as varied as the times.</p>  </scopecontent>
