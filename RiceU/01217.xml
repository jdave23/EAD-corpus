    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Jefferson Davis Hong, also known as J. D. Hong,
was born in Greenville, Mississippi on June 3, 1939, to parents Kun and Mamie Hong. Hong has 2 older sisters and 3 younger brothers. He attended Chinese School for 3 years until his school was integrated with white students, due to the segregation between colored and white students. Hong attended Susie P. Trigg Elementary, Bass Junior High, and graduated from Greenville High School on June 01, 1957. 
As a youth, Hong loved fishing, woodworking and being in the Boy Scouts, and only lacked the swimming and life saving merit badges for getting the Eagle Scout Medal. Hong went on to be the first to earn the Silver Award in the Air Explorer Scouts, which is equivalent to the Eagle Scout. He earned 9 out of 10 ratings in the Air Explorer Manual and received recognition as Outstanding Scout 2 years in a row at the Summer encampments  at Greenville AFB, MS. Being an Instructor for the Ground  Observer  Corps and Senior Patrol Leader  for Squadron 1, Hong taught first aid classes for the Emergency  Service Group. </p><p>On 20 Aug 1957, Hong enlisted in the United States Air Force and was honorably discharged on 18 Aug 1961 at the rank of Senior Airman. During his time in the Air Force, he qualified for air freight specialist and loadmaster. Duty stations included McChord AFB, WA; Travis AFB, CA; Clark Field, Philippines, and missions to Saigon in 1959. While at Clark Field, Hong earned 15 hours of college credits at the University of Philippines. His education experiences included Advanced Air Transportation School Tinker AFB, OK, then to Sheppard AFB, TX, to set up complete air freight operations.
After Hong's time in the Air Force, he attended Mississippi State University, earning a degree in Transportation and Business. In June of 1965, he moved to Houston and started working in reservations sales for Delta Air Lines.  He Worked for Delta from July, 1965 until January 1992 as Reservations Sales Supervisor.  He then worked for Costco for 10 years.
From 1997-98, Hong served as President of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, Houston Chapter, and American Legion Commander of Post 596 from June 2005 to June 2009. During my time as Post 596 Commander, the group attended the WWII monument opening ceremony with a group of American Legion members and their families. Hong is also a life member of VFW Post 8790 and on the Veterans Cemetery Council of Greater Houston taking care of the Gold and Blue Star mothers.
Hong created a veterans' seminar to educate veterans about benefits they can receive from the VA hospital and burial arrangements in the VA cemetery.  
Hong is married and has 2 sons and one daughter-law.  Their family attends the Chinese Baptist Church.</p>  </bioghist>
