    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Peter W. Gray was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1819 and moved to Texas in 1838. Gray worked in his father's law office in Houston, Texas before he became a captain in the Army of the Republic of Texas. In 1841, Gray was appointed District Attorney of the Houston district by Sam Houston. He ran for city secretary in 1840 but was elected alderman in 1841 and became a member of the board of health. In 1846, Gray was elected to the first Texas States Legislature where he authored the Practice Act which is the first piece of legislation regulating the court system of the State of Texas. In 1848, Gray founded the Houston Lyceum which eventually became the Houston Public Library. Henderson Yoakum's "History of Texas" was published with the financial support of Gray. After being elected to the State Legislature in 1854, Gray served as judge of the Houston district. Gray was a states rights Democrat and fully supported succession. He also served as a delegate to the states Succession Convention. During the Confederacy, Gray served as a representative of the Houston District in the Congress of the Confederacy. After serving in many important positions in the Confederacy, peace brought Gray back to Houston where he practiced law privately and built his firm into one of the largest in the nation. In 1874, Gray was appointed associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court and served there until he became fatally ill with tuberculosis. Gray died later that year.</p>  </bioghist>

He patently denounces those who deny judges the right of citizenship based on their public service. Gray states that he along with all other judges are able to separate their political tendencies from their impartial stances in court. Gray then gives a lengthy article by article description and history of states rights and the constitution. Gray also briefly discusses the Articles of Confederation and the various reasons for that governments collapse. The purpose of Gray's discussion is to reaffirm the state's pro-slavery stance in the upcoming election, while vehemently denying that the issue is a political question, offering rather that it is a fundamentally moral issue free from political bias. The rhetoric employed by Gray is a common argument made throughout the southern states, arguing that the dissension between Southern Democrats and Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Free Soilers is based not on slavery but the issue of the states' right to choose. Gray is awkwardly poised as a Pro-Slavery Democrat opposed to the continuation of the slave trade. He explains his position by arguing that by allowing the slave treaded to continue slave owners would appear to Northerners as insecure about the justice of slavery. By continuing the slave trade, says Gray, slave owners would be destroying the credibility of the institution on a national level furthering the national opinion against the continuance of slavery. Gray's pro-slavery anti-slave trade stance was a common platform for many Southern Democrats of the time. Often these Democrats would try to steer political rhetoric away from the hotly contested issue of slavery and towards states rights and popular sovereignty.</p></odd></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref58_1sm" level="file"><did><unittitle>"There is no Liberty without Law" Lecture given by Peter Gray before the Houston Lyceum February 28th, 1853</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="29902" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">29902</unitid><container id="aspace_34c4ed354097606d3c3c39d31e08fe4f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_25c4a0ad2f2242160719c034756996d7" parent="aspace_34c4ed354097606d3c3c39d31e08fe4f" type="Folder">14</container></did><odd id="aspace_0e8c4ed0a1b45fa57c70f81737d885e0"><head>General note</head><p>Peter Gray gives an intelligent discussion of the strengths of the United States' government. He begins by informing the reader of the many subtle differences between liberty and freedom and the way each word was used in antiquity; namely in the republics of Greece and Rome. Then Gray begins to dissect our government by branch beginning with the Executive branch and discussing similar organs in other governments. Throughout his discussion of both the Executive branch and the Legislative branch, Gray marginalizes their combined importance in protecting the right of the average citizen from tyranny. Gray suggests that the revolutionary aspect of the United States' government is the individuals right to hold the government accountable for damages and infringements on the charter of the government: the Constitution. Gray then proceeds with a lengthy discussion of the Judiciary and its supreme importance to our government and individual liberty and freedom in the United States. Gray cites interesting examples from Britain and France such as Richelieu, Napoleon the Great, Napoleon III, The Directory, The Reign of Terror, Oliver Cromwell, and several British common law cases that embody the difference between the British limited monarchy and the American democracy. The essay is 49 pages long in script from the period. The actual document is in pristine condition and represents the writings of the educated southern gentry in the antebellum period in United States history.</p></odd></c02><c02 id="aspace_ref61_wnb" level="file"><did><unittitle>"There is no Liberty without Law" Lecture given by Peter Gray before the Houston Lyceum February 28th, 1853 -- abbreviated version</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="29901" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">29901</unitid><container id="aspace_af3d8e68a0f52bf1ee1433a8e5aa7c90" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_6e4b4c8d3c4fc88bf21d2f0a8fbead57" parent="aspace_af3d8e68a0f52bf1ee1433a8e5aa7c90" type="Folder">15</container></did><odd id="aspace_a30a29997f306a12a39275cd224a9ea4"><head>General note</head><p>This document is an abbreviated version of the "There is no Liberty without Law" lecture.
