<p>Herbert Clark Hoover (1874-1964) was the 31st President of the United States from 1929-1933. Prior to his Presidency, the served as the United States Secretary of Commerce in the 19290s under Presidents Harding and Coolidge. In this capacity, he promoted government intervention under his program of "economic moderinization." Hoover easily captured the Republican nomination despite to previous experience in campaigning for elected office. To date, Hoover is the last cabinet secretary to be directly elected President. Hoover served as President during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and lost his bid for reelection in 1932. Hoover was also a professional mining engineer and author.
   J. Hugh Jackson (1891-1992) received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Simpson College in 1912, an MBA with Distinction from Harvard University in 1920, and two honorary degrees from Simpson College, Doctor of Laws (1930) and Doctor of Business Administration (1955). He became licensed as a CPA in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and California. His first college teaching jobs were at the University of Oregan the University of Minnesota. After completing his Master's degree in Business, he was named assistant professor of accounting at Harvard's Graduate School of Business in 1923 and was eventually made a full-time professor there. During his time at Harvard, and until 1930 at Stanford, he was associated with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse and Co. In 1926, Jackson moved to Stanford and became a professor of accounting; in 1931, he became the second dean of Stanford's new Graduate School of Business. He held this post for twenty-five years until his retirement in 1956.</p>  </bioghist>
