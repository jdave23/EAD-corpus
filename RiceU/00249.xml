      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Carl Woodring</emph> (1919-) was born in Texas, received his B.A. from
        Rice University in Houston and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard. Dr. Woodring, Woodberry
        Professor Emeritus of Literature, Columbia University, has been accorded many distinctions
        including the Phi Beta Kappa award (1972) for his book on William Wordsworth, <emph
          render="italic">Politics in English Romantic Poetry</emph>, a Ford Foundation grant for
        1955-56 and a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1958-59. Considered a renowned authority on the
        Romantic Period in English Literature, Woodring is the author of numerous articles and books
        including <emph render="italic">Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge </emph>(1961), <emph
          render="italic">Wordsworth </emph> (1965),<emph render="italic">Nature into Art: Cultural
          Transformations in Nineteenth-Century Britain </emph>(1989), (ed.) <emph render="italic"
          >Table Talk of Samuel Taylor Coleridge for the Collected Coleridge</emph>, 2 vols. (1990),
        and (ed.) <emph render="italic">The Columbia History of British Poetry</emph> (1994).</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Charles de Sousy Ricketts</emph> was born in Geneva, Switzerland on
        October 2, 1866. He was known as a book designer, theatre designer, sculptor and painter.
        His mother was musical; his father a painter of marine subjects. Ricketts spent his early
        years in Lausanne and London and his youth at Boulogne and Amiens in France. After his
        mother's death, he returned to London with his father and in 1882 entered the City and
        Guilds Art School in Kennington, London, where he was apprenticed to Charles Roberts, a
        prominent wood-engraver. His father died a year later and on his sixteenth birthday he met
        his lifelong partner, Charles Haselwood Shannon.</p>
      <p>Ricketts and Shannon founded an occasional art journal, <emph render="italic">The
          Dial</emph> (1889-1897) and the two artists also began designing and illustrating books,
        including <emph render="italic">Daphnis and Chloe </emph>(1893) and <emph render="italic"
          >Hero and Leander</emph> (1894). Ricketts also worked for commercial publishers; his more
        famous books include John Gray's <emph render="italic">Silverpoints </emph>(1893) and Oscar
        Wilde's <emph render="italic">The Sphinx</emph> (1895).</p>
      <p>In 1894 Ricketts met Llewellyn Hacon, a wealthy barrister, enabling him to realize his
        dream of being a publisher and he set up the Vale Press (1896-1904). Ricketts designed three
        fonts and numerous decorations and illustrations. After the closing of the Vale Press in
        1904, he designed books for friends such as Katherine Bradley (1946-1914) and Edith Cooper
        (1862-1913) (pseudonym Michael Field) and Gordon Bottomley (1874-1948).</p>
      <p>In 1900, Ricketts took up painting and sculpture. He was elected Associate of the Royal
        Academy in 1922 and Royal Academician in 1928. Ricketts also produced theatrical designs and
        was involved in about forty productions, including George Bernard Shaw's <emph
          render="italic">St. Joan</emph>. He wrote several books on art and other subjects and
        acted as art consultant to various individuals and institutions</p>
      <p>He and Shannon also built up their own collection of paintings, drawings, and antiquities;
        many are now at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and at the British Museum. Charles
        Shannon, falling from a ladder, became disabled; this devastated Ricketts who died of a
        heart attack in 1931 – six years before his friend.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Charles Haselwood Shannon</emph> was born in Lincolnshire on April 26,
        1863. He attended St. John's School, Leatherhead (1873-1881) and then studied at the City
        and Guilds Technical Art School, an extension of the Lambeth Art School (1881-1885). It was
        there he met Charles Ricketts and it was the start of a lifelong friendship. By 1888, they
        had devised a strategy for their joint career; Ricketts was to provide the income and
        Shannon perfected his abilities as a painter. In 1897, Shannon sent two paintings and some
        lithographs to Munich where he was awarded a gold medal. Shannon's self-portrait, <emph
          render="italic">The Man in the Black Shirt</emph> was completed that year.</p>
      <p>Ricketts was the dominant figure in the artistic and literary circle that formed around
        them in Chelsea (1888-1898) and then in Richmond (1898-1902). Joint activities included
        their magazine, <emph render="italic">The Dial </emph>(1889-1897), design and illustration
        of Oscar Wilde's books and wood-engravings for editions of <emph render="italic">Daphnis and
          Chloe </emph>(1893) and <emph render="italic">Hero and Leander </emph>(1894). They set up
        the Vale Press in 1896 complemented with a shop where work by Shannon and their friends
        could be bought.</p>
      <p>Shannon had his own lithographic press and he produced a number of works including <emph
          render="italic">A Lithograph in White Line </emph>(1891), <emph render="italic">
          Summer</emph> (1892), and <emph render="italic">The Shepherd in a Mist</emph>. In
        painting, his traditional technique, deriving from the Venetians and the English eighteenth
        century, were the bases of his art. His works include an early success, <emph
          render="italic">The Lady with a Cyclamen </emph>(1899), a favorite sitter, Kathleen Bruce
        (1878-1947), is seen as <emph render="italic">The Sculptress </emph>(1904) and in <emph
          render="italic">The Winged Hat.</emph></p>
      <p>In 1902 Ricketts and Shannon returned to London to live in a flat in a block in Lansdowne
        Road, Holland Park. Shannon became an active exhibitor, for example at the New English Art
        Club and the International Society. He was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1911
        and Royal Academician in 1920.</p>
      <p>In January 1929 Shannon suffered a fall while hanging a picture in Townshend House, Regents
        Park, where they had moved in 1923. He suffered brain damage and never fully recovered.
        Ricketts sold some works to pay for nursing expenses and more went after Rickett's death in
        1931. Charles Shannon died on March 18, 1937.</p>
