<p>Hermann J. Muller (1890-1967) was educated at Columbia University and came to the Rice Institute in 1915 to teach biology. His tenure at Rice was brief and he later went on to teach at Columbia, the University of Texas in Dallas and Indiana University. In 1946, Muller won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his work with mutations and X-rays.</p><p>Joseph I. Davies (1896-1966) was an Englishman who became Julian Huxley's assistant and followed him to the Rice Institute in 1914. At Rice, Davies earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in biology. Opposite of Huxley, Davies remained at Rice for his entire professional career. He served many years as Chairman of the Biology Department. In 1966, Davies died in the laboratory ten days from retirement.</p><p>Julian Huxley (1887-1975) was a prolific writer on numerous topics such as cancer research, religious philosophy, zoology and poetry and was best known as a popularizer of science. He was born in London, England and educated at Eton and Oxford University. Huxley taught biology at the Rice Institute from 1914 to 1916 when he went back to England to participate in the war effort. Huxley later taught at King's College at Oxford and from 1946 to 1948 he was the first Director-General of UNESCO (the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization). In 1958, Huxley was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>George Carlos Wheeler (1897-1991) went to Texas Christian University in 1914 with the intention of becoming a high school language teacher. His long-time interest in biology, however, dominated his spare time and upon transferring to the Rice Institute in 1915, Wheeler began to enroll in biology classes. His first teacher and academic advisor was Julian Huxley, who strongly influenced Wheeler to become a professional biologist. When Wheeler completed his undergraduate work at the Rice Institute in 1918, he enlisted in the army and was sent to the Yale Army Laboratory School. After Armistice, he carried out his military service at Base Hospital in Camp Dodge, Iowa. In 1919, he started his graduate work in entomology at Harvard's Bussey Institute. After he received his Ph.D., Wheeler went on to teach at Syracuse University, the University of North Dakota and the Desert Research Institute (University of Nevada).</p> </bioghist>

<p><emph render="bold">James Lockhart Autry, II</emph> was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on November 4, 1859. Educated in Mississippi schools for most of his life, Autry attended the University of the South on a scholarship before moving to Texas in 1876. He moved to Navarro County to undertake management of a ranch given to his grandfather's heirs for his part in the Texas Revolution.</p><p>Once established in Texas, Autry began the study of law in the offices of Judge Sam Frost in Corsicana, and was admitted to the bar in 1880 at the age of twenty-one. While still studying law in 1879, Autry served as enrolling clerk for the House of Representatives of the Texas Legislature and he served again in the sessions of 1880 and 1881. Autry began the practice of law in partnership with Richard Channing Beale; he retired from this partnership, however, to serve two terms as County Judge of Navarro County. He then formed a partnership with W. J. McKie which lasted until Autry left Corsicana to become General Attorney for the Texas Company in Beaumont.</p><p>The partnership of McKie and Autry served as counsel to J.S. Cullinan, an oil operator who moved into Corsicana with the oil boom of the area during the 1890's. After the dissipation of oil in the Corsicana area and the discovery of oil in the Spindletop - Beaumont area, Cullinan moved to the coastal town to form the Texas Fuel Company. For several years McKie and Autry continued to serve Cullinan, taking turns on leaving Coriscana to spend one or two weeks at a time in Beaumont. Finally in 1904 the partnership of McKie and Autry was dissolved with McKie staying in Corsicana and Autry moving to Beaumont as general counsel of the Texas Fuel Company. </p><p>A reorganization and expansion of the Texas Fuel Company in 1905 resulted in the incorporation of the Texas Company in which Autry was elected a director and became general attorney. The corporate headquarters were moved to Houston in 1908 when Spindletop began to decline and other fields down the Gulf Coast like Humble and Goose Creek began to produce. Autry again moved with the company. He remained with the Texas Company until November of 1913 when a dispute over management of the company became a major issue in a stockholders' meeting and a proxy struggle ensued. Cullinan with the open support of Autry and Will C. Hogg lost the battle and resigned as president and director. Autry and Hogg both resigned at this time.</p><p>Autry, Cullinan and Hogg then combined their capital and talents to form the Fidelity Trust Company, Farmers Petroleum Company, American Petroleum Company and Republic Production Company. Autry served as president of Farmers Petroleum Company, president of Fidelity Trust Company and vice-president and general counsel of the last two under the combined name of American Republics Company. In 1915 Autry suffered a stroke and he spent the last five years of his life a semi-invalid seeking rehabilitation and use of his right side. He died on September 29, 1920. He was survived by his wife, the former Allie Kinsloe, whom he married in 1896, a son James Lockhart Autry III, and a daughter Allie May Autry.</p><p><emph render="bold">Allie Belle Kinsloe Autry</emph> was born in Corsicana, Texas in 1873. She married James Lockhart Autry II in 1896. Throughout her life she was active in philanthropic causes in Corsicana and Houston. In 1921 she donated money for the construction of a community house at Rice Institute. A memorial to her husband, Autry House served as social meeting place for students, faculty, and campus organizations at Rice Institute. She also donated $50,000 towards the establishment of a hospital school for children with tuberculosis, Autry Memorial Hospital School, as a memorial to her son, James Lockhart Autry III. She died in 1935.</p><p><emph render="bold">James Lockhart Autry, III</emph> was born in Corsicana, Texas 1899. The only son of James Lockhart Autry II, he graduated from Rice Institute in 1921.

He died after complications from appendicitis at the age of 23.</p><p><emph render="bold">Allie May Autry Kelley</emph> was the second child of James L. Autry II and Allie Kinsloe Autry. She was born 1903 in Corsicana, Texas. She graduated from Rice Institute in 1925, the first woman in her family to attend college. As a student at Rice she was extremely popular, elected class vice president 1921-22 and 1924-25, queen of May Fete 1925 and was a lifelong supporter of her alma mater. She helped establish Autry Court, the Allie Kelley Dittmar lounge in the student center, and generously supported the Friends of the Fondren Library.

<p>William Harrison Hamman, soldier, farmer, lawyer, and entrepreneur, was born at Woodstock, VA on January 17, 1830, the son of George and Catherine Schmucker Hamman. His father, a carpenter, died when William was ten years old, and William worked various numerous jobs to help support his family. He attended the University of Virginia in 1850 and 1851, studying mathematics, German and chemistry. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Virginia militia on April 13, 1850, and promoted to captain on November 8, 1856. In January 1858 he moved to Owensville in Robertson County, TX, and on September 21 was licensed to practice law there.</p><p>Through the 1850s he had been an ardent Unionist and strongly opposed Virginia's secession. On December 15, 1860, he was a leader in Robertson County calling for the immediate secession of Texas. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Hamman enlisted on July 15, 1861, as a private in the "Robertson Five Shooters", which soon became Company C, Fourth Texas Infantry of the famed Hood's Texas Brigade. Hamman was first elected to corporal and then, on October 16, 1861, to regimental color sergeant. He was appointed acting regimental commissary sergeant in July 1862 and served as regimental commissary officer from August 6, 1862, until the Confederate government in August 1863 abolished the position. That month he applied for a mission to return to Texas, and was dispatched as a messenger to the Trans-Mississippi Department. He remained in Texas and was appointed on December 25, 1863, aide-de-camp to the commander of the First Brigade, Second Division, Texas State Troops. On March 12, 1864, he was promoted to captain of the Texas State Troops and appointed adjutant general of the Fifth Brigade District. He rose to the rank of brigadier general on December 26, 1864.</p><p>Although his means were reduced by the war, in 1866 Hamman became the first oil prospector in Texas; he drilled his first oil well at Saratoga in Hardin County. Ironically, he owned options and leases at the Sour Lake and Spindletop oilfields, but did not drill on them. In August 1870 Hamman helped to incorporate three business enterprises - the Calvert Bridge Company, to build <emph render="doublequote">a safe and substantial bridge</emph> over the Brazos River at Calvert; the Pacific and Great Eastern Railway Company of Texas, to build a rail link between the Red River and the Rio Grande; and the Texas Timber and Prairie Railroad Company, to build a railroad between Beaumont and Bremond. In May of that year he also helped charter the Calvert and Belton Railroad. In 1871 Hamman moved to Calvert when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad reached town. There he established a successful legal practice. On July 26, 1871, he married Ella Virginia Laudermilk. The couple had five children.</p><p>In 1878 Hamman, theretofore a Democrat, became interested in monetary reform and ran as the Greenback party's candidate for governor, finishing second; he ran again in 1880 and finished third. In 1889 he became interested in the development of the coal and iron deposits at New Birmingham in Rusk County and helped organize the Cherokee Coal and Iron Company. Hamman died at New Birmingham on July 14, 1890, and was buried in the Owensville Cemetery, Calvert, Texas.</p><p>Excerpted from <emph render="italic">The New Handbook of Texas, </emph>1996</p> </bioghist>

<p>Frank Curtis Michel was born June 5, 1934, in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He attended high school in Sacramento, California, and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree from California Institute of Technology in 1955, graduating with honors. After working briefly as an engineer, he served in the United States Air Force as a pilot from 1955 to 1958.</p><p>Michel then returned to California Institute of Technology, where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He continued as a Research Fellow in Physics at the Institute until April, 1963 when he accepted a position as assistant professor in the newly established Space Science Department at the Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Michel's entry into the field of space physics proved timely, for a national effort was underway to accelerate scientific research programs needed in the nation's space endeavors. Two years earlier, President John F. Kennedy had enunciated a national goal to place a man on the moon before the end of the decade. Academic programs useful to the projected Apollo spaceflights were thus undergoing intense evaluation by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) together with the National Academy of Sciences and with other interested federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense.</p><p>A Space Science Summer Study, conducted in 1962 and involving more than one hundred scientists from universities, private research organizations, industry, and the government recognized the potential for scientific investigation which could be carried out on manned missions of NASA's Apollo spacecraft. They proposed establishment of a program for training scientists as astronauts to participate in the Apollo flights and in later space programs.</p><p>The following year, specific recommendations for such a program were presented to Congress by the Space Science Board, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences which served as the main liaison between NASA and the American scientific community. The Board's Ad Hoc Committee on Scientific Qualifications of Scientist-Astronauts began work in May, 1964, to establish scientific criteria for applicants.</p><p>Michel's qualifications as a scientist who was also an experienced pilot made him a likely candidate for such a program, and he was attracted by the possibility of combining his expertise and special interest in solar winds with his desire to take part in space flight. His interest was shared by Dr. Alexander J. Dessler, director of Rice's Department of Space Science, who was an early supporter of the proposed Scientist-Astronaut program. Furthermore, Rice's Space Science Department had a close relationship with NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center near Houston (MSC, later Johnson Space Center). Departmental research projects, funded in part from NASA grants, were of direct benefit to NASA's programs, and MSC personnel were among those coming to Rice for graduate training.</p><p>Michael was thus in a fortunate position to take advantage of these new developments. When NASA officially established the Scientist-Astronaut program and began recruiting in October, 1964 Michel applied and was one of six accepted into the first group in June, 1965.</p><p>As a Scientist-Astronaut Michel spent six months in orientation training at MSC (he was already a qualified pilot and thus exempt from basic flight training). His work assignment was primarily to plan for the Apollo Applications Program (AAP, later known as the Skylab program). In September, 1966, Michel was appointed to monitor progress on the Apollo Telescope Mount project (ATM), which involved working with specialists at the Marshall Space Flight Center. At various periods he also served on working groups concerned with Lunar Atmospheres, Manned Space Science Atmospherics, and Planetary Atmospheres. In addition to these duties, Michel participated in ongoing astronaut training and in maintaining his flight proficiency as a potential flight crew member.</p><p>In 1967, NASA established a review procedure to ensure that the scientist-astronauts had time for study and research in order to maintain proficiency in their particular areas. Although officially one day a week and one week a month were to be set aside for this purpose, it proved difficult in some cases to achieve this. Over a period of time Michel was among those concerned about being able to meet requirements as an astronaut along with those of a scientist.</p><p>When it became apparent in 1967 that budget problems (caused in part by the war in Vietnam) would decrease the number of Apollo flights and thus the possibility for assignment to one of the flight crews, Michel requested and was granted a year's leave of absence to return to Rice in the fall of 1968 to teach and to pursue research. Michel resigned from NASA in August, 1969, when opportunities for space flight continued to appear unlikely and the time commitment for academic interests made remaining in the space program difficult.</p> </bioghist>

<p>If I am to be remembered, I hope it will not be primarily for my specialized scientific work, but as a generalist; one to whom, enlarging Terence's words, nothing human and nothing in external nature was alien. Julian S. Huxley, Memories</p><p>Julian Sorell Huxley, the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley and great-nephew of Matthew Arnold, was born June 22, 1887. The union of the Huxley and Arnold families brought about a happy combination of what Julian's younger brother Aldous would call blue genes, but the combined family traditions also imposed an obligation of intellectual excellence and social responsibility. This obligation was keenly felt by Julian Huxley from an early age. It was enhanced by his affinity for the interests which had earned his grandfather his place in the history of science, and thus, it soon became apparent that young Julian would be Thomas Huxley's intellectual heir as well as his grandson. This inheritance would prove both a joy and a burden, for while Julian Huxley achieved great renown as a scientist and popularizer of science, he was plagued, like his grandfather, by serious and debilitating attacks of depression. In spite of this he was able, throughout a long career, to contribute significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and to act effectively as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism.</p><p>He was educated at Eton and Oxford, where he followed his own inclinations and his grandfather's example by studying Natural Science. His scientific interests were combined with literary talents which were officially recognized in 1908, when he was awarded the Newdigate Prize for English Verse at Oxford, an honor which he remembered with pride even after a lifetime of honors and accomplishments. (It is note-worthy and characteristic that he spent his prize money on a microscope.)</p><p>After completing his schooling, he began his career at the institution which had taught him: in 1910, he became a lecturer in Zoology at Oxford. Two years later, however, he departed from the course traditional to a young man of his academic interests and social background. He left England and Oxford to accept a position as Research Associate at the newly established Rice Institute in Houston, Texas, and by 1913 he had become Assistant Professor of Biology there. He remained in Houston until 1916 when he returned to Europe to take part in World War I.</p><p>After serving as an army intelligence officer in Italy, he came home to marry and to take up a position as Senior Demonstrator in Zoology at Oxford. From 1919 to 1925 he remained at Oxford, carrying out his famous axolotl experiments and participating in the university's expedition to Spitsbergen. In 1925 he became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London. But he did not remain long in that position. The following year he made a decision which, like his decision to teach at the Rice Institute, would move him away from the path followed by most of his fellow scientists. He accepted the invitation of H.G. Wells to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life, and in 1927 resigned his position at King's College. This meant a new direction for his career, for although he was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution from 1927 to 1929, after that he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues.</p><p>In 1935 he accepted the position of Secretary of the Zoological Society of London. In this capacity he had the means to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. Unfortunately his leadership aroused the displeasure of some members of the Society, and in 1942 he resigned under pressure. He continued, however, his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program.</p><p>The end of the war brought an opportunity for him to put many of his cherished ideals and projects into practice. True to family tradition, he had always viewed science, art and literature as part of a great whole. Thus when he became a member of the commission formed to plan what would become Unesco, he ensured that science would be an integral part of the educational and cultural institution. When in 1946 he became Unesco's first Director-General, he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He even went so far as to advocate his own solution to the troubling questions of modern society, his religion of scientific humanism, as an official basis for Unesco's philosophy. This he himself came later to find unwise. During his tenure as Director-General he also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. Finally, he came to stress even more strongly than before his optimistic belief that mankind can and should take control of its own environmental and biological destiny.</p><p>In 1948 his term of office with Unesco came to an end and Huxley was once again a private citizen. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted: evolutionary theory and its significance for potential human development, ecology and the preservation of wildlife and population control. He was honored often for his contributions to science and to society, receiving prizes and awards for his efforts in helping the general public to better understand contemporary scientific thought. In 1958 he received a knighthood. In 1965, in a culmination of work he began in his youth with his field studies of the behavior of the great crested grebe, he organized a Royal Society Symposium on the Ritualization of Behavior in Animals and Man, and in 1970 he received the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to scientific research related to conservation.</p><p>On February 14, 1975, at the age of 87, Sir Julian Huxley died. His life had been long, beginning in the Victorian era and ending in a world which his grandfather could scarcely have imagined. He served many of the causes with which the 20th century will no doubt become identified, and his influence on the development of contemporary biological science was considerable. Through his field studies of animal behavior and his synthetic approach to Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics, he helped determine the direction of modern biology. As an educator his influence was incalculable, for he taught not only such men as E.B. Ford and A.C. Hardy, but through his writings, perhaps millions of men and women as well. He was, moreover, known for his encouragement of aspiring scientists and scholars. In his catholic interests, in his belief in the interrelationship of science and arts, he extended his influence beyond the laboratory of the classroom and reached artists, writers, musicians, politicians and finally the general public. Such interests and such influence indicate that his desire to be known as one to whom nothing human and nothing in external nature was alien was fulfilled.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Walter Gardner Hall was born in Houston, Texas on May 30, 1907. His parents, Samuel Emery and Emma Belle Gardner Hall, moved from Illinois to the Texas Gulf Coast in 1898. His family farmed and ran a cafe before his father went to work as a mechanic for the Houston Streetcar Company and later the Interurban Company. In about 1913, Hall and his family moved to League City, only to return to Houston in 1915. In 1919 the Halls moved once again to League City and acquired a ten-acre farm, while Samuel Hall continued to work for the Interurban Company.</p><p>Hall enrolled in Rice Institute in 1924 as, he once said, "the greenest freshman that ever entered." When reflecting on his life, Hall has always pointed to his experiences at Rice and his association with such professors as Radoslav A. Tsanoff as vital components of whatever political and economic success he might have had in his life. After his graduation in 1928, Hall went to work for the Texas Company as cashier at a clay mine in Fayette County. Two years later, Hall was transferred to Houston. In January of 1931, in the midst of an ever-worsening depression, Hall resigned from the Texas Company because he believed that the company's management had treated unfairly a friend and fellow employee. He accepted the position of cashier of the Citizens State Bank of League City (a job he had earlier refused) and by 1935 had convinced the owners of the bank to move to Dickinson. In 1943, Hall and his wife, Helen Lewis, whom he had married in 1927, bought controlling interest in the Citizens State Bank of Dickinson. Later, as the Halls and their community prospered, they took over the Alvin State Bank, the Leaque City State Bank, and the Webster State Bank. They also invested in real estate, established several insurance agencies, and acquired controlling interest in Sentinel National Life Insurance Company.</p><p>Beginning in the late 1930's, Walter Hall took an increasing interest in politics. He supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt fervently at a time when many Texas Democrats were becoming increasingly estranged from the President. In the mid 1940's, Hall emerged as a leader of the Liberal Democrats in Texas. He helped Lyndon B. Johnson win the crucial Senate election of 1948 and later aided in the election of Senator Ralph W. Yarborough. At the historic 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, he was a strong supporter of Hubert Humphrey. Although his candidates often lost closely contested elections, Hall continued to support the Democratic Party, particularly the liberal wing of the party, throughout the 1950's, 60's and 70's. Hall died March 12, 2000.</p> </bioghist>

<p>William Ward Watkin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 21, 1886. His parents were Fred W. Watkin and Mary Hancock Watkin. Watkin grew up in Pennsylvania, the home state of his mother's family. He graduated from Danville High School in 1903 and entered the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing the study of architecture under Paul Phillipe Cret. Following his graduation in 1908, Watkin spent one year traveling in Europe, principally in England.</p><p>Upon his return from Europe, Watkin joined the Boston office of Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, then one of the most prominent architectural firms in the United States. At the time of Watkin's employment, 1909, Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson had received the commission to produce a campus plan and to design the initial buildings of the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas. Watkin worked on the development of both the campus plan and the building plan in the office; when construction was to begin, in the summer of 1910, Watkin was sent to Houston to serve as Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson's representative supervisor. In this capacity Watkin not only oversaw the construction of the initial Institute group--the Administration Building, the Mechanical laboratory and Powerhouse, and the North and South residence halls - but most of the Institute's subsequent development: the Physics laboratory (1913-1915), east Hall (1913-1914), West Hall (1915-1916), three proposed President's houses (1913, 1915, 1923-1924), the Field House (1920), the Chemistry Laboratory (1923-1925), a proposed Alumni Hall (1927), two proposed libraries (1927, 1940-1941), and the Founder's Statue (1927-1930). Watkin himself was to design the Faculty Club - Cohen House (1927), Rice Stadium (1938), and the Naval ROTC building (1941). He also served as consulting architect to Staub and Rather in the design and construction of the Fondren Library (1946-1949), M.D. Anderson Hall (1946-1947), and the Abercrombie Laboratory (1947-1948).</p><p>As supervising architect, Watkin worked closely with Dr. Edgar Odell Lovett, president of the Rice Institute. Lovett offered Watkin a faculty appointment and the Institute opened in the fall of 1912 with Watkin as instructor in architectural engineering. In the summer of 1916 he was made an assistant professor and in 1922 he became a full professor. In 1914 the architecture faculty expanded to two, and to three in 1915. Rice awarded the first professional degrees in architecture in 1917. Watkin's efforts to provide his students with a thorough course in architectural studies led him to organize a traveling fellowship in 1928. Watkin's academic duties were not restricted to the Architecture department. He was also Curator of Grounds, Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Buildings and Grounds, and Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Outdoor Sports, a position which resulted in his serving a term as president of the Southwest Conference in 1920. At the time of his sabbatical in the 1928-1929 academic year, Watkin resigned the athletic committee post. He remained, however, head of Buildings and Grounds, as his resignation of this post was not accepted by Dr. Lovett. During World War II, Watkin chaired the Committee on Air Raid protection and Civilian defense.</p><p>As early as 1912 Watkin was accepting independent architectural commissions. Between 1913 and 1915 he entered into partnership with George Endress of Austin, practicing under the name Endress and Watkin. This firm was dissolved at the end of 1919 and Watkin thereafter practiced under his own name. Also in 1919 Watkin ceased his affiliation with Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, though he continued to operate, on a commission basis, as supervisor for their Texas projects. In addition to practicing architecture, Watkin consulted on projects, and in 1933 he was appointed to the Board of Architectural Consultants, an advisory group connected with the design of the Federal Triangle in Washington, D.C.</p><p>During the teens and twenties, Watkin wrote articles for journals, primarily dealing with Houston, its growth and development, and the implications these held for the city's architecture. Watkin contributed descriptive pieces on the Rice Institute to <title>Progressive Houston</title> and the <title>Southern Architectural Review</title>, Houston's short-lived architectural magazine. Not until the late twenties did he become more involved in research and writing. In 1930 the <title>Rice Institute Pamphlet</title> published a series of lectures Watkin had given on the new architecture in Europe; <title>Pencil Points</title> reprinted these in 1931. Watkin wrote two additional essays for <title>Pencil Points</title> one published in 1931 on new directions in ecclesiastical architecture, and another in 1932. This former essay was something of a prolegomena to Watkin's first book, "The Church of Tomorrow" published in 1936. In 1951 Watkin's second book, "Planning and Building the Modern Church," was published. At the time of his death he was planning to write a book on architecture in Texas.</p><p>Watkin had numerous academic and professional associations. He was a member of the Houston Philosophical Society, the Texas Philosophical Society and the Houston Country Club. Watkin was a charter member of the Rice Institute Faculty Club. He had become a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1913, and was elected to the College of Fellows in 1949. Watkin was a communicant of Trinity Church.</p><p>William Ward Watkin died on June 24, 1952 from complications following surgery for a broken kneecap. He was survived by his wife, Josephine Cockrell Watkin, whom he had married in 1933. Watkin had previously been married to Annie Ray Townsend Watkin, who died in 1929. Their three children were Annie Ray Watkin Biehl Hoagland, Rosemary Watkin Barrick, and William Ward Watkin, Jr.</p><p>Excerpted from Stephen Fox's 1976 unpublished "Guide to the Papers of William Ward Watkin in the Woodson Research Center of the Rice University."</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Osterhout Family Collection begins with John Patterson Osterhout (1826-1903). John was
born in Pennsylvania and completed his education as a lawyer while carrying out a teaching
career in that state. In 1851, John moved to Bellville, Texas in Austin County. At first, he
continued to be a teacher but, in the years up until his death, John held a number of
different positions - lawyer, collecting agent, newspaper editor and owner, officer in the
Confederate Army, railroad company president, judge, postmaster, rancher and a store owner.
As well as these varied occupations, John was prominent in the Baptist church and Masonic
communities and, later in his life, he was involved in state politics. In 1859(?), he made a
brief return to Pennsylvania to marry Junia Roberts.</p>
<p>Junia (Roberts) Osterhout was born in Pennsylvania where she met and married John and came
back to Texas with him in 1859(?). She was the mother of six children - Paul, Gertrude, John
Jeremiah, Ora, Junia and another child that died in infancy - and helped raise them in
Bellville and Belton, Texas. Junia died in 1897.</p>
<p>Paul Osterhout (1859-1944), the first child, was born and raised in Bellville and Belton,
Texas. He graduated from Baylor College in Texas and Jefferson Medical College in
Pennsylvania. After holding several odd jobs following graduation, Paul moved to Central
America in 1888 where he began his professional career. He and his wife, May, lived in
Nicaragua, Colombia and Panama where Paul tried his hand variously as a doctor, pharmacist,
banana and rubber plantation owner and political consul. In the later stages of his career,
Paul and May moved back to Texas and resided in San Antonio.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the family, Gertrude Osterhout, the second child, went to Baylor Female
College where she had much success academically. She later went on to become a faculty
member at Baylor University. John Jeremiah, who went by the name Jeremiah or Jere, moved to
Central America to look for work and lived with his brother Paul. He later held a job as a
postal clerk on the Santa Fe railroad. Ora Osterhout attended Baylor University and later
married into the Wade Family. It is from Ora that this collection came to Rice University.
The youngest Osterhout, Junia, had a career as a school teacher.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Salomon Chaim Bochner, a mathematician, historian, and teacher of international fame, was born on 20 August 1899 in the small town of Podgorzu, Austria-Hungary, now in Poland. His early schooling included grammar school and attendance at the Academia w Krakowie. Reputedly, he had already mastered the calculus by age 13, and completed his first original research in his fifteenth year. In 1915 he moved to Berlin to attend the Konigstadtisch Oberrealschule until he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army in May 1917.</p><p>In the army Bochner received medical training at a military school near Vienna, and eventually obtained the rank of corporal in the medical corps. He was stationed at Feldpost # 3, a military hospital, until November of 1918. Soon thereafter he matriculated at the University of Berlin where he studied mathematics for three years. He received the D.Phil. on 8 April 1921, his examiners being Max Planck, Ehrhardt Schmidt, Issai Schur and Alois Riehl.</p><p>Directly after receiving his degree, Bochner was employed as a volunteer in the Cuten and Syman Banking House in Berlin, but left at the end of the year to "do other things." Exactly what he did for most of the next three years is unknown. In 1925, however, he was awarded an International Education Board Fellowship, which brought him to Copenhagen to study with Harald Bohr and to Oxford and Cambridge to work with G.H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood. In 1927 Bochner accepted a position as a Lecturer in the Mathematics Department of the University of Munich. His colleagues there included several well-known mathematicians, among them C. Caratheodory, O. Perron, H. Tietre, and H. Hartogs.</p><p>Bochner made his debut as a young scholar in the 1920s in an incident involving the Danish mathematician, Harald Bohr, the brother of the well-known physicist, Niels Bohr. Inspired on the one hand by the analytic number theory of Bernhard Riemann and on the other by the celestial mechanics of Lagrange and the later astronomers, Bohl and Esclangon, Bohr had developed a general theory of a phenomenon which he named "almost periodicity" and which was described in brief announcements published in 1923. On reading such exciting news, Bochner lacked the patience to wait for the publication of the detailed proofs and simply worked it out himself. Upon learning of the young man's work a month later, Bohr invited Bochner to visit him in Copenhagen. They soon discovered that Bochner had achieved Bohr's result by means of a highly original and parallel approach, entirely different from that of Bohr. Moreover, the Bochner approach was the one that would stand the test of time, being the basis for future generalizations of Bohr's theory.</p><p>Notoriety at such an early age led Bochner onto his life-long study of harmonic analysis, starting in 1932 with the now classical treatise, "Lectures on the Fourier Integral." This work laid out the seeds of what was later to be called the theory of distributions and set forth his most famous theorem, actually known as the "Bochner Theorem." In the later development of abstract Fourier analysis, the Bochner theorem became the cornerstone of the theory of distributions.</p><p>As a Jew, Bochner evidently decided that the growing tide of Nazism in Germany left him with no other choice than to seek a new life elsewhere. Accordingly, after a six-month stay in Cambridge, England, he joined the Princeton University faculty in 1933, and served as an assistant, associate, and full professor of mathematics until 1968. During that period Bochner held other professional positions. He was a temporary member of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton University. He spent one year as a visiting professor at Harvard University and another at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a consultant at the Los Alamos Project and for the Air Research and Development Command. In 1968 Bochner retired from Princeton University and accepted Rice University's offer of the Edgar Odell Lovett Chair in Mathematics. He subsequently became the chairman of the Mathematics Department.</p><p>Although Bochner was most devoted to his work and study, he nonetheless led a very active personal life that involved much correspondence and travel. In November 1937 he married Naomi Weinberg of Brooklyn, New York. They went on a three-month honeymoon trip the following year to Holland, France, and Great Britain. One daughter, Deborah, was born to them. His father, Joseph Bochner, became ill in 1935 and died soon thereafter. Upon his father's death, his mother, Ruda Bochner, moved to London to live with his sister, Fannie Rabinowicz. He maintained close ties with his family throughout his life.</p><p>During those early years at Princeton, Bochner was extremely preoccupied with pure mathematical theory and proved to be a provocative and prolific writer. His research was original and pioneering. He was a forerunner in the theory of the so-called Schwartz distributions in that he introduced generalized Fourier transforms for functions that do not grow faster at infinity than a power of "x." Also, he was the first to introduce, in 1936, the much-studied process of spherical summability of multiple Fourier series; and by a nonobvious construction, he showed that Riemann's classical localization property in one dimension does not have the "expected" analog in two dimensions.</p><p>In the field of several complex variables, Bochner's achievements were very significant and spanned a broad horizon, especially in their interaction with other areas of mathematics. In 1938 he proved that the envelope of holomorphy of a tube is again a tube, the basis of the envelope tube being the convex closure of the basis of the original tube. In 1943 he used the "Bochner-Martinelli kernel" to prove Hartog's key theorem that, for a bounded domain with a connected boundary, a holomorphic function on the boundary has a continuation into the entire interior of the domain. The "Bochner-Montgomery Theorem," published in 1946, maintains that, on a compact complex manifold, the Lie group of holomorphic automorphism is a complex Lie group. Bochner created, for real and complex manifolds, the topic of "curvature and Betti numbers," a title under which he published a book with Kentaro Yano in 1953. Finally, the crowning honor in this field came in 1967 with the fifth printing of "Several Complex Variables," originally published in 1947.</p><p>In probability theory, Bochner constructed, analyzed, and introduced in 1946 the Fourier transform of a rather general type of stochastic process, randomizing not point functions, but additive set functions, and obtaining not only differential space but other homogeneous processes. In this area of study Bochner's "Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Probability" became a standard work. Finally, a belated honor arrived in 1977, when it became generally known that Zorn's lemma of 1933 had been fully published and applied by Bochner in 1926.</p><p>In the period from 1950 to 1965, Bochner published at least eighty mathematical articles, most being elaborations of the enormous body of his earlier ideas. Afterwards, however, he turned almost exclusively to the history and philosophy of science. In his later years, Bochner wrote books and articles on the role of the concepts of space, infinity, real numbers, functions, and continuity in major junctures and upheavals in the rise of Western mathematics, such as the decline of Greek mathematics in its own phase, the sudden emergence of analysis in the late Renaissance, and a subtle but very tangible change of style in mathematics in the transition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century. His "The Role of Mathematics in the Rise of Science," perhaps his most famous book, was published in 1966 and soon thereafter translated into many languages. Indeed, a very large proportion of the working papers in this collection deal with the history of science.</p><p>Salomon Bochner died in Houston, Texas on 2 May 1982, eleven years after the death of his beloved wife, Naomi. His life began at the turn of the century and his work influenced and sowed seeds of ideas in his students and colleagues that will continue to be important long after his death and beyond the turn of the next century.</p><p><chronlist> <head>Biological Chronology</head> <chronitem> <date>1899: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Born on 20 August in Podgorzu, Kracow, Austria-Hungary.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1906: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Began Grammar School, Kracow.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1913: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Graduated from Grammar School.</event> <event>Entered the Academia Handlowa w Krakowie, Kracow.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1914: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Graduated from the Akademia Handlowa w Krakowie on 10 December.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1915: </date> <eventgrp> <event>In February began to attend the Konigstadtische Oberrealschule in Berlin, Prussia.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1917: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Left the Konigstadtisch Oberrealschule on 25 April.</event> <event>Entered the Austro-Hungarian army in May.</event> <event>On June 11 began to attend a school for medical training near Vienna, Austria-Hungary, eventually obtaining the rank of corporal in the medical corps.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1918: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Left Feldpost # 3, a military hospital, on 14 March to travel to Berlin on a leave of absence valid until 12 October.</event> <event>Discharged honorably from the Austro-Hungarian army in November.</event> <event>Matriculated at the University of Berlin.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1921: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Received D.Phil. degree from the University of Berlin on 8 April.</event> <event>Joined the German Mathematical Society.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1922: </date> <eventgrp> <event>On April 1 began employment as a volunteer in the Cuten and Syman Banking House in Berlin.</event> <event>On 31 December left Cuten and Syman to <emph render="doublequote">do other things</emph>.</event> </eventgrp> </chronitem> <chronitem> <date>1925: </date> <eventgrp> <event>Became International Education Board Fellow and studied with Harald Bohr in Copenhagen and with G.H.

<p>Charles William Goyen, author, editor, and teacher, was born in Trinity, Texas, on April 24, 1915 and moved with his family to Houston at the age of eight. He received B.A. and M.A. degrees from Rice University (then Institute) in 1937 and 1939, respectively. After teaching for one year at the University of Houston, he left to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Returning after five years, he left Houston to pursue his work as a writer, residing at various times in New Mexico, Europe, New York, and California. His East Texas origins, however, were to have an enduring influence on the speech patterns and cultural characteristics reflected in his writings. </p><p>His first novel, House of Breath, was published to critical acclaim in 1950. Subsequent publications included the novels In a Farther Country (1955), The Fair Sister (1963), and Come the Restorer (1974); Selected Writings (1974); short story collections Ghost and Flesh (1952), The Faces of Blood Kindred (1960) and The Collected Stories (1975); the non-fiction A Book of Jesus (1973); and plays The House of Breath (1956), The Diamond Rattler (1960), Christy (1964), House of Breath Black/White (1971), and Aimee (1973). He also created lyrics for the film Left-Handed Gun (1958) and served as translator for The Lazy Ones by Egyptian author Albert Cossery. </p><p>In addition to being a writer, he was instructor of English at the New School for Social Research in New York City, 1955-60; Associate in English at Columbia University, 1964-66; senior editor in the trade department at McGraw Hill, 1966-71; and visiting Professor of English at Brown University, 1973. He married the actress Doris Roberts in 1963. </p><p>Among awards he received were music awards for words and music from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (A.S.C.A.P.) in 1964, 1965, 1968, 1970, and 1971; an award from the Texas Institute of Arts and Letters, 1950; and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Rice University in 1977. He was a Guggenheim fellow in 1950 and 1952 and a Ford Foundation grantee in 1963-64. He died in Los Angeles of leukemia in August 1983, two months before his novel Arcadio was published.

<p>Albert Thomas was the first Rice Alumnus to serve in Congress. Thomas was born in Nacogdoches, Texas, on April 12, 1898. As a child, he attended Public Schools in Nacogdoches and worked in his father's store. During World War I, Thomas served as a second lieutenant in the army. He graduated from Rice Institute in 1920 and from University of Texas law school in 1926. Thomas was married to Lera Millard in 1922. He was elected county attorney in Nacogdoches in 1927, and served there until 1930, when he moved to Houston to become assistant United States district attorney for the southern district of Texas. Thomas was elected to represent the Eighth District of Texas (Harris County) in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1936, a position he held until his death. Thomas served on numerous committees and was instrumental in locating the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. He became chairman of the House Subcommittee on Independent Office Appropriations in 1949, chairman of the Texas House delegation in 1950, and chairman of the House Democratic caucus in 1964.

<p>Walter W. Fondren was born in 1877 in Tennessee, the son of a farmer, who moved the family to Arkansas in 1883. Orphaned at the age of nine or ten, W. W. Fondren began working on farms in Arkansas and Texas. Then in 1897 he worked as a helper on a drilling rig at Corsicana, Texas, developing rapidly and becoming an independent driller during the first decade of this century. While he was working at Corsicana, he met and married Ella F. Cochrum.</p><p>Born at Hazel, Kentucky, Ella Cochrum was in her mid teens when her father died, making it necessary for her to quit school to care for her sister and five brothers. She and Walter Fondren were married on Valentine's Day, 1904 in Corsicana, and soon thereafter moved to Houston, where a son and two daughters were born to them and where they lived for the remainder of their lives.</p><p>Mr. Fondren was elected a director of the Humble Oil Company, then controlled mostly by Ross. S. Sterling, in 1912. In 1917 the Humble Oil and Refining Company was formed, and Walter Fondren was elected vice president. He assumed responsibility for drilling on the Gulf coast when Humble was affiliated with Jersey Standard in 1919. When W. S. Farish was elected Jersey director (1933), while retaining the Humble presidency, W. W. Fondren retired. After several years of heart trouble, he died suddenly early in 1939.</p><p>The Fondren's interest in aiding worthy institutions led to the establishment of the Fondren Foundation in 1948 to manage the resources of an estate valued at over thirty-three million dollars at the time of Mr. Fondren's death. Prominent among the recipients of this generosity have been St. Paul's Methodist Church, Methodist Hospital, Methodist Homes for Older People and the YMCA, all in Houston and Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Mrs. Fondren's concern with health care and the training of nurses led her to charter the Texas Association of Hospital Auxiliaries in 1943. Over the years she also provided money for scholarships and awards for nursing students. At the time of her death in 1982, Ella F. Fondren had devoted much of this century to local philanthropy.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Floyd Seyward Lear was a member of the faculty at the Rice Institute (later Rice University) in the Department of History from 1925 to 1975, the year of his death. He was born in Corfu, New York, on July 7, 1895, received an A.B. degree from the University of Rochester in 1917, and Master's and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1920 and 1925, respectively. He first came to Texas in 1917 for military duty in the United States Army, serving from 1917 to 1919 in the Army Air Service at the new Ellington Field near Houston. </p><p>He married Elsie Laura Mann in 1920, and after completing his graduate work at Harvard returned to Houston in 1925 to join the faculty at the Rice Institute, then beginning its fourteenth academic year, as Instructor in history. He taught a wide range of courses at Rice over the next fifty years, including ancient and medieval literature and history (his particular areas of expertise), as well as courses in political theory and American history as the needs of a growing Department of History required. He was Assistant Professor from 1927 to 1945, Professor in 1945, Harris Masterson Jr. Professor of History in 1953 (the first to hold this chair), and Trustee Distinguished Professor from 1965. He served as chairman of the Department of History from 1933 to 1960, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and from 1925 a charter member of the Medieval Academy of America.</p><p>As a teacher, Dr. Lear took a personal interest in his students, coming to regard many as friends while remaining closely involved in their intellectual development. He was instrumental in developing a graduate program in history at Rice and in encouraging students interested in pursuing academic careers, including young women for whom opportunities in this area were just beginning to grow. He witnessed the extensive physical expansion that took place at Rice following World War II, and was involved in recruitment of faculty and in changes to the curriculum brought about by post-war shifts in national priorities.</p><p>Dr. Lear's papers reflect the broad interests of a humanist, teacher, and scholar. When writing in 1965 to the family of another of Rice's early faculty members whose papers had recently been given to the University Archives, he expressed his thoughts concerning the value of such papers for preserving a university's collective memory, saying:</p><p>In a very short time there will be no one left in active service here who recalls or has direct knowledge of the old school. And the depth of ignorance about almost everything prior to the Second War would appear quite unbelievable to graduates of a generation ago. The amount of correspondence and other memorabilia associated with the original faculty is all too small in the archives and the likelihood of preserving this material decreases with every passing year.</p><p>Dr. Lear's own papers help to fill this need by providing a record of years critical in the development of Rice University.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The collection consists of letters written mainly to Louisa Neumann (later Mrs. Charles H. Bering) in Houston, by her brothers and sisters. Of greatest interest are the 12 letters written by her brother Emil from 1862-64. Emil, a member of the Confederate Army, was stationed at Fort Eagle Grove, Pelican Battery, and Galveston. In a letter to Louisa written from Galveston on January 7, 1863, he described a battle in which he was in charge of cannon "near the brick warehouse" on The Strand. He witnessed the capture of the vessel "Harriet Lane" and the escape of her companion ships, the "Orosco" and the "Clifton." In a letter written four days later, he mentioned the five vessels then lying off the island, which "shot over one hundred shots into town." We do not know the names of these ships, but presumably they were Union vessels, as they were firing into Galveston which was then held by the Confederates.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Billie McClain Carr (later known as "The Godmother" for her work on behalf of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party) was born in Houston, Texas, June 1, 1928. She grew up near downtown Houston, graduated from Sam Houston High School in 1946, and married three months later; she had three sons, and over the years took courses at South Texas College and the University of Houston. </p><p>Carr's activities as a political organizer began in 1952, when political issues in Texas stirred her to run for Democratic chairman of her precinct and she unexpectedly won. Soon afterward she became a protégé of Frankie Randolph, a leader and benefactress of liberal causes who helped found the Harris County Democrats (a liberal precinct organization) in 1953. She taught Carr the art of grass roots political organizing, and over time Carr assumed a leadership role in Harris County Democrats and began to establish a statewide reputation as an organizer, convention strategist, and spokesperson for the statewide liberal coalition. </p><p>In 1954 Carr was elected a member from her precinct to the Harris County Democratic Executive Committee, serving in that capacity until 1972; she was also Harris County's member on the Texas State Democratic Executive Committee from 1964 to 1966. She was a leader in efforts to achieve proportional liberal participation in presidential conventions and became nationally known in the Democratic Party for taking a rump delegation to the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, an action which helped initiate a party-wide set of reforms abolishing the use of the unit rule by which conservative Democrats had been able to minimize the election of liberals as delegates to presidential conventions. </p><p>As a liberal activist and strategist, Carr also fought for civil rights. She protested the Vietnam War and fought for women's rights in the 1970s, and for gay rights in the 1980s. She helped organize the 1966 campaign leading to the election of Barbara Jordan, the first black woman elected to the Texas Senate, and was later described by U. S. Rep. Mickey Leland as "the grand old lady of liberal politics" for her efforts in helping a number of minority candidates (including himself) win political office. She later established a business, Billie Carr &amp; Associates, specializing in campaign and other political services. </p><p>In 1972 Carr was elected to serve as a member of the Democratic National Committee (a position she held until 2000); there she was elected "whip" for the progressive-reform caucus and in June 1981 was elected chair of the newly-formed Progressive-Liberal Caucus.

<head>Organizational Sketch</head>
<p>In 1914, native Texan Herman Brown was given eighteen mules in lieu of back wages for construction work done in his hometown of Belton, which he used to enter the construction business on his own. In 1919 his brother-in-law, Dan Root, advanced him money for working capital, and the company was named Brown and Root, Incorporated. In 1922 Herman's younger brother, George Rufus Brown, joined the firm. Dan Root, a prosperous Central Texas cotton farmer, died in 1929. The paving of dirt roads and building of steel bridges for municipal and county governments in Central Texas led the firm to a successful joint bid in 1936 to construct the Marshall Ford Dam (now Mansfield Dam) on the Colorado River. A 1940 contract to construct the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was the first of their big federal war projects. The brothers formed the Brown Shipbuilding Company in 1942 and constructed more than 350 vessels for the navy. The shipyard had a labor force of 25,000 and won the Army-Navy E and a presidential citation. </p><p>After World War II the Brown brothers and other investors purchased the Big and Little Inch pipelines from the government with the winning high bid of $143 million and organized a new company, Texas Eastern Transmission Company, which is now a part of Panhandle Eastern Corporation. Brown and Root was widely known during the 1950s and 1960s for constructing United States air and naval bases (in Spain, France, and Guam) and roads, dams, bridges, petrochemical plants, and large offshore drilling platforms. In 1961 the company won the planning contract for the $200 million Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.</p><p>Herman Brown died on November 15, 1962, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.Brown was a cofounder of the Brown Foundation. He was a member of the board of directors of First City National Bank of Houston, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, Southwestern University, Armco Steel Corporation, and Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. He was also active in oil and gas exploration and ranching. </p><p>After the death of his brother Herman in 1962, George became president of Brown and Root. Later that year the corporation was sold to the Halliburton Company. </p><p> In December 1962 the Halliburton Company of Dallas purchased Brown and Root, which continues to operate under its own name. Halliburton's significant acquisition of Brown and Root of Houston in 1962 gained for the company the sort of subsudiaries that heretofore had been missing: industrial and marine engineering and construction firms. At the time of acquisition Brown and Root had annual revenues of $5.5 billion. </p><p>George R. Brown served as a director of the Halliburton Company, Armco Steel Corporation, Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, Trans-World Airlines, Southland Paper Company, First City Bancorporation, and Highland Oil Company. He served on important commissions for presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, and was appointed to commissions for the state of Texas, from the 1930s under Governor James Allred to the 1970s under Governor Dolph Briscoe. He was a well-known friend and visible supporter of Lyndon B. Johnson throughout his political career. He was the recipient of many honors during his lifetime, including Awards from Rice University, Colorado School of Mines, Southwestern University, and the University of Texas. He received several awards in construction and engineering, including the John Fritz Medal in 1977 from the five national engineering societies, and the American Petroleum Institute Gold Medal.</p><p>Brown served as chairman of the board of trustees of Rice University for fifteen years of his twenty-five years of service on the board. In 1951 the Brown brothers and their wives established the Brown Foundation, through which they pursued a strong and generous interest in philanthropy. By June 30, 1994, the foundation had granted more than $381 million to charitable institutions, primarily in higher education and the arts. In 1925 Brown married Alice Nelson Pratt of Lometa, Texas, who became well-known for her support for the arts at the local, state, and national levels. They had three children.

<p>In 1963 Jones was the only women's college at Rice, and there was such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were being housed in another university's dorms. In October of that year, George R. Brown and his wife Alice Pratt Brown donated one million dollars through the Brown Foundation to build a new dorm for women at Rice. The new college was established in memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown, (1896-1963) who was the wife of the also late Hermann Brown. Margarett Brown was devoted to the fine arts as an art critic and collector and served on the boards of several of organizations. As a tribute to her love of the arts, the first floor of Brown College houses a wide variety of paintings and antique furniture donated by the George R. Brown family and others.</p><p>The College was dedicated on October 3, 1965 and was filled primarily by women who had volunteered to leave Jones College to start a new college. Since then other colleges have been added to Rice, and beginning in 1971 some colleges went co-ed. Brown held out as the last all female college until 1987 when it agreed to accept male members.</p><p>The College is an eight-story masonry structure on the northeast campus. The high-rise was devised to spare trees. In 2001 new construction will change the Brown College complex. An addition will connect to Brown College on four levels and will extend west of the College in the area occupied by the current Jones Masters' House. New Brown Commons will anchor the west end of Brown Quadrangle with the existing Brown Master's House on the South Side.</p><p>Excerpted from <emph render="italic">Rice University Construction Web Page and Brown College Web Page</emph> </p> </bioghist>

<p>The first meeting of the Houston Philosophical Society was held on January 18, 1920 at the University Club in downtown Houston. It was organized to bring together the intellectual community both on and off campus. Its purpose was to "stimulate interest in modern developments in science and philosophy." The word "philosophical" is used in its broadest sense and members of the society represent all departments of the arts, sciences, and letters.</p><p>At that first meeting Professor H. A. Wilson was elected as president, Professor G. C. Evans as secretary, and Mr. S. G. McCann (the registrar at Rice) as treasurer. Three additional members were elected to serve on the executive council: Professors C. W. Heaps, H. B. Weiser, and R. A. Tsanoff. The persons listed here, whose main work was respectively in physics, mathematics, history, chemistry, and philosophy, indicate the wide range of interests that has characterized the Society from the beginning.</p><p>The monthly meetings held during the academic year normally consist of a dinner, followed by a business session and then the address of the evening by either a member of the Society or an invited guest speaker. Time is reserved for questions or discussion after the address.</p><p>The members of the Society are elected based on their high intellectual and professional achievements. Originally an all male organization, in 1987 the bylaws were changed so that they did not imply that one had to be male to be a member. By the next year several women had been elected. Today the Society has no gender or racial restrictions and has a maximum membership of 240 members divided into eight sections as follows: <list numeration="upperalpha" type="ordered"><item>Astronomy, Engineering, and Mathematics</item><item>Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics</item><item>Medicine</item><item>Business and Economics</item><item>Education, Health, and Physical Education, Philosophy, Psychology, Religion, and Social Science</item><item>History, Journalism, Language, Literature, and Library Science</item><item>Architecture, Fine Arts, Music, and Theater</item><item>Government and Law</item></list></p><p>Members pay annual dues but are exempt if they have achieved Life Membership status.

<head>The Original Role of the College Masters</head>
<p> As codified by the Committee on Student Housing in the 1950s, each residential college has a master, often a husband and wife team. The college masters "would be the primary ones responsible for achieving the goals of social concern and intellectual curiosity. It was therefore important to choose the masters with great care; the committee recommended that they be chosen from the ranks of full professors. Although the committee originally thought that masters, faculty fellows, and student officers would handle disciplinary matters, the final report emphasized that masters were not to be thought of as disciplinarians. . . The master retained overall responsibility for student life in his college, but his main duties were to counsel students, provide an example, and advise student committees.</p><p>Excerpted from <emph render="italic">A History of Rice University: The Institute Years, 1907-1963</emph>, by Fredericka Meiners, pg. 180.</p> </bioghist>

The next building completed was East Hall, which is now known to members as the "Old Wing" of Baker. These buildings remained unchanged until the installation of the college system at Rice in 1957 when the addition of the "New Wing" and Baker House completed the present Baker College. The Baker House is home of the College Master and his family. </p><p>The Charter Members of Baker College, under the leadership of the first cabinet, declared the purpose of their college to be: "to provide and maintain an atmosphere and environment which will encourage the intellectual and social growth of its members through the development of a sense of responsibility in all spheres of community action."

<p>Libby Prison (in which the letter in this collection was written) was a prison in Richmond, Virginia for Union captives, noted for the harsh conditions under which its inmates lived, both from periodic overcrowding and from the growing shortage of provisions available in Richmond for civilians and inmates alike as the war progressed and fresh waves of Union prisoners continued to pour in. The prison was housed in three brick buildings (formerly part of a tobacco factory), one building of which had been leased in 1854 by Captain Luther Libby for his company, L. Libby &amp; Sons, Ship Chandlers; the prison received its name from the company's sign, left behind after the buildings were hastily commandeered for prison and hospital use shortly after the Battle of First Manassas (Bull Run) of July 21, 1861.</p> </bioghist>

<p>When the Beer-Bike race first began in 1957, it was a competition between two residential colleges, run on the campus inner loop, with the victorious college receiving a keg of beer from the loser. At that time, the people who rode the bikes were the same as those who chugged the beer. The Beer-Bike race of today is more of an intercollege bike race where 10 non-riding people chug between riders.</p><p>In the early days, riders and drinkers worked out for only a couple of days before the race, just to make the team and get in the spirit of things. The beer drinkers opened the taps of their cans with a standard opener and the riders rode "English Bikes." The crowd, which numbered only a few friends, stood anywhere they pleased to view the action. In those days, the race was a test of mechanical durability as well as speed, for the same bike was used for the whole race. This involved ripping the incoming rider off his speeding machine, slapping on a fresh rider, and casting him out in front of the pit. The spent rider was then scooped up and removed from the course. During this time, the beer drinkers knocked off their refreshments in the living-room time of six or seven seconds. High speed was not necessary because of the time involved in changing riders.</p><p>In, 1968, Beer-Bike moved to the Rice Stadium. The first women's race took place in 1972 when Brown and Jones Colleges competed. In 1976, the seed of the parade tradition was planted when Sid Richardson College entered with torches, followed by a brass band playing the theme for the Olympic Games. Alumni participated in the first alumni race in 1982. In 1987, when the drinking age changed from 18 to 21, water was offered at Beer-Bike for the first time to quench underage students' thirst.</p><p>Today, technology dominates the race. Nearly all the bikes are of the ten-speed type ridden in the Tour de France (some machines costing as much as $600). The beer drinkers have special 14 oz. "tall boy" cans with mouthpieces custom fitted and thoroughly tested. Several bikers are used throughout the race with the gears matched to the rider's style of riding. The speed of the beer team now counts heavily since the outgoing rider is mounted and ready to go before the incoming rider reaches the pit.</p><p>College and bike teams practice for months ahead of the race, and making the team of 10, or at least securing a spot as an alternate, is a sought-after goal for many college members. Parade coordinators plan weeks in advance to devise an innovative parade float, or theme song, or chant, or mode of transportation to the track on race day. Team participants seek financial sponsors, design team and college t-shirts, work to determine the optimal chug technique, and hold coordination practices to ensure that a biker starts riding precisely as the chugger finishes. Every year race coordinators hold meetings to choose team colors, to schedule practice races, and to revise or change rules.</p><p>Excerpted from "Sallyport," April-May 1992, "Thresher," April 7, 2000, and "The Beer Bike Race," by Jim Llamas, Captain. </p> </bioghist>

<p>In the early 1900's, university professors were limited in what they could teach and write. Many outspoken professors lost their jobs because of their views. The American Association of University Professors was born when Arthur O. Lovejoy, a philosopher at Johns Hopkins, and John Dewey organized a meeting at Johns Hopkins University in 1915 to form an organization to ensure academic freedom for faculty members. The mission of AAUP is to advance academic freedom and shared governance, to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and to ensure higher education's contribution to the common good. AAUP is the leading organization primarily dedicated to protecting the academic freedom of professors. Faculty members turn to AAUP for assistance in the thousands each year. Membership in the national organization is open to all faculty, librarians, and academic professionals at two- and four-year accredited public and private colleges and universities. Membership as of 2004 is about 45,000, with over 500 local campus chapters and 39 state organizations. Leadership is provided by bi-annually elected national officers drawn from colleges and universities throughout the country. The Association is governed by an elected national Council that meets twice a year, and by an Executive Committee that meets four times a year. </p><p>Excerpted from http://www.aaup.org/aboutaaup/description.htm and http://www.aaup.org/aboutaaup/hist.HTM , [accessed June 10,2004]. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Judge Harris Masterson, the youngest son of Thomas Gilbert and Christina Masterson, was born in Brazoria County on June 30, 1856. His father, a lawyer, judge, and large landowner in Brazoria County, migrated to Texas from Nashville, Tennessee. His mother also studied law and came from Tennessee where her grandfather had been a prominent judge and governor.Harris and all five of his brothers received their legal education from her. Of the six, four entered into active legal practice, and all of the them served as judges at one time during their careers. </p><p>Harris Masterson began his legal career in Brazoria County. Although not much is known about Masterson's early career in Brazoria or his terms as judge, it seems from papers and correspondence in the collection that he became involved in land litigation early in his career. This emphasis began with his interests in his father's large holdings in Brazoria County. In June 1880, Harris Masterson married Sallie Stewart Turner, by whom he had five children, of whom only three lived beyond infancy. A short time after his wife's death in January of 1894, the Judge moved his legal practice to Houston. </p><p>From the extensive correspondence and numerous deeds in these papers, it seems Masterson dealt largely with land litigation and investments in Harris and surrounding counties, including Brazoria, Firt Bend, Galveston, Hardin, and Jefferson Counties. His land interests extended into several East Texas and Louisiana lumber companies. Since he owned so much coastal land, Spindletop and the discovery of oil opened a new field of business for Masterson. He joined with other prominent landowners in the coastal area to form small oil companies for drilling. He also made a great deal of money by leasing out his land for drilling. He became a member of the Hogg-Swayne syndicate participating in and contributing to their numerous drilling operations, as well as independently drilling with Frank Andrews and Joseph S. Cullinan. Most of the oil drilled on Masterson's land was sold to the Gulf Oil &amp; Pipeline Company, the Sun Pipeline Company, and other large oil companies. </p><p>Masterson set up several land corporations with his brother A.R. Masterson and son Neill. Two of these were the Texas Town Lot &amp; Improvement Company and the Houston Town Lot &amp; Improvement Company. Although these companies on occasion contracted to build houses on the land they sold, their primary function was to buy large tracts of land and break them into smaller lots. Much of this land was sold to what would today be called the middle and lower class people of Houston. These sales then were usually financed by Harris Masterson so that in case of default, the land reverted back to the Mastersons. Through one of these companies Masterson apparently acquired some land which the owners had been unwilling to sell to the newly founded Rice Institute. </p><p>Masterson also speculated in land in Cameron County and other parts of the Rio Grande Valley which only needed irrigation to become agriculturally productive. Not coincidentally, he also bought stock in various irrigation companies. Among these were the Harlingen Land &amp; Water Company and the La Feria Land &amp; Water Company. Although these companies were badly mismanaged by the local operators and eventually went bankrupt, they seemed to have opened up the speculation and search for water to make this area productive. Other investments for which there are records in these papers include coal mines in West Texas, local railroads, sugar crops, cattle and ranching. </p><p>Judge Harris Masterson was a shrewd businessman who kept his wealth spread across his various investments. His employed the services of a secretary as well as his son Neill and son-in-law Elliott Cage to help him look after and protect his investments. Neill Masterson continued to care for the investments after the death of Judge Masterson in July 1900. </p><p>Source: "The Masterson Family Papers", <title type="simple"><emph render="italic">The Flyleaf</emph> </title>, Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1974.

<p>Jared Ellison Groce (1782-1839), planter, public official and the wealthiest settler in Stephen F. Austin's colony, was born in Halifax County, VA, on October 12, 1782, the son of Jared Ellison and Sarah (Sheppard) Groce. In 1802 he moved to South Carolina, where he acquired property and married Mary Ann Waller, daughter of Texas pioneer Leonard Waller, on August 29, 1804. Later that year he moved to Lincoln County, Georgia, where he purchased a large estate. There he became a delegaate to the convention that drafted the Georgia constitution. After his wife's death in 1814, Groce moved to Alabama and established a settlement known as Fort Groce. Austin's colonization scheme drew him to Texas in 1821.</p><p>Groce reached the Brazos River in January 1822. He constructed a homestead, which soon became known as Bernardo Plantation, on the east bank four miles south of the site of present-day Hempstead. The Mexican government granted him title to ten leagues of land in 1824, which was soon augmented with other land. In 1822 he cultivated the first possible cotton crop in the Austin colony and in 1825 constructed one of the earliest gins in Texas on the Brazos River. He resided on his plantation until 1833, when the malarial environment compelled him to divide his estate among his children and move to Wallace Prairie. There on the east bank of the Brazos he constructed his home known as Groce's Retreat. He was selected as a delegate from the District of Viesca (later Milam County) to the Convention of 1832, where he opposed the resolution seeking independence for Texas. He espoused revolution but outfitted men for service in the Texas Army. The draft of the Texas Declaration of Independence was completed at Groce's Retreat and was sent to Washington-on-the-Brazos for ratification. Between March 18 and 21, 1836, Groce's Retreat served as the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas. After the Battle of San Jacinto in April, 1836, Groce's Retreat was considered as a site for the permanent capital of the republic.</p><p>Groce and his first wife had three sons and a daughter. In 1814 Groce married Ann Waller, Mary's sister, and they had two additional children. Ann died in 1818; Groce died in 1839 and was buried at Bernardo.</p><p>Leonard Waller Groce (1806-1873), oldest son of Mary Ann (Waller) and Jared E. Groce, was born in Lincoln County, Georgia, on September 27, 1806. He was attending school in Montgomery, Alabama, when his father moved the family to the Brazos River area of Texas, where he received title to lands from Stephen F. Austin in 1824. Leonard received his education in Augusta, Georgia, and in 1825 took over responsibility for much of his father's business. Leonard brought the first cotton gin to Texas and in 1830, with his brother Jared E. Groce, Jr. and a partner, went into the cotton trade. On November 17, 1831 he married Courtney Ann Fulton and lived at Bernardo, which they inherited in 1835 from Groce, Sr.</p><p>Leonard Groce was a member of the local militia at San Felipe de Austin, a delegate to the Convention of 1833, and a commissioned colonel in the Texas army. He supplied corn and beef for the army during the Texas Revolution, and saw the "Twin Sisters" cannons mounted at Bernardo on April 11, 1836. In 1840 Leonard Groce received his license to practice law, but remained with cotton production. Later on in life he was a trustee of the Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute. </p><p>In 1853 he moved his family of eleven children to Liendo Plantation which was the site of a Confederate recruiting station, prisoner of war camp during the Civil War, and troop encampment during Reconstruction. Groce sold his plantations and remained in Texas. The purchasers defaulted on the payments, but Groce was caught in the economic debacle of southern Reconstruction and declared bankruptcy in 1868. He died at Liendo on August 29, 1873. </p><p>Excerpted from "The New Handbook of Texas," 1996</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Sixth Kentucky, a Union Army regiment, was organized in late 1861 with volunteers that came principally from Henry, Jefferson, Kenton, Oldham and Shelby counties. Anderson, Campbell, Fayette, Hardin, Madison, Spencer, Trimble and Woodford counties were also represented, with about 60 men from southern Indiana. Four of the Sixth Kentucky's ten companies were composed principally of German-born residents of Louisville. The Sixth Kentucky was a member of Colonel (later Brigadier General) William B. Hazen's brigade. Hazen's brigade served in the Army of the Ohio and its successor, the Army of the Cumberland. The regiment fought at Shiloh, Stones River, Chickamauga, Brown's Ferry, Orchard Knob, Missionary Ridge, and in the four-month-long Atlanta Campaign. The Sixth Kentucky was at Perryville on the day of the battle, but its division was not called into the fray. However, the Sixth was instrumental in pushing Confederate forces out of Kentucky with frequent skirmishes with Braxton Bragg's rear guard. </p><p>The survivors of the three years of heavy service were mustered out in late 1864. Over 110 of its men were killed or mortally wounded. Almost 90 died from disease and illnesses caused by their wounds. By the end of the regiment's three years of service, its rolls had been reduced from approximately 900 men to about 300. </p><p>Excerpted from a "Brief History of the Sixth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Union)" by Joe Reinhart.</p> </bioghist>

The couple were married in 1930.</p><p>Continuing to expand his career, Woodson became the founder and president of one trade association and trustee of another, developing training methods and spreading them across the nation. The Woodsons relocated to New York City, and in 1953, the founder of American General, Gus Wortham, initiated a conversation with Woodson which resulted in Woodson taking the role of President of American General and moving to Houston, Texas in July 1953.</p><p>As president of the then small company which only wrote policies in Texas, Woodson helped launch an aggressive acquisition plan. The company grew from $48 million in assets to $5.3 billion and was listed in "Fortune Magazine" as one of the fifty largest financial service companies. In 1972, Woodson succeeded Gus Wortham as the company's second chairman of the board and chief executive officer. In 1978, he retired, but kept an office went to work selling insurance policies for an additional 15 years. </p><p>In 1981, Woodson's wife, Grace, died after heart surgery. Woodson remarried Audrey Watson, an old friend whose husband had recently passed away. The two couples had known each other since their days in Chicago, fifty years before.</p><p>Woodson gave back to the Houston community very generously, donating funds to build the "Houston Post" building (currently the "Houston Chronicle" building at Hwy 59 and Loop 610), and working with many other Houston luminaries including Gus Wortham and Bill Hobby to faciliate the city's cultural growth. He also served as a regent for the University of Houston, as director for the Society for the Performing Arts, chairman of Houston's Chamber of Commerce, and founded Houston's Forum Club. He also served on the board of governors for Rice University, and also contributed financially to Rice during his lifetime and through his estate.

<p>John L. Margrave was born April 13, 1924 in Kansas City, Kansas. He served in the U.S. Army's Signal Corps from 1941 until 1968, on active duty from 1943 through 1946. Margrave earned his B.S. in Engineering Physics in 1948 and his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1950 from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, where he was a Summerfield Scholar and a Slosson Fellow. He spent twenty months as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Atomic Energy Commission in the Department of Chemistry at Berkeley from 1951 to 1952. He also was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1960.</p><p>Margrave taught Chemistry from 1952 to 1963 at the University of Wisconsin. He began his career at Rice University as a professor of chemistry in 1963. From 1967 through 1972 he was professor and chair of Rice's department of chemistry, and from 1972 until 1980 as dean of Advanced Studies and Research. In 1980 he was named vice-president of Advanced Studies and Research, a position he held until 1986. That year he was named the E. D. Butcher Professor of Chemistry, a title he kept until his death on December 18, 2003 from complications following heart surgery.</p><p>Margrave's laboratory at Rice University pioneered the following processes: synthetic studies of the carbine-analog SiF2; research in liquid metals at high temperatures through the electromagnetic levitation and heating of conducting samples coupled with high pressure drop calorimetry; a technique for X-ray powder diffraction studies of samples at high pressures; the use of high temperature mass spectroscopy to study fluorides, oxyfluorides, sulfides, and other species; low temperature reactions of metal atoms, dimers, and small clusters with H2O, ROH, R2O, NH3, CO, CO2, and other Lewis bases; reactions of elemental fluorine in low-temperature matrices and with oxides and nitrides; and studies of liquid metals by levitation techniques, including microgravity. Margrave's special fields of interest included High Temperature Chemistry; Fluorine Chemistry; Optical, Infrared, ESR, Matrix-Isolation and Mass Spectrometry; High Pressure Chemistry; Thermochemistry; and Levitation Calorimetry. He was the recipient of numerous awards, including an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, an American Chemical Society Award in Fluorine Chemistry, and a Kiekhofer Memorial Teaching Award. He was included in Who's Who in America's 1976-1977 edition. Margrave belonged to numerous professional societies such as the American Chemical Society, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Institute of Chemists, and the American Society for Mass Spectrometry. He authored more than 800 publications and was editor of the journal High Temperature Science from 1968 through at least 1995 and Refractory Materials Science from 1976 to 1977. From 1970 through 1976 he also co-edited the Materials Science and Technology Series and, from 1975 to 1976, the Proceedings of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry. In addition, Margrave was a member of a number of editorial boards, including the Journal of Physical Chemistry, Annual Review of Physical Chemistry, and Advances in High Temperature Chemistry. Additionally, Margrave served on many advisory committees, including the Advisory Committee for Reactor Chemistry at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Materials Research Council, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Advisory Panel for Space Processing.</p><p>During his career at Rice University Margrave served as chairman of the Committee on the Undergraduate Curriculum for 1965-1971 and the Graduate Council from 1972-1986. In addition he served on the University Council from 1972-1986, the Research Council 1971-1986, the Tenure Review Committee from 1972-1986, and the Committee on Affirmative Action from 1969-1985, which he chaired from 1969-1973. Other committees upon which Margrave served included the University Space Committee from 1980-1986 and the Graduate House Advisory Committee from 1983-1986. Margrave also became director of the Rice Design Center in 1972 and was a member of the Rice Quantum Institute beginning in 1979. He was also president and then director of Sigma Xi, the scientific research society, from 1986 until 1992.</p><p>Margrave delivered numerous international lectures and served as a consultant to many industries and government entities, including the Argonne National Laboratory, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and the Solar Energy Research Institute. He established Marchem, Incorporated, a consulting firm and research lab, and was involved with the Houston Area Research Center (HARC) and the Gulf Universities Research Consortium (GURC). He married Mary Lou Davis, granddaughter of a former Kansas governor, in 1950.</p><p>The Gulf Universities Research Consortium (GURC) was formed in 1965. It was an interdisciplinary collaboration between industries and Gulf of Mexico universities designed to further research and development capabilities. Businesses such as Arco Oil and Gas Company, the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation, and Dresser Industries often co-sponsored research projects. GURC relied on the expertise of knowledgeable professionals in economics, chemistry, anthropology, agri-economics, and ecology. The organization's founders specifically worked to develop programs and research that were in the public interest or of common concern to its members and affiliates. Affiliates included the University of Alabama, Tulane University, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Miami. The last correspondence related to GURC, dated 1983, indicates that the consortium disbanded sometime after that date.</p><p>The Houston Area Research Center (HARC) was an independent, non-profit corporation established to undertake studies associated with the development of new and emerging technologies. In addition, the corporation sought to carry out research focusing on the social, economic, and environmental consequences of alternate technologies, and to provide a setting for research and technology-related learning through workshops, seminars, and conferences. HARC was formed by a partnership of Rice University, the University of Houston, and Texas A&amp;M University. It grew to include the University of Texas at Austin. It promoted the economic growth of east Texas and focused its attention on developing applied research centers such as the Laser Application Research Center, the Advanced Studies Institute, the National Dynamic Test Center, and the Technological Support for Health Systems center. While no definitive date for the beginning of HARC is located in the collection, it appears that it began operations in 1980. The last dated correspondence in the Margrave papers related to HARC is 1989.</p><p>High Temperature Science began publication in 1969. It was formed to foster the theoretical and practical uses of high temperature science. Margrave was one of its initial incorporators. He served as its editor from 1969 until at least 1995, the last year for which material was found in the collection. In 1975 it became known as High Temperature Science and Energy Technology and later as High Temperature and Materials Science. Academic Press originally published the journal, but lack of subscriptions caused that press to cease sponsoring publication. In 1977 Humana Press took over as publisher.</p><p>Margrave formed Marchem, Incorporated in 1969. The company started as a direct result of Margrave's and his chemistry associates' experimentation and development of CFX—a high temperature lubricant incorporating the fluorination of carbon (thus, the CF). Marchem's beginning goal was to produce and sell CFX samples. Marchem also operated as a consulting firm and research lab with expertise in high temperature chemistry. In addition, the company helped develop the LaMar process (a combination of the names of its developers—Margrave and Dr. R. J. Lagow, another Rice chemist). The process produced a product known as "FluoroKote," a fluorinated coating for plastics and rubbers. Both of these developments made possible the creation or improvement of many new products such as wax paper, surgical gloves, inner tubes, and rubber washers.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Rice University's Department of Fine Arts was established as part of Architecture in 1959 and James Chillman acted as the temporary chairman. Mr. William Caudill took over this job in 1961. In the early 1960's the Fine Arts Department (changed to the Department of Art and Art History in 1978) consisted of several courses in drawing, painting, sculpture, and art history. The faculty at that time was made up of Charles Schorre, David Parsons, Katherine Brown, and James Chillman as well as Jasper Rose, an Englishman who taught painting and art history. Eleanor Evans came in 1964 to teach a basic design course for freshmen architects. During that time the department offered neither a degree nor a major in fine arts. It served as a service department for the entire University to provide electives for all students. Sandy Havens, director of the Rice Players, requested he be assigned to the Fine Arts Department instead of the English Department.</p><p>At that time the Department was housed in the basement of Fondren Library with studio courses being taught in a temporary metal building at the base of the track stadium. In 1968, the Department moved to Allen Center where the first art gallery was established. During the first years, important exhibits included drawings of Dorothy Hood and photographs of Geoff Winningham. It was decided to begin building a permanent collection. The department moved to their new quarters in Sewall Hall in the early 1970's. There they had classrooms, studios and offices.</p><p>In 1969 Dominique and John de Menil left the sponsorship of the Art History Department and gallery at the University of St. Thomas and proposed moving these activities to Rice University. The move of the entire Art Department, collection and staff, was completed and the de Menil's Institute for the Arts at Rice was born. The Institute sponsored exhibits and published catalogs of national and international interest.</p><p>In 1965 John O'Neil was asked to become Chairman of the Department of Fine Arts. He accepted on the basis of being 'acting' chairman since it was not certain what the situation would be. In 1967 he decided to accept a permanent appointment at Rice. When the de Menil merger was completed, he continued as Chairman and Mrs. de Menil was the director of the Institute for the Arts.</p><p>In 1965 a proposal was made for an undergraduate major in Fine Arts at Rice University. In the 1970's and 1980's a Master of Arts degree in history of art and 5th year bachelors degree in studio were offered.</p><p>Parts excerpted from "The Cornerstone," published by the Rice Historical Society, Winter/Spring 2001.

<p>The Kirby Petroleum Company/George Sawtelle records offers a glimpse into the early 20th century oil boom in Texas primarily through the correspondence of George Sawtelle, who served as president of the company for more than 20 years. Sawtelle died September 4, 1967.</p><p>The origin of the <emph render="bold">Kirby Petroleum Company</emph> can be traced back to 1921 when John Henry Kirby, a pioneer in the development of the Houston business community, formed Kirby Petroleum Company, an oil and gas exploration and development company. Kirby Petroleum Company operated as a Houston-based independent oil and gas exploration and development company until 1956 when, after the sale of its producing properties, the remaining non-producing acreage was merged with three other independent oil and gas companies to form Kirby VenSyn Petroleum Company, a publicly traded company. As a result of the mergers, the Murchison family of Dallas, later noted for its ownership of the Dallas Cowboys, owned approximately 35 percent of Kirby. Kirby VenSyn Petroleum Company changed its name to Kirby Petroleum Co. in 1957 and adopted the name Kirby Industries, Inc. in 1967. As of 2005, the company, still based in Houston, is known as Kirby Corp. although its primary business is transporting bulk liquid products on the Mississippi River System and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.

During World War I, he served in France in the Seventh Field Artillery Brigade and rose to the rank of captain. His brigade commander thought highly enough of the young captain to write Sawtelle a letter stating that he had been recommended for promotion to major. That letter is located in box 5, folder 4. From 1920 to 1921, Sawtelle, a longtime football enthusiast, served as an assistant football coach at Northwestern University. He joined Kirby Petroleum Company in 1922. In 1924, he was the general manager and chief geologist of the company. Eventually, he rose to the presidency of the company, a position he held for more than 20 years.

<p>Ruth Young McGonigle was born on April 5th, 1902 in Spindletop, Texas. After graduating from Houston High School in 1918, she entered the Rice Institute to take art classes, but ended up studying architecture instead. </p><p>In 1924, McGonigle was the first woman to graduate from Rice with a B.S. in Architecture. After graduation, she worked for William Ward Watkin, who was not only a Houston architect, but also a professor at Rice. McGonigle worked under his tutelage until she married former classmate, George McGonigle Jr., on September 29, 1925. She then settled in her husband's hometown of Brownsville and began her own practice.</p><p>McGonigle was particularly known for recognizing Brownsville's unique historical architecture and incorporating that style in her own work. Her sensitivity to19th century Creole building tradition is evident in her designs for the Brown-Young house and Hert house in Rio Viejo. Although she designed mainly single-family homes, her artistry could also be found in public buildings like the St. Paul's Episcopal Mission and the Brownsville Art League Museum. During the 1950's, she also designed floats for Brownsville's annual Charro Days parades. Ruth was not only one of the first female architects to work in the lower Rio Grande Valley, but also one of the founders of the Brownsville Art League. Throughout the last decades of her life, McGonigle worked with the Brownsville Historical Association to document the city's architectural heritage. </p><p>She and her husband had two children. Her husband was killed in a plane accident on July 2, 1954. Ruth Y.

<p> In 1987, Rice president George Rupp formed a Commission on Women to investigate matters related to working women at Rice. Following an election, he appointed sixteen women from the faculty and staff to serve on the commission, which accepted the following charge: "The Commission will explore and evaluate issues relating to Rice women, especially in areas where inequities may exist, formulate specific recommendations to the Administration based upon its analysis, and educate the Rice community about behaviors and attitudes that operate to the detriment of women. The ultimate goal of the Commission will be to ensure a positive environment for women on campus." </p><p> The Commission, chaired by Professor Hally Beth Poindexter, set up task forces to study campus visibility, salaries, hiring practices, promotion and employee review practices, campus climate, benefits, and policies related to part-time employment. Over a hundred volunteers, both women and men, worked on the task forces, which met as often as weekly. However, before the task forces went into action the Commission felt it needed to address an immediate issue, the summer working conditions of college maintenance employees; an ad hoc subcommittee was formed in August 1987 and its report was issued September 1987. </p><p> The report of the Commission on Women 1987-88 consists of a summary report plus the reports of the seven task forces. The Commission also made recommendations, organized according to the individuals or departments responsible, so that each administrator can see the recommendations from the various task forces that would apply to his or her office or function. </p><p> In April and May 1989, Commission members met with three deans and the provost to discuss and take notes on the latters' "ideas for the future role of the Women's Commission, issues that needed clarification, and future problems that they could anticipate." In the spring of 1990 the Commission sent a memo to vice presidents and deans summarizing the Commission's five themes deemed to be of utmost importance of women on the Rice Campus and asking the VP's and Deans to identify "both general and specific points of progress and programs that have addressed these deficiencies, " which they did, some at length. </p><p> In September 1990, some of the original Commission members stayed on and others phased out, to allow for a mix of new blood and continuity of experience. </p><p>The Commission continued for several years thereafter. In the early 1990s, the Commission analyzed issues as child care needs for employees and students, and suggested creating an on-campus facility. During the mid-1990s under President Malcolm Gillis' direction, the Commission revisited the original 1988 report to determine whether recommendations and concerns were addressed by Rice University since that time. </p><p>Recently, President David W. Leebron established a new advisory group that will counsel the president and provost on issues facing women faculty. Based on the findings of a 2003 report of the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee, the report indicated a favorable campus-wide climate, however women faculty expressed lower degrees of satisfaction than men on most measures. The 2003 report is included in the collection. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Green's Texas Brigade was a cavalry brigade ordered to Louisiana to support Vicksburg and Port Hudson, crucial Confederate posts on the Mississippi River. Green's Texas Brigade had been formed by former Arizona militia forced out of the Arizona territory by the Union's "California Column". Green's Brigade was assigned the task of preventing Union incursions into Texas from the sea, the west, and the east. After successfully preventing the Union Army from capturing Galveston, Green's Brigade was ordered to Louisiana. Upon returning to Louisiana, Green's brigade was rejoined by Herbert's Battalion and General Sibley, all under the command of General Richard Taylor. Under General Taylor's command, Green's Brigade was meant to divert Union attention from the besieged forts of Vicksburg and Port Hudson. After this failed attempt Union forces entered Louisiana placing General Taylor's men, including Green's Brigade, on the front lines of the war. This campaign to prevent Union forces from taking control of Louisiana is referred to as the Bayou Teche campaign. The Union goal in the campaign was to trap Confederate forces between the Bayou Teche and the Atchafalaya River. It was during this campaign that a small detachment of Company H of Green's Texas Brigade encountered the 2nd Illinois in the outskirts of Iberia, Louisiana. The officers of the company attempted without success to rally their troops to fight the charging Illinois cavalry. The retreating Confederates were then either "sabered", using James Henry Tevis's words, or captured.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Kezia Payne DePelchin, Texas nurse, social worker and teacher, was born in the Madeira Islands and moved to Texas at the age of eight. Her father died shortly thereafter, and she was raised and educated by his second wife, an English governess. She gained resistance to yellow fever in 1839 when she survived the disease that killed two siblings and weakened her father, and volunteered as a nurse during the Houston epidemics of 1852, 1854, 1858, and 1867. After her marriage during the U.S. Civil War failed, she lived with a minister's family and participated in charitable activities with women from Houston's elite families. </p><p>In 1878, she traveled to Memphis, Tennessee from her home in Houston to assist the Howard Association during a yellow fever epidemic known as the Yellow Jack, and worked as a volunteer nurse from August 30 until mid-November. Her devotion to volunteer work was based in her strong religious and charitable sentiments. Though she was well respected in Houston, Memphis society viewed DePelchin's work as a violation of their expectations of a woman's proper place. She traveled as a volunteer nurse though Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, following the epidemic, then returned home to Houston in November of 1878. She spent many years as a teacher and matron of an orphanage in Houston. </p><p>In the late 1800's, she took three unwanted babies into a Houston house that, supported by DePelchin and charitable donations, eventually developed into a haven for orphans. In 1893 she officially named the house "Faith Home", but died three months later from a fever. After the turn of the century, the facility was rebuilt and is now known as the DePelchin Children's Center. </p> </bioghist>

<p>William Allen Haynes (1873-1953?), a native of Bell County, Texas, came from ranching stock. He carried on the family tradition and by the turn of the century was an established rancher. As oil became increasingly lucrative adjunct to ranching, Haynes together with his brother Robert branched out into oil well drilling and leasing oil lands. Haynes, like most ranchers, suffered ups and downs of the cattle market, from difficulties with transporting his cattle, and from the vagaries of weather. Despite these problems, he managed to stay solvent and even make money during the 1920's. One reason for his solvency was that he was never simply a rancher, but derived additional income from oil and investments in real estate. In 1928 Haynes was named a director of the struggling First National Bank of Killeen, and he became president of the bank just in time for the Great Depression. His Bank limped along through the early 1930's as Haynes and the other officers and directors of the bank reduced capitalization and discussed possible liquidation. About 1935 Haynes left banking and focused his energies on ranching and land speculation. </p><p>As he grew older, the scope of his activities became increasingly limited, but he maintained an active interest in ranching well into his 70's. Haynes' life was not strictly business however. He was interested in politics and although never serving in an elected position, he often acted as an election judge in his precinct or campaigned for the Democratic Party. Among his political friends were Miriam and Jim Ferguson who both served as Governor of Texas. Parrie and Allen apparently did not have children, but they were very close to their nieces and nephews. Haynes also provided a guiding hand and monetary support for his brothers who were never quite the businessman he was. In later life, as Haynes suffered from sickness and various ailments his familial loyalty paid off, as his family took care of him in his weakened state. In 1952 his last letter was received and in 1959 his collection was donated to Rice University. His actual death occurred at some point between 1952 and 1959. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Thomas W. Hotchkiss, a lawyer, editor, magazine writer, and professional researcher, was a member of the Campaign Committee of the Men's League for Woman Suffrage of the State of New York, which was active in promoting the passage of a women's suffrage amendment to the state constitution. In November of 1915, referenda for women's suffrage were on the ballot in four eastern states, including New York, but the opposition was strong. Many claimed that if given the right to vote, women would neglect their homes, and the fabric of society would be destroyed. The opposition also argued that undesirable women would flood the polls, and that a woman should not be allowed to vote if she wasn't willing to fight for her country. To help organize a response to the arguments against women's suffrage, Hotchkiss sent a form letter, dated September 27, 1915, to public officials in the states that had already adopted women's suffrage. While the response from the public officials was favorable, suffrage for women was again denied in the November 2, 1915 election. The New York Men's League for Woman Suffrage continued to campaign until New York passed the measure in 1917, three years before a national Constitutional Amendment granted suffrage to all American women.</p> </bioghist>

<p>A group of Houston women residing in the Woodland Heights neighborhood founded a club in 1909, initially calling it "The 26 Club," so named (according to tradition) because their modest homes could accommodate up to 26 guests. To their chagrin, they later discovered that this was also the name of a saloon on Houston Avenue, and promptly changed their name to "The 26 Literary Club" (which for archival purposes has been re-phrased as "The Twenty-Six Literary Club"). The daughters of a number of the original members became students at Rice Institute (later University) after it opened in 1912 and continued the Club, which over time was expanded and, along with its social activities, assumed various philanthropic projects, including providing scholarships for young women entering Rice.</p> </bioghist>

<p>William Marsh Rice was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 14, 1816. He was the third of ten children born to David and Patty Hall Rice. Little is known about Rice's childhood but records indicate that he worked for a while as a shopkeeper in Springfield before deciding to move to Texas in 1838.</p><p>Rice started out in business as a merchant in Houston, Texas. His first business partnership with a Barnabas Haskill was formed in 1840 but dissolved by 1842. In 1844 Rice became a commission and forwarding merchant in partnership with Ebenezer B. Nichols, a Houston businessman. By 1850 Rice's siblings began to follow him to Houston and assisted in his ventures. On June 29, 1850 Rice married Margaret Bremond whose father Paul was one of Rice's many business partners. In the census of 1860, Rice is listed as having $750,000 in real and personal property, making him one of the wealthiest men in Texas at the time.</p><p>At least 15 enslaved people were included as Rice's property in 1860. According to county deed records and newspaper advertisements, Rice purchased, sold, and accepted mortgages on enslaved people; he also attempted to recapture enslaved people who fled him. In addition to extending credit to slaveowners who leveraged enslaved people as collateral, Rice also bought and sold cotton as a substantial portion of his antebellum business.
Rice served on a secession committee in Houston after the 1860 presidential election, and during the Civil War, Rice and his wife Margaret raised money for Confederate soldiers. On August 13, 1863, Margaret Rice died, possibly from cholera or yellow fever. Shortly after his wife's death, Rice went to Monterrey, Mexico and stayed there until August of 1865 when he returned to Houston. In Monterrey, Rice smuggled cotton and manufactured goods across the Texas-Mexico border. Later in the summer of 1865, he went to Massachusetts for business and did not return to Houston until 1866. On June 26, 1867 Rice married for a second time. His second wife was Julia Elizabeth Baldwin Brown, a widow and a daughter of Horace Baldwin, one of the early mayors of Houston. Elizabeth's sister Charlotte was the wife of William's younger brother Frederick.</p><p>Rice and his second wife moved to New Jersey to live with Rice's sister Charlotte and her family. Rice and his wife divided their time between New York City and New Jersey with occasional trips to Houston to oversee business.
During one of the Rices' visits to Houston, he was approached by Cesar Maurice Lombardi, who was interested in building a high school in Houston. Rice had been interested in endowing an educational institute of some kind, having revised his will twice previously to include a school for needy boys, first in New Jersey, then in New York City. After the meeting with Lombardi, Rice decided to fund an institute of higher learning in Houston. On May 19, 1891 the charter for the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art was incorporated in Austin, Texas. Captain James Addison Baker, William's brother Frederic, Houston businessmen Emanuel Raphael, Cesar Lombardi, James E. McAshan and Alfred S. Richardson were named as the first board of trustees.</p><p>In article two of the charter: "(t)he objects, intents, and purposes of this Institution are declared to be the establishment and maintenance, in the City of Houston, Texas, of a Public Library, and the maintenance of an Institution for the Advancement of Literature, Science, Art, Philosophy and Letters; the establishment and maintenance of a Polytechnic school; for procuring and maintaining scientific collections; collections of chemical and philosophical apparatus, mechanical and artistic models, drawings, pictures and statues; and for cultivating other means of instruction ..." The charter also required that the Institute only accept white students, which was changed in 1965. The institute was initially endowed with a promissory note for $200,000 to be paid upon Rice's death. Rice revised his will on September 26, 1896 and left the bulk of his estate to his namesake institute.</p><p>During the battle over the estate two lawyers became involved with the proceedings and would end up greatly influencing the final results. Captain Baker, a trustee of the Rice Institute, served as William Rice's lawyer. Albert Patrick, the other lawyer, was hired by Orren Holt in 1898 to investigate the residency question in New York City. There Patrick met Charlie Jones, Rice's valet. The two spent a great deal of time together and slowly a plan was formed. At first it seemed that Patrick was only interested in the settlement of the contested will and was looking for any way to win. He convinced Jones, in the spring of 1900, to start poisoning Rice with mercury pills as a way to avoid a court battle. By the summer of 1900 Patrick came up with the idea to forge a will that left the majority of Rice's estate to himself and small sums to relatives and friends. The forged will was dated June 30, 1900.</p><p>On September 8, 1900 a hurricane struck the Gulf Coast and one of Rice's businesses, the Merchants and Planters Oil Company, suffered severe damage. The business manager telegraphed that they needed money for repairs and the sum was most of what Rice had available in his bank account. Patrick was worried at the loss of such a large sum of ready cash and he convinced Jones to use chloroform to kill Rice. On September 23, 1900 Rice was murdered by Jones. Patrick, in his haste to get hold of Rice's cash, tried to withdraw money from Rice's bank using a check forged by Jones right after Rice's death. The bank refused to honor the check since Patrick's name was spelled incorrectly. When calling to verify the check with Rice, the bank learned that he was dead. Since the circumstances were suspicious, the bank contacted Rice's Houston lawyer, Captain Baker.</p><p>When Baker arrived in New York City, he learned there had been a new will written up by Patrick. Baker was suspicious of the will since Rice had never notified him of any changes to the one Baker had drawn up on September 26, 1896. This suspicion led to a long and sensational trial where Patrick's version of the will was exposed as a forgery and the scheme to kill Rice was discovered. Patrick was found guilty of murder and forgery on March 26, 1902 and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. Jones, who confessed to his part of the events, ended up being released despite being the one who had actually committed the murder. Patrick's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the governor of New York, but eventually won a full pardon in 1912.</p><p>On February 6, 1902 Orren Holt settled the suit over Elizabeth's will for $200,000. After the trials and settlement, Captain Baker and the original Board of Trustees set about fulfilling Rice's dream to have an institute for higher learning in Houston, Texas. To guide them, the trustees chose as first president, a young mathematician and astronomer at Princeton University named Edgar Odell Lovett, who signed on as president in 1908. Lovett had earned doctorates both from the Universities of Virginia and Leipzig and had taught at Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago, and Princeton, the most innovative American universities of the time. The trustees sent him on a worldwide tour of the "competition," where he interviewed faculty, inspected facilities, and developed an inspired vision of what might be accomplished on the plains of Texas with a blank-check charter, a generous endowment, and high ambitions. The goal was a university "of the highest grade" that kept "the standards up and the numbers down." Lovett shaped the university that Rice would become.</p><p>The Rice Institute opened on September 23, 1912, the anniversary of Mr. Rice's murder, with 77 students and a dozen faculty. An international academic festival celebrated the opening three weeks later, a spectacular event that brought Rice to the attention of the entire scholarly world. Four years later, at the initial commencement, 35 bachelor degrees and one master's degree were awarded, with the first doctorate conferred in 1918.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Americas collection strives to represent the full range and complexity of the Americas. Thomas Jefferson famously observed that "America has a hemisphere to itself," and the founding fathers agreed that gaining influence in Spanish America "piece by piece" was essential to the U.S. Conversely, Latin American nations like Brazil, Cuba, Nicaragua, and El Salvador used the American Revolution as a touchstone for their own nation formations, even as they aspired to shape the U.S. democratic model to their own needs.</p><p>This story of national exchange and influence across the hemisphere will be more fully told through this archive which brings together key documents. Currently scholars interested in telling this rich story must travel, for example, between the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and the Cuban Society of Historical and International Study in Havana. A notable exception is the University of Maryland's Early Americas Digital Archive, which invites scholars to submit their editions of early Americas texts for digital publication. Its historical range of 1492 to 1800 makes it an ideal future partner for Rice's initiative, which begins with the heyday of nation formation from 1776 to 1815 and ends with the building of the Panama Canal in the early twentieth century.</p><p>This archive will allow us to understand, for example, why Brazilian insurgents owned and read copies of the American Declaration of Independence as well as works by Jefferson and Thomas Paine; why José Martí found the U.S. system of governance a rich source of commentary and critique for Cuban independence efforts; and why Fidel Castro quoted the American Declaration of Independence and likened the burning of cane fields to the Boston Tea Party during his 1958 take over of Cuba. But such an archive will also allow us to think in new ways about the U.S. American story. It will show us, for example, that U.S. slaves escaped South as well as North, establishing communities throughout Spanish America during the U.S. antebellum period. Such an archive, in short, brings into sharp focus the overlapping national stories of the hemisphere.</p><p>Historical sketch excerpted from text courtesy of Dr. Caroline Levander, Humanities Research Center, Rice University.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Julian Sorell Huxley</emph>, the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley and great-nephew of Matthew Arnold, was born June 22, 1887. The union of the Huxley and Arnold families brought about a happy combination of what Julian's younger brother Aldous would call "blue genes", but the combined family traditions also imposed an obligation of intellectual excellence and social responsibility. This obligation was keenly felt by Julian Huxley from an early age. It was enhanced by his affinity for the interests which had earned his grandfather his place in the history of science, and thus, it soon became apparent that young Julian would be Thomas Huxley's intellectual heir as well as his grandson. This inheritance would prove both a joy and a burden, for while Julian Huxley achieved great renown as a scientist and popularizer of science, he was plagued, like his grandfather, by serious and debilitating attacks of depression. In spite of this he was able, throughout a long career, to contribute significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and to act effectively as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism.</p><p>He was educated at Eton and Oxford, where he followed his own inclinations and his grandfather's example by studying Natural Science. His scientific interests were combined with literary talents which were officially recognized in 1908, when he was awarded the Newdigate Prize for English Verse at Oxford, an honor which he remembered with pride even after a lifetime of honors and accomplishments. (It is note-worthy and characteristic that he spent his prize money on a microscope.)</p><p>After completing his schooling, he began his career at the institution which had taught him: in 1910, he became a lecturer in Zoology at Oxford. Two years later, however, he departed from the course traditional to a young man of his academic interests and social background. He left England and Oxford to accept a position as Research Associate at the newly established Rice Institute in Houston, Texas, and by 1913 he had become Assistant Professor of Biology there. He remained in Houston until 1916 when he returned to Europe to take part in World War I.</p><p>After serving as an army intelligence officer in Italy, he came home to marry and to take up a position as Senior Demonstrator in Zoology at Oxford. From 1919 to 1925 he remained at Oxford, carrying out his famous axolotl experiments and participating in the university's expedition to Spitsbergen. In 1925 he became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London. But he did not remain long in that position. The following year he made a decision which, like his decision to teach at the Rice Institute, would move him away from the path followed by most of his fellow scientists. He accepted the invitation of H.G. Wells to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life, and in 1927 resigned his position at King's College. This meant a new direction for his career, for although he was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution from 1927 to 1929, after that he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues.</p><p>In 1935 he accepted the position of Secretary of the Zoological Society of London. In this capacity he had the means to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. Unfortunately his leadership aroused the displeasure of some members of the Society, and in 1942 he resigned under pressure. He continued, however, his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program.</p><p>The end of the war brought an opportunity for him to put many of his cherished ideals and projects into practice. True to family tradition, he had always viewed science, art and literature as part of a great whole. Thus when he became a member of the commission formed to plan what would become Unesco, he ensured that science would be an integral part of the educational and cultural institution. When in 1946 he became Unesco's first Director-General, he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He even went so far as to advocate his own solution to the troubling questions of modern society, his "religion" of scientific humanism, as an official basis for Unesco's philosophy. This he himself came later to find unwise. During his tenure as Director-General he also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. Finally, he came to stress even more strongly than before his optimistic belief that mankind can and should take control of its own environmental and biological destiny.</p><p>In 1948 his term of office with Unesco came to an end and Huxley was once again a private citizen. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted: evolutionary theory and its significance for potential human development, ecology and the preservation of wildlife and population control. He was honored often for his contributions to science and to society, receiving prizes and awards for his efforts in helping the general public to better understand contemporary scientific thought. In 1958 he received a knighthood. In 1965, in a culmination of work he began in his youth with his field studies of the behavior of the great crested grebe, he organized a Royal Society Symposium on the Ritualization of Behavior in Animals and Man, and in 1970 he received the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to scientific research related to conservation.</p><p>On February 14, 1975, at the age of 87, Sir Julian Huxley died. His life had been long, beginning in the Victorian era and ending in a world which his grandfather could scarcely have imagined. He served many of the causes with which the 20th century will no doubt become identified, and his influence on the development of contemporary biological science was considerable. Through his field studies of animal behavior and his synthetic approach to Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics, he helped determine the direction of modern biology. As an educator his influence was incalculable, for he taught not only such men as E.B. Ford and A.C. Hardy, but through his writings, perhaps millions of men and women as well. He was, moreover, known for his encouragement of aspiring scientists and scholars. In his catholic interests, in his belief in the interrelationship of science and arts, he extended his influence beyond the laboratory of the classroom and reached artists, writers, musicians, politicians and finally the general public. Such interests and such influence indicate that his desire to be known as one to whom <emph render="italic">"nothing human and nothing in external nature was alien"</emph> was fulfilled.</p><p><emph render="bold">Juliette Huxley:</emph> Lady Marie Juliette Baillot was born in Auvernier, Switzerland, in a village near Lake Neuchâtel, on December 6, 1896, and moved to England at the age of nineteen to work as a French teacher for Ottoline Morrell. At Garsington, Morrell's home, she met numerous guests including Aldous Leonard Huxley (ALH) and Julian Huxley. Julian and Juliette began courting in 1916, and corresponded throughout 1917 and 1918 while Julian served in the Army Service Corps and Army Intelligence during World War I. The two were married in 1919. Their first son, Anthony, was born in 1920, and their second, Francis, in 1923. Juliette followed Julian in his tenures at King's College and the Royal Institute in London during the 1920s and until 1931, when Julian resigned. During Julian's term as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London from 1935 until 1942, Juliette loved living in their home at the London Zoo. She enjoyed walking among the animals and hearing them at night. In 1946 the couple moved to Paris while Julian Huxley served as Director-General of UNESCO.</p><p>Juliette Huxley traveled extensively with her husband throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. She later published Wild Lives of Africa (1963), which was based on her experiences traveling with Julian during 1960 and 1961. The two eventually returned to London, where Julian died in 1975. Juliette Huxley continued living in London, surrounded by her own sculptures and the artwork of their numerous friends from over the years. She continued writing as well, publishing her autobiography Leaves of the Tulip Tree in 1986. She also continued to take notice of advancements in the fields in which her husband was interested, including biology, conservation, humanism, and social evolution. Juliette Huxley's brother-in-law (and Nobel Prize winner), Aldous Huxley and her two sons, among other life-long acquaintances, frequently visited her. Her son Anthony died in 1992, which affected her own health. Juliette Huxley died on September 28, 1994.</p> </bioghist>

The members of this group consisted of the President (chairman), the Provost, the Dean of the Institute, the Dean of Humanities, the Dean of Engineering, and six members elected by the Faculty. A re-organization took place again, in 1971, in conjunction with the formation of a University Council. At this point changes were made in the Faculty Council's membership and its mission. Membership now consisted of eight Faculty members elected to serve on the University Council along with eight other Faculty members elected to serve only on the Faculty Council. Their mission was re-defined to initiate studies and examine proposals submitted by faculty members. Most other University matters were to be dealt with by the University Committees and the University Council. In fact, this change shifted greater responsibility to the newly formed University Council and gave the Faculty Council the mission of the now defunct Committee on University Welfare.</p> </bioghist>

Originally, the entire Faculty, headed by the President of the Institute made all the academic and policy decisions. With a growing number of Faculty members this was no longer feasible and committees were formed to meet the changing needs of the University. Input from the general Faculty was directed to these committees and the committees, in turn, reported their findings to the general Faculty. Decision making also was channeled through committees, earlier through the Executive committee, and more recently through the University Council. The committee, rather than the individual Faculty member, now serves as the advisory body to the President.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The national Phi Beta Kappa Society, America's oldest and most prestigious honor society, was founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. Membership in the national society is a significant achievement, which honors excellence in the arts and sciences. Election to Phi Beta Kappa is based on outstanding academic performance reflecting a love of learning for its own sake as opposed to narrow technical specialization or vocational preparation. To demonstrate the breadth of their intellectual curiosity, most students will have taken more than the required number of courses and studied in traditional academic fields outside their major.</p><p>The Beta Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at Rice was founded in 1929.

Rice had long hosted major world figures—General Pershing; Presidents (or presidents-to-be) Taft, Hoover, Eisenhower, Kennedy (announcing the goal of going to the moon), Johnson, Carter, Reagan; Sir Harold Wilson; Prince Philip; and the Dalai Lama suggest the range of famous visitors. But never had such an assemblage appeared at one time as during the Economic Summit. Alumni around the globe were thrilled to see on television world political leaders walking through the familiar arches of Lovett Hall.</p><p>Excerpted from Dr. John Boles' "A University So Conceived: A Brief History of Rice" (Revised Edition), 1997, p. 81.</p> </bioghist>

<p>On June 2, 1992, Dr. Richard J. Stoll, Director for the Center for the Study of Institutions and Values, as well as a professor of Political Science, sent a memo to then Rice President George Rupp. In this memo, Stoll suggested that Rice approach then Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the beginnings of a "James Baker Institute". Rupp responded favorably to Stoll's memo and thus the Baker Institute was born.</p><p>On March 31, 1993, Secretary Baker gave a speech accepting Rice's offer of an Institute in his honor. While at Rice where he laid down his ideas on the Baker Institute. In this speech, entitled "Ideas Into Action", in which he charged the Baker Institute to "draw together statesmen, scholars and students...and...build a bridge between the world of ideas and the world of action..." These founding words were later used as the building stones for the external architecture of the building.</p><p>Between 1993 and 1994, the Baker Institute was coordinated by John Rogers, former undersecretary for management at the Department of State. In August 1994, Rice appointed a Founding Director for the Institute, distinguished diplomat Ambassador Edward P. Djerejian. Ambassador Djerejian served in this post until June 2022 and was replaced by David M. Satterfield. </p><p>On October 20, 1994 ground was broken on the Baker Hall building site. Four U.S. Presidents participated in the ceremony (Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush), setting the bipartisan tone that James A. Baker III had madated from the Institute's beginning. More information on the Institute's groundbreaking ceremony can be found in the Inagural Baker Institute report. This was a major step forward for the Institute. As the Founding Director noted: "...the building itself symbolizes, in both form and function, the integrative nature of the Baker Institute. Within its walls the faculty and students of Rice University will interact with visiting scholars and practitioners to address the major issues our nation faces in the future."</p><p>The First Associate Director for Academic Programs was selected in 1995 - Dr. Richard Stoll. In January 2001, Dr. Stoll resigned from that position to take on more responsibility as the Associate Dean of Social Sciences at Rice. The current Associate Director is Dr. Allen Matusow.</p><p>On October 17, 2003 the Baker Institute celebrated its 10th anniversary with a gala on Jamail Plaza.

<p>The Presidential Inaugural Committee is charged with the overall planning of the
presidential inauguration and the events surrounding it. Twenty-seven college presidents and
dignitaries from foreign institutions were in attendance. Karl T. Compton, president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivered the principal address, "Dynamic Education".
Harry C. Wiess, Vice chairman of the Rice Board of Trustees, inducted Houston into the
Office of President. Lee A. DuBridge, president of the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech), spoke at a luncheon in the Commons. At a dinner honoring the new president and
his wife, addresses were given by Carl M. Knapp, president of the Association of Rice Alumni
and by Houston industrialist Jesse H. Jones. Dr. Dixton Wecter, chairman of the Research
Group at the Huntington Library, presented a paper. </p>
<p>A precedent for future inaugurations was set when Dr. Houston placed on the steps of
William Marsh Rice's statue a wreath honoring the founder of the university. </p>
<p>William Vermillion Houston was born in Mount Giliad, Ohio, on January 19, 1900. He received
B.A. and B.S. degrees from Ohio State University in 1920. In 1922, he received an M.S.
degree from the University of Chicago, and in 1925, his Ph.D. from Ohio State University. </p>
<p>Houston was a National Research Fellow at the California Institute of Technology, and
taught there until he became president of what was then Rice Institute, later Rice
University, in 1946. Houston studied in Germany on a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1927,
assisting Warner Heisenberg and others in the development of quantum theory.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy awarded Houston its Medal of Merit for directing development of the first
homing torpedo and for supervising scientific studies which helped improve U.S. weapon
effectiveness in the area of undersea warfare. Because of his genuine modesty, Houston never
wore his Medal of Merit ribbon. </p>
<p>Houston made pioneering efforts in the fields of atomic spectroscopy and solid state
theory. He was the author of two books: "Principles of Mathematical Physics" (1934) and
"Principles of Quantum Mechanics" (1951), as well as of numerous scientific articles. After
having been a fellow of the American Physical Society for many years, he was elected its
president in 1962. He also served on the Society council.</p>
<p>Houston was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, serving on its council and on
several important committees. He was also a member of the American Philosophical Society and
several other scientific and educational associations. He served on the National Science
Board and as a trustee of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. </p>
<p>When Houston arrived at Rice in 1946, he greatly expanded graduate study and research. He
also initiated a five-year engineering program with greater emphasis on the humanities than
had previously existed, and implemented the planned residential college system.</p>
<p>Houston died after a brief illness, in Edinburgh, Scotland on August 22, 1968, while
attending the 111th International Conference on Low-tempurature Physics at St. Andrew's
University.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">William Ward Watkin</emph> was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 21, 1886. His parents were Fred W. Watkin and Mary Hancock Watkin. Watkin grew up in Pennsylvania, the home state of his mother's family. He graduated from Danville High School in 1903 and entered the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing the study of architecture under Paul Phillipe Cret. Following his graduation in 1908, Watkin spent one year traveling in Europe, principally in England.</p><p>Upon his return from Europe, Watkin joined the Boston office of Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, then one of the most prominent architectural firms in the United States. At the time of Watkin's employment, 1909, Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson had received the commission to produce a campus plan and to design the initial buildings of the Rice Institute in Houston, Texas.</p><p>Watkin worked on the development of both the campus plan and the building plan in the office; when construction was to begin, in the summer of 1910, Watkin was sent to Houston to serve as Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson's representative supervisor. In this capacity Watkin not only oversaw the construction of the initial Institute group--the Administration Building, the Mechanical laboratory and Powerhouse, and the North and South residence halls - but most of the Institute's subsequent development: the Physics laboratory (1913-1915), east Hall (1913-1914), West Hall (1915-1916), three proposed President's houses (1913, 1915, 1923-1924), the Field House (1920), the Chemistry Laboratory (1923-1925), a proposed Alumni Hall (1927), two proposed libraries (1927, 1940-1941), and the Founder's Statue (1927-1930). Watkin himself was to design the Faculty Club - Cohen House (1927), Rice Stadium (1938), and the Naval ROTC building (1941). He also served as consulting architect to Staub and Rather in the design and construction of the Fondren Library (1946-1949), M.D. Anderson Hall (1946-1947), and the Abercrombie Laboratory (1947-1948).</p><p>As supervising architect, Watkin worked closely with Dr. Edgar Odell Lovett, president of the Rice Institute. Lovett offered Watkin a faculty appointment and the Institute opened in the fall of 1912 with Watkin as instructor in architectural engineering. In the summer of 1916 he was made an assistant professor and in 1922 he became a full professor. In 1914 the architecture faculty expanded to two, and to three in 1915. Rice awarded the first professional degrees in architecture in 1917. Watkin's efforts to provide his students with a thorough course in architectural studies led him to organize a traveling fellowship in 1928. Watkin's academic duties were not restricted to the Architecture department. He was also Curator of Grounds, Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Buildings and Grounds, and Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Outdoor Sports, a position which resulted in his serving a term as president of the Southwest Conference in 1920. At the time of his sabbatical in the 1928-1929 academic year, Watkin resigned the athletic committee post. He remained, however, head of Buildings and Grounds, as his resignation of this post was not accepted by Dr. Lovett. During World War II, Watkin chaired the Committee on Air Raid protection and Civilian defense.</p><p>As early as 1912 Watkin was accepting independent architectural commissions. Between 1913 and 1915 he entered into partnership with George Endress of Austin, practicing under the name Endress and Watkin. This firm was dissolved at the end of 1919 and Watkin thereafter practiced under his own name. Also in 1919 Watkin ceased his affiliation with Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, though he continued to operate, on a commission basis, as supervisor for their Texas projects. In addition to practicing architecture, Watkin consulted on projects, and in 1933 he was appointed to the Board of Architectural Consultants, an advisory group connected with the design of the Federal Triangle in Washington, D.C.</p><p>During the teens and twenties, Watkin wrote articles for journals, primarily dealing with Houston, its growth and development, and the implications these held for the city's architecture. Watkin contributed descriptive pieces on the Rice Institute to Progressive Houston and the Southern Architectural Review, Houston's short-lived architectural magazine. Not until the late twenties did he become more involved in research and writing. In 1930 the Rice Institute Pamphlet published a series of lectures Watkin had given on the new architecture in Europe; Pencil Points reprinted these in 1931. Watkin wrote two additional essays for Pencil Points, one published in 1931 on new directions in ecclesiastical architecture, and another in 1932. This former essay was something of a prolegomena to Watkin's first book, The Church of Tomorrow published in 1936. In 1951 Watkin's second book, Planning and Building the Modern Church, was published. At the time of his death he was planning to write a book on architecture in Texas.</p><p>Watkin had numerous academic and professional associations. He was a member of the Houston Philosophical Society, the Texas Philosophical Society and the Houston Country Club. Watkin was a charter member of the Rice Institute Faculty Club. He had become a member of the American Institute of Architects in 1913, and was elected to the College of Fellows in 1949. Watkin was a communicant of Trinity Church.</p><p>William Ward Watkin died on June 24, 1952 from complications following surgery for a broken kneecap. He was survived by his wife, Josephine Cockrell Watkin, whom he had married in 1933. Watkin had previously been married to Annie Ray Townsend Watkin, who died in 1929. Their three children were Annie Ray Watkin Biehl Hoagland, Rosemary Watkin Barrick, and William Ward Watkin, Jr.</p><p>Excerpted from Stephen Fox's 1976 unpublished <emph render="italic">Guide to the Papers of William Ward Watkin in the Woodson Research Center of the Rice University</emph>.</p><p><emph render="bold">Ray Watkin Strange</emph> was born Annie Ray Watkin, May 11, 1915, in Houston, Texas.

Smith was given command of the frigate Diamond which he used to conduct partisan warfare along the French coast. He was captured in 1796 off Le Havre and imprisoned in the Temple, Paris. Two years later he escaped and returned to command the Tigre in Levant. The most famous episode in his career came in 1799 when he undertook the defence of Saint-Jean d'Acre (3 March–8 May) and heroically repulsed Napoleon.

<p><emph render="bold">Charles de Sousy Ricketts</emph> was born in Geneva, Switzerland on
October 2, 1866. He was known as a book designer, theatre designer, sculptor and painter.
His mother was musical; his father a painter of marine subjects. Ricketts spent his early
years in Lausanne and London and his youth at Boulogne and Amiens in France. After his
mother's death, he returned to London with his father and in 1882 entered the City and
Guilds Art School in Kennington, London, where he was apprenticed to Charles Roberts, a
prominent wood-engraver. His father died a year later and on his sixteenth birthday he met
his lifelong partner, Charles Haselwood Shannon.</p>
<p>Ricketts and Shannon founded an occasional art journal, <emph render="italic">The
Dial</emph> (1889-1897) and the two artists also began designing and illustrating books,
including <emph render="italic">Daphnis and Chloe </emph>(1893) and <emph render="italic">Hero and Leander</emph> (1894). Ricketts also worked for commercial publishers; his more
famous books include John Gray's <emph render="italic">Silverpoints </emph>(1893) and Oscar
Wilde's <emph render="italic">The Sphinx</emph> (1895).</p>
<p>In 1894 Ricketts met Llewellyn Hacon, a wealthy barrister, enabling him to realize his
dream of being a publisher and he set up the Vale Press (1896-1904). Ricketts designed three
fonts and numerous decorations and illustrations. After the closing of the Vale Press in
1904, he designed books for friends such as Katherine Bradley (1946-1914) and Edith Cooper
(1862-1913) (pseudonym Michael Field) and Gordon Bottomley (1874-1948).</p>
<p>In 1900, Ricketts took up painting and sculpture. He was elected Associate of the Royal
Academy in 1922 and Royal Academician in 1928. Ricketts also produced theatrical designs and
was involved in about forty productions, including George Bernard Shaw's <emph render="italic">St. Joan</emph>. He wrote several books on art and other subjects and
acted as art consultant to various individuals and institutions</p>
<p>He and Shannon also built up their own collection of paintings, drawings, and antiquities;
many are now at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and at the British Museum. Charles
Shannon, falling from a ladder, became disabled; this devastated Ricketts who died of a
heart attack in 1931 – six years before his friend.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Charles Haselwood Shannon</emph> was born in Lincolnshire on April 26,
1863. He attended St. John's School, Leatherhead (1873-1881) and then studied at the City
and Guilds Technical Art School, an extension of the Lambeth Art School (1881-1885). It was
there he met Charles Ricketts and it was the start of a lifelong friendship. By 1888, they
had devised a strategy for their joint career; Ricketts was to provide the income and
Shannon perfected his abilities as a painter. In 1897, Shannon sent two paintings and some
lithographs to Munich where he was awarded a gold medal. Shannon's self-portrait, <emph render="italic">The Man in the Black Shirt</emph> was completed that year.</p>
<p>Ricketts was the dominant figure in the artistic and literary circle that formed around
them in Chelsea (1888-1898) and then in Richmond (1898-1902). Joint activities included
their magazine, <emph render="italic">The Dial </emph>(1889-1897), design and illustration
of Oscar Wilde's books and wood-engravings for editions of <emph render="italic">Daphnis and
Chloe </emph>(1893) and <emph render="italic">Hero and Leander </emph>(1894). They set up
the Vale Press in 1896 complemented with a shop where work by Shannon and their friends
could be bought.</p>
<p>Shannon had his own lithographic press and he produced a number of works including <emph render="italic">A Lithograph in White Line </emph>(1891), <emph render="italic">
Summer</emph> (1892), and <emph render="italic">The Shepherd in a Mist</emph>. In
painting, his traditional technique, deriving from the Venetians and the English eighteenth
century, were the bases of his art. His works include an early success, <emph render="italic">The Lady with a Cyclamen </emph>(1899), a favorite sitter, Kathleen Bruce
(1878-1947), is seen as <emph render="italic">The Sculptress </emph>(1904) and in <emph render="italic">The Winged Hat.</emph></p>
<p>In 1902 Ricketts and Shannon returned to London to live in a flat in a block in Lansdowne
Road, Holland Park. Shannon became an active exhibitor, for example at the New English Art
Club and the International Society. He was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1911
and Royal Academician in 1920.</p>
<p>In January 1929 Shannon suffered a fall while hanging a picture in Townshend House, Regents
Park, where they had moved in 1923. He suffered brain damage and never fully recovered.
Ricketts sold some works to pay for nursing expenses and more went after Rickett's death in
1931. Charles Shannon died on March 18, 1937.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">George Cruikshank</emph>, born in London on September 27, 1792 to a
Scottish painter, Isaac Cruikshank, and his wife, was an English humorist and illustrator.
Briefly educated at Edgeware, he is considered by some to be one of the best humorists that
Britain ever produced. Cruikshank began his career as a political satirist but moved on to
become a book illustrator. He also had a late interest in oil painting, enrolling in the
Academy Schools as a student at the age of sixty-four. In his lifetime he created nearly
10,000 prints, illustrations, and plates. His early drawings often featured attacks on
Britain's royal family. In the 1820s his preoccupation with political caricature waned,
however, as he became more interested in theatrical caricatures and book illustrations.
Cruikshank produced some of his best-known work for Charles Dickens, beginning with <emph render="italic">Sketches by Boz </emph>, (1836) and reaching an apex with <emph render="italic">Oliver Twist</emph>, (1838). <emph render="italic">Grimm's Fairy
Tales</emph>, <emph render="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</emph>, <emph render="italic">Paradise Lost</emph>, and seven novels by William Harrison Ainsworth were among other
works he illustrated.</p>
<p>Cruikshank married Mary Ann Walker (1807-1849) on October 16, 1827. Two years after her
death, on March 7, 1851, he married Eliza Widdison. Later in his life, Cruikshank supported
the temperance movement, creating prints illustrating the evils of alcohol. Collections of
his works are in the British and the Victoria and Albert museums. George Cruikshank died
February 1, 1878.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Robert L. Patten</emph>, the Lynette S. Autrey Professor of Humanities
at Rice University, was born on April 26, 1939 in Oklahoma City. He received his B.A. from
Swarthmore College in 1960. He went on to earn an M.A. (1962) and Ph.D. (1965) from
Princeton University. After college, Patten lectured in English at Bryn Mawr College,
leaving there in 1969 to take a position as Assistant Professor in the English Department at
Rice University, where he became a full professor in 1976. In 1991 and 1992 Patten chaired
Rice's English Department. The author of dozens of articles and reviews on
nineteenth-century British literature, Patten used the materials in this collection to write
a two-volume biography of George Cruikshank, entitled <emph render="italic">George
Cruikshank's Life, Times, and Art</emph> (vol. 1, 1992; vol. 2, 1996). In 1999 <emph render="italic"> The Guardian</emph>, a British newspaper, called Patten's biography one
of the best books of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Robert L. Patten was a Fulbright Scholar from 1963 to 1964 and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1980.
He was also chosen as a Couper Scholar in 2004, served as president of the Rice University

<p>The city of Houston has been a home to theater almost since its founding, with the first professional production on June 11, 1838. Since then, the Houston Theater District has grown until it seats the second largest number of people in the country, behind only New York. In 1951, "Houston was the site…of The Playhouse, the first permanent building built in America specifically to be a theatre-in-the-round" (Dauphin, 83). Another historic venue is the Alley Theatre whose growth mirrors that of Houston theatre, evolving from one simple room to hosting two main stages holding 824 and 310 seats. Productions at the Alley tended to be popular, modern plays early on, and it was only later that they leaned towards the classics. Other venues today include the "national AIA prize-winning Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts" (Holmes 2), the Miller Outdoor Theatre, and the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts. The Hobby Center is home to Theatre Under The Stars, the "largest non-profit producer of musical theater in America" (About).</p><p>Houstonian Ed Oppenheimer collected these programs from the 1900s to the 1990s from various theaters in Houston as well as New York, London, Dallas, and Fort Worth.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Tennison Bros. Sheet Metal Company was founded in 1891 in Mt. Pleasant, Texas. The company manufactured sheet metal products such as roof ventilators, flues, flue jacks, rainproofs, stove pipes, water tanks, and other materials. In the early 1900s, the company went through a number of changes in ownership and location, and finally was sold to Edward Kelly in 1937. It was called Kelley Manufacturing Company and was based on Franklin St. in Houston until 1938, when it expanded to a former cotton warehouse in the 4900 block of Clinton Dr., Houston. A large office building was also built at that time. The product line enlarged also, including attic fans, floor furnaces, underground garbage containers and industrial stampings.</p><p>By 1941, Kelley Manufacturing employed approximately 150 people. When materials were needed to support the effort for World War II, Kelley Manufacturing produced tanks and shoulder carriers for chemical warfare, as well as porthole screens and scoops for naval ships. </p><p>In May 1946, Edward Kelley died at the age of 49. The company went on under the leadership of Mrs. E.W. Kelley as President and Mr. H. W. Brown as Exec. Vice-President. Mr. Brown resigned due to ill health in 1949. Various changes in leadership took place over the next ten years. In 1956, E.W. Kelley Jr., age 24, graduate of Rice Institute, moved to Dallas and joined the company in a sales position. In 1957, the company stopped selling to dealers and only sold to jobbers and distributors. Edward Kelley, Jr. took a two year leave of absence to attend Harvard Business School, and returned to the company in June 1959, when Kelley Manufacturing was at a very low ebb.

<p>The Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology was originally named the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. In 1993, Professor Richard E. Smalley envisioned the first nanotechnology center in the world. Thus, the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) was born. With full support from the university, CNST was tasked with defining and implementing the nanotechnology initiative at Rice University. CNST set forth a bold objective to provide a venue where researchers from all disciplines of science and engineering can come together to share ideas and discuss their views and prospects of nanoscience, nanoengineering, and nanotechnology. CNST concluded the best way to achieve this objective was to provide the administrative and technical infrastructure to conduct cutting-edge nanotechnology research, sponsor seminars and conferences, advocate entrepreneurism, encourage multi-disciplinary collaborations, connect to external organizations, and support educational initiatives from the kindergarten to the professional level. </p><p>Within 8 years, CNST had fostered the formation of a nanotechnology spin-off company (Carbon Nanotechnologies, Inc), received NSF funding for a new nanotechnology center (Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology), and developed a centralized, well-managed equipment collection valued at greater than $10 million (Shared Equipment Authority). Building on this success, CNST began branching out to incorporate technical training, industry partnership, and community outreach. In 2002, CNST held the 1st Annual TunaFest Celebration, an informal venue for industry, academia, and nanotech enthusiasts to network. In just 6 years, TunaFest has grown to over 1000 attendees making it the premier nanotechnology social event of Houston. From 2002 to 2004, CNST advanced nanotechnology education through a variety of initiatives. The NanoKids program, based in Professor Tour's group, brings key concepts of nanoscience to middle school students. Additionally, CNST worked with several departments at Rice University to create undergraduate curriculum, a professional masters program, and continuing education courses in a variety of nanoscience and engineering topics.</p><p>While expanding their initiative portfolio, CNST continued cultivating its scientific strengths, fostering 10 spin-off companies, developing 5 unique nanotechnology centers and components, and growing the shared equipment at Rice University to over $12 million. By 2005, CNST supported the research efforts of 100 faculty members with over 400 graduate students spanning 14 departments at Rice University.</p><p>In 2005 after the passing of Professor Smalley, the Rice University Board of Trustees renamed the Institute in his honor. </p><p>As of 2010, the Smalley Institute included 151 faculty members in 21 departments with over 500 students researching nanotechnology in a variety of societal and scientific arenas including energy, education, aerospace, ethics, and human health; consisted of 5 major centers and components including $15 million in shared equipment and facilities for nanotechnology research; was affiliateds with 8 nanotechnology organizations in Houston and around Texas; and collaborated with over 50 associations to promote nanotechnology in all aspects of science and society.</p><p>In 2015 the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology and the Rice Quantum Institute merged to form the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI).</p><p>(Excerpted from the CNST website, http://cnst.rice.edu/history/, accessed Jan. 3, 2011.) </p><p>Richard E. Smalley was affiliated with Rice University from 1976 until his death in 2005, serving as the Gene and Norman Hackerman Professor of Chemistry at Rice beginning in 1982 and Professor of Physics at Rice beginning in 1990. A co-founder of the Rice Quantum Institute in 1979, he served as its chairman beginning in 1986, and was the director of the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences (elected 1990), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1991), and was the recipient of the 1991 Irving Langmuir Prize in chemical physics, the 1992 International Prize for New Materials (shared with R.F. Curl and H.W. Kroto), the 1992 E.O. Lawrence Award of the U.S. Department of Energy, the 1992 Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry, the 1993 William H. Nichols Medal, and the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with R.F. Curl and H.W. Kroto).</p><p>Smalley pioneered advances in the development of supersonic beam laser spectroscopy, super-cold pulsed beams, and laser-driven sources of free radicals, triplets, and metal and semiconductor cluster beams. He discovered and characterized fullerenes, the third elemental form of carbon after graphite and diamond, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.</p><p>Born June 6, 1943, in Akron, Ohio, Smalley received his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1965 from the University of Michigan, and master's and doctorate degrees from Princeton University in 1971 and 1973.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Engineering has been a part of Rice's curriculum since the university first opened as The Rice Institute in 1912. In those early days Rice offered courses in chemical, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Over the years, the engineering program grew, and in 1975 the George R. Brown School of Engineering was established. Today the school is comprised of eight academic departments and includes fourteen research institutes and centers. More than one fourth of Rice students are engineering majors. </p><p>Among the more than 100 engineering faculty are six members of the National Academy of Engineering. Virtually all undergraduate courses in engineering are taught by Ph.D. faculty. With a small student-to-faculty ratio, students in both undergraduate and graduate programs not only have easy access to professors in the classroom, but work closely with them in their labs. Departments and centers within the school of engineering take advantage of Houston's role as a center for the energy industry, medical research, space exploration, and the city's rapidly growing high-technology sector. Several departments have active industrial affiliates programs, and many research projects are undertaken with local companies. Students benefit from these relationships through collaborative research projects, summer internships, and making contacts for employment before graduation.</p> </bioghist>

<p>William Martin (Ph.D., Harvard, 1969), is the Harry and Hazel Chavanne Emeritus Professor of Religion and Public Policy in the Department of Sociology at Rice. Since his retirement from teaching in June 2005, he serves as the Chavanne Senior Fellow for Religion and Public Policy at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice. His areas of specialization include religion, criminology, and issues related to drug use and drug policy. He has been a professor at Rice since 1968.</p><p> Professor Martin's recent research and writing have focused in two areas: 1) religious fundamentalism and its impact in the political arena, in the United States and elsewhere; and 2) issues related to drugs, with particular emphasis on ways to reduce the harms associated with drug abuse and drug policy. In this connection, he has organized and chaired a series of programs at conferences at the Baker Institute dealing with these issues. </p><p> After several years of experience as a boy preacher, Bill Martin attended Abilene (Texas) Christian University, where he received B.A. (1958) and M.A. (1960) degrees in Biblical Studies and taught for one year as a graduate assistant. He then attended Harvard Divinity School, where he received the B.D. degree in 1963. In 1969, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard, in a program known as Religion and Society, a joint effort between the Divinity School and the Department of Social Relations. His dissertation, Christians in Conflict: The Role of the Clergy in Racial Conflict in Rochester, New York, was prepared under the direction of Harvey Cox, Joseph Fichter, and Thomas Pettigrew. At Harvey Cox's suggestion, he submitted an article based on his thesis to The Atlantic Monthly, which published it as the lead article in its December 1967 issue. Flushed with the pleasure of having his work read by large numbers, Bill Martin began to follow an unusual career path of publishing mainly in high-quality magazines such as The Atlantic, Harper's, Esquire, and Texas Monthly, for which he wrote a three-year monthly series of articles on Texas churches that led to his being the subject of a "60 Minutes" segment in September 1979.</p><p> During the 1970s and 1980s, Professor Martin concentrated mainly on religious broadcasters and was one of the first academicians to give serious attention to what came to be known as the Electronic Church. At the end of the 1970s, this led naturally to increased attention to fundamentalist involvement in politics and the rise of the movement known as the Religious Right. This work culminated, after dozens of articles, in his writing "With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America" (Broadway Books, 1996), the companion volume to the PBS mini-series of the same name and for which he served as chief consultant. A revised edition of both the book and the video series appeared in the summer of 2005. His writings on various aspects of evangelical and fundamentalist religion also led to his being given the opportunity write "A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story" (William Morrow, 1991), regarded as the most authoritative biography of the famed evangelist. An updated version of this book is in progress [as of July 2998]. In addition to these historical and sociological publications, Professor Martin also wrote "My Prostate and Me: Dealing with Prostate Cancer" (Caddell and Davies, 1994), an account of his own successful bout with this disease. As a result, he has appeared on more than 150 radio and television programs to discuss prostate cancer and regularly counsels with men and families touched by the disease.</p><p> More recently, as noted above, Bill Martin has taken an active role in the Baker Institute, organizing and chairing programs and conferences on the impact of religion, particularly various forms of fundamentalism, on public policy, and on ways to reduce the harms associated with drug abuse and drug policy. Many of these papers are available on the Baker Institute website. </p><p> Bill Martin received a number of teaching awards during his years as a professor, including the George R. Brown Life Honor Award, which made him ineligible for most additional awards given by Rice. At age sixteen, he decided to become a college professor as a consequence of exposure to particularly inspiring and dedicated teachers he encountered during his freshman year in college. As he enters partial retirement after more than thirty-seven years at Rice, he still regards it as a fine decision.</p><p> Recent Publications</p><p> * "With God on Their Side: Religion and American Foreign Policy ," Chapter 11 in Hugh Heclo and Wilfred M.

<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Rice began playing organized football against outside opponents in 1912 under the direction of Philip H. Arbuckle, who taught English and History. (It was fairly common until after World War II for faculty to coach athletics teams. For example, Knute Rockne, coach at the University of Notre Dame from 1918 to 1930 and perhaps the most legendary figure in college football history, was a chemistry professor.) In 1914, Rice participated in forming the Southwest Conference (SWC) and played its first full schedule against collegiate competition. The school's early teams, coached by various faculty members, comprised regularly enrolled students and were consistently mediocre on the playing field. In 1924, however, the Committee on Outdoor Sports, chaired by William Ward Watkin, hired John W. Heisman to coach Rice football and serve as Athletic Director. Heisman's hiring provoked immediate controversy among the faculty; although he would be in residence only for the football season and spring training, Heisman's salary far exceeded that of full-time faculty members, some of whom were among the most distinguished scholars in the world. Heisman also began attracting students from the northeast, specifically to play football, at a time when the notion of "recruiting" was still controversial, and even scouting other teams was regarded as dishonorable.</p><p>Faculty unease, as it would turn out, was as justified by the number of recruited athletes who failed classes as it was by the Heisman-led teams' poor records on the gridiron. (Heisman teams, 1924 to 1927, were 14-18-3.) Strict regimentation of the athletes' daily lives helped academic performance somewhat, but the teams continued to falter on the field, and Heisman resigned after the 1927 season.</p><p>Wrestling with issues of academic standards, losing records, and an increasingly onerous financial situation, the Rice Board, faculty, and administrators chose—far from unanimously—a new tack in 1928. The faculty approved the creation of a department of Physical Education. This department offered a program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education (P.E.), consisting largely (but not entirely) of courses in P.E., coaching, and business. Supporters of the program argued that, although the requirements for a degree in P.E. were obviously different from those in other academic areas, the standards could be just as high. This argument carried the day with the majority of Rice professors. For its part, the administration was satisfied by the trustees' agreement that the costs of this program would be covered solely by contributions from the Houston business community and the guarantee that the 40 students enrolled each year would be in addition to the regular class of 400. No money would be taken from the academic needs of the school; no 'regular' students would be denied admission.</p><p>Rice saw more athletic success in the wake of this change. Apart from one truly disastrous season in 1933 when eight varsity players were suspended for Honor Code violations, the football team did well, winning the SWC Championship in 1934, again in 1937, and playing in their first Cotton Bowl in 1938. The basketball, track, golf, and tennis teams were also frequent winners during this period. As might be expected, the increased success led to increased visibility in the Houston community. As the teams attracted many more spectators, it became clear that Rice needed a new football stadium to replace its undersized facility. Rice had been financially constrained since the mid-1920s, though, and this condition worsened in the 1930s. Struggling to improve its academic position, Rice could not afford to divert funds to such a project. Again, the trustees turned to the Houston community, which provided money to renovate and expand the stadium.</p><p>As the United States moved closer to war in 1939, and after a 1-9 season, the Committee on Outdoor Sports fired Coach Jimmy Kitts and hired in his place Jess Neely from Clemson University. Eventual entry into World War II in 1941 did not halt SWC play, but the loss of students to the armed forces created "patchtogether" football teams and predictably erratic results. In other sports, though, Rice faired better. In track and field, Fred Wolcott, Bill Cummins, and Bill Christopher amassed eight individual event NCAA titles between 1938 and 1946. Rice basketball also saw NCAA tournament appearances in 1940 and 1942 and a National Invitation Tournament (NIT) tournament appearance in 1943.</p><p>After the war, Rice experienced renewed football success, adding another SWC title in 1946. Basketball and tennis also performed reasonably well, with regularly competitive teams in the conference. Neely's football team contended almost every year, rising to fifth in the national rankings in 1949 after a Cotton Bowl victory over North Carolina. This success continued into the 1950s, with additional SWC championships and Cotton Bowl appearances after the 1953 and 1957 seasons. With Rice adding a SWC men's basketball championship and NCAA basketball bid in 1954 under Coach Don Suman, other Rice sports also began to receive national attention. Interestingly, baseball was not one of the success stories in the 1950s, with Rice teams struggling to stay above .500 throughout the period. In a city with no professional sports franchises, Rice games drew large crowds, and ticket scalping even became common. To meet the increased demand, Rice considered another renovation of its facilities. Instead, the trustees chose to build two completely new venues: the present Rice Stadium and Autry Court (a new multi-purpose indoor facility), both completed in 1950. With two new world-class facilities and successful seasons in many sports, Rice athletics looked well positioned to build on its success as it entered the 1960s. However, two changes in the environment, both with negative implications for Rice, would make that increasingly difficult.</p><p>First, Rice began to lose its ability to keep up with rivals such as the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M University. Huge enrollment increases at those schools created a giant advantage in recruiting. The 1965 re-adoption of the "twoplatoon" system in football—the practice of having separate offensive and defensive players—and the growing importance of expensive training facilities exacerbated this scale difference leaving Rice at a considerable disadvantage. (The two-platoon system of free substitution was originally instituted in 1941, outlawed in 1952, and re-instituted in 1965.) Second, the Houston Oilers began to play professional football in 1960. Fans began to trickle away, and then left in droves as the popularity of the fledgling American Football League grew. Jess Neely also retired in 1966 after coaching the Owls for 27 seasons. Over the next 18 years, Rice had nine football coaches, and by the late 1970s, Rice teams regularly struggled just to compete. The 1977 season was an example of how difficult it had become to build consistent teams: the football team, quarterbacked by All-American Tommy Kramer went 3-8, and the basketball team went 4-22. In effect, these changes were the beginning of what has become a fundamental structural change in the competitive context for Rice. Competition for an audience, Rice's size, and its ongoing efforts to build a national academic reputation, contributed to Rice's transformation from successful contender, to occasional competitor, to "cellar dweller" in many sports.</p><p>The 1960s and 70s also saw changes in the way athletics were viewed on campus. The program in Physical Education was re-evaluated in 1960 by a faculty committee. This review led to the adoption—again amidst substantial controversy—of a new program that (many inferred) was just for athletes. The Commerce Department offered a program focused on practical business courses, including finance, marketing, and management. From the beginning, its presence at a school that was beginning to make real strides in academics and research was perceived as an anomaly. Consistent lack of success on the playing field made some Rice constituents question the overall value of the athletics program as well. Self-studies in 1964 and 1974 and the appointment of an Athletics Review Committee in 1971 brought renewed controversy over athletic admissions, and in 1975, Rice's faculty voted to eliminate the Commerce Department, ending what was regarded by some as a formal sheltered course of study for athletes.</p><p>In the 1980s, six of nine SWC schools were placed on NCAA probation for various violations in their football programs. Although Rice's reputation remained spotless, these violations tarred the reputation of the conference as a whole, led to more difficulties in recruiting, and caused a loss of national television coverage. Intermittent turmoil on campus over the academic performance of athletes also continued. Rice's 1984 Self-Study and a 1992 Athletics Review Committee report again worried over the differential admissions criteria for athletes and non-athletes, leading to the adoption of some reforms in the way recruited athletes were admitted.</p><p>In 1992, the University of Arkansas defected to the Southeastern Conference in search of better television revenues. The remaining SWC members, facing continued participation in a highly regional conference with little national appeal, disbanded in 1994 with national powerhouses like the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M University joining strong conferences such as the Big 8 (now the Big 12), and the competitively weaker schools such as Rice and Texas Christian University casting about for good options.</p><p>With few reasonable alternatives, Rice ultimately entered the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 1996 and was immediately confronted with a new set of problems. The lack of traditional rivalries brought an even greater loss of fan interest, and far-flung competitors led to increased travel expenses. Subsequently, the WAC also suffered it's own problems, splitting into the current WAC and the 8 team Mountain West (Utah, Air Force, Brigham Young, Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State, UNLV, and Wyoming). This left a far weaker conference with amplified geographic problems that forced Rice to the west coast and Hawaii more frequently and removed from the conference any schools that resembled Rice academically.</p><p>Rice's move to Conference-USA (C-USA) in 2005 was, in part, an attempt to re-engage with traditional rivals like Southern Methodist University, Texas Christian University, and the University of Houston, while addressing the current budget impact of traveling to such WAC schools as the University of Hawaii and California State University at Fresno. However, at least one of these planned rivalries will not occur as TCU moved from C-USA to the Mountain West conference. Regardless of how these new conference affiliations play out, one thing is certain: the future of Rice sports will be built internally on the same rich character and competition that has been the hallmark of its history. External factors, particularly the changing nature of intercollegiate competition, may prove far more challenging as Rice seeks to maintain its place in top tier sports.</p><p>Organizational sketch excerpted from "Intercollegiate Athletics at Rice University," Board of Trustees Athletics Subcommittee, April 2004.

<p>J.H. Bastide, is probably John Henry Bastide, a British army officer and military engineer. In 1711, while still a boy, he was commissioned an ensign. He remained a lieutenant for well over 20 years, perhaps in part because of his decision to serve as a military engineer. At the time of this letter (May 1743), he was in Boston, aiding Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts in the construction of local fortifications. During the Seven Years War, he assisted in the defense of the fortress Louisbourg located at the site of a French settlement in Nova Scotia on Ile Royale now known as Cape Breton Island. He went on to become a lieutenant-general in April 1770. His name does not appear on the 1771 War Office list of officers, so he may have died in 1770.

<p>William Motherwell, Scottish poet and editor, was born in Glasgow in 1797. He studied classics at Glasgow University from 1818-1819 before becoming Sheriff-clerk at Paisley. He later was deputy Sheriff-clerk of the county of Renfrewshire from 1819-29. Motherwell always wrote in his spare time and in 1828 undertook to edit the 'Paisley Magazine'. From 1828-1830 he also carried out the editorial duties of the 'Paisley Advertiser'. After 1830 the poet moved back to his native Glasgow and worked, again in an editorial capacity, on the 'Glasgow Courier' until his death. In 1835 Motherwell helped produce an edition of Burns' poetry along with a small biographical account of Burns. A self-confessed participant in the Orange movement, Motherwell was called to London in 1835 to testify before a special committee set up to investigate Orangeism. His performance before that tribunal was confused and perhaps showed signs of mental instability. He was returned to Scotland almost immediately. He died of apoplexy soon after. The year was 1835.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Sketch</head>
<p>Harold Albert Wilson was born in York, England on December 1, 1874. Wilson's interest in engines and machines came from playing with a working model of a railway locomotive his father gave him about the time he entered kindergarten. Under the influence of his father, he began to experiment with chemistry at an early age when Wilson received Bloxham's Chemistry from him and bought a box of chemical apparatus from a pawnshop. Later, Wilson taught himself glass blowing which he admitted helped him in much of his research. </p><p>He graduated from a private preparatory school called St. Olave's at age 17 but stayed on as a mathematics teacher for two years. Afterward, he attended Victoria University in Leeds where he studied mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Wilson received first class honors in chemistry in the London intermediate B.Sc. and scholarships from both London and Leeds for two years. Three years later, Wilson obtained a first class in the ordinary London B.Sc. in applied mathematics, chemistry, and physics. While studying in college, he was able to conduct more research and published a small paper in the Chemical News on the size of atoms. He also worked with professors at Cambridge on the conductivity of flames containing salts. In 1897, he decided to work under J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish at Cambridge for a research degree which he received in 1899. Afterward, Wilson went to Berlin to work in a laboratory until he received the Allen Scholarship to go back to Cambridge eight months later. In 1901, he was awarded the Clerk Maxwell Studentship and elected to a Fellowship in Trinity College. In 1904, he received a vacant Lectureship at King's College in London where he was soon appointed as Chair. From the Principal, Wilson was able to receive money to increase the space for research at King's College. In 1906, Wilson was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1909, he accepted a professorship in Applied Physics at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>In 1912, the new Rice Institute of Houston, TX offered Wilson a Professorship which he took partly because he was interested in helping to start a new university. At that time, the physics department was temporarily housed in the mechanical building until 1914 the physics building proper was finished under Wilson's supervision. It came with an apparatus and teaching cost of several hundred thousand dollars. During WWI, Wilson assisted the United States Navy as a technical expert on anti-submarine devices. Wilson invented binaural listening devices for locating submarines. He published a paper at New London, CT which provided much insight on sound receivers. Shortly after accepting his position at Rice Institute, Wilson married Marjorie Patterson Smyth, who was a gold-medalist in mathematics and physics at McGill, by whom he had two sons and two daughters. </p><p>Wilson quickly gained a high reputation as a teacher at Rice and established a research school which also gained a high reputation as it grew. In 1925, he left Rice Institute for Chair of Natural Philosophy in Glasgow; however, the pensions offered at British universities were not satisfying to Wilson's needs so he accepted President Lovett's offer to come back to Rice. He was offered his professorship back which also came with a position as a consultant physicist to Humble Oil and Refining Co. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1931. During World War II, Wilson was one of the senior scientists to develop the atomic bomb in Chicago.</p><p>Wilson was appraised as an excellent teacher by both his colleagues and students. He also enjoyed teaching immensely and was loved by his students. He retired in 1947, at age 70 but continued teaching a small class out of his home in special and general relativity until his late 80's. Wilson's work was a contribution to the development of Rice Institute to a University making Rice an important center for research.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>If I am to be remembered, I hope it will not be primarily for my specialized scientific work, but as a generalist; one to whom, enlarging Terence's words, nothing human and nothing in external nature was alien. Julian S. Huxley, Memories</p><p>Julian Sorell Huxley, the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley and great-nephew of Matthew Arnold, was born June 22, 1887. The union of the Huxley and Arnold families brought about a happy combination of what Julian's younger brother Aldous would call "blue genes", but the combined family traditions also imposed an obligation of intellectual excellence and social responsibility. This obligation was keenly felt by Julian Huxley from an early age. It was enhanced by his affinity for the interests which had earned his grandfather his place in the history of science, and thus, it soon became apparent that young Julian would be Thomas Huxley's intellectual heir as well as his grandson. This inheritance would prove both a joy and a burden, for while Julian Huxley achieved great renown as a scientist and popularizer of science, he was plagued, like his grandfather, by serious and debilitating attacks of depression. In spite of this he was able, throughout a long career, to contribute significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and to act effectively as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism.</p><p>He was educated at Eton and Oxford, where he followed his own inclinations and his grandfather's example by studying Natural Science. His scientific interests were combined with literary talents which were officially recognized in 1908, when he was awarded the Newdigate Prize for English Verse at Oxford, an honor which he remembered with pride even after a lifetime of honors and accomplishments. (It is note-worthy and characteristic that he spent his prize money on a microscope.)</p><p>After completing his schooling, he began his career at the institution which had taught him: in 1910, he became a lecturer in Zoology at Oxford. Two years later, however, he departed from the course traditional to a young man of his academic interests and social background. He left England and Oxford to accept a position as Research Associate at the newly established Rice Institute in Houston, Texas, and by 1913 he had become Assistant Professor of Biology there. He remained in Houston until 1916 when he returned to Europe to take part in World War I.</p><p>After serving as an army intelligence officer in Italy, he came home to marry and to take up a position as Senior Demonstrator in Zoology at Oxford. From 1919 to 1925 he remained at Oxford, carrying out his famous axolotl experiments and participating in the university's expedition to Spitsbergen. In 1925 he became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London. But he did not remain long in that position. The following year he made a decision which, like his decision to teach at the Rice Institute, would move him away from the path followed by most of his fellow scientists. He accepted the invitation of H.G. Wells to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life, and in 1927 resigned his position at King's College. This meant a new direction for his career, for although he was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution from 1927 to 1929, after that he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues.</p><p>In 1935 he accepted the position of Secretary of the Zoological Society of London. In this capacity he had the means to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. Unfortunately his leadership aroused the displeasure of some members of the Society, and in 1942 he resigned under pressure. He continued, however, his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program.</p><p>The end of the war brought an opportunity for him to put many of his cherished ideals and projects into practice. True to family tradition, he had always viewed science, art and literature as part of a great whole. Thus when he became a member of the commission formed to plan what would become Unesco, he ensured that science would be an integral part of the educational and cultural institution. When in 1946 he became Unesco's first Director-General, he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He even went so far as to advocate his own solution to the troubling questions of modern society, his "religion" of scientific humanism, as an official basis for Unesco's philosophy. This he himself came later to find unwise. During his tenure as Director-General he also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. Finally, he came to stress even more strongly than before his optimistic belief that mankind can and should take control of its own environmental and biological destiny.</p><p>In 1948 his term of office with Unesco came to an end and Huxley was once again a private citizen. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted: evolutionary theory and its significance for potential human development, ecology and the preservation of wildlife and population control. He was honored often for his contributions to science and to society, receiving prizes and awards for his efforts in helping the general public to better understand contemporary scientific thought. In 1958 he received a knighthood. In 1965, in a culmination of work he began in his youth with his field studies of the behavior of the great crested grebe, he organized a Royal Society Symposium on the Ritualization of Behavior in Animals and Man, and in 1970 he received the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to scientific research related to conservation.</p><p>On February 14, 1975, at the age of 87, Sir Julian Huxley died. His life had been long, beginning in the Victorian era and ending in a world which his grandfather could scarcely have imagined. He served many of the causes with which the 20th century will no doubt become identified, and his influence on the development of contemporary biological science was considerable. Through his field studies of animal behavior and his synthetic approach to Darwinian evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics, he helped determine the direction of modern biology. As an educator his influence was incalculable, for he taught not only such men as E.B. Ford and A.C. Hardy, but through his writings, perhaps millions of men and women as well. He was, moreover, known for his encouragement of aspiring scientists and scholars. In his catholic interests, in his belief in the interrelationship of science and arts, he extended his influence beyond the laboratory of the classroom and reached artists, writers, musicians, politicians and finally the general public. Such interests and such influence indicate that his desire to be known as one to whom nothing human and nothing in external nature was alien was fulfilled.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The city of Houston has been a home to theater almost since its founding, with the first professional production on June 11, 1838. Since then, the Houston Theater District has grown until it seats the second largest number of people in the country, behind only New York. In 1951, "Houston was the site…of The Playhouse, the first permanent building built in America specifically to be a theatre-in-the-round" (Dauphin, 83). Another historic venue is the Alley Theatre whose growth mirrors that of Houston theater, evolving from one simple room to hosting two main stages holding 824 and 310 seats. Productions at the Alley tended to be popular, modern plays early on, and it was only later that they leaned towards the classics. Other venues today include the "national AIA prize-winning Jesse H.

<p>Julian Sorell Huxley (b. June 22, 1887, d. February 14, 1975) was a lecturer in Zoology at Oxford (1910-1912), Research Associate and later Assistant Professor of Biology at Rice Institute (1913-1916), and fought in World War I before returning to Oxford in 1919, where he conducted the famous axolotl experiments and participated in the university's expedition to Spitsbergen. He became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London in 1925, but resigned his position in 1927 to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life with H.G. Wells. He was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution (1927-1929) while working with Wells, however after 1929 he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues. </p><p>From 1935-1942 he served as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London, allowing him to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. He continued his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program. After World War II he helped form Unesco, serving as the organization's first Director-General (1946-1948). Here he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted. Throughout his long career, he contributed significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and acted as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Sheerness is a town in north Kent, England located at the mouth of the River Midway on the northwest corner of the Isle of Sheppey. The town of Sheerness started as a fort that was built during the reign of King Henry VIII in the early 16th century to protect the River Medway from invasions by sea. In 1665, plans were laid out to rebuild and strengthen the fort and make Sheerness an extension of the naval dockyard in Chatham. However, the fort was destroyed in 1667, during the Dutch raid on the Medway. Soon after, Samuel Pepys, Secretary of the Admiralty, ordered construction to begin again for a naval dockyard. It was hard to retain construction workers as a result of indecent living conditions and lack of fresh water; therefore, the first dry-dock was not completed until 1708. A fire completely destroyed the dockyard in the early 1820's but was rebuilt and redeveloped with a high brick wall and moat surrounding the yard as a defense measure. The dockyard officially reopened in 1823 by the Duke of Clarence, the future King William IV. Sheerness served as one of the bases of the Nore Command of the Royal Navy until 1960 when the dockyard closed and the Royal Navy relinquished control to the Medway Port Authority.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Harrie Thomas Lindeberg (1879-1959) was a New York based society architect whose simple, clean-lined country home designs were significant in setting the style for early 20th century domestic American architecture. During his career he designed more than a hundred country houses, numerous suburban dwellings, and a smattering of public buildings.</p><p>Born April 10, 1879 in Bergen Point, New Jersey of Swedish immigrant parents, little is known of Lindeberg's early years. He acquired his architectural training through an apprenticeship, from 1901 to 1906, at McKim, Mead and White, the leading architectural firm of the American Renaissance in New York. Lindeberg's work bears the lasting stamp of that tradition. In 1906 Lindeberg and his colleague, Lewis Colt Albro left the firm and opened their own New York architectural office. Aided by Albro's social connections and later, those of Lindeberg's second wife, they became architects to a new wealthy elite who were looking for symbols of leisure and success. Lindeberg's style was known for its simplicity and warmth. Steeply pitched roofs, vernacular materials, and bare hints of older European architectural vocabulary differentiated Lindeberg's homes from those of more traditional styles.</p><p>With the onset of World War I, Lindeberg joined the air corps. After the war, he resumed his practice in New York but found that more socially advantaged competitors including Charles Platt and John Russell Pope, had sewn up the premium commissions for social register homes along the eastern seaboard. It was then that Lindeberg discovered clients in the Midwest, South, and Gulf Coast regions. His imprimatur as a New York society architect with a strong record in country house work appealed to the new barons of the east Texas oil boom.</p><p>In Houston, before World War I, Stephen Cullinan (1860-1937), the founder of Texaco, envisioned a park-like enclave near Rice University and Hermann Park. He hired St. Louis landscape architect George E. Kessler to lay out the new Shadyside area. In 1919 he offered lots for sale to a select group of friends and associates. One of the friends, stockbroker Hugo V. Neuhaus (father of noted domestic architect Hugo V. Neuhaus Jr.), chose Harrie Lindeberg as his architect. The drawings for Neuhaus' house constitute this collection.</p><p>Neuhaus also persuaded three of his friends, oilman William Stamps Farish, cotton exporter Kenneth E. Womack, and industrialist D.D. Peden to hire Harrie Lindeberg to design their homes.</p><p>Excerpted from Domestic architecture of H.T. Lindeberg by H. T. Lindeberg and originally published in 1940.</p> </bioghist>

<p>In November of 1976, Houstonian George Hawkins founded The Black Ensemble Company, Houston's first African American professional theater, to provide a venue for Houston's talented Black actors, writers and artists to perform. When his company moved into its first home at 1010 Tuam Street in Houston, Hawkins dropped the word Black from the name, becoming simply The Ensemble. The first production performed at the new site was <title xlink:href="" render="italic" type="simple">Surprise, Surprise...A Love Story, </title> written and directed by Hawkins. In 1985, George Hawkins and his theater supporters rented a building at 3535 Main Street, Houston, and converted it into a theater. After Hawkin's death in 1991, Eileen Morris became the artistic director and devoted her life to keeping Hawkin's dream alive. In 1993, the group, now known as The Ensemble Theatre, began a fundraising campaign to purchase the building theyhad occupied for eight years at 3535 Main Street and renovate it. This venue became the largest African American theater in the United States and was the site of many "firsts" in the history of African American professional theater. In 2004, the Ensemble Theatre reached two milestones; becoming a designated stop on the new Houston Metrorail system, and the fulfillment of the mortgage on the building, celebrated by a Mortagage Burning Ceremony on January 1, 2004.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Annie Gregory belonged to a Methodist (Wesleyan) family in Wiltshire. Annie published a book in 1881 called "Susanne Gibson: A Study for Christian Workers… with an appendix concerning a London School for Wesleyan Ministers' Daughters". Lady Margaret Spicer was a younger daughter of the 12th Earl of Westmoreland. Though her father was a colonel in the British Army, and served in the Crimean War, he was chiefly notable for losing much of his fortune on horse racing. But Lady Margaret's grandfather, the 11th Earl, was a celebrated M.P. soldier, diplomat, musician, and historian. He founded the Royal Academy of Music, wrote seven operas and many other smaller musical pieces, and wrote two or three books on military and political matters. The husband of Lady Margaret was Captain John Edward Philip Spicer (1850-1928), who was from a celebrated old Wiltshire family.

<p>Jerry C. Debes (1920-1944) was born in Beaumont, Texas as one of five children of immigrant parents. His father Mike N. Debes (b.c. 1881) immigrated to America from Tripoli, Syria (now a part of Lebanon) in 1892. Mike married Vehiba, also Syrian, about 1907 and began his retail business in Beaumont, Texas. The Debes children attended Beaumont High School from which Jerry Debes graduated in 1938. He then attended the local Lamar College to study accounting.</p><p>On December 7, 1941, Debes was working as an accountant for the Stedman Wholesale Company. He enlisted in the US Army where he was sent to Camp Crowder, Mo. to be trained for the newly-established Signal Corps for the Second Division of the US Army Air Force (AAF). Preferring to become a pilot, Debes then began training at the Wilson &amp; Bonafils Flying School in Chickasha, Oklahoma but failed to finish the program. He then studied at the bombardier school at the George Air Force base in Victorville, CA. and graduated on July 31, 1943. He did additional training as a bombardier at the Air Force bases in Pueblo, CO and Tuscan, AZ eventually becoming a bombardier instructor. In the spring of 1944, he became certified as an aviation navigator.</p><p>Lt. Jerry C. Debes was then transferred to the RAF base in Halesworth, England as part of the 846th Squadron of the 489th Bombardment Group of the Eighth Air Force (8AF). Jerry and his crew christened their B-24 Liberator plane as the "Agony Wagon". Although notorious for catching on fire because of the fuel tank placement, the B-24 Liberator eventually became the most produced American military aircraft in history. The crew of the "Agony Wagon" entered combat on May 30, 1944 at the very end of the Allied Forces' "softening up" process of Nazi-occupied France prior to the D-Day invasion. </p><p>The Allied invasion of Normandy began on June 2, 1944. Debes flew six combat missions that focused exclusively on strategic targets such as factories, oil refineries, and airfields. On August 16, 1944, Jerry Debes and crew were on their tenth mission with orders to destroy the Rothensee plant and power stations in Magdeburg, Germany. After dropping their loads, the 846th squadron had turned back towards England when the "Agony Wagon" bombed accidently by another Allied plane. The Debes family received word that Jerry was "missing in action" one week later. Over a year later, the US War Department finally declared Second Lieutenant Jerry C. Debes officially "dead". He was posthumously awarded the US Army's Purple Heart and the USAF Air Medal for his service, and a tombstone in his memory was placed in the Lorraine American Cemetery outside St. Avold (Moselle), France in 1947. His family spent the rest of the decade trying unsuccessfully to discover the circumstances of his death. After visiting his brother's grave in France, Dr. Robert Debes of Houston, Texas reopened the inquiry in 1988. </p> </bioghist>

He became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London in 1925, but resigned his position in 1927 to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life with H.G. Wells. He was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution (1927-1929) while working with Wells, however after 1929 he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues. in 1919, Huxley married Juliette Baillot, a French Swiss girl whom he had met a Garsington Manor.
From 1935-1942 he served as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London, allowing him to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. He continued his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program. After World War II he helped form Unesco, serving as the organization's first Director-General (1946-1948). Here he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted. Throughout his long career, he contributed significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and acted as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism.</p> </bioghist>

<p>KTRU began in February 1967 as a two-watt station, KHCR, broadcast by students from Hanzsen College in the Hanzsen basement. In 1968 the station relocated to the basement of the Rice Memorial Center and broadcast throughout campus on 580 AM as KOWL. During the process of licensing and transitioning to FM, students discovered that the call letters KOWL were already in use by a station in California and in 1969 the station was renamed KTRU, for The Rice University. In 1970 the FM committee was established as a guiding entity of the licensing process and an application was submitted to the FCC. When the license request was granted in 1971, KTRU's power upgraded to 10 watts and the station began broadcasting at 91.7 FM from the top of Sid Richardson College, reaching approximately an 8 mile radius of campus. At this stage, KTRU, frequently referred to as "the radio", identified itself primarily as a source of diverse and underexposed music while incorporating campus news and events of interests to emphasize the educational purposes of the service. The staff was entirely volunteer, comprised mainly of electrical engineering majors due to the technical complexities of the equipment. KTRU evolved from 250 watts in 1974 to 650 watts in 1980, followed by an unexpected leap to 50,000 watts in 1991. This major shift emerged from the ambitions of neighboring station KRTS 92.1 whose request to expand to 50,000 was denied by the FCC due to the complete overpowering of KTRU's broadcast that would result. KRTS reached an agreement with Rice administrators to pay for the installation and maintenance of the new transmitter, located off campus in Humble, a northwest suburb of Houston. One consequence of the move was the interference of the Texas Medical Center with the broadcast signal, causing poor reception on campus and a decrease in the student audience. In 1997 a committee was formed to redirect KTRU in terms of a "university asset". The tensions between KTRU staff and the university administration manifested in November 2000 when two DJ's protested an arrangement made to broadcast more athletic events by playing punk rock songs over the last half of a Rice women's basketball game. The station was abruptly shut down by administrators for nine days until reopened after a series of protests condemning the university's action and negotiations with the station.</p><p>KTRU's content progressed from art rock in the 1970s to alternative, experimental, and underground rock in the 1980s, mirroring the national musical movement of the time. This decade also brought forth the addition of specialty shows, which balanced the alternative bent with segments of jazz, blues, folk, classical, independent and world music. Most recently KTRU boasts a similar eclectic mix of tunes directed away from the mainstream and towards open-minded tastes. Additionally, KTRU broadcasts Rice athletic events, interviews, public lectures of Rice affiliates, concerts from the Shepherd School of Music, and news and events relating to the campus and beyond.</p><p>Up until 2010, KTRU broadcasted twenty-four hours a day from a 50,000 watt antenna and streamed online from the Ley Student Center at Rice University. As of April 28, 2011, KTRU no longer broadcasted on the 91.7 frequency, which had been sold to the University of Houston. It only streamed music online until KPFT allowed KTRU to broadcast on its HD2 channel.</p><p>For more information, visit KTRU on-line at http://74.53.234.138/. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Ellington Field was officially opened November 27, 1917, as the United States' largest pilot and navigator training base, and the nation's first aerial bombing school. By the end of World War I, Ellington Field had grown to the size of a small city which housed 20,000 men and 250 aircraft. Like most bases, it was closed after World War I, but unlike most other military installations, it was reopened and saw at least partial use until World War II, when it was rebuilt as one of ten strategic defense bases in the United States. It was the only strategic defense base on the Gulf Coast. The location of the field was, and still is, crucial to the defense of the Houston Ship Channel, the ports of Galveston and Houston and one of the United States' largest oil refining centers. In 2005, the field was once again expanded to become a Joint Reserves base, to house the combined military forces Reserve Units. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Defense recommended retiring Ellington Field's 147th Fighter Wing F-16 Falcon fighter jets. The aircraft were replaced with MQ-1 Predator unmanned drones and the unit was redesignated as the 147th Reconnaissance Wing. The ANG 272nd Engineering Installation Squadron, was also relocated to Ellington Field. From 1976 to 2007, Ellington Field was partially owned and managed by the Houston Airport System, and the base was also home to the Texas State Guard, NASA's Johnson Space Center, a U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue unit, and other aviation related businesses.</p><p>Kathryn Black Morrow (1948- ) assembled this collection during her research for a master's thesis, which she completed at the University of Houston, Clear Lake campus, in 2003. She expanded her thesis research and published a history of Ellington Field called Defender of America's Gulf Coast, A History of Ellington Field, Texas 1917-2007 , in 2007. Ms. Morrow was born in Houston Texas, and works as a researcher, writer of Texas history, and archivist. Her other books include "Guide to the Texas Slave Trade Series, 1818-1886, The 79th Aviation Squadron, Ellington Field, Texas, in World War II, Southeast Texas Colored Voter Registrations, 1867-1869," and "Meant to Fly; The Memoirs of Captain A.J.

<p>Anah Marie Leland, daughter of Marie Angelique Schoenberger and Francis W. Leland, was born Oct. 12, 1901. She had one brother, Eaton Francis Leland. She was originally from Chicago, IL, but came to Houston in 1910 and attended Central High School and Rice Institute. She graduated Central High School in 1918 and Rice Institute in 1922 with a degree in Philosophy. While at Rice she met James Lockhart Autry III and became engaged. However, Autry died in 1922 (he graduated 1921) shortly before the wedding. Anah Marie at some point moved in with the Autry family in Courtlandt Place and became romantically involved with Autry's best friend, W.M. Streetman, an attorney with Andrews and Kurth. They became engaged and married in 1925. She was actively involved in the early cultural, civic and social activities of Houston. She died in Houston on Feb. 20, 1995 and is buried in Glenwood Cemetery.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Edward W. Kelley, Jr. was president of Kelley Industries, a Houston-based holding company with businesses in manufacturing and distribution. He then served as chairman of the board of Investment Advisors, also in Houston. In 1987, his valuable perspective as a business executive was called upon when he began a term of service as a governor on the Federal Reserve board. He was instrumental in preparing the Federal Reseve system for Y2K, to make sure the Federal computer sytems would keep running as the year 1999 turned over into 2000. These preparations helped the same system keep running effortlessly after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Kelley served on the Federal Reserve board until 2001, when he retired. He was honored in 2005 by having the new Federal Reserve branch bank building in Houston named after him, and praised by then Federal Reseve Chairman Alan Greenspan in a speech at the building's dedication.</p> </bioghist>

<p>In 1959 the Cypress Creek Course was opened for play, designed by Ralph Plummer. This course has hosted tournaments such as the 1967 Ryder Cup, the 1969 U.S. Open, multiple Tour Championships, the U.S. Amateur, and the Houston Champions International, which was a PGA Tour event. There are 2 courses, Cypress Creek, and Jackrabbit. The Club boasts several hundred members with single-digit handicaps, a statistic that can be matched by only a handful of other clubs in the country.</p><p>James Newton Demaret (May 24, 1910 – December 28, 1983) was an American professional golfer. He won 31 PGA Tour events in a long career between 1935 and 1957 and was the first three-time winner of the Masters. </p><p>Demaret was born in Houston, Texas. He reached his peak in the late 1940s with wins in the Masters in 1947, runner-up to Ben Hogan in the 1948 U.S. Open, and leading money winner and Vardon Trophy winner in 1947. He reached the semifinals of the PGA Championship four times in all but never won. He played on three Ryder Cup teams: 1947, 1949, and 1951. His career declined in the 1950s although he managed several key wins including the 1952 Bing Crosby Pro-Am. Demaret was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1983. In 2000, he was ranked as the 20th greatest golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine. Known for his keen sense of humor and colorful outfits, Demaret was one of first Tour pros to become involved in golf broadcasting. After working as a commentator for "All Star Golf" in the early '60s, he replaced George Rogers as co-host for Shell's Wonderful World of Golf along with Gene Sarazen in 1966. Jimmy Demaret was a guest on "I Love Lucy" in the early 1950s. The over-70s groupings on the Senior PGA Tour were named the Friends of Demaret in his honor. He died of a heart attack in Houston, Texas as he was getting ready for a round of golf.</p><p> John Joseph "Jack" Burke, Jr. (born 29 January 1923) is an American professional golfer who was most prominent in the 1950s. He first rose to fame with two lopsided victories in the 1951 Ryder Cup matches. He was subsequently selected for the 1953, 1955, 1957, and 1959 teams, serving as playing captain in 1957. He also served as non-playing captain in the 1973 matches.</p><p> Burke was born in Fort Worth, Texas. He turned professional in 1940. He won 16 PGA Tour events in his career, including the 1956 Masters and PGA Championship. Perhaps his most famous match was his nine-hour, 40-hole quarterfinal loss to Cary Middlecoff in the 1955 PGA Championship. Burke won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1952 and was selected PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1956.</p><p> After retiring from competition, Burke, along with Jimmy Demaret, was the main force in creating the Houston Champions Golf Club which has been the site of many PGA Tour events, as well as the 1969 U.S. Open and 1993 U.S. Amateur. He became the fifth recipient of the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, and was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2000. Burke shares his permanent locker at Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters in Augusta, Georgia with Tiger Woods. As tradition dictates, both keep their prized green jackets, awarded to the annual winner of the tournament, in a wooden, finished locker with gold name plates on the front, with each year listed for the year they won.</p><p>Sources: </p><p>Rule, Bob (with forward by Ben Hogan) (1976).

<p>Stephen Carrie Blumberg was an accomplished book thief who stole 18,900 books from 327 libraries and museums in 45 states and Canada before being caught in 1991. Over 20 years he amassed his collection of rare books in his Iowa home in an attempt to create his own rare book collection, never intending to sell them. Blumberg stole numerous color plates from journals in Rice's Fondren Library in the 1980s. When the FBI confiscated his collection, and attempted to return the books to the libraries from which they were stolen, the task was complicated by the fact that Blumberg had removed each library's ownership marks. It is believed that this group of prints represents only what was stolen from Fondren Library, but complete accuracy on this point is not possible. It was also determined that the original journals from which these plates were cut were in such bad condition that returning the plates to them would not be possible. Therefore they have been maintained in their original order since their investigation and return.</p><p>Blumberg's stolen book collection was valued at $5.3 million. He served nearly 6 years in prison for the thefts. </p> </bioghist>

<p>William Martin (Ph.D, Harvard, 1969), is the Harry and Hazel Chavanne Emeritus Professor of Religion and Public Policy in the Department of Sociology at Rice. Since his retirement from teaching in June 2005, he serves as the Chavanne Senior Fellow for Religion and Public Policy at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice. His areas of specialization include religion, criminology, and issues related to drug use and drug policy. He has been a professor at Rice since 1968.</p><p>Professor Martin's recent research and writing have focused in two areas: 1) religious fundamentalism and its impact in the political arena, in the United States and elsewhere; and 2) issues related to drugs, with particular emphasis on ways to reduce the harms associated with drug abuse and drug policy. In this connection, he has organized and chaired a series of programs at conferences at the Baker Institute dealing with these issues.</p><p>After several years of experience as a boy preacher, Bill Martin attended Abilene (Texas) Christian University, where he received B.A. (1958) and M.A. (1960) degrees in Biblical Studies and taught for one year as a graduate assistant. He then attended Harvard Divinity School, where he received the B.D. degree in 1963. In 1969, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard, in a program known as Religion and Society, a joint effort between the Divinity School and the Department of Social Relations. His dissertation, Christians in Conflict: The Role of the Clergy in Racial Conflict in Rochester, New York, was prepared under the direction of Harvey Cox, Joseph Fichter, and Thomas Pettigrew. At Harvey Cox's suggestion, he submitted an article based on his thesis to The Atlantic Monthly, which published it as the lead article in its December 1967 issue. Flushed with the pleasure of having his work read by large numbers, Bill Martin began to follow an unusual career path of publishing mainly in high-quality magazines such as The Atlantic, Harper's, Esquire, and Texas Monthly, for which he wrote a three-year monthly series of articles on Texas churches that led to his being the subject of a "60 Minutes" segment in September 1979. During the 1970s and 1980s, Professor Martin concentrated mainly on religious broadcasters and was one of the first academicians to give serious attention to what came to be known as the Electronic Church. At the end of the 1970s, this led naturally to increased attention to fundamentalist involvement in politics and the rise of the movement known as the Religious Right. This work culminated, after dozens of articles, in his writing "With God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America" (Broadway Books, 1996), the companion volume to the PBS mini-series of the same name and for which he served as chief consultant. A revised edition of both the book and the video series appeared in the summer of 2005. His writings on various aspects of evangelical and fundamentalist religion also led to his being given the opportunity write "A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story" (William Morrow, 1991), regarded as the most authoritative biography of the famed evangelist. An updated version of this book is in progress [as of July 1998]. In addition to these historical and sociological publications, Professor Martin also wrote "My Prostate and Me: Dealing with Prostate Cancer" (Caddell and Davies, 1994), an account of his own successful bout with this disease. As a result, he has appeared on more than 150 radio and television programs to discuss prostate cancer and regularly counsels with men and families touched by the disease.</p><p>More recently, as noted above, Bill Martin has taken an active role in the Baker Institute, organizing and chairing programs and conferences on the impact of religion, particularly various forms of fundamentalism, on public policy, and on ways to reduce the harms associated with drug abuse and drug policy. Many of these papers are available on the Baker Institute website.</p><p>Bill Martin received a number of teaching awards during his years as a professor, including the George R. Brown Life Honor Award, which made him ineligible for most additional awards given by Rice. At age sixteen, he decided to become a college professor as a consequence of exposure to particularly inspiring and dedicated teachers he encountered during his freshman year in college. As he enters partial retirement after more than thirty-seven years at Rice, he still regards it as a fine decision.</p><p>Recent Publications </p><p>"With God on Their Side: Religion and American Foreign Policy," Chapter 11 in Hugh Heclo and Wilfred M.

<p>Beginning in 1973, the Rice Center for Community Design + Research was an organization within the School of Architecture at Rice University. In 1978 it was expanded to the entire University, and the name was shortened to Rice Center. Its purpose was to conduct research for both public and private entities. Internally it created research projects judged beneficial to the Houston and Texas community. These independent research projects were funded by substantial foundation grants and private contributions. In approximately 1975 it was designated a National Center of Research Excellence by the Urban Mass Transit Administration and received long term support for transportation research. This collection includes the Rice Center projects that were published; additional projects took place that were not published. It also includes material created at the University of Louisville that served as examples of the kinds of research anticipated.</p><p>Donald L.

<p>The University Welfare Committee, elected in October 1962 by the faculty, met for the first time Nov. 26, 1962. President Pitzer had asked for this committee to consider all matters not dealt with by other committees. Topics were to be initiated within or outside the committee. The members would then examine and criticize issues brought before them and report their findings to President Pitzer and the faculty. The committee functioned somewhat as a grievance committee and dealt with a diverse number of matters over the years which ranged from inadequate lighting on campus, faculty pension plans and tenure, to student-faculty-administration relationships. It was out of the latter issue that in May 1971 a University Council was formed with representatives from the student body, the faculty, and the administration. It functioned as the primary adviser to the president on policy decisions and matters affecting the operation of the University. At the same time a Faculty Council was formed, constituted partly by faculty members of the University Council. The Faculty Council assumed all the duties of the Committee on University Welfare, which disbanded in 1971. (J. McDermott, 5/5/82)</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William Marsh Rice was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 14, 1816. He was the third of ten children born to David and Patty Hall Rice. Little is known about Rice's childhood but records indicate that he worked for a while as a shopkeeper in Springfield before deciding to move to Texas in 1838.</p><p>Rice started out in business as a merchant in Houston, Texas. His first business partnership with a Barnabas Haskill was formed in 1840 but dissolved by 1842. In 1844 Rice became a commission and forwarding merchant in partnership with Ebenezer B. Nichols, a successful Houston businessman. By 1850 Rice's siblings began to follow him to Houston and assisted in his ventures. On June 29, 1850 Rice married Margaret Bremond whose father Paul was one of Rice's many business partners. In the census of 1860, Rice is listed as having $750,000 in real and personal property, making him one of the wealthiest men in Texas at the time.</p><p>At least 15 enslaved people were included as Rice's property in 1860. According to county deed records and newspaper advertisements, Rice purchased, sold, and accepted mortgages on enslaved people; he also attempted to recapture enslaved people who fled him. In addition to extending credit to slaveowners who leveraged enslaved people as collateral, Rice also bought and sold cotton as a substantial portion of his antebellum business.
Rice served on a secession committee in Houston after the 1860 presidential election, and during the Civil War, Rice and his wife Margaret raised money for Confederate soldiers. On August 13, 1863, Margaret Rice died, possibly from cholera or yellow fever. Shortly after his wife's death, Rice went to Monterrey, Mexico and stayed there until August of 1865 when he returned to Houston. In Monterrey, Rice smuggled cotton and manufactured goods across the Texas-Mexico border. Later in the summer of 1865, he went to Massachusetts for business and did not return to Houston until 1866. On June 26, 1867 Rice married for a second time. His second wife was Julia Elizabeth Baldwin Brown, a widow and a daughter of Horace Baldwin, one of the early mayors of Houston. Elizabeth's sister Charlotte was the wife of William's younger brother Frederick.</p><p>Rice and his second wife moved to New Jersey to live with Rice's sister Charlotte and her family. Rice and his wife divided their time between New York City and New Jersey with occasional trips to Houston to oversee business.
During one of the Rices' visits to Houston, he was approached by Cesar Maurice Lombardi, who was interested in building a high school in Houston. Rice had been interested in endowing an educational institute of some kind, having revised his will twice previously to include a school for needy boys, first in New Jersey, then in New York City. After the meeting with Lombardi, Rice decided to fund an institute of higher learning in Houston. On May 19, 1891 the charter for the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art was incorporated in Austin, Texas. Captain James Addison Baker, William's brother Frederic, Houston businessmen Emanuel Raphael, Cesar Lombardi, James E. McAshan and Alfred S. Richardson were named as the first board of trustees.</p><p>In article two of the charter: "(t)he objects, intents, and purposes of this Institution are declared to be the establishment and maintenance, in the City of Houston, Texas, of a Public Library, and the maintenance of an Institution for the Advancement of Literature, Science, Art, Philosophy and Letters; the establishment and maintenance of a Polytechnic school; for procuring and maintaining scientific collections; collections of chemical and philosophical apparatus, mechanical and artistic models, drawings, pictures and statues; and for cultivating other means of instruction ..." The charter also required that the Institute only accept white students, which was changed in 1965. The institute was initially endowed with a promissory note for $200,000 to be paid upon Rice's death. Rice revised his will on September 26, 1896 and left the bulk of his estate to his namesake institute.
During the battle over the estate two lawyers became involved with the proceedings and would end up greatly influencing the final results. Captain Baker, a trustee of the Rice Institute, served as William Rice's lawyer. Albert Patrick, the other lawyer, was hired by Orren Holt in 1898 to investigate the residency question in New York City. There Patrick met Charlie Jones, Rice's valet. The two spent a great deal of time together and slowly a plan was formed. At first it seemed that Patrick was only interested in the settlement of the contested will and was looking for any way to win. He convinced Jones, in the spring of 1900, to start poisoning Rice with mercury pills as a way to avoid a court battle. By the summer of 1900 Patrick came up with the idea to forge a will that left the majority of Rice's estate to himself and small sums to relatives and friends. The forged will was dated June 30, 1900.</p><p>On September 8, 1900 a hurricane struck the Gulf Coast and one of Rice's businesses, the Merchants and Planters Oil Company, suffered severe damage. The business manager telegraphed that they needed money for repairs and the sum was most of what Rice had available in his bank account. Patrick was worried at the loss of such a large sum of ready cash and he convinced Jones to use chloroform to kill Rice. On September 23, 1900 Rice was murdered by Jones. Patrick, in his haste to get hold of Rice's cash, tried to withdraw money from Rice's bank using a check forged by Jones right after Rice's death. The bank refused to honor the check since Patrick's name was spelled incorrectly. When calling to verify the check with Rice, the bank learned that he was dead. Since the circumstances were suspicious, the bank contacted Rice's Houston lawyer, Captain Baker.</p><p>When Baker arrived in New York City, he learned there had been a new will written up by Patrick. Baker was suspicious of the will since Rice had never notified him of any changes to the one Baker had drawn up on September 26, 1896. This suspicion led to a long and sensational trial where Patrick's version of the will was exposed as a forgery and the scheme to kill Rice was discovered. Patrick was found guilty of murder and forgery on March 26, 1902 and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. Jones, who confessed to his part of the events, ended up being released despite being the one who had actually committed the murder. Patrick's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the governor of New York, but eventually won a full pardon in 1912.</p><p>On February 6, 1902 Orren Holt settled the suit over Elizabeth's will for $200,000. After the trials and settlement, Captain Baker and the original Board of Trustees set about fulfilling Rice's dream to have an institute for higher learning in Houston, Texas. To guide them, the trustees chose as first president, a young mathematician and astronomer at Princeton University named Edgar Odell Lovett, who signed on as president in 1908. Lovett had earned doctorates both from the Universities of Virginia and Leipzig and had taught at Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago, and Princeton, the most innovative American universities of the time. The trustees sent him on a worldwide tour of the "competition," where he interviewed faculty, inspected facilities, and developed an inspired vision of what might be accomplished on the plains of Texas with a blank-check charter, a generous endowment, and high ambitions. The goal was a university "of the highest grade" that kept "the standards up and the numbers down." Lovett shaped the university that Rice would become.</p><p>The Rice Institute opened on September 23, 1912, the anniversary of Mr. Rice's murder, with 77 students and a dozen faculty. An international academic festival celebrated the opening three weeks later, a spectacular event that brought Rice to the attention of the entire scholarly world. Four years later, at the initial commencement, 35 bachelor degrees and one master's degree were awarded, with the first doctorate conferred in 1918.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Some of the town lots referred to in this collection were acquired by William Marsh Rice and were turned over to Rice Institute in 1906 by the executors of his estate. Others were apparently bought by the Institute. It was noted in 1946 that most of the desirable lots had been disposed of through the years. The remaining lots were for the most part undesirable because of poor location, lack of utilities in the vicinity, or surface conditions. It was noted that in a few instances lots would be more salable if and when utilities were extended and drainage provided. It appeared in 1946 that this would be done fairly soon in certain sections of Bremond and Calvert, but it seemed doubtful that properties in the other towns would be benefited by these types of improvement for a number of years to come. Thus, as documents in this collection show, some lots continued to be held by Rice through the fifties, sixties, seventies, and as late as 1985.</p><p>The records pertaining to the Rice Hotel also begin with a purchase by William Marsh Rice. In 1886 he bought the hotel at the corner of Texas Ave. and Main St. in downtown Houston, then known as the Capitol Hotel, for back taxes. When he was murdered in 1900, the hotel was left to the newly chartered Rice Institute and was renamed the Rice Hotel. Under the terms of Rice's will, the land could not be sold; thus when in 1910 Jesse Jones made a proposal to the Institute trustees to lease the land and build a new hotel, the resulting deal was to lease Jones the site for ninety-nine years with an additional ninety-nine-year option. In addition to receiving revenue from this and other leases, the Institute also earned money on its endowment funds by making loans for construction. On June 1, 1910, an agreement was made between the Institute trustees and Jones to loan him a sum not exceeding $500,000, half the estimated cost at the time to build the hotel. A year later the loan of an additional $250,000 was agreed to, and it was agreed that one of the Institute trustees would be on the board of Jesse Jones's company, the Houston Hotel Association. When Jesse Jones died in 1956, his charitable foundation, Houston Endowment, became owner and operator of the hotel.</p><p>In 1971, Houston Endowment gave the hotel to Rice—now University, which still owned the land occupied by the building. At that time it was valued at $7.5 million. The University decided not to spend the $1.2 million necessary to bring the building up to current codes, it was bought by a New York corporation, refurbished and re-opened, but in 1977 it was sold at a foreclosure auction to the Rice Preservation Corporation. In 1978 Community Investors IX Ltd. purchased the building and bought the land from Rice University. Thus the value of the entire Rice Hotel property became part of the University endowment.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Gene L. Lee, military veteran, entrepreneur, and publisher, was born on October 5, 1926, in Canton, part of China's Guangdong province. While only a young boy, Lee's father left their village of Toisan and traveled to Canada. Lee's mother passed away soon thereafter and Lee was raised by his sister with financial assistance provided by their father in Canada. Lee rarely spoke of his early childhood, for it was certainly marked by upheaval and uncertainty. </p><p>Lee did, however, travel in a month-long journey to the United States in 1949. His family was instrumental in aiding his travels: his father helped pay for the ship voyage, uncles and cousins joined Lee, and he ultimately lived with his sister and her husband in Houston, Texas. Soon after arriving in Texas, Lee was drafted into the United States Army and was assigned to occupation duty in Germany. Lee fondly remembered his service in the military as a time in which he met people of great diversity and was exposed to a host of disciplines including classes on typing, mathematics, and history. These formative experiences reflected Lee's life-long ambition to learn as much as possible through self-education. </p><p>While in Germany Lee met his future wife, Hedy. Following a courtship of only six weeks, Gene and Hedy married. The couple knew very little English and used a pocket dictionary to assist their communication. The Lees lived for two years in Germany while Gene completed his military service. </p><p>The couple returned to Houston and Lee began working in at his uncle's grocery. Gene and Hedy, though, soon purchased their own market and, throughout the 1960s, turned it into a successful business. Lee exhibited a strong work-ethic and labored seven days a week. Gene's Food Market, located at 3404 Leeland, was a family enterprise; all five of the Lee children worked in the store. </p><p>In 1970 Lee opened Lee Printing Company in Houston. He had long expressed an interest in the printing business, took community college courses on the subject, and sought advice from some of Houston's existing printers. Lee Printing provided both English and Chinese printing services and even sold office supplies to other businesses. </p><p>The printing industry directed the already successful Lee toward publishing his own newspaper. In 1976, he introduced the region's first Chinese/English newspaper, the Southwest Chinese Journal. Similar to his success in the grocery and printing business, Lee's positive influence was easily seen in the printing industry. One of his employees, Wea Lee (no relation), a Lamar University graduate, later founded the Southern News Group, which publishes multiple Chinese-language papers. </p><p>Lee retired from his prosperous businesses in 1994 and handed the daily operations to his son, Sam. Gene Lee, in addition to being a successful entrepreneur and businessman was also an avid reader and dedicated to self-education. He immersed himself in classical Chinese literature, history, and poetry. A connoisseur of Chinese music, Lee played violin with a Cantonese opera group. </p><p>Gene Lee passed away on October 24, 2010, and was survived by his wife, Hedy, their five children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandaughter. </p> </bioghist>

<p>A five-day controversy rose on the campus of Rice University in February 1969 following the appointment of Dr. William H. Masterson by the Board of Trustees as the university's new President to succeed Kenneth Pitzer, who had resigned in August 1968. Members of the faculty and student body protested in particular the method by which Masterson had been appointed, which was perceived as a unilateral decision by the Board without sufficient consultation with the committee of faculty and students appointed earlier by the Board to assist in suggesting and screening candidates' names. A variety of personal objections to Masterson himself were also voiced, along with concern about appointment of a President from within the university (Masterson was a former graduate of Rice who had joined the faculty in the Department of History in 1951 and served later as Dean of Humanities before leaving Rice in 1966 to serve as President of the University of Chattanooga). As a result of the pressure created by the protests and by a campus-wide poll conducted among students and faculty (results of which were made known to Masterson), the controversy ended with Masterson's resignation as President on February 25th, five days after his appointment had been announced.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Although the anthropology department was established at Rice University in 1961, its revitalization and redirection began in 1980. Because of its focus on high-quality, specialized, and creative work within the discipline during this decade, the anthropology department became well-known for both its identity and reputation. Such distinction became evident at the American Anthropological Association meeting in 1984, at which knowledge of Rice's accomplishments were widespread, and in the spring of 1986 when publishers bid vigorously for two volumes produced by Rice's anthropology department. At this time the anthropology department was on par with the small but specialized departments at Duke, Princeton, John Hopkins and Virginia, and the department's candidates were actively pursued by the large graduate departments of Harvard, Michigan, Chicago, and Stanford.</p><p>Traditionally the anthropology department was organized around a cultural anthropology core with archaeology and biological anthropology as additional tracks that supported the core. Since then, the social-cultural anthropology program has expanded and focuses on the application of anthropological methods and styles of research to the study of complex societies. Archaeology has become its own prominent track with emphases on the emergence of complex societies and urbanism, settlement studies, origins of food production, the Late Stone Age and Iron Age in Africa, and historical archaeology. Today the department of anthropology's doctoral program offers advanced training in these fields. In addition, students interested in medical anthropology have access to resources of the Texas Medical Center. The national prestige of the anthropology department at Rice continues to flourish.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Franz R. Brotzen was born in Berlin July 4, 1915. When the collapse of a paper mill in the Great Depression had a severe financial effect on his family, Brotzen left the mechanical engineering studies he had begun, in order to accept a position in the South American division of the German chemical company I. G. Farben. His work was to travel throughout Brazil, selling medications for both people and livestock. </p><p>When World War II broke out, a British blockade of German vessels cut off the supply of pharmaceuticals he was selling, and Brotzen moved to a job with a foundry equipment importer in Rio de Janeiro. Reading a metallurgy book to learn more about his new employer's business stimulated recall of interest in the engineering studies he had begun. When his sister, who had emigrated to Cincinnati, suggested that he continue his education in the United States, he followed up on this idea and arrived with a German passport in Ohio December 1, 1941. He enrolled at Case Institute for Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University), but in December 1942 he was drafted by the U.S. Army. When his familiarity with multiple languages was recognized, he was sent to the Military Intelligence Training Center in Maryland, and, by this time a U.S. citizen, he completed courses in interrogating prisoners of war and also an officer candidates' school. He then worked as an instructor at the MITC until spring 1945.</p><p>For the following year Brotzen was on assignment in Frankfurt, where he and Army colleagues had been sent to take advantage of an offer made by Nazi leaders hoping to "buy" clemency, to share their intelligence on the Soviets. During this year, Brotzen met Frances Burke Ridgway, who was serving on the staff of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine. Hers was a four-month assignment in Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>By January 1950 both Franz and Frances were back in Washington, D.C., and were married. The following year they moved to Cleveland so Franz could resume his engineering studies. Without further interruption, he completed the M.S. and Ph.D degrees, awarded by Case in 1954.</p><p>Rice University owes Brotzen's joining its faculty to a close friendship between his dean at Case and William Houston, then president of Rice. A letter of introduction from Brotzen to Houston prompted Houston to offer him the position of starting the materials science program at Rice. He continued teaching in this department for fifty-five years, finishing his final course in 2009.</p><p>Franz Brotzen influenced the development of Rice University in many ways. His first contribution was to add a discipline to the curriculum. Having been promoted to Professor of Mechanical Engineering in 1959 and been a Guggenheim Fellow at the Second Institute for Applied and Theoretical Physics in Stuttgart in 1960-61, in 1962 he was appointed Dean of Engineering at Rice. President Pitzer, whose term began in 1961, charged him with developing and expanding the engineering program. To do this Brotzen brought new faculty to the university and sought particularly federal funding to make Rice more research conscious. He also helped raise money to build the Ryon Laboratory as well as the first space science building in the country.</p><p>While Brotzen worked effectively as an administrator, students found him outstanding also as a teacher. The way this is demonstrated at Rice is through the Brown Teaching Awards, the recipients of which are determined by student vote. Brotzen won the George R. Brown Award for Superior Teaching in 1967, 1971, 1972, and 1973. In addition, in 1975 he won a Piper Award, which recognized him as outstanding among teachers at all Texas colleges and universities.</p><p>Brotzen's contributions to student life were not limited to the classroom. After filling in as a college master for one year while the actual master was on leave, Franz and Frances accepted a mastership of their own at Brown College from 1977 to 1982.</p><p>His leadership of the faculty at large is represented by a number of terms on Faculty Council and by his serving as chairman of the Faculty Committee on Educational Enhancement appointed by President Hackerman in 1977.</p><p>A distinctive feature of Brotzen's involvement with students is the way he represented his lifelong commitment to promoting international understanding. In addition to hosting events in their home for foreign students, Franz and Frances established an annual $2,500 summer foreign travel prize open to all Rice undergraduates.</p><p>Franz Brotzen devoted his entire academic career to the community of Rice University, but because of his background, travels, experience, interests, and accomplishments, he is most accurately thought of as a citizen of the world.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>William Marsh Rice was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 14, 1816. He was the third of ten children born to David and Patty Hall Rice. Little is known about Rice's childhood but records indicate that he worked for a while as a shopkeeper in Springfield before deciding to move to Texas in 1838.</p><p>Rice started out in business as a merchant in Houston, Texas. His first business partnership with a Barnabas Haskill was formed in 1840 but dissolved by 1842. In 1844 Rice became a commission and forwarding merchant in partnership with Ebenezer B. Nichols, a Houston businessman. By 1850 Rice's siblings began to follow him to Houston and assisted in his ventures. On June 29, 1850 Rice married Margaret Bremond whose father Paul was one of Rice's many business partners. In the census of 1860, Rice is listed as having $750,000 in real and personal property, making him one of the wealthiest men in Texas at the time.</p><p>At least 15 enslaved people were included as Rice's property in 1860. According to county deed records and newspaper advertisements, Rice purchased, sold, and accepted mortgages on enslaved people; he also attempted to recapture enslaved people who fled him. In addition to extending credit to slaveowners who leveraged enslaved people as collateral, Rice also bought and sold cotton as a substantial portion of his antebellum business.
Rice served on a secession committee in Houston after the 1860 presidential election, and during the Civil War, Rice and his wife Margaret raised money for Confederate soldiers. On August 13, 1863, Margaret Rice died, possibly from cholera or yellow fever. Shortly after his wife's death, Rice went to Monterrey, Mexico and stayed there until August of 1865 when he returned to Houston. In Monterrey, Rice smuggled cotton and manufactured goods across the Texas-Mexico border. Later in the summer of 1865, he went to Massachusetts for business and did not return to Houston until 1866. On June 26, 1867 Rice married for a second time. His second wife was Julia Elizabeth Baldwin Brown, a widow and a daughter of Horace Baldwin, one of the early mayors of Houston. Elizabeth's sister Charlotte was the wife of William's younger brother Frederick.</p><p>Rice and his second wife moved to New Jersey to live with Rice's sister Charlotte and her family. Rice and his wife divided their time between New York City and New Jersey with occasional trips to Houston to oversee business.
During one of the Rices' visits to Houston, he was approached by Cesar Maurice Lombardi, who was interested in building a high school in Houston. Rice had been interested in endowing an educational institute of some kind, having revised his will twice previously to include a school for needy boys, first in New Jersey, then in New York City. After the meeting with Lombardi, Rice decided to fund an institute of higher learning in Houston. On May 19, 1891 the charter for the William M. Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art was incorporated in Austin, Texas. Captain James Addison Baker, William's brother Frederic, Houston businessmen Emanuel Raphael, Cesar Lombardi, James E. McAshan and Alfred S. Richardson were named as the first board of trustees.</p><p>In article two of the charter: "(t)he objects, intents, and purposes of this Institution are declared to be the establishment and maintenance, in the City of Houston, Texas, of a Public Library, and the maintenance of an Institution for the Advancement of Literature, Science, Art, Philosophy and Letters; the establishment and maintenance of a Polytechnic school; for procuring and maintaining scientific collections; collections of chemical and philosophical apparatus, mechanical and artistic models, drawings, pictures and statues; and for cultivating other means of instruction ..." The charter also required that the Institute only accept white students, which was changed in 1965. The institute was initially endowed with a promissory note for $200,000 to be paid upon Rice's death. Rice revised his will on September 26, 1896 and left the bulk of his estate to his namesake institute.
During the battle over the estate two lawyers became involved with the proceedings and would end up greatly influencing the final results. Captain Baker, a trustee of the Rice Institute, served as William Rice's lawyer. Albert Patrick, the other lawyer, was hired by Orren Holt in 1898 to investigate the residency question in New York City. There Patrick met Charlie Jones, Rice's valet. The two spent a great deal of time together and slowly a plan was formed. At first it seemed that Patrick was only interested in the settlement of the contested will and was looking for any way to win. He convinced Jones, in the spring of 1900, to start poisoning Rice with mercury pills as a way to avoid a court battle. By the summer of 1900 Patrick came up with the idea to forge a will that left the majority of Rice's estate to himself and small sums to relatives and friends. The forged will was dated June 30, 1900.</p><p>On September 8, 1900 a hurricane struck the Gulf Coast and one of Rice's businesses, the Merchants and Planters Oil Company, suffered severe damage. The business manager telegraphed that they needed money for repairs and the sum was most of what Rice had available in his bank account. Patrick was worried at the loss of such a large sum of ready cash and he convinced Jones to use chloroform to kill Rice. On September 23, 1900 Rice was murdered by Jones. Patrick, in his haste to get hold of Rice's cash, tried to withdraw money from Rice's bank using a check forged by Jones right after Rice's death. The bank refused to honor the check since Patrick's name was spelled incorrectly. When calling to verify the check with Rice, the bank learned that he was dead. Since the circumstances were suspicious, the bank contacted Rice's Houston lawyer, Captain Baker.</p><p>When Baker arrived in New York City, he learned there had been a new will written up by Patrick. Baker was suspicious of the will since Rice had never notified him of any changes to the one Baker had drawn up on September 26, 1896. This suspicion led to a long and sensational trial where Patrick's version of the will was exposed as a forgery and the scheme to kill Rice was discovered. Patrick was found guilty of murder and forgery on March 26, 1902 and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. Jones, who confessed to his part of the events, ended up being released despite being the one who had actually committed the murder. Patrick's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the governor of New York, but eventually won a full pardon in 1912.</p><p>On February 6, 1902 Orren Holt settled the suit over Elizabeth's will for $200,000. After the trials and settlement, Captain Baker and the original Board of Trustees set about fulfilling Rice's dream to have an institute for higher learning in Houston, Texas. To guide them, the trustees chose an first president, a young mathematician and astronomer at Princeton University named Edgar Odell Lovett, who signed on as president in 1908. Lovett had earned doctorates both from the Universities of Virginia and Leipzig and had taught at Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago, and Princeton, the most innovative American universities of the time. The trustees sent him on a worldwide tour of the "competition," where he interviewed faculty, inspected facilities, and developed an inspired vision of what might be accomplished on the plains of Texas with a blank-check charter, a generous endowment, and high ambitions. The goal was a university "of the highest grade" that kept "the standards up and the numbers down." Lovett shaped the university that Rice would become.</p><p>The Rice Institute opened on September 23, 1912, the anniversary of Mr. Rice's murder, with 77 students and a dozen faculty. An international academic festival celebrated the opening three weeks later, a spectacular event that brought Rice to the attention of the entire scholarly world. Four years later, at the initial commencement, 35 bachelor degrees and one master's degree were awarded, with the first doctorate conferred in 1918.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The materials that constitute the Tragsdorf Panama Canal Zone Photograph Collection were created and/or gathered by William E. Tragsdorf, a native of Neillsville, Wisconsin, who lived from January 11, 1882 to February 14, 1948. The eldest of seven children and son of a successful merchant in Neillsville, he first after high school worked in his father's store. In 1903 at the age of 21, he enrolled in the Minneapolis Business College, completing the course in nine months and in 1904 writing a civil service exam for stenographic work. In August of 1905, he became one of the early civil service employees to be stationed at the Isthmus of Panama.</p><p>It had been only one year earlier that the United States, after supporting Panamanians in their successful battle for independence from Columbia, agreed to pay the new country $10 million per year in order to continue the work begun by the French for building a canal at the isthmus. Also in 1904 the U.S. paid the French $40 million for their equipment and excavations. </p><p>American engineers and the workers they supervised needed ten years to complete the canal, which was by far the largest American engineering project of that or any previous era. William Tragsdorf remained in the Canal Zone for the duration of the building and until 1918, when he returned to Neillsville. Over the years he advanced through several positions, finishing as a baggage agent with the Panama Railroad Company. He remained in the States during the 20's, owning a theater in Neillsville, which he sold, and working for the DuPont Company. In January 1932, he was back in the Canal Zone, employed by the railroad as a clerk in the records bureau. Once again he advanced through several positions, transferring to the office engineering division as a clerk in 1935, being named principal clerk in 1941, and retiring from that position in 1944. After a stay of several months in Neillsville, he settled in Cocoli in the Canal Zone where he died in 1948.</p><p>Excerpted partially from "Good Old Days" column in Clark County Press, Neillsville, WI, Feb. 19, 2003, pg. 23, http://wvls.lib.wi.us/ClarkCounty/clark/news/OldDays/2003_2_19.htm, accessed May 7, 2012.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Anderson Todd was born October 22, 1921. A formative experience in his youth was that at the age of 13, he spent four months sailing and learning navigation on the battleship USS Idaho, which was commanded by his father, Rear Admiral Forde Anderson Todd. From 1939 to 1943 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture at Princeton University. He then served in World War II, commanding convoys in the South Atlantic. After the war he returned to Princeton, where he remained until 1949, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in Architecture and serving as a Fellow.</p><p>In 1949 Todd was recruited by William Ward Watkin, the first professor of architecture at Rice University (then the Rice Institute) to assume a teaching position at Rice. He devoted his entire teaching career to this institution, advancing from instructor to assistant professor in 1952, to associate professor in 1956, and to full professor in 1966. In 1969 he took over the duties of Architecture School Director from William W. Caudill, who had headed the school since 1961.

Todd's effectiveness as a teacher was recognized by his being among winners of the university-wide George R. Brown Award for Excellence in Teaching (1968).</p><p>Among Todd's accomplishments as an administrator of the school was development of the preceptorship program to be a student's year away from campus working in an established, selective architectural firm. He also started Rice's Qualifying Graduate Workshop, a program that enables students with no undergraduate training in architecture to learn the essential skills quickly and then enter the graduate program, eventually receiving a Master of Architecture degree.</p><p>Todd's personal accomplishments as an architect include serving as architectural design consultant for the Ford Foundation's Chilean Communities Facilities Program (1963-64); being a planning consultant for Duke University and Southern Colorado State College (1963-65); working as a partner in Todd Tackett Lacy, Architects and Planning Consultants (1964-69);having his own firm, Anderson Todd, FAIA (1969-72); and being a partner in the office of Anderson Todd, FAIA, and William T. Cannady, AIA. He was elected to Fellowship in the American Institute of Architecture in 1972. His award-winning projects include, in 1966, for the design of his personal residence, an Honor Award from the Houston Chapter of the American Institute of Architects; two Honor Awards from the Houston Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1968, one for the design of Houston Fire Station 59, and the other for the Geophysical Laboratory of Superior Oil Company; from the Texas Society of Architects in 1975, the Honor Award for design of the Brochstein House (with Raymond Brochstein and William T. Cannady); and in 1976 from the Texas Society of Architects the Award of Merit for design of the Children's Mental Health Services of Houston (with William T. Cannady). The Superior Oil Company Geophysical Laboratory was also selected as one of fifteen nationwide winners of the "Architectural Award of Excellence for 1968" by the American Institute of Steel Construction.</p><p>A significant contribution made by Todd to the civic life of Houston came about when he was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts. He had long admired the style and design principles of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969), and he was instrumental in bringing Mies to Houston to design the 1958 addition to the museum. Todd said, "He was like any other good architect when I recommended him. The museum collection at that time was of high quality but low quantity. We had to rely on visiting exhibitions, so we needed a very flexible space within the rigid structure of the museum. Mies had a free way of handling space, and I found it sympatico."</p><p>On October 22, 2011, Todd turned 90. The evening before, a grand dinner was held at Rice University in celebration and honor of his life and work. He died peacefully at home on December 21, 2018.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Orlando L. Poole's mother was living in Richland Hill, Louisiana, in 1839 when she wrote to her son, who had traveled to an area about 19 miles west of Texarcana, Texas, where he had a land grant. Orlando became substantially involved in settling the town of Boston, Texas, which became the county seat of Bowie County when the county was organized in 1841. Government records show him as being appointed postmaster of Boston May 13, 1852. In his letter of 1854 to a sister-in-law, Mrs. Nancy Parting in Holly Retreat, Mississippi, Poole reports that he was then clerk of the district court of the county and a member of the Missionary Baptist Church. He added that the next year he expected to go into the merchandise business "with many friends at my side" with "fair prospects for bettering my condition, which by the by is not a very despicable one." Poole's letter shows that his father had written a will establishing quite specifically how his assets were to be distributed, and Orlando was well acquainted with the law as to how the share of an estate coming to a minor needed to be handled. Both Poole's letter and that of his mother reflect the difficulty of maintaining good health in the living situations of these people. They also reflect the support provided to their lives by religious faith.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Gertrude Barnstone was born in Houston, Texas on September 5, 1925. She received a Bachelor of Arts in English from Rice University in 1945 and also studied art at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and Stanford University Art Department. In 1953, Gertrude Barnstone was comissioned to create a sculpture of two large, curved aluminum pieces for the exterior of the U.S. Green Stamp building in Houston. She continued to contribute artwork to local exhibitions as well as create sculptures for private residences, working largely with steel, but also with wire, glass, mirrors, fabric, and other materials. </p><p>In the 1960s and 1970s Gertrude Barnstone took an active role in politics and social activism, championing women's rights and civil rights. She was elected to the Houston Independent School District School Board in 1964 and served a five-year term while achieving significant changes regarding desegregation and federal aid. </p><p>In 1969 Gertrude Barnstone divorced from her husband of thirteen years, Howard Barnstone, a prominent architect and co-designer of the Rothko Chapel. She began studying welding at Houston Community College in 1969 and worked at a factory making plexiglass skylights in help support her three children, a job that also provided the inspiration to incorporate glass into her colorful and intricate metal sculptures. From 1970-1973 Gertrude Barnstone was producer of the KPRC-TV educational children's program "Sundown's Treehouse" and from 1972-1973 served as Director of Development for the Institute for Storm Research, focusing on minority needs and representation in both positions.

<p>The Braes Republican Women's Club traces its founding to a decision by two women following an election in 1960. After the Republican convention of Harris County Precinct 175 in that year, Peggy Brelsford and Vandalia Van Osdall decided to form an organization for the purpose of motivating and informing fellow residents in their newly developing neighborhood on how to participate in local, state, and national political affairs. Efforts of the increasing membership brought about noticeable results as early as 1967, when Glenn Purcell, husband of one of the members and a past president, was elected to the State Legislature, the first Republican elected to that body in over one hundred years.</p><p>Another early electoral success was one of the Club's members, Kay Bailey—subsequently U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. She also initially was voted into the State Legislature. At the time of the Club's thirty-fifth anniversary in 1995, Senator Hutchison sent congratulations to the members and wrote, "I was honored to be a member of the Club while I was in Houston, and your support started my political career."</p><p>The Club continued to grow, and in addition to carrying out specific tasks to get Republican candidates elected, the members raised money through garage sales, took one- and two-day trips to places like the South Texas Nuclear Facility, and the Port of Houston and Seamen's Center, and held an annual Christmas party. The funds raised by the Club were donated to candidates' campaigns and to civic causes like restoration of the dome of the Harris County courthouse.</p><p>As the Club became affiliated with state and national organizations of Republican women, some of its members held positions outside the local group. In 1987 the Braes Republican Women were presented with the Gold Achievement Award of the National Federation of Republican Women at the 24th Biennial Convention in Orlando, Florida. The Club kept members up to date on meeting times, locations, and business through a Newsletter published generally September through May. Under its title the Newsletter has carried the statement "Proud of being the oldest active Republican Women's Club in the Greater Houston area."</p><p>
At the time of the thirty-fifth anniversary in 1995, the Club numbered almost fifty members. Five years later the fortieth anniversary was celebrated on April 18 with a luncheon at the Renaissance Hotel, at which U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was the guest speaker. Gradually as a result of relocations and deaths, the size of the Club began to decline. The 2010 roster numbered twenty-six. On April 16 of that year, the Golden Anniversary was celebrated with a luncheon at Bayou Manor, an area residence for seniors, which had become the home of at least one of the members.</p><p>Evidence of the Club's ongoing effectiveness in supporting Republican candidates is in the November 2010 Newsletter. It includes a thank you message from newly elected State Representative Sarah Davis, a Republican who had won the seat from a strong Democratic incumbent.</p><p>Chronologically the latest document in this collection is the November 2011 Newsletter, which announces the meeting to take place on November 18 at the by then usual meeting place, the Outback Steakhouse across from Meyerland Plaza. The program was to be opportunity to hear from candidates in the upcoming election who would be present. The Newsletter also reminded members to vote for Republican Jack Christie for the Houston City Council (the Club's candidate won again). Finally, this Newsletter includes a full slate of six Club officers for 2012.</p><p>Over the life of the Club, various ethnic groups have been active members, including the Asian American community. Mrs. Edward C.M. Chen has been a very active member of club, just as Dr. Chen himself served as Harris County Republican Party Chair in 2002 and later on the board of the United Republicans of Harris County.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Edith Norse Rogers (1881-1960), Republican representative for the Fifth District in Massachusetts, was the sixth woman to be elected to Congress. She succeeded her husband who had represented the same district for 12 years; she would occupy her seat for 35 years, the longest of any woman representative (June 30, 1925 – September 10, 1960). While her gender was an issue during her first run for office, it was muted by the declaration that the "office seeks the woman" (rather than vice versa). That Edith Nourse Rogers and her husband had been firm supporters of suffrage remained unpublicized. Ten years later, Rogers encourages women to address themselves as a distinct voting block to issues which affect them. Suffragists had anticipated women would have, as a substantial percentage of the electorate, a powerful affect.

<p>The Chinese American Citizens Alliance is an organization created in 1895 in San Francisco, California by a group of Chinese Americans who wished to celebrate their heritage and fight against the prejudice they were facing at the time. The Alliance's purpose was to provide support for the Chinese American community, as well as other Asian American groups, by linking the traditions and culture of their homeland with the ideals and customs of America. They also fought to represent the rights of Chinese Americans and were instrumental in improving the legal status of Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans across the country.</p><p>The Alliance's first name, "Native Sons of the Golden State," was replaced in 1915 for the "Chinese American Citizens Alliance" due to increased national interest. The San Francisco site became the Grand Lodge and acts as the governing body of the Alliance, with 18 existing Lodges across the country. </p><p>The Houston Lodge was established in 1954 with Edward K.T. Chen as the founding President. Along with providing a close relationship with the Chinese American community of Houston, the Houston Lodge has presented the Miss Chinatown Houston Scholarship Pageant every year since 1971. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Roy M. Huffington, geologist, oilman, philanthropist, and U.S. ambassador, was born Oct. 4, 1917, in Tomball, Texas. His father was also an oilman but died in an accident when Roy was 16. Enrolling at Southern Methodist University, Roy earned a geology degree in three-and-a-half years and then went on to Harvard, where he graduated with a masters and a doctorate in geology.
From 1942 to 1945 he served in the U.S. Navy as first ensign and then lieutenant commander. Returning to Texas after the war, he worked as a field geologist for Humble Oil (now a part of ExxonMobil) until 1956, when Huffington struck out on his own. Eventually Roy M. Huffington, Inc. was established into an oil and gas exploration company. He had saved enough money to cover expenses for three years, and for the first 18 months he did not make "a red cent," he said. Then, however, he hit oil in 17 of the first 18 wells he drilled.</p><p>Huffington's company, subsequently known as Huffco, grew to be a major independent international oil company active around the world. Observing that the geology of Indonesia seemed to resemble that of the Gulf Coast, Huffington suspected that oil or natural gas might be found there. Thus, in 1966 Huffco signed a production sharing contract with Pertamina to explore in the Kutai Basin of the Mahakam River delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The initial exploration objective was oil, but in 1972 Huffco discovered a giant natural gas reserve at Badak Field. Huffco and Pertamina collaborated to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Bontang, and the first shipping took place in 1977. </p><p>Subsequently Huffco joined forces with Mobil Oil Indonesia to expand the size of the Indonesia natural gas project. After seven years of this field's operation, Indonesia became the world's largest liquid natural gas supplier. In 1989 Huffington sold his business to the Chinese Petroleum Corporation of Taiwan.</p><p>In 1990 Huffington accepted appointment by President George H. W. Bush to be ambassador to Austria. He served in that post for three years, working to improve business ties with the former Soviet bloc. After his ambassadorship, he returned to Houston and resumed his position as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Roy M. Huffington, Inc., the independent international oil company that remained after the sale of Huffco to the Chinese.</p><p>While serving as ambassador to Austria he joined the board of the Salzburg Global Seminar, an international policy center, and in 1994, he was elected its chairman, a position which he held until 2007. Huffington also served as the chairman of the Asia Society, a New York-based charity, for seven years in the 1980s. His philanthropic activities were wide ranging, related especially to education and medicine. To cite a few examples, he founded the Huffington Foundation, a Houston-based charity, and he and his wife, the former Phyllis Gough, who died in 2003, established the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor College of Medicine. Having been a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at Southern Methodist University, he made a significant donation to the Alpha Tau Omega Educational Foundation, which provides scholarships for undergraduate members of the fraternity.</p><p>On July 11, 2008, while vacationing in Italy, Huffington died in Venice of natural causes. He was 90.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The person who primarily preserved the items in this collection is Nancy Cravens Chamberlain, born in 1932 to Mary Cullinan and James Rorick Cravens. Mary Cullinan Cravens was one of five children born to Joseph Stephen Cullinan, founder of oil companies culminating with what became Texaco, early civic leader in Houston, and resident of the Shadyside development, one of the original houses being his.</p><p>J. S. Cullinan was born on December 31, 1860 near Sharon, Pennsylvania, the oldest son and second of eight children. Beginning to work in the Pennsylvania oilfields at the age of fourteen, he learned essentially every task associated with oil production. At the age of 22 he joined Standard Oil and held several management positions before leaving in 1895, at the age of 35, to form his own company, Petroleum Iron Works, which manufactured steel storage tanks.</p><p>When oil was discovered in Corsicana, Texas, in 1894, Cullinan was sought out for advice on production and marketing techniques. In Corsicana he formed a company in his own name, which later became the Magnolia Petroleum Company. Cullinan was instrumental in introducing oil as a fuel for locomotives, the use of natural gas for heating and lighting, and using oil to settle dust on streets. In 1899 he constructed a refinery south of Corsicana, the first such facility west of the Mississippi. Also in 1899 he had an important role in persuading the Texas legislature to enact the state's first statute for petroleum conservation. </p><p>Shortly after the Spindletop discovery in 1901 Cullinan moved to Beaumont, where he founded the Texas Company (later Texaco). In 1905 he moved the Texaco headquarters to Houston. Losing his controlling interest of Texaco stock in a proxy fight with eastern investors in 1913, Cullinan resigned as president but remained active in the industry. He was instrumental in developing the Sour Lake, Humble, and East Texas oilfields.</p><p>From 1913 to 1919 Cullinan served as president of the Houston Chamber of Commerce and supported development of the Houston Ship Channel. In 1922 he was responsible for construction of the North Side Belt Railway around the city. He served as special advisor to the Food Administration under Herbert Hoover during World War I. Beneficiaries of his philanthropy were the Museum of Fine Arts, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, and the Houston Negro Hospital. He served as chairman of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Committee from 1928 to 1933. In 1937 while visiting his friend Herbert Hoover in Palo Alto, California, Cullinan died of pneumonia on March 11.</p><p>Members of three generations are represented in this collection: Nancy's grandfather's, J. S. Cullinan's; her parents', the Cravens'; and the generation of Nancy and her siblings, Anne, James "Chico," and Patsy Cravens. Nancy was married to Charles Devere Chamberlain, Jr. from 1954 to 1974. The span of time represented in the collection is 1907 to 2003. Nancy Cravens Chamberlain died in 2010.</p><p>As the eldest surviving child of Mary and James Cravens, Nancy was the preserver of records, photographs, and memorabilia from the two preceding generations as well as her own. In addition to, effectively, being family historian, Nancy earned a bachelor's degree in 1975 and a master's in English in 1980 from the University of Houston. She became known for generous volunteer work teaching adult literacy classes for ten years. She also tutored children at Gregory Lincoln Elementary School and counseled alcoholics and drug addicts.</p> </bioghist>

Walters remained at Rice through retirement in 1999 and beyond, advancing through the professorial ranks to chairman of the physics department, assistant dean of natural sciences, and dean of natural sciences.</p><p>Walters' areas of specialization were atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics. In the 70's he conducted pioneering work on excimer lasers that came to be widely used to print semiconductor chips. Experiments he designed and conducted using an atomic accelerator in the now gone Bonner Nuclear Laboratory at Rice formed the basis for very sensitive devices called magnetic anomaly detectors. This technology was used by the U.S. military to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. The devices were also used in space exploration vehicles. In the 80's some of Walters' research, sponsored by the Department of Energy and the Houston-based Robert A. Welch Foundation, included studies of the physics of high-power lasers for possible application in power generation by laser fusion, and investigations of solid surfaces important in industrial catalysis. Subsequent research of his has found practical application as an improved MRI device, which can image the lungs when a patient breathes in polarized helium or xenon gas.</p><p>In 1977-78 Walters was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which was followed soon after by his election to Fellowship in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition to authoring a wide range of publications, he has provided editorial leadership for the Journal of Geophysical Research, Case Studies in Atomic Physics, and Reviews of Modern Physics. He served as an elected member of the governing council of the American Physical Society as well as in other positions in national scientific organizations.</p><p>In addition to serving as a highly regarded teacher and directing 29 doctoral students, King Walters participated very actively in the structural operations of Rice. His committee work included the Athletic Review Committee and the Faculty Advisory Committee on Retirement. He was a member of three important search committees, for university president in 1984-85, for provost in 1993-94, and for librarian in 1995-96.</p><p>A distinctive honor Walters received at the end of his career was the establishment of a one million dollar endowed fund in his name. He directed that awards made from the fund annually are to be used for research innovation in the Rice department of physics.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Biology Department at Rice University formed in 1912 with Julian Huxley named the first Professor of Biology. His name is commemorated by the department's Huxley Fellows Program, a fellowship for recent Ph.D. recipients. In 1989 the Biology Department became The Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) Department; this transition is well documented in the Annual Reports leading up to and immediately following the formation of the EEB Department, from 1985 to 1992. Today the department focuses on plant/insect interactions, molecular evolution, genomics, and the biology of plants, insects, and microbes. Recent research has examined environmental issues, such as ecosystem degradation and global warming, and their actual and potential effects on the environment. The department offers M.S., M.A., and Ph.D. Degrees to graduate students and B.A. and B.S. degrees to undergraduates. The graduate programs seek to build strong relationships between faculty and students, while the undergraduate degrees look to inspire a sense of environmentalism within its students. The EEB Department is housed in the Anderson Biology Lab with a recently renovated greenhouse next to the lab building.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The original charter for the Rice Institute was drawn from an indenture written by William Marsh Rice in 1891 and stated that the institute would be open to "white inhabitants of Houston and Texas" for "free tuition". The trustees of the Rice Institute petitioned the courts in February 1963 as a request for declaratory order confirming that the board of trustees in fact already possessed the authority and prerogative under the Charter to amend the same (which multiple courts subsequently affirmed). The Rice Board of Trustees was unanimous in supporting this suit, claiming that such actions were necessary in order to carry out William Marsh Rice's primary intent to establish an educational institution of the first class. Rice President Kenneth Pitzer was also in full support of this initiative. Rice was unable to compete for grant funding because it did not charge tuition to students, and was under increasing pressure by the civil rights movement to admit students based on merit and without regard to race. Rice was among the last of the southern colleges and universities to admit students of color.</p><p>In summer 1963, two Rice alumni, John B. Coffee and Val T. Billups filed a petition intervening in the suit and challenging the trustees' position. In January 1964, a group of Rice University alumni filed a petition supporting the trustees' position and opposing Coffee and Billups. Later that month, Coffee and Billups filed an amended petition further outlining their points.</p><p>The case went to District Judge William M. Holland's court on Feb. 10, 1964 and a verdict favorable to Rice was handed down on March 9, 1964.</p><p>Later in 1964, the first civil court of appeals affirmed District Judge William M. Holland's ruling. In 1965, the first civil court of appeals dismissed an appeal by two Rice alumni, John B. Coffee and Val T. Billups (begun in summer 1963), ruling that the two men had no justifiable interest in the case. Coffee and Billups then appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, who sent the case back to the appeals court, claiming it should heard the case in the first place.</p><p>Tuition was charged to students who could afford it beginning in 1965. In fall 1965, Rice's first two African American undergraduate freshmen were admitted and began classes. One of them was a woman, Jacqueline McCauley of Houston. However, Rice's first African American student was actually admitted in 1963, when Raymond Lewis Johnson was admitted to the Math Department in pursuit of a master's degree. As part of these changes to the charter, Rice Institute became known as Rice University.</p><p>Prior to this charter lawsuit, Rice did on occasion ignore the Caucasian rule and admit male students of color, including Charles S. Chan of Houston who graduated in 1941 with a B.S. in architectural engineering.</p><p>In October 1966, the appeals court upheld Judge Holland's 1964 ruling in favor of Rice Institute. In February 1967, the Texas Supreme Court denied a writ of error in the lawsuit filed by alumni Coffee and Billups.</p><p>A 1982 lawsuit over the charter provision requiring all seven trustees to live in Houston was overturned. Further amendments to the charter were made in 1998, enabling the expansion of the Board of Trustees from seven to a maximum of twenty-five and allowing Rice to incur debt by borrowing money or using tax-free bonds to finance large projects such as construction.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Forming in 1916, the Rice Owl Band consisted of twelve members with interests in band activities and reading band literature. By 1922, when Lee Chatham became the director, the band had 35 members and grew to 50 under his leadership. Since there was a dearth of high school bands, some of the members came from the community at large.</p><p>During World War II, the membership of the band was unstable, which lead to the creation of a new band of Navy cadets under the V-12 program. After the war, the band reorganized and the all-male outfit added four majorettes.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s, director Holmes McNeely made the band co-ed, bought instruments, added personnel, and gave a small number of band scholarships. The issuing of scholarships continued under director Bert Roth (1967-1979) who provided work scholarships for participating band members. Roth also changed the focus of the band from a marching band to a scatter band.</p><p>Starting in 1970, the band began to infuse timely and sometimes controversial topics into their halftime shows. Into the 1970s, the band began to move away from traditional band uniforms and sometimes chose outfits that matched the theme of their halftime shows.</p><p>1980 brought Ken Dye as the new Rice Owl Band director. He added new bands like the Jazz Ensemble and the Rice Concert Band. In addition, he selected the mob-style uniforms to match the new name of the band, the Marching Owl Band (MOB). Dyer also promoted travel, even taking the MOB to the Opening Ceremonies of the 1984 Olympics, the 1986 Statue of Liberty celebration, the 1986 U.S. Olympic Festival, and 1993 Carnivale in Nice, France.</p><p>Currently, band director Chuck Throckmorton has continued the legacy of Ken Dye.

<p>The Intramural Sports Records, 1939-1995 begin with an October 6, 1939 newsclipping that reports the formation of an intramural athletic council under the supervision of G. L. Hermance, director of intramural activities. Representatives from nine men's clubs (including the Rally Club, Pre-Law Association, Pre-Medical Society, Engineering Society, the Band, Architectural Society, East Hall, South Hall, and West Hall) met "to organize and pledge support to a new intramural system which is now in the process of formation."</p><p>In addition to teams formed by the various men's clubs, in 1942 Pat Crady announced that there would be basketball for five women's teams: the literary societies E.B.L.S, P.A.L.S., O.W.L.S., the Girls' Club, and the Independents .Play was to start Nov. 20, and games would be played in the gymnasium at Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church across Main Street from campus. Also in 1942 six women's and eight men's teams entered a bowling league. Faculty fielded a team that competed in volleyball with the men's student teams. In 1943 there was a softball tournament with seven teams, one of faculty and two of N.R.O.T.C. Table tennis play was also organized with sixteen participating in a singles tournament and eight teams in doubles.</p><p>The intramural program continued with strong participation through 1943, but then it "became dormant" according to a Thresher article because of the stationing of a V-12 unit at Rice. During the war years because of short-handedness in the Physical Education Department, intramurals were stripped to bare essentials of organization.</p><p>However, in the fall of 1947, an intramural sports council was reformed, again with the sponsorship of Associate Professor of Education Gilbert Hermance. Activities in 1947-48 included touch football, fencing (including both men and women), volleyball (including a faculty team led by Mr. Hermance), basketball, and softball. For basketball there were 19 men's teams and five women's, specifically the four literary societies and the Girls' Club. Softball included an engineering faculty team.</p><p>In 1948 John Plumbley became the Intramural Director, and the Rice Girls' Sports Council was set up, composed of representatives from the four literary societies and the Girls' Club. In 1950 two additional PhysicaL Education Department members were assigned responsibilities for intramurals, Hally Beth Poindexter as Assistant Director for women's activities, and J. R. Barker as Assistant Director for men's.</p><p>1953 saw the beginning of a long Rice intramural tradition, the annual spring picnic (later barbeque) for all the participants who had won championships in the current academic year. By the time of the fourth annual intramural picnic in 1956, J. R. Barker was Intramural Director, and Hally Beth Poindexter's role had been taken over by Margaret Garrett. The women's literary societies had teams in a volleyball tournament. Joanna Hahamis became the Assistant Intramural Director in 1956-57.</p><p>Because of the meticulous record keeping of J. R. Barker and his practice of putting together an Intramural Sports Yearbook for every one of the 32 years he was Director, the activities of these years are richly documented. Student participation increased yearly, and the variety of sports offered also grew.</p><p>During the period before Barker's retirement in 1986, the greatest changes in the intramural program came about because of the creation and involvement of the university's college system. Though officially established in 1954, and dependent on construction of both additions to the existing residential buildings and an entire new building for women, the college system was not in full operation until 1957. Gradually the formation of teams for athletic competition shifted from student organizations like the women's literary societies and randomly assembled groups of students to the residential colleges. A December 12, 1958 Thresher column reported that J. R. Barker "credited the colleges with a fifteen per cent increase in two years in participants in intramural activities."</p><p>For a while there were many intramural activities that took place alongside tournaments composed of teams from the four colleges. For instance, J. R. Barker's Intramural Sports Yearbook for 1959-60 lists the following:
men's softball 19 teams
college softball 4 teams
women's basketball 12 teams
women's softball tournament
women's volleyball tournament.
In April 1960 there was a college rifle match which included teams from the four men's colleges as well as a six-member team of women from Jones College (which won fourth place). By 1961 the Jones women came in second in the college rifle match.</p><p>It appears that participation on a college team involved a somewhat higher level of play than did the other teams. The September 19, 1959 Thresher carried the announcement, "Note carefully- If you intend to participate on your college teams you must first play that sport in intramurals. This year plaques will be given to each college bearing their success in the athletic competition."</p><p>For the women, in 1959 the literary societies were still forming teams. The women's swim meet at 4:30 on a spring Wednesday was won by the E.B.L.S. In women's sports there were also teams defined by class—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. For instance in 1963-64 a women's volleyball tournament involved ten teams divided into two leagues. Both the literary societies and the classes fielded teams. In 1964-65 the O.W.L.S. and the E.B.L.S. had teams competing with four other teams in women's basketball and three other teams in co-ed softball.</p><p>In the remainder of the sixties, Joanna Hahamis's name disappears from the records, and by 1970-71 Janet Jo Robbins is listed as Women's Intramural Chairman. By 1975, June McFall had assumed responsibility for women's intramural activities. Also by 1975 the records show women from Brown College as well as Jones competing.</p><p>In 1980-81 Jim Hesson was in charge of women's activities, in 1981-82, this position was filled by Genie Lutz, and by 1982-83, June Dickey had taken it over.</p><p>In the spring of 1982 Lisa Widner began work at Rice. By 1983-84 she was Director of Women's Intramurals, and in 1986 J. R. Barker retired after 37 years at Rice. By this time the annual intramural picnic had become a barbeque and was in its thirty-fourth year. The records suggest that Lisa Widner moved into J. R. Barker's position as Director of Intramurals. In 1992-93 she was assisted by Bill D. Snelling, and in 1994-95 by David Krolow. This is the last year represented in the records that make up this collection.</p><p>Lisa Widner continued J.

<p>The Committee on the Undergraduate Curriculum is one of fifteen committees of the faculty. During the years represented in the records comprising this collection, the members of the committee were appointed by the University president. The committee was made up of eight or nine members, some of whom served for multiple years. The records include committee membership lists.</p><p>There were three parts to the charge that determined the committee's work. The primary one was "to review any matter relating to the structure or content of all the undergraduate curricula." These matters could originate in "the University Council, any standing committee of the University, faculty and student groups, members of the administration and others." It was stated that "the Committee will make appropriate recommendations concerning these matters to the University Council and the President."</p><p>The second part of the charge was "to initiate, whenever appropriate, reviews of the general curriculum, any of the undergraduate major curricula, distribution requirements and the like, and make recommendations to the University Council and the President."</p><p>The third part of the charge was "to prepare a brief, written report on the year's activities of the Committee at the end of the academic year and to submit copies of this report to the President of the University and the University Council."</p><p>In years subsequent to the creation of the records in this collection, the University Council has been replaced by the Faculty Senate.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Other Economic Summit (TOES), 1990 was the seventh in a series of annual conferences planned to coincide with the G-7, the annual meeting of the world's seven major industrial economies. In 1990 the G-7, also known as the Economic Summit, took place from July 9 to 11 in Houston, Texas. The Other Economic Summit of 1990 took place also in Houston on July 6 through 8.</p><p>The founding purpose of The Other Economic Summit in 1984 was to convey to leaders assembled for the Economic Summit, the message that economics "as usual" is leading to a number of undesirable consequences: disrupting cultures, degrading Earth's environment, and undermining people's abilities to join together in common practice to solve problems. From the beginning in 1984, the intention of participants in The Other Economic Summit was to demonstrate that the prevailing exploitative economic policies are not sustainable and are thus ill-suited to the modern world.</p><p>The Other Economic Summit of 1990 had as its overall theme "The Voice of the People for a Change," a phrase meant to be understood in two meanings: that the people are demanding change, and that the people, for a change, must be listened to. Each of the three days of TOES '90 had a different topic which was developed by panels and workshops. For the first day the theme was "Global Changes," for the second, "New Perspectives on Ecology and Economy, and for the third, "Democratizing the Economy." Running through the three days were six tracks: sustainable development, environmental and social economic indicators, Houston as microcosm, debt and trade, theories in "alternative" economics, and religious perspectives on economics.</p><p>It was intended that position papers on policy alternatives coming out of TOES '90 and collections of thematic papers coming from topical tracks would be published. A draft of the Report and Summary of "The Voice of the People for a Change," edited by Susan Hunt, is included in this collection.</p> </bioghist>

<p>In 1979, future Houston mayor Annise Parker gave Rice professor, Dr. Chandler Davidson, a note with a phone number on it. He then called and heard a man say: "the gay students on campus want to form an officially recognized student group." Davidson agreed and sponsored the group, which took the name The Rice Gay/Lesbian Support Group (RG/LSG). The organization maintained this title until 1986 when it was renamed Gays and Lesbians of Rice (GALOR). </p><p>To be more inclusive, GALOR became Pride in 1994. The members wanted to include not only gays and lesbians, but also bisexuals, transgendered people, and allies. During the 2003/2004 academic year, some Pride members created a new group called GATHER (GLBTQAs Advancing Towards a Harmonious Environment at Rice). The impetus for creating GATHER came from the Coach Ken Hatfield controversy in which the football coach made public statements about how he might treat homosexual players. Where Pride served a social function on campus, GATHER had a more social activist thrust. GATHER even had a meeting space in the Wellness Center. In September 2007, Pride and GATHER joined to become Queers and Allies.</p><p>Queers and Allies sponsored GLBTQ-themed film showings, sponsors speakers, and organized an annual drag show at Willy's Pub. In 2017, the newly created Queer Resource Center and Queers and Allies joined to become Rice PRIDE.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The history of Women's Studies at Rice can be said to begin in 1983 when Dean of Humanities Allen
Matusow returned from a conference in Wisconsin with a sense that Rice was behind the times in relation to this field. Under the leadership of Paula Sanders (history) and Elizabeth Long (sociology), women faculty from various departments—including sociology, history, English, and music—organized a joint study project known as the Faculty Feminist Reading Group, which met several times a semester and brought a few nationally known feminist scholars to campus for public presentations. In 1985 the university hired its first faculty member whose research was dedicated to Women's Studies. This was Jane Gallop, now a Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.</p><p>In 1990 Helen Longino, subsequently chair of Stanford University's Philosophy Department, was hired by Rice and guided establishment in 1992 of the undergraduate major in the Study of Women and Gender, one of Rice's first interdisciplinary majors.</p><p>Having become known as the Program for the Study of Women and Gender, the discipline added "sexuality" to its title in 2005. In 2006 the Program was made a Center, and Rosemary Hennessy, the author of three books on materialist feminism and sexual identities in late capitalism, was brought to Rice to head the Center. Establishment of the Center brought together various expressions of feminist studies on campus, including the peer-reviewed journal Feminist Economics, which was founded in 1995 and continues to be overseen by Diana Strassman, its founding editor. She is also director of the Program on Poverty, Justice, and Human Capabilities, included in the curriculum as a minor in 2006.</p><p>In addition to the undergraduate major, the Center offers the Graduate Certificate Program, established in 2004. The curriculum represents an educational philosophy centered on "engaged research." Majors can write a thesis or, beginning in 2008, conduct a research project in partnership with a Houston nonprofit organization. Director Hennessy explains, "For us it means a project that is developed in a collaborative and reciprocal relationship with the clients who are served by this nonprofit." In the first four years of this project, more than 40 students had been matched with 27 Houston-area nonprofit organizations. Research projects ranged from evaluating anti-bullying policies in high schools to educating low-pay workers about the labor laws in Texas. In 2012 the Sherry Matusoff Merfish Award was established to recognize students who show exceptional commitment to social justice or engaged research on an issue pertaining to women, gender, or sexuality.</p><p>To mark the twentieth anniversary of Women's Studies at Rice, on November 9 and 10, 2012, the Center held a celebration that featured a graduate student panel and a day-long symposium in which current and former directors participated. Present were Jane Gallop, Distinguished Professor of English, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee; Helen Longino, the Clarence Irving Lewis Professor and Chair of the Department of Philosophy, Stanford University; Paula Sanders, vice provost for academic affairs, dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies, and professor of history, Rice University; Helena Michie, the Agnes Cullen Arnold Professor in Humanities and professor of English, Rice University; Lynne Huffer, the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Emory University; Lora Wildenthal, associate professor of history and chair of the History Department, Rice University; Elora Shehabuddin, associate professor of humanities and political science, Rice University; and Rosemary Hennessy, the L. H. Favrot Professor of Humanities, professor of English and Center for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality director.</p><p>The Center has grown to include 47 faculty affiliates from seventeen departments and three divisions: Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Shepherd School of Music. Also included are visiting scholars, postdoctoral fellows, graduate fellows, graduate assistants, and staff. In addition to its many undergraduate and graduate courses, the Center provides two public lecture series: the Gray/Warow Lectures in Health and Well-being, and the Marian Fox Martel Lectures in Gender and Science. Beyond these series, other acclaimed authors and scholars are brought to campus for their contributions to the study of women, gender, and sexuality.</p> </bioghist>

<p>In 1963 Jones was the only women's college at Rice, and there was such a severe housing shortage that some Rice women were being housed in another university's dorms. In October of that year, George R. Brown and his wife Alice Pratt Brown donated one million dollars through the Brown Foundation to build a new dorm for women at Rice. The new college was established in memory of their sister-in-law, Margarett Root Brown, (1896-1963) who was the wife of the also late Hermann Brown. Margarett Brown was devoted to the fine arts as an art critic and collector and served on the boards of several of organizations. As a tribute to her love of the arts, the first floor of Brown College houses a wide variety of paintings and antique furniture donated by the George R. Brown family and others.</p><p>The College was dedicated on October 3, 1965 and was filled primarily by women who had volunteered to leave Jones College to start a new college. Since then other colleges have been added to Rice, and beginning in 1971 some colleges went co-ed. Brown held out as the last all female college until 1987 when it agreed to accept male members.</p><p>The College is an eight-story masonry structure on the northeast campus. The high-rise was devised to spare trees. In 2001 new construction will change the Brown College complex. An addition will connect to Brown College on four levels and will extend west of the College in the area occupied by the current Jones Masters' House.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Bobby Joe Moon was born in Cleveland, Mississippi, in 1944, the son of Chou Guie Moon, whose name became anglicized as Jew Guie Moon, and Sue Wong, his father's second wife, the first wife having died.</p><p>Since B. J. Moon is proud of his ancestry and has devoted substantial attention to preserving records of how his parents entered the U.S. from China, it is appropriate to summarize their stories of resettlement.</p><p>J. G. Moon was born in China in 1899, although his identity papers showed 1898. He arrived for the first time at the Port of San Francisco on September 3, 1908, but was denied admission on account of trachoma, an infectious eye condition. A Chinese Six Companies' attorney drew up a document which helped Moon gain admission the following year. After returning to China and saving another $1,500 to pay for passage, he arrived at the Port of San Francisco on July 13, 1909, and was finally admitted to the U.S. on August 25, 1909. Settling in the Sacramento area, he attended school for seven months and then began working on farms and ranches, learning to read and write English using newspapers, with farm or ranch owners' wives tutoring him after dinner. He also worked as a cook for 20 Mule Team Borax Smith's Tonapah and Tidewater Railroad.</p><p>In 1913 J. G. Moon went to work for the Sun On Chong Company, a grocery business in Old Sacramento, joining several people with whom he remained in contact as the years passed, one of them being a cousin, Jew Han Lett (J. H. Lett). Intending to start his family in China in the Gor Doi Long Village, in 1920 he applied for the coveted "Merchant" status in order to be guaranteed re-entry to the U.S. He received the classification in February 1921 and immediately left for China through the Port of San Francisco. Before returning on October 12, 1922, he married Fong Shee, who gave birth to their first son in April 1923 in the Village. Several years later J. G. Moon moved to Boyle, Mississippi, to join cousin Jew Doy Lin and J. H. Lett with other Village cousins to form Joe Brothers Company. The business had stores in the Mississippi Delta towns of Boyle, Cleveland, and Shaw.</p><p>Between May 30, 1931, and November 7, 1932, J, G. Moon was in China again, having returned to build a house in the New Village, the house that Bobby Moon visited in 2000. The elder Moon was in China again from March 2, 1935 to June 9, 1937. His first wife having died, he married Wong Sui Yeung (anglicized as Sue Wong) in June 1936. He succeeded in arranging for the immigration of Sue Wong and their two daughters as well as their first cousin Joe Y. Sing (15 years old) via Hong Kong and the Port of Seattle on February 11, 1939. They reached Cleveland, Mississippi, in February 1939, traveling by train from Seattle through Chicago. A son, Roy, was born in December 1939 in Boyle, and Bobby Moon in 1944 in Cleveland.</p><p>Bobby Joe Moon attended Cleveland High School in Mississippi, then studied accounting and graduated from Mississippi State University, class of 1965. In Houston, he worked for Metro Transit, as Manager of Audit, COntracts and Internal Quality Assurance.</p><p>In 1993 Bobby Moon became active in publicly challenging the method used by the Houston Independent School District to distribute spaces for students in programs for the gifted and talented. Because these programs had originated as part of the school district's response to federal desegregation requirements, race was initially a dominant factor in determining which students would be selected. The initial ratio was 30 percent black, 30 percent Hispanic, and 40 percent white or other races. When the Moons went through the testing and application process for their daughter, Laura Anne, to be considered for the gifted and talented program, she was not chosen. Bobby Moon was quoted in the Houston Post (May 25, 1993, p. A-10) saying, "We got a letter saying she qualified, but that there weren't any spaces open. We were lumped in with whites. I know my daughter would have had a better chance if she was considered a minority." He added, "I'd like to be called what we are—Asian Americans—but beyond that I'd just like to see things shake down more fairly. It's really frustrating that our racial classification is holding her back while her intellect is pushing her forward."</p><p>Subsequently two other parents sued the school district, charging that their children were denied entry in the gifted and talented program based on their race. In April 1997, the school district appointed a special Peer Examination, Evaluation, and Redesign committee which in July recommended that race be replaced as a criterion for selection with a matrix including test scores, teacher and parent recommendations, grades, and overcoming hardships. Research took place to determine how each of these factors should be weighted, and by November it was announced that the new process would be in place for the selection of students for the 1998-99 school year. </p><p>Bobby Moon traveled to China for the first time in 2000, April 22 through May 7. Among the places visited was his father's home village, Gor Doi Long, in an area about thirty miles northwest of Taicheng in South China. With the help of a Chow family tree made in 1983 by Moon's cousin T. Jack Chow of Cleveland, Mississippi, a villager led him to a cousin who, in turn, led him to another cousin. Together the two cousins led Moon and his fellow travelers (a party of four, including his wife, Jennie) to a compound of four homes constructed by the villagers who had gone to the U.S. and returned to build the compound known as the New Village. He found that none of the New Village homes were occupied and were locked. A fact he found interesting is that these homes are still considered the property of the respective owners in America and the property and contents are left for the most part undisturbed.</p><p>A key to his father's home was obtained from the village chief. The most important outcome of his getting inside was that on a second story wall he found a framed watercolor portrait of his father, as he wrote, "nearly perfectly preserved at an age that I had never known him to look!" Moon succeeded in convincing the person with the key that he had legitimate claim to the painting, and he proceeded to take it from the wall and bring it back to Houston.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Julian Sorell Huxley (June 22, 1887 - February 14, 1975) was a lecturer in Zoology at Oxford (1910-1912), Research Associate and later Assistant Professor of Biology at Rice Institute (1913-1916), and fought in World War I before returning to Oxford in 1919, where he conducted the famous axolotl experiments and participated in the university's expedition to Spitsbergen. He became Professor of Zoology at King's College, University of London in 1925, but resigned his position in 1927 to collaborate on what would become The Science of Life with H.G. Wells. He was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal Institution (1927-1929) while working with Wells, however after 1929 he held no academic position. For ten years he was a private person working to advance his ideas about the biological sciences not as a researcher nor as a teacher, but as a writer on scientific developments and their relationship to contemporary social issues. </p><p>From 1935-1942 he served as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London, allowing him to encourage solid research on animal behavior while introducing innovative methods for implementing his vision of the zoo as an educational institution. He continued his work as a writer and lecturer and was known throughout war-time Britain for his participation as a panel member of the BBC Brains Trust program. After World War II he helped form Unesco, serving as the organization's first Director-General (1946-1948). Here he set out a program cosmopolitan in vision, one concerned with mankind in relationship with nature and with its past, one in which art and science were equally valued. He also began to articulate fully the concerns which would occupy the later years of his life: the relation of overpopulation to poverty and ignorance, the necessity for the conservation of wilderness and wildlife, and the importance of the renunciation of parochial views on religion and politics. The remainder of his life was spent traveling, lecturing and writing in support of the causes to which he was devoted. Throughout his long career, he contributed significantly to the fields of ethology, ecology and cancer research, and acted as a powerful proponent of neo-Darwinism. </p><p>Anita Loos (April 26 1888 - August 18, 1981) was an American screenwriter, playwright, and author.

<p>Francis Jean Marcel Poulenc (January 1, 1899-January 30, 1963) was an accomplished French composer and pianist known for his mélodies, solo piano works, chamber music, orchestral works, choral pieces, operas, and ballets. Poulenc was a member of Les Six, a group of French and Swiss composers who had links with Erik Satie, Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau. </p><p>"Francis Poulenc has come to be considered the greatest composer of French mélodies of his period – a period that opened with the aftermath of the First World War and closed as recently as 1960. He set to music poetry by all of the greatest French twentieth century poets, as well as a few from earlier times. For 25 years the famous baritone Pierre Bernac, with Poulenc at the piano, toured Europe giving recitals, and also visited Britain and America. Thanks to their work, not only in the French repertoire but also in the general Lieder repertoire, the piano-accompanied song increased enormously in popularity in their own country; and in other countries they were very largely responsible for the present wide popularity of the French song repertoire." Exerpt from: Bernac: "Francis Poulenc: The Man and his Songs"</p><p>Pierre Bernac (January 12, 1899-October 17, 1979) was a French singer who became the most renowned interpreter of the French art song. He had a close artistic association with Francis Poulenc, who wrote many of his songs for Bernac. He gave the first performances of Francis Poulenc's "Chansons gaillardes" in 1926. He began appearing in recital with Poulenc as his accompanist in 1934, and they continued performing together until Bernac withdrew from performing in public about 1960.</p><p>Denise Duval (October 23, 1921- January 25, 2016) was a French soprano, best known for her performances in works by the composer Francis Poulenc.

<p>Dr. Madeleine Alcover was born in Casablanca, Morocco on October 27, 1938. She received a Diplôme d'études supérieures de lettres modernes (magna cum laude) and a Doctorate in French Literature (summa cum laude) from the University of Bordeaux. She began her teaching career at Indiana University from 1967-1975 before coming to Rice University in 1971. Specializing in 17th and 18th century French literature, she contributed to the current understanding of the life, times, and works of Cyrano de Bergerac, a subject she would continue to pursue in Paris archives even in the years after her retirement in 2004. </p><p>Dr. Alcover garnered international recognition for the five books she published over the course of her career, and of articles on Bayle, Corneille, Fénelon, Furetière, Guilleragues, Madeleine de Scudéry, and Voltaire. Her published books are: Cyrano de Bergerac (1968); La Pensée philosophique et scientifique de Cyrano de Bergerac (1971); L'Autre Monde ou Les Estats et Empires de la Lune (1977); Poullain de la Barre, une aventure philosophique (1981); and Cyrano relu et corrigé (1990). Dr. Alcover passed away on August 27, 2014.</p><p>Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac, (born March 6, 1619, Paris—died July 28, 1655, Paris), was a French satirist and dramatist whose works combining political satire and science-fantasy inspired a number of later writers. He has been the basis of many romantic but unhistorical legends, of which the best known is Edmond Rostand's play Cyrano de Bergerac (1897), in which he is portrayed as a gallant and brilliant but shy and ugly lover, possessed (as in fact he was) of a remarkably large nose.</p><p>As a young man, Cyrano joined the company of guards and was wounded at the Siege of Arras in 1640. But he gave up his military career in the following year to study under the philosopher and mathematician Pierre Gassendi. Under the influence of Gassendi's scientific theories and libertine philosophy, Cyrano wrote his two best known works, Histoire comique des états et empires de la lune and Histoire comique des états et empires du soleil (Eng. trans. A Voyage to the moon: with some account of the Solar World, 1754). These stories of imaginary journeys to the Moon and Sun, published posthumously in 1656 and 1662, satirize 17th-century religious and astronomical beliefs, which saw man and the world as the center of creation.</p><p>Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac.

<p>Frederick B. Rudolph was a ground-breaking researcher and a devoted educator in biochemistry who was hired to teach at Rice University in 1972. He died in the midst of his customary activities at the university in 2003 at the age of 58.</p><p>Fred Rudolph's most far-reaching research concerned the enzyme adenosine desminase. It was reported in the June 2, 1991 issue of the journal Science. Working with two colleagues, Rudolph found that an immune deficiency occurred when this enzyme, normally present in all body cells, was missing from B and T lymphocytes, cells of the immune system located in the blood, spleen, and thymus. One important outcome of this discovery is that it led every major producer of infant formula worldwide to add what the work showed is necessary for development of a strong immune system. </p><p>As an educator, Fred Rudolph was not only an effective teacher of his own courses, but also a leader in curriculum development nationally. For multiple years he was involved as a workshop leader in Project Kaleidoscope, an informal national alliance of individual institutions and organizations committed to strengthening undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education.</p><p>He was also a participant in numerous inter-institutional activities with the Texas Medical Center, among them the Rice-Baylor College of Medicine Planning Committee, which sponsored a pathway for qualified students to be admitted to Baylor College of Medicine after successful completion of a specified sequence of Rice courses.</p><p>Rudolph's efforts as an educator also reached out to pre-college-age young people. He established short summer residential programs offered at Rice to students in economically disadvantaged schools, both in Houston and in the Rio Grande Valley. The aim of these programs was to expose young people to the activity of laboratory research and to career possibilities in science and medicine.</p><p>In addition to work in his academic discipline, Rudolph made important contributions to the institutional life of Rice. He was a member and then chair of the Admissions and Financial Aid Committee for more than two decades.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Robert Schumann, German composer and music critic, was born in Zwickau, Saxony, 8 June 1810. While best remembered for his piano music and songs, and some of his symphonic and chamber works, Schumann made significant contributions to all the musical genres of his day and cultivated a number of new ones as well. His dual interest in music and literature led him to develop a historically informed music criticism and a compositional style deeply indebted to literary models. A leading exponent of musical Romanticism, he had a powerful impact on succeeding generations of European composers. Schumann died in Endenich near Bonn, on 29 July, 1856"--Excerpted from: "'Schumann, Robert', The new grove dictionary of music online", ed. L.

<p>Fred J. Stancliff for 63 years was the secretary-treasurer of the Rice University organization for all athletes whose participation earned them the award of the letter R. He and his wife Florence are credited with keeping the R Association operating through decades of Rice athletics that are referred to as "The Stancliff Years."</p><p>Stancliff came to Rice from El Campo, Texas, and as a freshman was captain of the track team. He distinguished himself particularly as a discus thrower. Attention to his expertise was drawn not only by distance records but also by a photograph showing him in position ready to throw. The resemblance of the photograph to a well- known Greek statue led to its being printed first in the rotogravure section of a Houston newspaper and then circulated nationally.</p><p>Stancliff was elected secretary of the R Association in 1923 when he accepted his first varsity letter. He continued in that position and added treasurer to it, serving until 1986. In 1971 the organization honored him with the Distinguished R Man Award, and in 1973 he was recognized with a tribute as "the man who has been the motivating and sustaining force in our organization for the last 50 years."</p><p>A Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering is the degree Stancliff earned, graduating in 1926. Until the Depression years he worked as a field and petroleum engineer. Friendship with a fellow alumnus who had been captain of the football team led to his being offered a job selling insurance for Southland Life. By 1935 he was given the opportunity to become a general agent for Volunteer State Life Insurance Company, a position he held for many years. </p><p>Sancliff died in 1995.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Reginald Moore, of Sugar Land, Texas, has created or maintained this collection of material as part of his work with the Texas Slave Descendants Society. Mr. Moore is an historian and has a certification in Community Economic Development from the College of Biblical Studies. He is also a community activist, and has a particular interest in prison reform and prison re-entry into society. He served as a correctional officer in the Texas Department of Corrections, 1985-1988. Mr. Moore worked in the Beauford H. Jester I and III Units, a prison farm located in unincorporated Fort Bend County, Texas. Jester I Farm was the first built by the state at this site, and was known as the Old Harlem Farm. Although convict leasing as a practice is believed to have begun informally in 1872, the State of Texas sanctioned the contract to lease the penal system to the private firm of Ed H. Cunningham and L.A. Ellis (Cunningham and Ellis) in 1878. In 1883, the land and system reverted from private to state control. While working at this site, Mr. Moore became interested in the history of the Flanagan House (former warden's house) and then in the Central Unit of the prison. Over time, this interest grew and became a major research area for Mr. Moore, who went on to found and chair the Texas Slave Descendants' Society(TSDS) in the early 2000's. Through the TSDS and on his own, Mr. Moore, has worked to gain recognition for the past abuses associated with Sugar Land's convict leasing system. In 2016, the Texas Slave Descendants Society hosted its annual Labor Day program and honored Dr. Ken Brown (University of Houston) with the Emancipator Award for his archaeological work and advocacy in Sugar Land. Dr. Fred McGhee was recognized with the Lifetime Achievement Award. In the previous year, Dr. Lora Wildenthal (Rice University) was honored with the Emancipator Award for leading her students in highlighting Mr. Moore's work through the Houston Area Research Team program.</p><p>Mr. Moore serves as a member of the RIP Guardian program for the Imperial Prison Cemetery. Mr. Moore's son, Reginald J. Moore, earned a B.S. in Criminal Justice from Prairie View AM, and has also contributed to this body of research. </p><p>Texas Monthly magazine featured Mr. Moore and his advocacy regarding convict leasing in the January 2017 issue, available online at http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/sugar-land-slave-convict-labor-history/.

At thirteen Girard was soloist at Trinity Church Choir, New York, and at sixteen he was organist and choir-master at Zabriski Memorial Church. He then went to Christ Church, Rye, NY, and following at Archdeaconry Church, New York City.

<p>The General Announcements (GA), also known as the catalog, of Rice University contains course information as well as requirements for admission, for graduation, and for all the individual majors and degrees offered by the university. It is thus considered the contract between the university and the student.</p><p>Records concerning revisions show that planners have had in mind use of the GA not only by current students but also by high school students in the process of planning their next step in education and by the school guidance counselors advising them. Consequently, one of the goals of revision processes has been to present the academic information as fully as possible while keeping the publication a convenient-to-handle size and in weight under one pound for economy in postage.</p><p>Records regarding the production of GA prior to 1983 are not readily available. Between 1983 and 1986 production was accomplished by a freelance editor hired by the University Relations office (precursor to the Division of Public Affairs, of which the current Publications Office is a part). The Publications Office has produced GA since 1986; in 1994 Publications Editor Chris Dow took on supervision of the project.</p><p>One of the documents in the collection is the report of the eight-member faculty and staff General Announcements Review Committee, which, beginning in 1994, carried out a revision process designed to 1) improve the information contained in the book, 2) improve the book's ease of use, and 3) reduce the total amount of information contained so as to keep the book from exceeding the one-pound limit for reasonable postage rates. While the committee's reorganization of material resulted in a more comprehensive and easy-to-use volume, during the approval process, the space-saving measures were all but eliminated and thus do not appear in the 1997-98 version.</p><p>For the 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, and 2003-04 editions modifications continued to be made for the sake of maintaining a weight of under one pound. These modifications ranged from eliminating information considered non-essential to using thinner paper, reducing font size, and reducing margins throughout.</p><p>For the 2005-06 edition a major re-design was undertaken, since it was felt that everything that could be removed without complaints from the various constituencies had been removed. The re-design consisted of using a different typeface, compressing spacing, and reducing margins. The Provost's Office also accomplished some condensing of portions of the introductory material and the sections for all students, undergraduates, and graduate students. The result was an overall savings of 70 pages over the 2003-04 edition and a weight of 15.5 ounces.</p><p>Christopher Dow's report of the sequence of changes made to GA in order to maintain a weight of under one pound ends with description of the 2005-06 edition.</p><p>GA continued to be published in hardcopy through the 2008-09 edition.

<p>These papers record committee work done concerning possible ways of celebrating either the one hundredth anniversary of the charter establishing Rice Institute or the seventy-fifth anniversary of the opening of classes, or both. The one hundredth anniversary of the charter would occur in the spring of 1991, and the seventy-fifth anniversary of the actual opening, in October 1987. It was decided that during the entire academic year of 1990-91, a major celebration commemorating the centennial of the signing of the Charter of Incorporation of W. M. Rice Institute would take place. A Centennial Celebration Committee was formed with Dr. Harold E. Rorschach, Jr., appointed as chair. In his October 14, 1987, charge to the committee, President George Rupp wrote, "The centennial celebration should involve all segments of the Rice community—alumni, faculty, staff, students—and the larger community beyond. It should include a variety of celebrative events—lectures, symposia, concerts, exhibits, dinners, social occasions—with the purpose of indicating the breadth of activities associated with Rice."</p><p>The Centennial Committee came to include two trustees, two academic coordinators, two operational coordinators, and chairs of subcommittees for symposia, alumni activities, student activities, ceremony, community relations, and facilities. Ex-officio members were President Rupp and four other members of the administration or staff.</p><p>The first meeting of a smaller steering committee was held Saturday April 9, 1988, at 9 a. m. in the Founder's Room on the second floor of Lovett Hall. It was agreed that regular meetings of this group would be scheduled at the rate of about one per month. The second meeting took place on May 19, at which time agreement was reached on six goals for the celebration:</p><p>1. Bring people to the campus (alumni, community, nation);</p><p>2. Provide a stimulating and unifying intellectual atmosphere;</p><p>3. Attract favorable media coverage;</p><p>4. Provide a setting for fund raising, either general or for specific projects;</p><p>5. Not overload the calendar; and</p><p>6. Unify the alumni through an outreach program.</p><p>The steering committee next met on June 29. Discussion centered on planning priorities, preliminary cost estimates for various activities, and subcommittee appointments. On July 6 Chairman Rorschach sent a memo to all department chairs informing them of the intended Charter Centennial Celebration being planned for 1990-91 and inviting them to submit ideas for activities like seminars, colloquia, and visiting speakers that would be enhanced with funds from the Centennial Committee.</p><p>By October 6 a steering committee meeting took place for the purpose of discussing ideas generated by the various subcommittees and the departments. This was to be in preparation for developing a budget. Another point to be discussed was the scope of the celebration, alternatives being a series of activities spread over an entire year, or a few days of concentrated activities in the manner of a celebration at Harvard that this committee had heard of.</p><p>The steering committee in December was awaiting "guidance from the board as to the desired scope of the celebration." The goal at this point was to place in the hands of the president and the board, early in the second semester, a proposal of preliminary planning and budget estimates.</p><p>The steering committee meeting at which specific figures for all of the suggested activities were gathered together took place on April 5, 1989. Cost estimates organized under four headings were $100 thousand for ceremonial expenses, $200 thousand for symposia, $100 thousand for special events, and $200 thousand for staffing, publicity, and media. Allowing an additional $100 thousand as a contingency and inflation factor brought the total to $700 thousand for what the planners felt would be a "significant celebration."</p><p>It appears that when the steering committee's report on the estimated costs of the planned activities was presented to President Rupp, his response on August 31 was an offer of $50 thousand as seed money (implying that soliciting would be required to raise more). When the steering committee met on
September 7, the members agreed to respond to the president that they considered it impractical to try to raise funds with the offered seed money so close in time to the centennial year. They proposed that instead, the offered $50 thousand should be used to fund department proposals and one of the suggested symposia, the one most desirable to President Rupp.</p><p>On November 2, 1989 the president met with the steering committee and discussed what was referred to as "the fund raising situation," apparently factors that limited what could be done to supply what was needed for the expansive program of activities initially proposed. President Rupp told the subcommittee that in the fall of 1990 the Rice campus would be the location of the international "Economic Summit." A conclusion was that the Charter Centennial Celebration should consist of one symposium in early spring of 1991, and perhaps a lecture series on the history of Rice architecture, an "expanded" Rice Associates dinner, and other ways of engaging alumni and the Houston community.</p><p>The steering committee met again on March 30, 1990, covering topics like a possible art show featuring drawings of Rice buildings, a "community relations" dinner for guests of President Rupp, and presentations on Rice history by Professor Joe Thomas and Professor George Williams.</p><p>The last record of a steering committee meeting is dated June 25, 1990. Topics were the form that the celebratory dinner should take and the intended audience for presentations on student history. The meeting apparently ended with a decision that these events would occur in 1991.</p> </bioghist>

<p>At Lamar High School in Houston, TX in the early 1970s, two friends, Craig Calvert and Cris "Ezra" Idlet started a duo called Neat Stuff. It was short lived. Craig and Ezra went their separate ways by the end of the summer of 1972. In 1973 they added classmate Connie Mims to form a trio. Wheatfield, began playing country-tinged folk music, mainly covers, in small venues like Tanney's and Steak and Ale.</p>

<p>In 1974, they added Bob Russell, string bass, who they met after a trip to the Virgin Islands. The following year Wheatfield began making a name for themselves in Houston, playing at universities, like Rice and University of Houston, as well as making appearances on local TV.</p>

<p>By 1974, Wheatfield added another musician, Damian Hevia, drums/percussion. That year, they performed at Liberty Hall and the Kerrville Folk Festival.</p>

<p>1976 was the year that Wheatfield made changes to its sound and its name. They began adding electric instruments and added more of a jazz twist to their sound. After receiving a letter from an Oregon band that claimed to own the name "Wheatfield," the band changed theirs to St. Elmo's Fire. At the time, they were working with James Clouser of the Houston Ballet to score the rock ballet "Caliban." The ballet based on Shakespeare's "The Tempest" influenced their new name. The ballet premiered in May 1976 to rave reviews and later travelled to Dallas and Chicago. It even came back to Jones Hall the following year.</p>

<p>St. Elmo's Fire enjoyed other successes that year. Notably, they performed on the newly begun "Austin City Limits" TV show, toured in Colorado, and played at Miller Outdoor Theater alongside the first cast of "Saturday Night Live." In the fall, Bob Russell left the band and Keith Grimwood replaced him on bass and vocals.</p>

<p>Throughout the next year, the band continued to tour. They scored another rock ballet for Clouser, "Rasputin," which premiered in April 1977. They attended the NECCA convention in San Antonio to increase their national publicity. By the next year, they kept booking gigs across Texas and beyond as well performed at Houston's Sidewalk Symphony, Rockefeller's, and the Texas Opry House.</p>

<p>Despite all of this success, St. Elmo's Fire never secured a recording contract from a major music label, which limited their options for venues and TV performances. Eventually, this fact took a toll on the band. Craig Calvert left in July 1979 and was replaced by Mike Sunjka. The band disbanded later that year.</p>

<p>In the 1980s-1990s, St. Elmo's Fire reunited for gigs at Fitzgerald's and other places in Houston. Around 2004, Craig Calvert, Ezra Idlet, Connie Mims, and Keith Grimwood officially reunited as Wheatfield and released albums in 2004, 2008 and 2014. They play shows throughout Texas, Arkansas and Missouri.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The music venue, Rockefeller's, began as way to cover the renovation costs of the historic Citizens/Heights State Bank building on 3620 Washington Avenue in Houston. In the beginning, Sanford and Susan Criner envisioned a performance space for local talent. Early on, they realized that local acts were not enough to fill the hall. The Criners turned to booking jazz acts and made a trip to Los Angeles to promote the venue to bigger names. The trip was incredibly successful. </p>
<p>From 1979 to 1997, Rockefeller's hosted great performers from a variety of genres: blues, jazz, rock, country, and comedy. Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Fats Domino, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Chet Atkins, Garth Brooks, Bonnie Raitt, the Dixie Chicks, Pee-wee Herman, Bill Hicks, and Timothy Leary all graced the stage. While ownership of Rockefeller's changed hands during that time, the venue always thrived on presenting Houston with a wide mix of talent. </p>
<p>As for the renovation, Taft Architects and construction manager Matt Pasternak headed up the project. The revitalized building, originally designed by Joseph Finger, won a Texas Society of Architects Honor Award for historical preservation. </p> </bioghist>

Her mother died in 1833 and her father moved the family to America in 1836, with Galveston, Texas as the destination in 1837. A yellow fever outbreak saw several sisters return to Madeira, but several siblings and her father did not survive. Kezia and her governess moved to Houston in 1841 where Kezia taught music in Houston's first public schools. She married Adolf DePelchin in 1862, but within a year they separated and never divorced. Kezia acquired immunity to yellow fever and nursed its victims in Houston and then in Memphis, TN and Senatobia, MS between 1878 and 1879. She returned to Houston and became the first matron of Bayland Orphan's Home for Boys between ages 6 and 12. In 1892 she was approached with three orphan boys too young to be accepted by Bayland, and asked friend Agnes Perry to supply a room for the boys' care. The DePelchin Faith Home was established, but Kezia died soon after on Jan. 13, 1893.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Reginald Moore, of Sugar Land, Texas, is an historian and has a certification in Community Economic Development from the College of Biblical Studies. He is also a community activist, and has a particular interest in prison reform and prison re-entry into society. He served as a correctional officer in the Texas Department of Corrections, 1985-1988. Mr. Moore worked in the Beauford H. Jester I and III Units, a prison farm located in unincorporated Fort Bend County, Texas. Jester I Farm was the first built by the state at this site, and was known as the Old Harlem Farm. Although convict leasing as a practice is believed to have begun informally in 1872, the State of Texas sanctioned the contract to lease the penal system to the private firm of Ed H. Cunningham and L.A. Ellis (Cunningham and Ellis) in 1878. In 1883, the land and system reverted from private to state control. While working at this site, Mr. Moore became interested in the history of the Flanagan House (former warden's house) and then in the Central Unit of the prison. Over time, this interest grew and became a major research area for Mr. Moore, who went on to found and chair the Texas Slave Descendants' Society(TSDS) in the early 2000's. Through the TSDS and on his own, Mr. Moore, has worked to gain recognition for the past abuses associated with Sugar Land's convict leasing system. Mr. Moore serves as a member of the RIP Guardian program for the Imperial Prison Cemetery. </p><p>Additionally, Mr. Moore has worked to bring attention to other topics such as modern day prison reform, mis-use of public funds, and preservation of Houston's historically African American wards and churches. </p><p>Resources of interest:

<p>The acquisition by Rice University of the Michael Heizer sculpture 45°, 90°, 180° began in a conversation between Mrs. George R. Brown and Chairman of the Art Department William Camfield when they were both members of a committee at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston around 1982. Mrs. Brown told Camfield that she and her husband wanted to commission some art for Rice and asked if he would help them do that. Mrs. Brown authorized the setting up of an account with funds from her estate, and a faculty advisory committee was formed to select the artist who would be commissioned to create the Brown gift. Among the criteria guiding selection were that the artist be a living American already established as among the outstanding sculptors of our time and that the sculpture created might be related to engineering.</p><p>A proposal considered to fulfill these and other criteria well was submitted by Michael Heizer with the title 45°, 90°, 180°. The intended work was to consist of very large granite stones supported by steel frames at angles of 45°, 90°, and 180°. Three seventy-ton slabs of Texas granite were quarried at Marble Falls and transported to Houston on three 36-wheel flatbed trucks in the first week of December 1984. The chosen site, the quadrangle of the Brown School of Engineering, had been prepared in October and November by the setting of concrete pedestals. Then on December 8 and 9 the granite slabs were put in place. One distinction of the sculpture is that its component slabs are among the largest natural objects to be transported by modern man.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Glenda Joe is a Chinese-Irish-Texan business owner, activist, and Asian festival director. She was born in Houston in 1954, where the Joe family has lived for several generations after immigrating from China in 1882.
Glenda organized her first civil rights rally at age 13 and has since been a prominent activist for the Asian-American community in Houston, serving as a consultant for Asian issues in the Houston Police Department, writing the Asian Merchant's Handbook to reduce interracial conflict in Asian-owned stores, and investigating hate crimes against Asians, to name a few. Her business, Great Wall Enterprises, is dedicated to helping Asian-Americans as well; it has done advertising and public awareness campaigns (raising awareness of immunizations, voting, the census) targeted to Asians, especially recent immigrants. In 1991, Glenda was the first Asian-American to run for Houston City Council; she also ran in 1993 but did lost both times.
Glenda has also been a strong promoter of Asian arts in Houston. She first got involved in HAAFA in 1980 at age 26 and eventually became its executive director. She has led HAAFA in running the Houston Asian American Festival 1980-2007, Lunar New Year Houston 2008-present, the Asian Performing Arts Gala, and other cultural programs at Houston schools and universities.

<p>The Houston Asian American Festival Association was founded in 1980 by Bill Joe (Glenda Joe's uncle), Bill &amp; Eleanor Der Bing, Daniel &amp; Akiko Watanabe, Dulal Datta, Phon Nguyen, CK Kim &amp; Glenda Joe.
In 1982, the project secured its formal nonprofit corporation status and has been led by various board members: Dr. Daniel Watanabe, Michael Chou, Yani Rose Keo, Rathna Kumar, Phan Duy, and Tony Joe Yeung. Glenda Joe has served as Executive Director.
Its mission is to preserve, present and promote authentic Asian cultural arts in free admission annual events for the City of Houston.
HAAFA has presented Houston's Asian American Festival (AAF) 1980-2007, and Lunar New Year Houston (LNYH) 2008-present.

AAF and LNYH are pan-Asian celebrations, bringing together the performers, artists, and cuisines of many Asian countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands.
According to Glenda Joe: "HAAFA was organized in response to President Jimmy Carter's first proclamation of Asian Pacific American Heritage Week in 1980. It was the first time Asians from all ethnicities convened to work for common cause in Houston. It was the catalyst for pan-Asian organizing around other civic and social issues affecting all Asians in Houston."
Between 1980 and 1985, venues for Houston's AAF were: Westbury Square, Sharpstown Center, Fonde Recreational Center.
In 1985, Miller Theatre's general invited AAF to present pan-Asian arts annually. It was the first Asian cultural arts programming presented at Miller Theatre. It was the only pan Asian cultural arts presented on Miller Theatre stage until 1996.
In 2006, Miller Theatre leadership changed. The new management, in a highly criticized action, singled out Houston's AAF for a "test case" for clearing out ethnic community arts from their annual schedule. While AAF lost its battle to present at Miler Theatre, AAF's legal protests and civic action precluded Miller Theatre from a wholesale ethnic cleansing of other small arts groups in its annual performance schedule.
By 2007, appreciation and understanding of Asian cultural arts and the maturation of small arts groups mentored by AAF was a mission accomplished.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Described as being "imaginative and with a feel for adventure," George Soloman Cohen was known for his generosity to the city of Houston and Rice University. He and his father bought Foley Bros. Department store from the Foley brothers in 1917 and developed it into one of the state's leading retailers. He served in various capacities for the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Symphony Society, Houston Community Chest, Young Men's Business League of Houston, and was instrumental in developing the first airline connections for the city as well as bringing the first passenger liner to Houston from Europe in 1925. He also served on the city's Generasl Arrangements Committee for the Democratic National Convention held in Houston in 1928.
Cohen was born in Galveston in 1885 and started at age 10 working at his father's store while either shipping out during summers on steamers sailing between Galveston and New York or on fishing boats off the west coast of the Yucatan Penisula of Mexico. He attended Ball High School in Galveston and Peeksill Military Academy in New York, but left to attend classes on advertising, window dressing, bookkeeping and accounting while working for many department stores before returning to Galveston in 1904.

<p>Carlos Salzedo (1885-1961) was a French harpist, pianist, composer and conductor. He began playing piano by the age of three, and wrote and published his first composition, a polka called Moustique (Mosquito), when he was five years old. At twelve years old he began studying the harp, and within a year was accepted as a harp student in the Paris Conservatoire. In 1909, Arturo Toscanini invited Salzedo to play in the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera, and Salzedo moved to New York. From the 1920s onward, Salzedo appeared regularly as a soloist with orchestras such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, and on tour as a recitalist, harp ensemble leader and flute-harp-cello trio member.
Salzedo is regarded by many as one of history's greatest harpists, and he was a highly regarded pianist, conductor, and teacher as well. His transcriptions and compositions were original and well abreast of the latest musical developments. He was a progressive spirit, seeking new tonal resources in the improved harp of his day manufactured by Lyon &amp; Healy. Salzedo taught hundreds of students during his career, and inspired other composers with his unique works and style of playing.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Liberty Hall was a music venue located in downtown Houston, Texas from 1971 to 1978. It was originally owned and operated by Michael Condray, Lynda Herrera, and Ryan Trimble. Hosting a wide variety of performers, including Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top, The Velvet Underground, The Ramones, Lightnin' Hopkins, Big Mama Thornton, and many more, it was known for its low admittance prices of sometimes only two dollars for nationally known entertainers.</p>

<p>Before Liberty Hall, Condray and George Banks, the future graphic illustrator of Liberty Hall posters, opened Jubilee Hall which became the Family Hand, a restaurant and entertainment venue. The restaurant was known for its red beans and rice, prepared by Thera Neumann, the African-American female chef. When Condray began looking for a new location to open with Herrera and Trimble, Neumann found the building that would become Liberty Hall. The building was originally a church built in the 1940s and later became the American Legion Post 391. On March 4, 1971, it opened as Liberty Hall.</p>

<p>Besides the many musicians that performed at Liberty Hall, the venue hosted plays and comedy performances. Cheech and Chong performed for a completely sold out four-night stand for two dollars a ticket. Cheech and Chong credit Liberty Hall for their success. Liberty Hall also hosted rock opera director C. C. Courtney's play "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" from March 23 to April 22, 1972. At the time, it was the longest running play in the history of Houston.</p>

<p>In 1974, Herrera left Liberty Hall with Condray following in 1975. Trimble stayed on until the venue closed in 1978. The building that was once Liberty Hall was soon demolished after its closing. Today, a parking lot near the Toyota Center sits where Liberty Hall once was.</p>

<p/>
<p>In April 1988, the society changed its name to the Houston Folklore and Folk Music Society. The group began using a shortened version of that name, the Houston Folklore and Music Society on a consistent basis in 1990, though the shortened name had been officially incorporated by July 1988.</p>
<p/>
<p>By June 1966, the society began publishing a newsletter that contained event information and articles about folk music. By 1968, the newsletter changed its name from the "Houston Folklore Bulletin" to the "Cotton Patch Rag."</p>
<p/>
<p>Over the years, the society also began formalizing their events. During the 1980s, they held monthly pickin' parties, which still continue. In 1980, they started hosting concerts, which turned into Second Saturday Concerts at the West University Community Center. These have continued to this day with a variety of national and regional folk musicians performing. Moreover, they hold meetings on the first Monday of the month at the Jewish Community Center, where the group handles business matters and runs a song circle.</p>

The Rice University Young Alumni Committee developed from an ad hoc committee of the Association of Rice Alumni in 1977. The intention was to organize a special group for graduates of the years 1965 through 1978 living in the Houston area. An initial get-together occurred on Friday, November 18 at 7:30 in the R Room at the south end of Rice Stadium. Respondents organized a 25-member steering committee, and on March 16, 1978, this group met for the purpose of planning activities. The most ambitious undertaking in the first year was a Friday-to-Saturday canoe trip on the Guadalupe River. 25 young alumni participated. By the spring of 1979, the committee decided that it would meet regularly on the second Thursday of every month at 7:30 in the Alumni Office. Membership recruitment materials over the years emphasized that the purpose of the organization, for which there were no dues, was to have fun and that it was not connected with fund-raising for the university.</p><p>
The variety of activities increased year by year. In many of the years there was a tubing trip modeled after the first year's canoe trip. Another early idea with a long history of continuation was a monthly networking gathering at Han's Bierhaus in Rice Village. Outing sponsored by the organization included a night at the Houston Rodeo (35 participants in 2005) and attendance at one of the summer Shakespeare plays at Miller Theater in Herman Park. At the time of Beer Bike there was a Young Alumni tent, which drew many for beer and pizza in addition to actual "regular" members. Another ticketed event was a crawfish boil linked to one of the baseball team's Saturday games. The records indicate that the steering committee had a budget to work with, presumably from the Association of Rice Alumni. The total for 2004-05 was $15,000. Expenditures were for printing and postage for mailed information, refreshments at pre-game gatherings, professional services like bartenders and security at Beer Bike, Beer Bike tent rental, service awards, and the like.</p><p>
The idea of establishing an award began with the purpose of recognizing outstanding service in the work of the Young Alumni Committee. It became officially named the Builders Award, which was given for the first time in 2005. Currently selection is determined by a twelve-member committee of young alumni who have made distinctive accomplishments in their careers and/or in service both to Rice Young Alumni or the University in general, and to the broader community. Awardees are announced at a Young Alumni event specifically for this purpose.</p><p>
The records constituting this collection end with the 2005 material, but Young Alumni continues as an organization within the Association of Rice Alumni. The A.R.A. website states, "Everyone who has earned an undergraduate degree from Rice within the last 11 years is considered part of the Young Alumni group of Rice University." Leadership is provided by the Young Alumni Host Committee, and "Social and celebratory events […] are planned for Young Alumni across the nation…" The A.R.A. website also states that Young Alumni are 25% of the total alumni base and "represent an essential and rapidly growing subset of the Association of Rice Alumni."</p> </bioghist>

The Rice Department of Bioengineering was established in July 1997 and formed with the help of a Whitaker Foundation Development Award. Of the original twelve faculty, seven held primary appointments: Larry McIntire (chairman), Tony Mikos, Ka-Yia San, Jackie Shanks, Jennifer West, Kyriacos Zygourakis, and Mike Berry, holding the joint appointment with Baylor College of Medicine. The five professors with secondary appointments were John Clark, Timothy Harrigan, David Hellums, Joel Moake, and Frank Tittel. By 2008, the department had grown to nineteen faculty members and eleven multidisciplinary joint appointments with science and engineering departments at Rice, as well as forty adjunct and affiliated faculty members, primarily from the Texas Medical Center. The student population has grown to more than 115 doctoral students.
</p>
<p>
By 2008 the total research expenditures were $12.6 million. Since its founding, the Department of Bioengineering at Rice has consistently been ranked among the nation's top ten bioengineering/biomedical engineering graduate programs.

<p>The Rice Board of Governors approved the construction of Duncan Hall in 1993. Ken Kennedy,
the director of the Center for Research on Parallel Computation, a consortium headquartered
at Rice, said, "Computational Engineering is vital to the future of Rice and the nation."
The building was designed to be a state-of-the-art facility for computation engineering. The
goal was to bring together several related fields in Computational Engineering and foster
collaboration between them. Rice received submissions from hundreds of firms, but ultimately
selected British architect John Outram. Outram's design and approach were unorthodox and
exciting but also stirred some controversy. He imbued his design elements with a rich if
esoteric symbology and meaning. Outram wrote extensively about the philosophy and symbolism
behind the building's elaborate and colorful design, and his essays can be found be found on
his website. The budget for the project was set at $16.5 million. The Groundbreaking
Ceremony was held on November 4th, 1994, and featured an exhibition of robots built by grade
school students. Construction was completed late in 1996 and the building opened on November
4th. The building is named after Anne and Charles Duncan, Jr. Charles was a former chairman
of the University's Board. Duncan Hall is currently a flagship building for the George R.
Brown School of Engineering, and houses the departments of Computational and Applied
Mathematics (CAAM), Computer Science (COMP), Statistics (STAT), part of the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information
Technology, and the offices of the Dean of Engineering.</p>

Jones. </p><p> Before graduating from the University of Texas, Jones was called to activie duty by the Army. He trained in Kentucky, North Carolina and Louisiana before shipping out to England and Ireland. During duty in Tunisia, Jones and his unit were captured by the Germans. Considered MIA/POW, Jones was transported to a prisoner of war camp, Oflag 64, in Szubin, Poland in June 1943 and remained there until 1945 when Germans force-marched prisoners deeper into Germany to flee Russians entering Poland. Jones returned to Houston following D-Day, and in Oct. 1945 married Winifred Small. </p><p> Jones went to work for the Houston Chronicle, owned by his uncle Jesse H. Jones. He gradually assumed greater responsibilities for Jesse Jones Interests and upon Jesse's death assumed full stewardship, which included Houston Endowment, Inc. He resigned his position as president of Houston Endowment in 1965 and served as president of Houston Chronicle from 1950 until 1966 from which he resigned to pursue oversight of KTRH Radio and KTRK Television as president of the Rusk Corporation. As a major Houston philanthropist, Jones gave time and energy to many local and national organizations, including National Conference of Chirstians and Jews, United Negro College Fund, Variety Boys Club, Society for the Performing Arts and Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing ARts. Jones continued his business and community activities in Houston until his death in 1994.</p> </bioghist>

The C.D. Broad exchange program started as the brainchild of Frank Abraham, founder of the Abraham Student Aid Foundation Inc., who had attended Trinity College, Cambridge in his youth and felt that an exchange between the renowned British college and Rice University would be a worthwhile project to support. Originally intended to be a three-year direct exchange program, the foundation ended up sending one student overseas at a time with the United States and England alternating as host every year from 1962 to present day.
</p>
<p>
The first exchange was between G. Lindsey Buchanan, 21-year-old graduate of Cambridge University, and James Sears McGee, 19-year-old Rice student. Though he stayed in a dormitory during his time at Rice, Lindsey was hosted by the McGees while he studied Industrial Management.

<p>Camp Logan was an emergency training center in World War I, located on the earlier site of
a National Guard Camp just beyond the western city limits of Houston. It was named for Major
General John A. Logan, a prominent Civil War Union officer. The land was leased by the
United States from the Hogg family who, by World War I had assembled the block of land that
includes Memorial Park in their vast real estate holdings. Construction of the center began
on July 24, 1917 in the area that is now Memorial Park. The developed area of Camp Logan was
3,002 acres within a tract of 9,560 acres. Camp Logan operated as a military establishment
for 20 months, from 1917 - 1919. </p>
<p>During construction, members of the 3rd Batallion, 24th Infantry (Black troops commanded by
white officers) were assigned to the Camp as guards and were stationed about a mile to the
east. The Black soldiers' August 23, 1917 armed revolt in response to Houston's Jim Crow
laws and police harassment resulted in the camp's most publciized incident, the "Houston
Mutiny and Riot of 1917."</p>
<p>On March 20, 1919 the camp was turned over to the U.S. Public Health Service. In 1919 a
building at Camp Logan, used by the American Red Cross during the war, was converted into a
hospital for charity purposes. Shortly after World War I, Mike and Will Hogg regained
possession of the tract on which Camp Logan was built. The City of Houston acquired the
property from them for the development of Memorial Park in 1925. </p>

<p>A Persian miniature is a small painting, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works. The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western and Byzantine traditions of miniatures in illuminated manuscripts, which probably had an influence on the origins of the Persian tradition.The art of miniature painting in Persia [now Iran] flourished from the 13th through the 16th centuries. Having been taken from their context, the specific location and date of their original creation or use is difficult to determine.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Although the goal of establishing a business school at Rice had been set in the sixties during the admihnistration of University President Kenneth Pitzer, the challenge of raising sufficient funds was not fully met until large gifts like a pledge of $5 million by Houston Endowment, Inc. had been secured in the mid-70's. The intent of this gift was to honor the memory of Jesse H. Jones, one of Houston's most important business and civic leaders and the founder of the Endowment. Thus, the Rice Board named the new school the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Administration. In April 1876 Robert R. Sterling, already at Rice as the first Jesse H. Jones Professor of Management and chairman of the accounting department, was named the first dean. In this early period there were two main goals: to develop a coherent curriculum and to build on the Houston Endowment $5 million gift to raise the endowment to levels adequate to support the school's ongoing expenses. </p><p>Classes began with 55 students in 1977. Two degrees were offered, the Master of Business and Public Management and the Master of Accounting. In July 1980 Dean Sterling left the Jones, School, having built an excellent faculty, attracted good students, and seen the school begin to achieve a solid reputation in the Houston area.</p><p>The primary goal of a second phase, which was to last through the next 15 years and the next two deans, was to realize the ambition for national prominence. Dean Sterling was succeeded by Doug Tuggle, who had been the school's associate dean since 1978 and interim dean in the 1980-81 academic year. He served until 1987, when Rice chose former Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar to lead the school. In the intervening period the school moved away from its intense focus on public policy, and in the fall of 1985 the university faculty approved a change in the degree offered by the Jones School from Master of Business Management and Public Management to Master of Business Administration. Additionally, the school opened its own placement office (instead of depending on the university's placement personnel). After a major fundraising effort, the goal of $10 million for a new building and an endowment for its maintenance was reached. Herring Hall, the Jones' School new home, was completed in 1984.</p><p>Dean Bailar's administration, lasting until his retirment in 1997, was a period of gradual improvements in program offerings including cooperation with Rice's George R. Brown School of Engineering to offer a joint MBA/Master of Engineering degree. However, the challenges were still not enough to bring the Jones School to the level of being regarding nationally as an elite program.</p><p>The arrival of Rice's sixth president, Malcolm Gillis, in 1993, along with Dean Bailar's 1995 paper "Recognition for Excellence," prompted a thorough review of the school. The conclusion of the review was that the Jones School should either "embark on a course of becoming recognized for world-class distinctiveness and quality in management education, or it should decide to close its doors." Determination to follow the first of these alternatives led to commitment by President Gillis and a steering committee to make changes that would take advantage of the school's unique situation in relation to the Houston business community.</p><p>The retirement of Dean Bailar was followed by selection of Gilbert R. Whitaker, Jr., a 1953 Rice graduate who as dean of the University of Michigan Business School for nearly 12 years had led that institution to become one of the top business schools in the country. Dean Whitaker announced the goal of being ranked as a top-ten business school within 10 years. He began by leading the school to obtain International Association for Management Education accreditation in 1998. The planning included an increase in the number of studnets and faculty, which, along with changes in technology, made it necessary to anticipate replacing Herring Hall with a new building designed with state of the art facilities for a premier program. Ground was broken on the new building on May 23, 2000, and in August 2002, the school occupied was has become known as McNair Hall.</p><p>With these developments, the Jones Graduate School of Business, as it has been known since 2017, has come as close as at any time in its history to being the nationally ranked enterprise envisioned by its leaders since its inception. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Shearith Israel Congregation had its inception in 1899 when the Jewish citizens of Wharton, Texas, first met to conduct religious services, using members' homes as meeting places. Later, under the leadership of I. Ditch, a congregation was organized and Sabbath services were held each Friday night and Saturday morning in the lower floor of the old Masonic Lodge Building. The first Torah used by the congregation was ordered from New York by Mr. Ditch.</p><p>As the community grew and the number of Jewish families increased plans were formulated for the building of a Synagogue. A committee composed of Joe Schwartz, Ben Davis, T. Gordon, and M. Bernstein solicited funds and the Synagogue was built on the corner of Rusk and Burleson streets in 1921. The officers of the Congregation at that time were: Ben Davis, President; Joe Schwartz, Vice President; A. M. Smith, Treasurer; Herman Davis, Secretary; Trustees, T. Gordon, M. Levine, I. Kurtz, and L. Smith. In addition to the officers the congregation listed as members the following: J. Goldman, B. Leder, P. Alpard, L. Abovitz, S. Yarno, M. Berstein, D. Gordon, I. Kreitstein, and J. Abovitz.</p><p>At first the membership consisted mainly of Wharton citizens, but as the Jewish population increased in surrounding towns the congregation expanded to include those who lived nearby from El Campo, Bay City, Ganado, Edna, Palacios, and Richmond, making a total of 85 members.
In 1940, President Ben Davis headed a committee to build the Jewish Community Center. A tract of 2.14 acres was purchased and the building was completed in the fall of 1940. It was located just off the Bay City Highway near the city park.</p><p>Rabbi Israel Rosenberg came to Wharton to assume the pulpit of Shearith Israel in 1955, and remained the community's spiritual leader until 1978. A year after Rosenberg's arrival, the community dedicated a new, state-of-the-art synagogue building in the shape of a six-pointed Star of David at 1821 Old Lane City Rd., that was designed by Houston Jewish architect, Lenard Gabert. The construction of a Religious School building and the Maynard Smith Memorial Library followed in 1961.
Perhaps, the most notable and enduring feature of the property, however, was the barbecue pit. Shearith Israel's annual barbecue fundraiser, the social event of the year for the community, attracted hundreds of Jews and non-Jews from the area, as well as relatives and former members, who descended upon Wharton to eat chicken and coleslaw.</p><p>The synagogue closed its doors in 2002, when membership dwindled from a peak of 400 members down to just 39, and sold its facilities. In 2010, the main building burned to the ground, and, besides the community hall that still stands, visitors to the site today will see nothing but a concrete slab where the sanctuary and school once stood.</p><p>Excerpts from:</p><p>"History of Shearith Israel," Box 5, folder 10 and

According to its website, The Workmen's Circle is "a social justice organization that powers progressive Jewish identity through Jewish cultural engagement, Yiddish language learning, multigenerational education, and social justice activism." Founded in 1900, the institution was originally meant to present a united front and root traditional values in the new world for Jewish immigrants facing "exploitative labor practices, blighted and overcrowded tenements, ethnic rivalries [and an] unfamiliar new culture." Though its focus has shifted somewhat in the century of involvement in the Jewish Community, the Workmen's Circle holds true to the values that originally brought the members together: "Jewish community, the promotion of an enlightened Jewish culture, and social justice." Today, the Circle "[works] fiercely to remain a bulwark in the fight for the dignity and economic rights of immigrants, fairness in labor practices, decent health care for all Americans."
</p>
<p>
A long-standing member of the Workmen's Circle, Edith Winograd Stolbun was born in Houston, one of nine children of Ida and Max Winograd. She married her husband Bernard on Sept. 8, 1946, and together they raised three children. During her time, she volunteered as a driver for the Lighthouse for the Blind, and various other community programs, including the Jewish Welfare Board's war-time program. She had a close connection to United States veterans, having lost in combat one of the two brothers who served in World War II.

<p>Seven Acres is a not for profit, non-sectarian, certified and licensed Medicaid, Medicare accredited, and private pay facility that cares for the aged for the Houston Jewish community. In addition to being the only Jewish nursing facility serving the Texas Gulf Coast, Seven Acres is the largest long-term care facility in Houston and contains one of the most outstanding certified Alzheimer's Units in the country. Founded in 1943, the Home began as a small house on Branard street with only 14 residents. Rampant support in the community led to growth, and the facility expanded four times over the next decade and a half, bringing the Seven Acre's capacity to 98. The Home moved to its current location on the Pauline Sterne Wolff Campus adjacent to The Medallion Jewish Assisted Living Residence in 1977. Originally formed to fill a need that the leaders in the Houston Jewish community recognized, Seven Acres still provides a warm, caring and religious atmosphere for its aging residents today.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Gus Louis Levine, with only an eighth grade education, opened a very small general store on Fowlkes Street in Sealy, Texas in 1915, after he left Brenham at the age of twenty. In 1917 he bought the Otto Albert store (built around 1890) at 217 Main Street in Sealy. Here they sold groceries, hardware, saddles, harnesses, and feed. A few years later they had an Oliver tractor dealership and sold the first tractors in Austin County. Abe Levine joined the business after World War I, and Maurice Levine became the third partner in 1924 after attending Brenham's Blinn College. He pitched for the Blinn baseball team and was known as "Lefty" Levine. In 1928, they constructed an adjacent building of equal size. Two large archways were put in the partition wall enabling customers to go from the grocery store to a new "dry goods" store. The new addition offered men's, ladies' and children's clothing, shoes, fabric, sheets and towels, tables and chairs, and Samsonite luggage. The brothers were always looking for new ventures. In 1940, they started ranching, which developed into a cow/ calf operation. Maurice usually looked after the cows and also worked at the Wednesday cattle auctions started by C.A. Mewish of Bellville.</p><p>Gus, died in a train crossing accident on December 29, 1948.</p><p>From 1930 until the late 1950s, tokens and coupon books were used in the store in lieu of cash. Levine Bros. had a large number of share-croppers and farmers as customers, and this offered them a simplified manner of managing their accounts. This also fit within their scope of business since the Levine Brothers were the major cotton buyer in Austin County. Usually a family, depending on their cotton acreage and family size, could get about $10-40 monthly to be paid in full upon the sale of cotton and corn in the fall. Tenant farmers paid as rent to their landlords one-quarter of their cotton harvest and one-third of their corn harvest. If there was a crop failure, the unpaid balance would be carried over without question until the next year.</p><p>The store continued in this fashion until 1966 when Gus's son, Melvyn Levine, remodeled the building and converted it to clothing, footwear, and jewelry only. Levine Bros. closed December 24, 1994.</p><p>Excerpts from: http://txjhs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2015-Dec.pdf</p> </bioghist>

Congregation Kol Israel was founded in 1917 by members who preferred Orthodoxy to the Reform worship style at Temple Emanuel. Due to dwindling numbers, the two Congregations merged in 1971, at which time and Kol Israel constructed a separate chapel in the Sunday school building of the Temple Emanuel complex. Due to this merger, Temple Emanuel grew from 175 contributing members in 1970 to 223 in 1976. The family belonged to Congregation Kol Israel prior to 1971 and continued at Temple Emanuel.

<p>Steven Fenberg's grandparents Eleanor and Bennett Fenberg moved to Houston, Texas from Detroit, Michigan in 1944, and bought a home and acreage on Post Oak Road near what is now Evergreen Street and Loop 610. They purchased Nolen Jewelry Company from Felix Nolen, who started the company decades earlier by selling watches door-to-door. Eleanor and Bennett returned to Detroit in 1950 after Steven Fenberg's father Morton returned from military service during World War II and assumed the business. Morton's brother L. Bennett (Elby) Fenberg and brother-in-law Marvin Barish also moved to Houston and participated in the new family business. The family's first store was located in Jesse Jones's 1914 two-floor Wells Fargo building at Capitol and Travis, where the 70-floor Chase Tower now stands.</p><p>Steven Fenberg attended Edgar Odell Lovett Elementary School, Albert Sidney Johnston Junior High School and Bellaire High School in Houston. During high school he volunteered at the Jewish Community Center where he established the Hikers and the Night Owls—social groups for special- needs children and young adults. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in business, Fenberg joined the family business, which his father had expanded statewide. Fenberg later volunteered as the speaker's bureau coordinator at AIDS Foundation Houston in the late 1980s when AIDS was emerging, and he began writing editorials for newspapers and magazines. In the early 1990s he left the family business and pursued a career as a writer. </p><p>Fenberg began working in 1993 at Houston Endowment—the philanthropic foundation established by Jesse H. and Mary Gibbs Jones in 1937—to write a biographical sketch about the Joneses for the foundation's annual report. He then created a permanent exhibit about the Joneses for the foundation's new offices in the Chase Tower—the 70-floor skyscraper that replaced the small building where his family's first store had been located. Fenberg conducted an oral history program to record memories of people who knew the Joneses and was the executive producer and co-writer of "Brother, Can You Spare a Billion? The Story of Jesse H. Jones," an Emmy Award-winning PBS documentary film narrated by Walter Cronkite. Following the film, Fenberg wrote "Unprecedented Power: Jesse Jones, Capitalism and the Common Good," which was published by Texas A&amp;M University Press in 2011. In addition to managing projects to restore and maintain knowledge about Jesse Jones, Fenberg produced the foundation's 200-plus page annual report for many years. He retired from Houston Endowment in 2013, and in 2022 returned to the foundation to help oversee the distribution of art and artifacts from its Chase Tower location in anticipation of Houston Endowment's move to new headquarters where Fenberg will curate and produce a new permanent exhibit about Jesse H. and Mary Gibbs Jones.</p><p>In 2016 Fenberg was executive producer and wrote "Remarkable Experiences," a documentary film celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts and its influence on the performing arts in Houston. In 2019 he was executive producer and wrote "Ever Open," a documentary film celebrating the 75th anniversary of Congregation Emanu El, of which his grandparents Bennett and Eleanor Fenberg were founding members.</p><p>Fenberg is an active volunteer, public speaker and writer who most recently helped the Coalition for a National Infrastructure Bank promote a government-based lending institution to duplicate the strategies and successes of the RFC, the federal government bank chaired by Jesse Jones that saved capitalism during the Great Depression and militarized industry in time to fight and win World War II. He previously served on the advisory boards of AIDS Foundation Houston; the American Red Cross Museum in Washington, D.C.; Houston History Magazine; and No More Victims, a support agency for the children of incarcerated parents. He served as a trustee and is now an honorary trustee of the Aubrey and Sylvia Farb Community Service Fund.</p><p>Fenberg's collection covers his personal and professional life and includes material about Jesse Holman Jones. Jesse Jones, born in 1874 on his father's tobacco farm in rural Tennessee, moved to Houston in 1898 to manage his Uncle M.T. Jones's vast estate of timberland, sawmills and lumberyards. In partnership with the City of Houston, in 1906 he developed the streets in today's Midtown and began building small houses to sell on unique long-term installment plans so people with modest means could afford to buy homes. With the income from the mortgages and loans from Rice Institute (now Rice University) Jones built Houston's first three skyscrapers, each 10-floors tall. The Houston Chronicle building brought him a half-interest in the newspaper, which he later bought outright. The Texas Company building brought Texaco and the petroleum industry to Houston. The Bristol Hotel gave Houston one of its first luxury hotels. Jones would later fill up Houston's Main Street with its most ornate movie theaters, its most luxurious hotels and its tallest office towers. He also built significant skyscrapers in Fort Worth, Texas and New York City.</p><p>Jones raised Houston's half of the funds to develop the Houston Ship Channel and served as first chairman of the Houston Harbor Board. He served as Director General of Military Relief for the American Red Cross during World War I and afterwards became active in the Democratic National Party. He was the Party's finance chair from 1924 to 1928, and in 1928 brought the Democratic National Convention to Houston, the first major political convention to be held in the South since before the Civil War and one of the first to be widely received over radio.</p><p>President Herbert Hoover appointed Jones to the bi-partisan board of the RFC when he established it in 1932 to combat the calamity of the Great Depression. Shortly after his inauguration President Franklin Roosevelt made Jones RFC chair. Through judicious lending Jones and the RFC salvaged the United States economy during the Great Depression and militarized industry in time to fight and win World War II. As RFC chair, Jones was considered to be, after President Roosevelt, the most powerful person in the nation. He also served as secretary of commerce from 1940 to 1945. </p><p>Materials associated with Audrey Jones Beck—the Joneses' granddaughter—are included in the collection. Audrey and her husband John amassed the Audrey and John A. Beck Collection of impressionist and post-impressionist masterpieces, which Audrey donated to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston after her husband's death. </p><p>Materials about Fenberg's family are also part of the archive. Fenberg's aunt Shirley Fenberg Barish, who moved to Houston with Eleanor and Bennett in 1944, became an acclaimed Jewish educator. Her husband Marvin Barish, who developed the Chair King into a national outdoor furniture store chain, is a prominent philanthropist in the Houston Jewish community. Fenberg's uncle Elby Fenberg served in World War II as a member of the 163rd Signal Corps and filmed the iconic explosion of the swastika on top of the Nuremberg Stadium and the capture of Berchtesgaren and Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Elby and his wife Marilyn managed Nolen's in West University on University Boulevard for many years and in the 1960s and 70s the store was known for its large selection of charms and bracelets. </p><p>Fenberg's father Morton grew up with his brother Elby and sister Shirley in Detroit, Michigan, with their parents Lillian and Jacob Albert Fenberg. His parents passed away when he and his siblings were young. Their aunt and uncle, Eleanor and Bennett Fenberg—Jacob's brother—adopted the three children. Morton and the family worked at the Colonial, his father's large department store in downtown Detroit on State Street, which Bennett took over after Jacob's death. Morton enlisted in the Army in 1941 and was honorably discharged as a Captain in 1946. After the war he served as the president of Nolen Jewelry Company and Phototex Sales Corp. He was a principal partner and developer of Bridge Harbor Marina, the first full-service marina developed in the early 1960s on the Texas Gulf Coast. </p><p>Fenberg's mother Lenore grew up in Brooklyn, New York and Rocky Mount, North Carolina, with her parents Lottie and Harry Berkowitz and brother Kenneth. She met her future husband Morton on a blind date while she was attending William and Mary College in Richmond, Virginia. They married in 1943 and had two children: Steven and his older brother Jay, who married Carole Mannheimer. Lenore was a community volunteer, the first woman of her generation to serve on the executive board of Congregation Emanu El and was a master salesperson who worked on sales floors until she was 86. </p><p>The three couples—Morton and Lenore, Shirley and Marvin and Elby and Marilyn—settled after World War II in Bellaire, Texas near Bennett and Eleanor's house on Post Oak Road and had eight children, who all attended Houston public schools and Congregation Emanu El. The three couples were part of the Big Eight Supper Club, which was established in 1950 by eight Jewish couples in Houston. The Club had a "scrambled supper" every month for over 60 years. Fenberg's collection contains two Big Eight scrapbooks.</p><p>Harry De Jonge, Fenberg's partner since 1993, grew up in Aalst, Belgium, with his parents Denise and Richard De Jonge and his brother Walter. Harry moved to the Netherlands in the 1970s, first attended the Academy of Dramatic Art in Utrecht and later became a registered nurse and practiced until he retired in 2010.

Named after Ethel Freda Kaczer, Temple Freda is one of the three oldest religious buildings still in use in Bryan, Texas, where it was restored by a group of citizens in 2013. Temple Freda is on the National Register of Historic Places of Texas and is used today as a center for community activities such as weddings, small receptions, and educational activities.
</p>
<p>
Temple Freda maintains close connections with Jewish congregations in the area. When Texas A and M University Hillel opened up a building in College Station in 1958, many members of the then-temple began to attend services at the Hillel foundation building, which houses Temple Freda's Torah. Other congregants joined Congregation Beth Shalom when it was founded in 1968, and Temple Freda's cemetery is now under that congregation's care. The temple has also been a focus for Texas A and M University's Center of Heritage Conservation since 1982.

Born in 1856, Robert I. Cohen was raised in London, England. He left school at a young age to work at his father's antique shop, immigrating to the United States in 1872 through Boston, where he joined a mercantile firm. Cohen spent the next five years travelling, eventually settling in Galveston, where he worked for four years under merchants Levy and Weiss. He left to start his own business with a succession of partners over several years. Cohen married Agnes Lord in 1882, and together they had three children.
</p>
<p>
In 1889 Cohen founded "Robert I Cohen," a men's clothing store, a venture that quickly proved successful as Cohen made his mark with innovations in advertising and window displays. The store evolved over several years into a leading department store as Cohen added merchandise. Subsequently, Cohen organized Galveston's first Retail Merchants Organization, and in 1917 purchased the Foley Brothers Dry Goods store of Houston with his son—explosive growth leading the store to become one of the largest department stores in the South and Southwest.
</p>
<p>
In 1919 Cohen became secretary and treasurer of the Houston Mill and Elevator Company, of which he eventually became president. Cohen also served as treasurer of the Hebrew Benevolent Society and of the United Charities of Galveston, as well as president of Congregation B'nai Israel for thirty years. He died on October 15, 1934, and was buried in the Hebrew Benevolent Association Cemetery.

Born, on September 11, 1946, in Comanche, Texas, Shirley Wetzel spent much of her youth travelling around the United States with her mother and sister to accommodate her father's career in the Navy. When he retired, the family settled in Texas, where Shirley graduated from South Oak Cliff High School before attending two years at Navarro College, then finishing her B.A. in Psychology at Texas Tech.
</p>
<p>
In September of 1967, Shirley married Don Alan Wetzel and spent the next two years working at Goodwill Industries and the Waco V.A. Hospital to help put Don through law school at Baylor University. In February of 1970 Don joined the Army Judge Advocate General Corps, and the family moved to Fort Eustis, Virginia, and had their first son, Christopher Baylor Wetzel. The couple's second son, Jeffrey Alan, was born in Bangkok, Thailand, where the family spent several years before settling in Houston in June of 1974. Don clerked for a federal judge, joined Baker Botts Law Firm for a short while, and worked for other firms and for himself, while Shirley started graduate school in the Anthropology Dept. of Rice University.
</p>
<p>
During her time as an anthropology student at Rice, Shirley worked under Frank Hole and with Texas Anderson doing primary archaeological and historical research on the 1890 Nottingham Lace Factory site (41GV71) in Galveston Island. Her research (Wetzel 1980), along with that of Texas Anderson (1980), produced a detailed history of the short-lived factory. They also found archival evidence that the developers platted the community of Nottingham around the factory.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Don separated amicably, and Shirley left her Ph.D to pursue a different track, moving up from her temporary job as a student worker in Fondren Library at Rice to a staff position, and later supplementing her work with a degree in Library and Information Science. Shirley continued her work as a librarian at Rice University for over 25 years, writing and publishing several essays and historical stories in her free time.

<p>The origins of the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston date to 1936, when a committee led
by Rebecca Nathan was charged by Houston Jewish communal leaders, including Joe Weingarten
and Simon Sakowitz, to explore the establishment of an organization that would oversee
Jewish philanthropic and social welfare activities in a centralized fashion. The first
meeting of the Jewish Community Council was called by Max H. Nathan, Rebecca's husband, in
April 1936. Subsequently, in November of that year, Max Nathan was elected the first
president of the Council, while M.M. (Mose) Feld became vice-president and Abram Geller
served as secretary-treasurer. The Council acquired office space in the West building in
downtown Houston, and in 1937, Jacob Lightman, previously with the American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, was hired as the organization's first Executive Director. In 1977,
the Council changed its name to the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. </p>
<p>The central mission of the organization in its early years was the United Jewish Campaign,
an effort to unify the fundraising efforts of the Houston Jewish community and to raise
funds for Jewish causes both at home and abroad. The resources of the Council were put to
the test during the 1940s, when more than 400 Jewish refugees came to Houston fleeing Nazi
persecution. A Refugee Services Committee was organized to assist these men and women with
employment, housing, and other needs. The records of this committee are included in the
collection.</p>
<p>In the decades since its founding, the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston has been
engaged in advocacy on behalf of Israel, Jews in the former Soviet Union, and other
international causes. Closer to home, the Federation supports a variety of community
initiatives, from philanthropic gifts to Jewish education to senior care. </p>
<p>Notable executive directors who have guided the Federation include Hans Mayer, who served
from 1977 to 1996, and Lee Wunsch, who served as President and CEO from 1999 to 2017. As of
2018, the President and CEO of the Federation is Avital Ingber.</p>

<p>Mitchell Louis Westheimer:
Born in Baden, Germany, on August 22, 1831, Mitchell Louis Westheimer moved to Texas in the 1850s, and married Babette Betty Hirsch on August 26, 1860. Westheimer became naturalized as an American citizen in 1867, and with his wife raised sixteen children: eight of their own, three orphans, and five children of relatives. Westheimer purchased at auction a 640-acre tract extending from what is now Bellaire Boulevard north beyond what is now Westheimer Road in Houston. The tract became known as the Westheimer Plantation. It featured a large, plantation-style residence on the site of present Lamar High School, stables for the livery, and a racetrack. In the 1860s Houston had no public schools, so Westheimer built a school on his farm, hired a teacher, and allowed area children to attend free.
A miller by trade, Westheimer owned a flour mill in Houston, became a hay merchant in the 1850s and 1860s, and built the first streetcar rails in Houston. He spoke seven languages and often served as an interpreter for the bank and post office. Beginning in the 1880s Westheimer opened the Houston Livery Stable and eventually brought over five nephews from Germany--Max, Sidney, Adolf, Sigmund J., and David. Some of his nephews formed in 1883 the Westheimer Transfer and Storage Company, which has been in operation ever since, and a funeral home. Westheimer and his family became leaders in Congregation Beth Israel, the oldest continually active affiliated synagogue in Texas, and he served as an officer and trustee of the congregation in the 1870s and 1880s.
In 1895 Westheimer dedicated a portion of the land from his plantation to Harris County to provide right-of-way for a short-cut road to Columbus and Sealy. This road was denominated Westheimer Road and runs west from near downtown Houston over thirty miles to Fulshear. It is the longest major thoroughfare in Texas. M. L. Westheimer died at St. Joseph's Infirmary on August 2, 1905, at 3:45pm following an operation. He was buried at Beth Israel Cemetery in Houston. </p><p>Biographical note provided courtesy of the Texas State Historical Association.</p><p>Dr. Robert Irving Kahn:
Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation Emanu El, and a beloved teacher, preacher, and shepherd for thousands of his congregants and many others across the city and the nation, Rabbi Kahn preached and lectured all over the U.S., but had perhaps the greatest effect on his chosen home city, Houston.
Born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1910 to Morris and Sadie Kohn, Kahn entered a joint program at the University of Cincinnati and the Hebrew Union College at sixteen, graduation with a B.A. in 1932, and becoming ordained as a rabbi in 1935. He later returned to school for a Doctorate of Hebrew Letters in 1950, and earned an honorary Doctorate of Divinity in 1960 from the Hebrew Union College.
Shortly after graduating, Rabbi Kahn came to Houston to be Assistant Rabbi at Temple Beth Israel, where he worked under the influential Rabbis Henry Barnston, Henry Cohen, and Samuel Rossinger, and Bishop Michael Quinn.
In 1939, Bob Kahn met his wife of 62 years Rozelle Rosenthal, and they married in 1940. A year later, Rabbi Kahn volunteered for service as a wartime chaplain and served in a series of posts including New Guinea and the Philippines with the 6th Medical Battalion of the 6th Infantry Division, leaving Rozelle at home with the first of their three children, Alfred.
Rabbi Kahn returned home when the congregation Emanu El formed in Houston, and the synagogue leaders asked him to become their rabbi. He served Emanu El as Senior Rabbi for 33 years, and in 1978 became Rabbi Emeritus, making his mark on the community as a visiting lecturer at the HUC-JIR, and as faculty of the University of Houston, St. Thomas University, and St. Mary's Seminary. Rabbi Kahn also wrote a weekly column, "Lessons for Life," for 25 years, and authored several books, including "Lessons for Life, Ten Commandments for Today," "The Letter and the Spirit," and "The Words of My Mouth," a collection of his sermons published by his congregants following his retirement.
Throughout his long life, Rabbi Kahn served as President of the Houston Rabbinical Association, the Kallah of Texas Rabbis, and President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, in addition to serving on the Boards of the Alumni Association of his seminary, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the World Union for Progressive Judaism, the Alumni Board of Overseers of the HUC-JIR, and the North American Board of the World Union of Progressive Judaism.
Rabbi Kahn was also a dedicated Houstonian, serving on numerous social agency boards, including Red Cross, Boy Scouts, Travelers Aid, Mental Health, Muscular Dystrophy, Houston Metropolitan Ministries, United Way, the Herman Eye Clinic, and the Rothko Chapel. He was a member of B'nai B'rith, of which he became president, the Masons, Scottish Rite, and the Shriners. He was president of the Houston Rotary Club and was its District Governor, Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Texas, and Chaplain of the Arabia Shrine Temple of Houston, the Houston Police Department, and the American Legion. In addition, he was a member of the Rabbinic Advisory Committee of the United Jewish Appeal.
Rabbi Kahn was honored by the Boy Scouts of America with the Silver Beaver and the Ner Tamid Awards; by the Freedom Foundation with a George Washington Medal; by the French Government for service to veterans; by the Masonic Order with the 33rd Degree; by the Zionist Organization of America District with the Robert I. Kahn Lodge; and by the State of Israel with the Prime Minister's Medal for Israel Bonds. A forest was planted in his honor in Israel. He received the Torch of Liberty Award by the ADL, the Humanitarian Award by the AJC, and the Brotherhood Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He was appointed to the Vatican II Committee on Guidelines for Catholic-Jewish Relations in the Houston-Galveston Diocese.

<p>
The Rice University Visual and Dramatic Arts Department traces its beginning to 1965 when the administration, as part of the effort to strengthen offerings in the humanities, recruited Professor John O'Neill of the School of Art at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. His charge was to establish a Fine Arts Department at Rice. He began with three faculty who had been offering instruction in art and art history in the Department of Architecture. They were joined by individuals hired to teach, in one case, specifically beginning drawing and sculpture, and in another, art history.
</p>
<p>
The inclusion of dramatic arts in the department came about when Neil Havens, the Director of the Rice Players, moved from the English Department to join the Fine Arts faculty. An expansion of the theater program came about with the hiring of Christina Keefe as Program Advisor and Professor in the Practice of Theatre. Two other faculty positions in theater arts have been added.
</p>
<p>
A major expansion of the visual arts took place in 1967-68 when Rice accepted the offer of John and Dominique de Menil to bring to Rice the entire art program they had developed and supported at the university of St. Thomas. Included were four art historians, an art library, the slide collection and curator, the exhibition program with its technical staff, the photography and film programs, each with an instructor, and generous funds to support activities. Dominique de Menil, who had been department chair at the University of St. Thomas, at Rice took a position created especially for her, Director of the Institute for the Arts.
</p>
<p>
The arrival at Rice of the entire de Menil program necessitated construction of new space. Although a permanent building was envisioned, the immediate solution was a pair of temporary structures. The larger of these has been demolished, but the other, known as the media Center, became the headquarters of the Visual and Dramatic Arts Department.
</p>
<p>
In the early years, the Media Center was the location of notable activity in observational cinema, or cinema vérité, the Direct Cinema movement. Nationlly and internationally known filmmkers and directorsvisited the Media Center, conducting meetings and workshopsto introduce students faculty, and the community to this new wave of filmmaking. In 1970-71 the de Menils brought David MacDougall, an ethnographic filmmaker, and James Blue, a specialist in documentary, to Rice to co-direct the Media Center. Together they received a Guggenheim fellowship and a grant from the National Endowment from the Humanities to make Kenya Boran, which became one of the best-known ethnographic documentary films.When MacDougal left in 1975 to become Director of the Film Unit at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, James Blue recruited Brian Huberman from the U.K. National Film and Television School. Blue and Huberman taught courses in production, and collaboratively and independently they produced several documentaries until Blue's departure in the early 1970s. Huberman's teaching and filmmaking continues in the department to the present time.
</p>
<p>
In 1969 Geoff Winningham was recruited from the University of St. Thomas to teach photography. While teaching in the department through the subsequent fifty years, he has produced several films and published numerous well-received volumes of photographs.
</p>
<p>
The film program continues with a schedule of screenings at the Media Center of films from diverse sources. In addition, students now have state-of-the-art screening facilities to examine and study films from around the world in 16, 35, or 70 millimeter format with Dolby Digital Sound. They can also showcase their own film production efforts.

Born August 11, 1938 to Gujarati Parsi Zoroastrian parents Peshotan and Tehmina Bhandara, Bapsi Sidhwa is an American–Pakistani novelist whose books, including "The Crow Eaters," "The Pakistani Bride," "Cracking India," and "An American Brat," have gained international acclaim for their exploration of the identity issues of Pakistani Parsi immigrants to the US, their life-styles and their culture.
</p>
<p>
After she was born, Bapsi's parents moved from Karachi to the city of Lahore, a large influence on Bapsi's later writing. Bapsi contracted polio at the age of two, and was nine at the time of the Partition--both events shaped her later writing, especially through the character of Lenny in "Ice Candy Man." In 1957, Bapsi received her BA from Kinnaird College for Women in Lahore. She married at the age of 19 and moved to Bombay for five years before she divorced and remarried in Lahore with her second husband Noshir Sidhwa. She had three children in Pakistan before beginning her career as an author.
</p>
<p>
Bapsi is perhaps best known for her collaborative work with Indo-Canadian filmmaker Deepa Mehta; Her novels "Ice Candy Man (1991)" and "Water: A Novel" formed the basis for the latter two films in Mehta's "Elements" Trilogy, "Earth," and "Water." In addition to her novels, Bapsi has written essays and reviews for publications, and travelled for speaking engagements, spending a great deal of time abroad before settling in Houston. Bapsi has also taught at Columbia University, University of Houston, Mount Holyoke College, Southampton University, and Brandeis.
</p>
<p>
Bapsi's work focuses especially on improving the struggles of women in the Indian subcontinent, and she served on the advisory committee to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Women's Development in pursuit of that goal. Among her many honors, Bapsi received the Bunting Fellowship at Radcliffe/Harvard, the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writer's Award, the Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Pakistan's highest national honor in the arts), the LiBeraturepreis in Germany, and the 2007 Primo Mondello Award in Italy.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Richard Huffington Sr. was born in England, in 1656 and supposed to have immigrated to the United States at the age of sixteen imported by Richard Bayley in 1672. A record from the Upper Northampton Court of Accomack, Virginia attests to this importation. He was a long time resident of the area as many depositions and tax lists indicate his inhabitation. He married Mary Windham (believed to be born between 1654 and 1656) in the year of 1679. Together they parented John Huffington Sr. (1680-1749), Richard Huffington Jr. (1693-1756), Susanna Huffington Brown (1694-date of death unknown) and Thomas Huffington (1697-1762). Though his burial place is unknown, it is believed that he died in the year of 1720 in Nanticoke One Hundred, Somerset County, Maryland. </p><p>James Brown was born in Virginia, his exact date of birth is unknown, but it is supposed that he was born in the year of 1760. He served as a private in the American Revolutionary War at the age of sixteen. He enlisted on October 2, 1776 while living in Charlotte County, Virginia and served for a total of three years. During his lifetime he was married twice, first to Frances Warren Brown, with whom he had two children Russell Brown (1782-1843), and Frances W. Brown Hancock. Later he would marry Martha (Pattie) Venable Brown on December 13, 1787 in Prince Edward County, Virginia. She would later receive a widow pension from the Bureau of Pensions in 1838 and lived to collect it for a decade. James Brown had passed away on December 16, 1829 in Charlotte County, Virginia.</p><p>Henry W. Gough was born in Blaina, Aberystruth Parish, Monmouthshire County, England on December 7, 1861. Biographical sketches indicate that Gough immigrated to the United States in 1863. However, a 1910 Census indicates that Gough immigrated to the States in 1864. For the rest of his life, he was a citizen of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. On August 25, 1885 he wed Sarah Jane (Jennie) Cope (1860-1925) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. For nearly a quarter century, Gough served as the County Controller for Dauphin County and had a notable career. He was also a prominent member of the Oddfellow, Masonic, and Elk lodges of Harrisburg. He died on August 27, 1937 and buried three days later in the Harrisburg Cemetery. </p><p>Phyllis Gough Huffington was the daughter of Celeste Brown Gough and Captain John Edwin Gough. She was born on January 4, 1923 in the Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu. She attended Southern Methodist University and earned a Bachelors of Business Administration in 1941. In 1945 she married Roy M. Huffington in Dallas, Texas. Later when the family relocated to Houston Mrs. Huffington was a socially active member of the area's society, in clubs such as the Doctor's Club of Houston and the Petroleum Club of Houston. Other areas that held her interest included genealogy and civic activities, which is apparent by her membership in groups such as the Society of Genealogists (United Kingdom) and the Campfire Girls. Mrs. Huffington passed away on November 9, 2003.</p> </bioghist>

He was the first president of Congregation Beth Am from 1974 to 1975. Jerry died unexpectedly on May 16, 1977, and is buried at Beth Yeshurun Cemetery. Congregation Beth Am dedicated the Jerald Y. Cohen sanctuary in 1987.</p><p>The history of Beth Am: On October 12, 1972, a group of young Jewish people met for the first time in the Kendall Branch Public Library on Memorial Drive to discuss the possibility of starting a Congregation to serve the needs of the increasing number of Jewish families settling in the Memorial-Northwest area of Houston. The need for a West Houston synagogue was recognized at that first meeting. Interest in forming a synagogue spread quickly and by January 1973, seventy people had already formed committees, held a Hanukkah service, and agreed that a religious school was a necessity. The first Board election was held in April 1973, and that month the members voted to become a conservative congregation. Within a six-month period both a Sisterhood and a Men's Club were formed, an ark was built to house the newly acquired Torah, and Rabbi Irwin Halpern became the congregation's first spiritual leader and school administrator. In 1975 Beth Am purchased a facility on Brittmoore Road. As the membership continued to grow a new sanctuary, kitchen, and offices were added. The youth group, Beth Am Synagogue Youth, was also created around this time. As the years passed the members decided that further growth was hampered by the somewhat industrial location of the synagogue. As a part of that decision, Congregation Beth Am merged with Congregation Or Hadash in 2001 and became Congregation Or Ami.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Although the Jewish population numbered around 100 individuals, Victoria lacked a formal congregation until the end of the 19th century. While they had met together informally as early as the 1850s, they did not organize until 1867, when Victoria Jews established a Hebrew Benevolent Society. The society held services and even joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations for several years in the 1880s. In 1876, Jewish women had founded the Hebrew Ladies' Benevolent Society, which had 17 members in 1900. They also founded a Jewish Children's Aid Society in 1889. A chapter of B'nai B'rith, later named in honor of prominent Jewish grocer Max Bettin, was organized in 1875. Finally, in 1894, Jews in Victoria established an official congregation, which they named B'nai Israel. Abraham Levi became its first President during these founding years and the first permanent Rabbi, George Solomon, arrived in Victoria in 1905. The synagogue that stands today was built in 1923 when the Jewish population in the city peaked at around 120 people. Today, there are about 20 Jewish families in Victoria. Dr. Shira Lander, a Southern Methodist University religion professor, has lead High Holiday services as well as periodic Shabbat and education services. Despite a 2007 incident in which the Temple's front was desecrated with anti-Semitic slurs, Victorian Jews remain welcome participants in the life of the city, and look to maintain their involvement and tradition in the coming years.
Excerpt from: https://www.isjl.org/texas-victoria-encyclopedia.html</p><p>Born in 1942, Melvin Lack grew up in Victoria, Texas. His father was from Tulsa, Oklahoma, while his mother grew up in Houston, Texas. In 1938, Melvin's father decided to open a family business selling many goods such as toys, guns, and furniture. Growing up in Victoria, Melvin was one of only 30 Jewish kids in the community attending Sunday school at Temple B'nai Israel. As an undergraduate student, Melvin attended Rice University. While there, Melvin was heavily invested in extracurricular activities, joining the Student Council and Hillel, writing articles for The Rice Thresher, and serving as president of Weiss College. Once he received his Bachelor's degree in Economics, Melvin attended Harvard University Business School where he met his wife Janey, one of the first women to be admitted into the Business School in 1963. After convincing from his uncle, Melvin and his wife moved back to his hometown in 1969 to work for the family business. From there, the couple settled down and had three children - David, Jeffrey and Julie. For the next 40 years, the Lack Company thrived, opening 39 stores at its height. Meanwhile, Melvin became involved in the local Jewish community, serving on the Board of Directors for Congregation B'nai Israel for 35 years as well as serving several terms as president. In addition, Melvin helped raise money for the synagogue through Bingo fundraisers. This allowed for the synagogue to go through several renovations in the 1990s and establish its Endowment Fund. Today, Melvin remains in Victoria, TX, managing the real estate of the family while staying active on the stock market.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The United Orthodox Synagogues of Houston was formed in 1965 when two separate synagogues, Adath Emeth and Beth Jacob, joined together. Congregation Adath Israel joined the United Orthodox Synagogues a year later.</p><p>The oldest of the founding congregations, Adath Israel, was formed in 1905 because observant Jews living in Houston's Fifth Ward lived too far away to walk to Adath Yeshurun. Members first met in the Wertheimer home until they dedicated their first synagogue building in 1910. From 1910 to 1930 Adath Israel was led by Rabbi Jacob Geller. In 1939 the congregation moved to a new building in Washington Terrace.</p><p>Adath Emeth was formed in 1908 and officially chartered in 1910. Like many synagogues in South Texas, Adath Emeth had its first services in the homes of members, rather than in a synagogue building. In its early years the congregation was led by shochet and cantor Meyer Epstein. Services moved to a house on Artesian Place near Preston Avenue, then to "the upstairs of a feed store" on Preston Avenue near the current downtown area, just North of Buffalo Bayou. After World War I the congregation built a wooden synagogue at Houston and Washington Avenue, but it burned down after only two years. That same year, 1923, the congregation built a more permanent structure in the same place, which would remain their synagogue building until 1948, when they erected a new building at Cleburne and Ennis in the Third Ward. In 1959 they sold their building to Texas Southern University, and moved to their present location on Greenwillow Drive at South Braeswood, in the Willow Meadows neighborhood in southwest Houston. The records we have between 1960 and 1965 show that Adath Emeth was an active community with a Sisterhood, N.C.S.Y, frequent parties and events, and a theatre troupe. Although the congregation officially joined with Beth Jacob and later Adath Israel in the mid-1960s, they maintained their own separate identity for years after the merger, even holding their own 50 Year Golden Jubilee Anniversary in 1968. </p><p>Beth Jacob was formed in 1937 in the home of Rabbi Max Geller to form a Modern Orthodox congregation designed "to serve the Jews residing in the South End of the city of Houston," according to the synagogue's board minutes. Twenty-three men comprised the first chartering members. That year the congregation bought land at Cleburne and Hamilton and in two years built their synagogue there. Elsewhere in the Houston Jewish History Archives is a large service flag from Beth Jacob Congregation, which includes the names of members and affiliated persons who served in the armed forces during World War II. </p><p>In 1965 because of dwindling membership and financial issues, Beth Jacob and Adath Emeth joined, followed by Adath Israel in 1966. United Orthodox Synagogues was led by Rabbi Raphael Schwartzman and Cantor Irving Dean. In the 1970s Rabbi Schwartzman left the congregation and was replaced by Rabbi Kenneth Hain, followed by Rabbi Joseph Radinsky, who served UOS from 1976 to 2003. Since 2003, Rabbi Barry Gelman has served as UOS's spiritual leader.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Born in Alabama in 1944 to a middle class family, Davis was the oldest of three children. She attended the segregated schools of Alabama until the age of 15, when she received a scholarship from the American Friends Service Committee to attend Elizabeth Irwin High School, a progressive private school in New York City.</p>

<p>After graduating from high school Davis won a scholarship to Brandeis University, where she majored in French literature. She spent her junior year (1962) at the Sorbonne in Paris, witnessed firsthand the Algerian conflict being waged in the streets there, and attended the Communist Youth Festival in Helsinki which had a significant impact on her political development. In 1965 she graduated from Brandeis with honors and went to Frankfurt, Germany to study philosophy at Goethe University. At the University she continued her activism and joined a socialist student group opposed to the war in Vietnam. In her autobiography, Davis notes that she spent time in East Germany, which served to deepen her commitment to socialism.</p>

<p>Upon her return to the U.S. Davis joined the Black liberation movement and the struggle against the Vietnam War in San Diego and Los Angeles.According to her autobiography, Davis first became aware of the Soledad Brothers after reading a February 1970 article in the Los Angeles Times. She accepted the co-chair of the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee and as a result of her activities and subsequent visits to Soledad Prison, Davis befriended the families of the Soledad Brothers and corresponded with the three men.</p>

<p>On August 3, 1970, Jonathan Jackson, George Jackson's seventeen year old brother, tried to assist James McClain, on trial for an alleged attempt to stab an officer, escape from the courthouse. During the escape attempt the judge and Jackson were killed in a shootout with the police; one juror and the district attorney were wounded. The guns used in the kidnapping were allegedly traced to Davis, implicating her in the escape attempt. A California warrant was issued for Davis' arrest in which she was charged as an accomplice to murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy. She fled Los Angeles and evaded arrest by seeking refuge in several places including New York City. A federal fugitive warrant was subsequently issued and she was placed on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ten most wanted list.</p>

<p>Two months later Davis was captured in New York City. While awaiting trial, and after a few joint court appearances, Davis separated her case from Magee's and their cases were tried separately. Magee wanted his trial held in a federal court while Davis wanted her trial held in California's state court. Davis' trial was moved from Marin County, a primarily white upper middle class community to San Jose, California which was an ethnically and racially more diverse city, in an effort to secure a fair trial with a less biased jury.</p>

<p>Almost immediately a groundswell of support developed in favor of Davis' release. Davis in particular, received widespread national and international support from the black community, liberals and the progressive left. The Communist Party mounted a major political campaign and held rallies in the United States and abroad, published articles, pamphlets and posters, issued petitions, distributed postcards, and requested that the public mail cards and letters on Davis' behalf.</p>

<p>After a trial by jury, consisting of eleven whites and one Latino, Davis was acquitted of all charges. Following her acquittal Davis taught at San Francisco State University for several years. From 1973 until the early 1990s she served on the board of the National Alliance Against Racism and Political Repression, an organization she helped found with Charlene Mitchell. In the Fall of 1995, she was appointed to the University of California at Santa Cruz Presidential Chair and became a consultant to the Ph.D program at UCSC where she continues to teach. Davis has written several books on gender and class issues, the prison system and its impact on minority populations, and is a major figure in the orthodox Communist Party.</p>

<p>Opened in 1953, the Rice Nuclear Laboratory would later become known as the Bonner Laboratory. It was named in dedication to the late Tom W. Bonner who was a renowned nuclear physicist both in the local community and internationally. The lab was designed by Abel Pierce and George F. Pierce Jr. The Bonner Lab was originally home to one particle accelerator, a Mega Electron Volt Van de Graaff machine. A second particle accelerator was acquired in 1961. The Bonner Lab was the United States' first fully equipped nuclear laboratory based out of a university. Major discoveries and accomplishments in the field of nuclear physics were discovered in the Bonner Lab. The two particle accelerators were donated to other laboratories in 1972 and the Bonner Lab was used for music practice and performance as well as computational engineering. In 1994, the Bonner Lab building was demolished. The laboratory was located where Duncan Hall is now.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Abolition of slavery was initiated in Mexico by the Spanish government, who abolished the practice throughout the empire in 1818. Like many other states which engaged in slavery, the full process of emancipation for the country took many years. The First Republic of Mexico issued a decree of abolition in 1829, but regions including Texas resisted, reclassifying enslaved people as "indentured servants for life". On April 5, 1837, the general Congress of the Mexican Republic issued a further decree, abolishing "without exception all slavery in all the Republic." The decree also provided compensation for enslavers' losses on a case-by-case basis: with the exception of settlers in Texas, who had seceded and later joined the United States as an enslaving state.</p> </bioghist>
