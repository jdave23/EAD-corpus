<p>The Ford letter, signed only as "Dotie," was written by Mrs. Ford to her husband to report
to him on her activities as a schoolteacher at the Blackfeet Agency. The letter mentions
many of the couple's friends back east in the context of asking about their health and
activities. Mrs. Ford's description of the Blackfeet Agency includes information regarding
the students in her school, and mentions several adult Blackfeet, specifically "Fancy Jim"
and "White Calf." Particularly interesting is her description of the funeral of an Indian
child who was buried in the ground, contrary to the tribe's traditional method of using
scaffolds. She also describes the social and leisure activities of the Anglo members of the
agency staff like amateur theatricals and playing croquet. Mrs. Ford also mentions "Mr.
Warner" and "Mr. Welch" as agency employees. A stamped, addressed envelope is included with
the letter.</p>

<p>The Barstow scrapbook was created by Charles H. Barstow specifically for his daughter,
Elizabeth, and given to her on February 16, 1891. The book contains mostly mounted newspaper
clippings, the majority of which deal with the Crow Indian tribe, or other Native Americans
of the northern plains. Topics include: various controversies regarding the sale or leasing
of Crow lands, particularly during the fall of 1887; the alleged malfeasance of Indian
Agents H. J. Armstrong and Henry E. Williamson; crime; cattle ranching in the Crow
reservation area; the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890 and events leading to it. There are also
obituaries and social notices of persons in New England that were apparently friends or
relatives of Barstow. Although the newspapers from which the clippings were taken are mostly

<p>The Victor George diary is a positive photocopy of a ruled notebook containing entries
which document his activities from 1907 to 1931. Although presented in chronological order,
it does not appear as if the entries were written on the recorded dates but rather
transcribed at a later time from memory or another source. Most of the entries are quite
terse, and few are beyond a single sentence that summarizes a day's activities such as
teaching school, travel to different Montana towns, and ranch chores. Beyond the
chronological entries, George recorded in his notebook cattle and livestock numbers and
sales, family birthdays, and short essays regarding particular events or people in his
extended family.</p>

<p>The Mitchell papers have been divided into three series. Series one contains materials created or collected by Mitchell while serving as co-chair of the Jaycees Legislative Committee in 1962. Mitchell's work on the committee related to the development of Substitute Senate Bill 45, passed on March 11, 1963, a state bill protecting fishing waters from highway construction. Papers include correspondence, brochures, pamphlets, newspaper articles, government documents, working papers, legislative lists, a photo story showing results of stream bed alterations, a slide presentation and slides promoting the bill, draft bills and the final version of the bill. Series two contains materials created or collected by Mitchell while serving as the chair of the Conservation Committee of the Jaycees. These papers relate to the committee's efforts to introduce a similar Federal bill to protect fishing waters. Papers include correspondence, newspaper articles, broadsides, state reports and official interdepartmental correspondence between Federal departments involved. These papers relate to the Jaycees continuing advocacy of the Stream Preservation Act of 1963 (SSB #45), Clean Water campaign, and the controversies over Federal construction plans for Interstate Highway I-15 along the Missouri River near Wolf Point, Montana. Series three contains the program, congratulatory letters, recommendations, newspaper clippings, and correspondence related to the awarding of a 1963 American Motors Non-Professional Conservation Award to Harry B.

<p>"The History of a Bridle" is a narrative of Montana's vigilante activity starting in 1864,
although it appears the document was composed much later in the nineteenth or early
twentieth century. The unknown author, writing in the first person, describes his trip from
Denver to Virginia City in the spring of 1864 in company with a mule train laden with
supplies for a mercantile operation. At one point of this journey the author claims to have
ridden on the overland stage line and identifies "Rowdy Pete" as his driver. After working a
claim in German Gulch, the author describes a horseback trip to Atchison, Kansas in 1865 and
his return to Helena, Montana in 1866. The narrative thereafter describes a great deal of
vigilante activity primarily in the Helena area, although the chronology of the events is
not always apparent. Most of the participants are identified by initials only, and their
organization is identified as the "3-7-77 Committee." The essay apparently takes its title
from the description of a hair bridle fashioned by an outlaw named "Henry" serving his
sentence in the territorial prison. The original essay and its typed transcription have been
placed in separate folders.</p>

<p>The Margaret Patten Letter to “Alice” consists of an original letter and typed
transcription dated February 10, 1921 and was titled "A Strange Disappearance". The
letter was addressed to someone who can only be identified as Alice. The letter
discusses her recollection of a story that was told to her by the host of her camp
about the deserted cabin of Andrew Levinski. The host tells her that Levinski had
come to the United States from Poland many years ago and after getting here he was
quite disappointed. He came to Gallatin Canyon in hopes of hitting it big with
prospecting. This was not the case and this caused him to live a hermit lifestyle.
Levinski thought that he had found a gold mine in the mountains of Gallatin Canyon,
but his discovery had brought more prospectors to the area. The other prospectors
had grouped together, and they formed a corporation that Levinski was not included
in. Levinski, from the forming of the corporation on, thought that they were out for
his claims. One day while walking up the mountain he was confronted by two members
of the corporation, they were supposedly armed, causing Levinski to shoot them in
self-defense. Levinski confessed to the murder which caused him to go to jail until
his trail occurred in the summer. Once the trail was held he was acquitted with the
verdict of Self-defense and then he went back to his cabin. Then next spring, they
investigated his cabin after no one had heard from him and found it deserted;
Levinski was not heard from again. She then finishes the letter by saying that they
were saddling the horses for a trip to a scout station on the park line.</p>

<p>Photocopy of a partial typewritten narrative written by Ethel V. Storm based on a
conversation with her father, Maynard S. Bean, concerning the Cheyenne Indian "uprising" of
1897. In the document, Bean is paraphrased in describing the discovery of a murdered
sheepherder named Hoover whose body was found near the Northern Cheyenne Indian reservation
in early May, 1897 (Bean gives the date of June, 1897). The search for the body was
undertaken by ranch hands led by Bean, and the subsequent confrontation between civilian and
military authorities and the Cheyenne Indians is described. Bean's narrative identifies key
figures in the events, which differs somewhat from official accounts recorded elsewhere.

<p>Del Jenkins was interviewed by Art True while wintering in San Diego, California in
1968. True, an amateur historian, used a reel to reel recorder which he operated
with some difficulty and then later transferred the recording to an audiocassette.
As a result, the sound quality of the interview is marginal at best. Jenkins
describes his experiences as a Yellowstone stage coach driver and anecdotes about
some of the tourists he transported. The interview has been digitally rendered, but
no transcription is available. In his 1975 letter forwarding the audiocassette to
MSU history professor Robert Dunbar, True wrote “Del was 88 years old at the time of
the taping. He wrote a book that he called “The Lucky Cowboy” about his life and
experiences. Unfortunately, a woman who got hold of it for editing took out his
spicy down to earth language and he decided not to publish. You can learn more about
it from the Historical Society, Jackson, Wyoming. As far as I know, Del is still
living. He has wintered in Sand Diego for over 20 years. That’s where I met
him.”</p>

<p>Roy Huffman's collected and created papers were organized by him in alphabetical files by subject. Except for a few duplicated files, the papers are arranged as Roy Huffman kept them with loose papers and untitled files placed within the alphabetic sequence. The materials are mostly typewritten with some handwritten notes and letters, and include photocopies or reprints of previously published materials, reports, speeches and presentations; plans, programs, schedules, studies, and numerous papers related to his professional positions at MSU; numerous research notes and unfinished manuscript pages with bibliographical materials and citations; personal and professional correspondence; and clippings from newspapers and journals. Subjects are wide ranging but can be characterized into several categories: a) files on topics of general interest or research interest; b) files related to specific organizations, conferences, symposia or programs both professional and governmental (these may have correspondence and attachments included); c) files related to the research and publication of Roy Huffman's writings; d) files related to Montana State University (Montana State College before 1962) which may be by subject; by department; by specific positions Huffman held during his career; by committee, program, institutional or branch names; by faculty, students or individuals; or as miscellaneous items. e) correspondence: alphabetical files of a professional or personal nature maintained by Huffman plus individually named correspondence files of colleagues intimately involved with his research and writing as well as politicians and selected projects or organizations. Representation of government agencies including the Federal Farm Security Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Energy Research and Development Administration, National Science Foundation, and regional entities such as the Missouri River Basin Commission and Columbia River Basin Inter-Agency Committee, Great Plains Agricultural Council, Montana Experiment Stations and Extension Service, and the Water Resources Research Center. Publications and publishers include Big Sky Books of the Endowment and Research Foundation of MSU, the Ronald Press and various journal publications. Representative files for professional and academic interests include the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, American Agricultural Economics Assn., Western Agricultural Economics Assn., Agricultural History Society, American Association of University Professors, Soil Conservation Society of America, Sigma Xi and others. China (People to People), Russia, Saudi Arabia (agricultural projects), and other countries have individual files. Several untitled files containing research notes, citations and a large rough draft manuscript were combined with research note files with the name Omnibus.</p>
<p>In 1970, both Merrill G. Burlingame and Elmer Starch wrote Roy Huffman about a proposed manuscript Huffman had been working on. The work began in the mid-60s as a book on Fairway Farms and the influence of that program. Margarita "Rita" McDonald assisted with the research and rough draft materials. It apparently evolved into a larger project to produce a book about the influence on farming by the Montana State College Agriculture Department and the Montana experience which resulted in changes in land use, farm techniques, irrigation, family farms and government assistance across the nation. Individuals of note present in files are Governor Tim Babcock, Hugo G. Eck, Nicholas Helburn, Governor Thomas L. Judge, Maurice M. Kelso, Carl F. Kraenzel, Senator Mike Mansfield, Margarita "Rita" McDonald; MSU Presidents: Leon Johnson, Carl W. McIntosh, Roland R. Renne, William J. Tietz, Jr.; Mont H. Saunderson, Elmer A. Starch, Carl F. Taeusch and M. L. Wilson. Roy Huffman's diverse interests are also reflected in files for the Museum of the Rockies, conservation and reclamation issues, arts and humanities, political and legislative issues, energy and water policies, and some personal memento and joke files.</p>

<p>The photographs of Thomas Brook consist of nature landscapes and town views of southwest
Montana and particularly in the Twin Bridges area of Madison and Beaverhead Counties.
Subjects include natural history, ranch and farming operations, bridges and bridge
construction, schools and school groups, and early settlers of the Twin Bridges area. Brook
organized the images by assigning sequential numbers for the first 388 photographs, but he
often would group several negatives within a given number if they were similar exposures.
Many of these early control numbers now bear alphabetic extensions to distinguish the
separate images. Starting with image number 389, new control numbers were assigned by the
processing archivist, observing a rough subject arrangement of the photographs as they were
filed by the MSU library staff in 1966. Again some overlap was found amidst the negatives
accompanying the prints, necessitating the assignment of alphabetic extensions for image
numbers 409 and 410. Overall there are 1,057 individual images, represented by numbers
1-839. Not all prints are available, especially in the first 388, and most negatives for
images numbered greater than 388 are missing. An important exception are the glass plate
negatives (numbers 773-785) documenting the 1896 flood at Twin Bridges. The photographer of
these images is unknown, and Brook left no clues as to how he came to own them. In some
cases for images that lack a corresponding negative, duplicate prints were saved if they
showed a difference in darkroom manipulation. For all the images in this collection the
titles were provided by Brook either in either his negative index or on the print
itself.</p>

<p>The Rawlins diaries consist of thirty one individual annual volumes dated from 1968
to 1997 (there are two for 1981). Information in the diaries includes appointments,
travel, consultations, technical data, and some personal observations of Rawlins as
he worked as a consulting geologist. Many of the named Rawlins contacts are members
of the Crow tribe, and most of the locations described are on the Crow Reservation
and elsewhere in eastern Montana. In addition to coal, gas, and oil exploration,
Rawlins advised on water well locations for named individuals. A small amount of
laid-in materials such as receipts and notations have been retained in those volumes

<p>The letters in this collection focus on Agassiz's efforts to collect fish specimen and eggs (presumably fish eggs) from colleagues throughout New England. The first, written from Cambridge, Massachusetts in April of 1854 to Franklin Benjamin Hough, a physician, author, and chief of the forestry division of the United States Department of Agriculture from 1876-1883, details Agassiz's efforts to collect a wide variety of fish specimens. Another letter, written from Newport, Rhode Island in July 1858, is to John Whipple Potter Jenks. At the time of Agassiz and Jenks' correspondence, Jenks was a professor of zoology at the Boston Horticultural Society (1858-1860). Beginning in 1873, Jenks chaired the department of agricultural zoology at Brown University and was curator of the University's museum collections. In his letter to Jenks, Agassiz apologizes for being unable to stop in Middleboro (Massachusetts?) and requests that Jenks send eggs (presumably fish eggs) by an express messenger so, "that they should not be spoiled."</p>

<p>In 1902, James David Wood wrote a brief autobiographical sketch of his life. The document
remained in the family and was eventually passed down to the D. V. Hagenbarth family of
Dillon, Montana. In 1964 the manuscript was borrowed by Stanley Davison for transcription
and editing, and then returned to the Hagenbarth family. Davison reviewed the sketch and
found historical discrepancies which he noted. Wood's story gives an outline of his trip to
Montana in 1864, his early residence in Virginia City, his experiences in the Nez Perce and
Bannock wars, and a brief outline of his business ventures. Davison never published the
manuscript, and the present location of the original is unknown.</p>

<p>The papers consist primarily of correspondence between Merrill G. Burlingame and the law
firm of Wilkinson, Cragun and Barker. The earliest letters, from 1956 to 1957, are largely
contractual in nature, specifying the payment and duties expected of Burlingame by the law
firm, although some historical evidence analysis is discussed. The letters from 1975-1976
concern critiques of manuscripts prepared by Michael F. Foley on the administration of the
Fort Belknap and Blackfeet Indian reservations by the United States government, 1855-1950s.
These manuscripts were prepared for the law firm as evidence for the plaintiffs in
forthcoming hearing before the Indian Claims Commission. The collection also includes a
folder of Burlingame's handwritten research notes and a folder of related printed materials,
clippings, and maps.</p>

<p>The collection consists of materials gathered by Professor Merrill G. Burlingame and
Montana State University library personnel from documents gathered independently or found
laid in the various books donated by Wallis Huidekoper in 1957. These materials include a
selection of letters exchanged between Dr. Merrill G. Burlingame and Wallis Huidekoper
regarding the editing of an oral history interview conducted in 1954, a 1929 letter from
Edward Douglas Branch thanking Huidekoper for his favorable comments on <title render="italic">The Hunting of the Buffalo</title> (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1929)
and a 1938 letter from Martin S. Garretson, again thanking Huidekoper for favorable comments
on his book, <title render="italic">The American Bison</title> (New York: New York
Zoological Society, 1938). Of interest in the Garretson letter is an anecdote concerning the
observation of a bison herd in the Oklahoma panhandle during the summer of 1884. The
collection also includes three consecutively edited versions of an oral history interview
with Huidekoper conducted by Elizabeth DeFrate and Merrill G. Burlingame on July 26, 1954
and transcribed from an audio tape which appears to have been lost. A typed bibliography of
Huidekoper's articles, along with two original manuscripts he wrote concerning artist
Charles M. Russell has been placed in a separate folder. Three folders of printed material
consist of brochures and pamphlets written by or pertaining to Huidekoper' father, Henry
Shippen Huidekoper and newspaper clippings pertaining to historic sites in the Germantown,
Pennsylvania area, Wallis Huidekoper, Theodore Roosevelt, and ranching in North Dakota and
Montana. Six photographs of North Dakota badlands residents circa 1880s and the Huidekoper
ranch near Big Timber, Montana, circa 1956, complete the collection.</p>

<p>The Gertrude White papers, 1916-1917 includes original handwritten letters,
envelopes, and billing statements for Mrs. Gertrude White. The three handwritten
letters in this collection include: one from a Mrs. J.L. Guthrie stating that she
was expected to go into labor between March 2nd and the 12th in 1917 and she wanted
Mrs. Gertrude to come and help with the delivery. This letter was dated February 2,
1917 in Manhattan, Montana. Then the second letter is from Lester White to his
mother, Gertrude. The letter is dated February 18,1917 in Helena, Montana. The
letter describes Lester's daily activities while at the children’s home in Helena
Montana. Then the third letter is from Roxana Beck, Principle of Montana Deaconess
School during 1917. Written on February 28, the letter informs Gertrude how Lester
was doing and provides her with a billing statement in regard to Lester. The
collection also includes multiple billing statements ranging from a shoe store to a
statement from the children's home Lester was residing at and envelopes that either
correspond with the letters or billing statements or were just kept by Gertrude.</p>

<p>The printed documents in the Crow Indian Agency Fraud Hearings Collection include
affidavits, letters, and statements. The documents relate to allegations of fraud at
Montana's Crow Indian Agency in 1876, leveled by Captain Edward Ball against Dexter E. Clapp
and Nelson Story. The affidavits detail Clapp's recollections on the receipt of shipments
and refute allegations of bribery, as well as Charles Rich, John Goewey, and Warren Allen's
verification of pork presented to the agency. Letters outline the charges against Clapp and
Story by Ball, rebuttal of the charges leveled, as well as a description of Ball's
character. The statement provided by Story refutes the charges levied by Ball. Folders 7-12
represent photocopies, microfilm, and a typed transcription of materials from the Montana
Historical Society Manuscript Collection 39.</p>

<p>The compilation of Montana agricultural statistics has been shared by a variety of federal and state agencies over the years, but almost all efforts were overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture in one form or another. The press releases in this collection include those from agencies who were concerned primarily with crop and livestock production. The name of the issuing body and titles vary throughout, and as a result they were gathered by Montana State University library personnel in the order received. Some of the 'titles' are fairly consistent and could be gathered together as 'serials' but others although on the same general topics, have quite varying titles. There seem to be some related but distinctive separate serials that have been interfiled within this group; some of those are listed at the end of these notes but there could be others. PLEASE NOTE also that later issues (1982?+) of some of these titles have already been cataloged as serials from the later issuing body, Montana Agricultural Statistics Service.</p>
<p> Issuing Body Changes and Title: these are the major changes but there are other variations within each date.</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>March 13, 1920-June 1, 1921 - United States. Department of Agriculture. Bureau of Crop Estimates. (Office of Field Agent and Office of Agricultural Statistician sometimes were included and sometimes neither was included.)</item>
<item>July 1,1921-November 12, 1925 - Montana Cooperative Crop Reporting Service (United States. Department of Agriculture. Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates. cooperating with Montana State College. Extension Service. and Montana. State Department of Agriculture, Labor and Industry). Also Montana Cooperative Crop and Livestock Reporting Service was used and some had neither; on some (State and Federal) was included.</item>

<item>March 1926-August 1930 - United States. Department of Agriculture. Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Division of Crop (and) (and) Livestock Estimates and Montana. State Department of Agriculture. The Division of State Publicity was sometimes included with the latter name and sometimes not.</item>
<item>September 1930-June 1939 - State-Federal Crop Reporting Service. Office of the Agricultural Statistician but not consistently; sometimes it was just United States. Department of Agriculture. Bureau of Agricultural Economics. (and sometimes Office of the Agricultural Statistician alone).</item>

<p>Titles:</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>Montana Crop Report was on the earlier reports and also Montana Crop and Livestock Report but the former was predominantly used and appears to run through all the years.

Among the many other titles: Pig Crop Report, Montana Range and Livestock Report, Montana Farm Prices, Montana Honey Report, Montana Hatchery Report, Montana Lamb Report, Montana Crop Statistics by Counties, Wheat Utilization, Alfalfa Seed, Agricultural Prices, etc.</item>
<item>These are the related but distinctive serials that may have been interfiled with this collection:</item>
<item>Montana Dairy Products Report fairly consistently issued from the Montana Cooperative Dairy Reporting Service first and then jointly from USDA. Bureau of Agricultural Economics and Montana. State Department of Agriculture. Dairy Division</item>
<item>Montana Quarterly Grain Stocks Report issued by USDA. Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Office of Agricultural Statistician and later including the Montana. State Department of Agriculture. Grain Division.</item>
<item>Weather-Crop Report and all its varying earlier titles is already a separately cataloged title in S600.62.M9W42=Special Collections</item>
<item>Weekly Station Reports of the Division of Dry Land Agriculture from the Bureau of Plant Industry, U.S. Department of Agriculture</item>
<item>It is possible that distinctive serials may be removed from this collection in the future for separate cataloging. The documents have been chronologically arranged.</item>

includes four business related letters written to James B. Campbell from New York, Michigan,
Washington D.C. and Virginia City, Montana Territory from 1836 to 1868; one letter from
James B. Campbell to A. J. Jackson of Galena, Illinois, written from St. Charles, Missouri
in 1862 which discusses Campbell's plans to move west; an 1873 letter from Gurdon Campbell
to his mother describing a flood at Gallatin City; an unsigned 1877 letter, possibly from
Gurdon Campbell to his sister Fannie, with a remarkably sympathetic account of the Nez Perce
pursuit and the writer's friend, Looking Glass; two letters from Rebecca Jackson of Galena,
Illinois to Fannie Campbell describing the death of her mother, Sarah Campbell. A single
folder of legal documents and promissory notes pertaining to the Campbell family dated from
1867 to 1899 complete the collection.</p>

<p>The Morris State Bank records have been divided into two series which roughly conform to
the creating entities, although given the interrelated nature of the owners a precise
separation is not possible. It is logical to assume that both sets of records were
maintained by the bank throughout its operational history. Series one, Morris State Bank,
represents primarily the outgoing correspondence of the firm, along with some financial
information such as balance ledgers and deposit information. A single letterbox of
correspondence and related documents alphabetically arranged was included with the bank
records, but it is not apparent if the bulk of these files pertain to bank business or the
various mining properties in which the owners had an interest. Series two, Mining company
records, includes payroll registers for the Pony Gold Mining Company, the Indian Mining
Company, and the various business operations of Elling and Morris. A broken series of
deposit receipts and related documents for the Indian Mining Company from 1906 to 1908 have
been chronologically arranged.</p>

<p>Outgoing correspondence of the banking firm from cashiers Philip H. (Harry) Gohn and
Fred G. Smith pertaining to a wide variety of business matters. The correspondence is
recorded in a series of nine letterpress books which bear the impression of outgoing

documents are also included. The record books are primarily accounting registers which
document the bank's financial status at any given time.</p>

and Virginia to his sister Agnes during the Civil War, a letter he wrote from Fort
Buford, North Dakota to his sister Bertha during his Indian Wars service, letters
from Clow’s sister Bertha to his daughter Cora, and other correspondents from other
family members. Most letters contain family news and some local conditions in San
Jose, California, Hawaii, and Seattle, Washington. Sixty family photographs are also
included, along with a biography of Richard H. Clow titled <title render="italic">Rough Enough</title> (2012) written by Richard H. McBee, Clow’s great-grandson

There are rough and final drafts of the books he wrote along with galley proofs. In addition
to his feature article manuscripts is correspondence that pertains to his writings, such as
acceptances and rejections of his articles. Almost all of his articles are on the subject of
the outdoors. The material was first sorted into series and chronologically arranged
thereafter, except in the case of the unpublished or date of publication unknown
manuscripts. These materials are arranged alphabetically according to title.</p>

<p>These are all book manuscripts written by Norman Strung. These manuscripts fit into
different groups, the books Norman wrote alone, the books Strung wrote with others, the
books he edited and the books he just contributed an article and chapter to. The

<p>Manuscripts of magazine feature articles written by Norman Strung, along with pertinent
correspondence. Some manuscripts were written under several various pseudonyms for
mostly sports/outdoor magazines. The other names Strung sometimes used were Bart Yaeger
and Asouf Barkee. Also included are articles Norman Strung "ghostwrote" for another man
by the name of Walter Cook. The articles are arranged chronologically beginning with the
earliest year. Two subseries divide these articles by those whose publication can be
confirmed and those whose publication is uncertain.</p>

<p>Letters, journals, diary and miscellaneous documents created by William S. Prentiss,
Roderick Prentiss, William Prentiss, and their descendants. Nine letters were written by
Roderick to his brother, William which describe his experiences as a cadet at the United
States Naval Academy and an officer serving aboard the United States Naval vessels <emph render="italic">Portsmouth</emph>, <emph render="italic">Crusader</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Monongahela</emph>. The letters describe student life, shipboard
incidents, and fellow shipmates in some detail. Two additional letters from Roderick were
written to his father, William S. Prentiss, just days before Roderick's death during the
Battle of Mobile. These letters describe Roderick's religious conversion and presentment of
death in addition to preparations for the upcoming fight. One letter from William S.
Prentiss to his wife Mary discusses the aftermath of their son's death, and two additional
letters to William S. Prentiss from William B. Lewis and Oliver Ambrose Batcheller, officers
on the <emph render="italic">USS Monongahela</emph>, give additional details on Roderick's
death. Three bound journals kept by Roderick document his service on the <emph render="italic">Plymouth</emph>, <emph render="italic">Portsmouth</emph>, and <emph render="italic">San Jacinto</emph>. Much of the information in these journals is as
detailed as a ship's log, but although often signed by the ship's commander, they do not
appear to be the official log for any of the vessels. The overland trail diary of William
Prentiss documents his departure from LaGrange Indiana and subsequent journey to the gold
fields of Montana Territory. Prentiss traveled with several other men, following a route
along the Platte River in present day Nebraska to Fort Laramie. From that point they veered
northwest and followed the Bridger Trail from present day Caspar, Wyoming and through the
Big Horn basin. After reaching the Yellowstone River they went through the Bozeman Pass and
ended their journey at Virginia City. The diary records Prentiss's unsuccessful time
searching for gold in Alder Gulch and his decision to return to Indiana after reading of his
brother's death in a Salt Lake City newspaper. The route home followed the Virginia
City-Salt Lake City trail to Soda Springs, and then southeast to Fort Bridger before again
turning east across Nebraska. The diary describes travel companions and trail incidents in
varying detail. The collection also includes transcriptions of Roderick's letters, some of
his journals, and William's overland trail diary prepared in 1987 by his great-great
granddaughter, Carol Opstad Jaeger. A single folder of miscellaneous documents, including an
unidentified reminiscence by a Prentiss family descendant, is included. The items in this
collection have been calendared by genre and thereafter in chronological order.</p>

<p>The Suckley papers consist of three autographed letters he received from Isaac I.
Stevens, a newspaper clipping, and two engravings of Stevens printed during the
Civil War. The earliest letter, dated October 2, 1853, Flathead Village, St. Mary’s
Valley, gives Suckley his specific orders for exploration by the most practical
route to Olympia, Washington Territory. The second letter, dated April 18, 1853 is a
“true copy” of an order written by George Simpson of the Hudson Bay House, Lachine,
Canada. The order advises all Hudson Bay employees to extend courtesies and supplies
to Isaac Stevens and his surveying party while passing through the northwest on
their surveying trip. This letter has a handwritten endorsement by Stevens dated
October 3, 1853, St. Mary’s Valley, for Suckley’s use during his reconnaissance. The
final letter was written by Stevens on August 4, 1858 from Washington, D. C.,
requesting that Suckley provide him with specific information on various rapids
along the Columbia River and river boat navigation possibilities. The newspaper
clipping is from the December 30, 1859 edition of the Puget Sound Herald and
concerns a critique of the territorial governor’s recently published message. The
engravings are a formal portrait of Stevens and a depiction of his death at the
battle of Chantilly, Virginia.</p>

<p>The reports in this University Archives accession have been arranged in five series: County Agents, Indian Reservation Agents, Special Projects, Specialists, and Administration. A sixth series of duplicate reports microfilmed from the holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration, forms the last series.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Over the years as the agency evolved, county extension agents and home demonstration agents have assumed the responsibility to maintain offices where citizens can get information on agriculture, home economics, urban horticulture and related fields. These agents have worked with local people in developing educational programs such as the 4-H clubs, and encouraging local leadership by providing training and encouragement. Inherent in these duties has been a charge to keep accurate records and use them for evaluating the effectiveness of their work by submitting to the state and federal offices annual reports. In early years, the reports were typed with multiple carbon paper duplicates, with the original retained by the county office. The carbon copies sent to Washington, D. C. were eventually transferred to the National Archives where they were retained until 1954 when they were microfilmed and subsequently destroyed. (The microfilmed copies have been placed in Series 6 of this accession.) The folders in this series have been arranged alphabetically by county, and then chronologically within that county sort. Not all counties had an individual agent assigned to them, and in those cases where the agent's responsibilities included more than one county, the first county named has been used for the alphabetical sorting. Although the original folder titles have been retained, the following abbreviations have been used: C.A.=County Agent; H.D.A.=Home Demonstration Agent; A.A.=Associate Agent.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>In the early years of the Extension Service, agents posted in counties adjacent to Montana's Indian reservations assumed some of the duties associated with working for the various tribes on an ad hoc basis, but beginning in 1955 agents were specifically assigned to the task. Six of Montana's reservations had an assigned agent, all initially supervised by Verne Dusenberry. As in the case of the county agents, Indian reservation extension agents filed annual reports on their activities. The folders in this series have been arranged alphabetically by reservation name, and then chronologically within that reservation name sort.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Several individual agricultural communities were assigned their own agents in addition to the county agents. The Huntley, Milk River, Sun River and Western Montana irrigation projects had their own agents who also filed annual reports. The folders in this series have been arranged alphabetically by project name, and then chronologically within that project name sort.</p>

<p>Annual and monthly reports issued by the Montana Extension Service director and subordinate officers such as the county agent leader, home demonstration agent leader, and 4-H club leader. Some correspondence files are also present in this series. The folders in this series have been arranged alphabetically by the administrative officer's title, and then chronologically within that name sort. Occasionally the officer's name is included.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>In 1952 the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) decided to reduce the size of Record Group 33, Extension Service Records, by microfilming the annual reports submitted by agents in the various states, including Montana. These reports were, in most cases, carbon duplicates of the reports already on file at individual state offices and the offices of individual agents, but important exceptions remained. For example, sometimes photographs submitted with the report forwarded to Washington were not duplicated in the report retained at the state level. Also, additions to the annual reports held by the state and individual agents' offices occasionally were not sent to Washington and therefore not filmed. Since the potential for significant differences exists, the film has been retained as a separate series in this archives record group. NARA filmed the records in rough chronological order, with county agents, specialists, Indian agents, and administrative reports all mixed together by year. A comprehensive inventory of the microfilm reels, with a cross index, is included in Box 99.</p>

<p>On January 28, 1966, Carolyn Riebeth typed a lengthy letter to Minnie Paugh, the Special
Collections librarian for Montana State University. Paugh had contacted Riebeth to inquire
about various early day residents of Crow Agency and the Crow reservation. Riebeth chose to
describe in great detail rancher Frank Michael Heinrich (1869-1928) and his cattle operation
on the reservation in the early twentieth century. Riebeth's letter describes the Heinrich
cattle roundups that she attended as a girl and biographical information about Heinrich
including his later activities as a Hardin, Montana banker.</p>

<p>This collection is organized into two series, the first dealing with the operation of
Myrick's ranch at Square Butte, Montana. In addition to some personal correspondence series one
also includes records dealing with Myrick family genealogy, and various Geraldine, Montana
institutions such as the Methodist Church, Equity Cooperative Association, and Farmers Union
Grain Terminal Association. Series two includes very detailed financial records pertaining
to Myrick's creation and presidency of the Square Butte Elevator Company.</p>

<p>Series 1 covers the personal and some business interests of H.D. Myrick. Included are
ledgers, cards, and inventory books that cover almost every aspect of the ranch's
operation. Also found in this series are more limited collections of Myrick's interests
including his involvement with a number of other organizations: financial records from
the Methodist Church of Geraldine, stock and correspondence regarding the Farmers Union
Grain Terminal Association, and ledgers from the Equity Cooperative Association. There
is little personal correspondence in this collection, but included are letters to and
from James C. Zanto, the man Myrick leased his ranch to when he moved to Bozeman. This
series is arranged with ranch papers, personal finance, personal correspondence, and
genealogy files preceding those dealing with the Farmer's Union Grain Terminal
Association and the Equity Cooperative Association.</p>

a business Myrick founded and served as president until its incorporation into the
Cooperative Elevator of Square Butte. Included are ledgers, audit reports, articles of
incorporation and other information on the company and its employees. When the Square
Butte Elevator Company was absorbed into the Cooperative Elevator of Square Butte,
Myrick maintained both stock and interest in the new company so there are some pieces
dealing with the new Cooperative. The contents of this series are arranged primarily in
chronological order across two boxes to show the progression of the company up until it
was absorbed into the Co-op.</p>

<p>Malcolm C. Story was born in Bozeman, Montana on June 12, 1902, son of Thomas Byron Story and grandson of Nelson Story, a prominent Montana pioneer. Malcolm attended local schools before enrolling in the Culver Military Academy and the Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He married Rose Ashby on Sept. 18, 1924, in Madisonville, Ky. After their marriage, they moved to Los Angeles where they lived for several years. He moved back to Montana in 1933. Considered an authority in local history and his famous family, Story was often sought out for information on those topics during his final years. He died on September 16, 1994. Winifred Story Lovelace was Malcolm's sister, also born in Bozeman on April 11, 1911. She married Bozeman businessman Jack Campbell Lovelace in 1933.

<p>William, James, John and Alex Glass formed a real estate operation 1904. In 1908 they reorganized with Frank Lindsay to form the Glass-Lindsay Land Company and contracted with the state Carey Land Act Board to build several reservoirs and irrigation canals as part of the Big Timber project. In addition to two reservoirs, the company built thirty-five miles of canals to transport water to irrigate sugar beets and fruit. The project was completed about 1915. Among the settlers who came to the area to establish farms were members of the Church of the Brethren. This tape created by librarian Minnie Paugh features twenty-five residents of the Big Timber area who met to share their memories of the Glass-Lindsay development. The original audiotape reel was combined with several transactions of the Montana Institute of the Arts meetings and placed in Collection 298 as tape numbers 52-56. Two blueprint drawings of the project's reservoirs, a complete list of the speakers heard on the tape, and several copy photographs accompany this recorded meeting.

<p>The Chandler C. Cohagen papers consist of notes, photographs, printed materials, project
specifications and architectural drawings which document his long career as an architect in
Montana. Although the majority of the architectural projects in this collection were created
by Cohagen himself, works by other architects are also represented. The projects include
public and private buildings in Montana, Wyoming, and a few other states. Although there is
some repetition of project titles, each drawing set represents a separate contracted
project, a result of Cohagen being retained for remodeling previously designed buildings.
The collection has been arranged in three series. Series 1 contains architectural drawings
from projects Cohagen and his partners designed during his career dating from 1907-1971.
Series 2 is a collection project specifications correlating to drawings in Series 1. Series
3 contains miscellaneous material collected by Cohagen such as notes, photographs of
buildings, and printed articles.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>353 architectural drawing sets representing projects designed from 1907 to 1971. The
majority of the drawings were done by Cohagen, although a few represent work done by his
partners and other architectural firms. The drawings directly attributed to Cohagen were
designed under his own name, and under the corporate names of McIver and Cohagen,
Cohagen and Williams, and McIver, Cohagen and Williams. The majority of the drawings
pertain to projects in Montana and Wyoming, but a few other locations are represented.
When first accessioned, the drawings were given sequential numbers starting from 1, but
an agreement with the Western Heritage Center in Billings, Montana necessitated the
transfer of specific drawing sets to that institution. As a result, the sequential
numbering of these drawings represents gaps throughout the listing. Only the assigned
drawing set number and the title assigned by Cohagen to the project are represented in
this listing, and to assist researchers in locating specific drawing sets based on
location or project genre a special online catalog is available. <extref actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://arc.lib.montana.edu/architect/">Click here

in oversize metal cabinets, so there is no individual container listing for the

Most of the papers pertain to research conducted by Binkowski in preparation for his 1995 publication, <title render="italic">Col P. W. Norris: Yellowstone's Greatest Superintendent</title>. The book began as a local history project about Binkowski's childhood home, but during the course of his research, Binkowski discovered Norris' Michigan homestead was just blocks away from this home and largely forgotten by the local residents. The research notes collected by Binkowski contain mostly letters and periodical articles that he transcribed from source materials. Also included in these papers are versions of the Norris biography and a copy of Binkowski's earlier article, "From Prairie Mound to Yellowstone National Park." Of particular importance among the correspondents are letters from Wilna Krisher, and Aubrey Haines. The collection has been arranged in topically labeled folders.</p>

homesteader, first in Musselshell County, and later in Rosebud County. Weather conditions

106 black and white photographs taken of Quaw, his band members, and friends in Yellowstone
National Park, most of which are circa 1921-1922. The photographs are almost all informal
snapshots of Yellowstone scenes and the outdoor performance stage at the Canyon Hotel where
Quaw and his band performed with the "Canyon Hotel Follies" during the summer of 1922. Some
photographs appear to have been taken much later, showing Quaw holding a copy of his score
for <title render="italic">Yellowstone</title> which was not published until 1937. The
autograph album was presented to Quaw in late 1951 after he had performed a special concert
in Bozeman, Montana for many long-time residents, many of whom recalled his work in
Yellowstone. Those who attended the concert put together the album which contains many
tributes to Quaw as a musician and friend. Among the signers are Bozeman musician Louis Leo
Howard and architect Fred F. Willson. The printed materials in the collection consist of a
copy of <title render="italic">Yellowstone</title>, along with a mimeograph lyric sheet for
the song dated March 4,1947, a business card for Quaw as pianist for the "Lone Star Trio" at
Old Faithful Inn, and a program for a formal recital at Mammoth Hot Springs, September 11,

<p>The collection consists primarily of writings, drafts and final published works of the fly fishing and fly tying writer Dave Hughes. Varying levels of manuscript and magazine article drafts illustrate project progression and Hughes' writing process. Most works are non-fiction, relating to fly fishing and fly tying, but there are also some fiction works and works of poetry. The collection also includes both records of Hughe's daily life and his firsthand fly fishing experience in the form of fishing Logs and pocket journals where he has noted both environmental conditions, and the methods he and his companions used while fishing. Most of his experience is in the Rocky Mountain Region and Northwestern United States, but his writings also include fishing trips and travel in Canada, Japan, and Chile. There are both illustrated and physical examples of fly fishing lures, and other illustrative materials that were used in the production of his published works.</p>

<p>This study appears to have been conducted at the behest of the Federal Government, and covers the period between 1911 and 1938. According to a cover letter in one of the files, the compiler was H.V. Brown. The data for this study appears to have been gathered in 16 Montana counties, which were then used to present a state average. There is no final report with this series, although the USDA Farm Mortgage Recordings report for Montana is included.</p>

<p>This project is dated 1929 in the original inventory, but correspondence extant in the files runs from 1928 through 1935. The basic thrust of this project, which seems to have been coordinated or overseen by Harriet Cushman, was to establish standards and certification for Montana poultry flocks in line with those used by the American Poultry Association. There is much information about certification standards, including some used in Washington State, but no final report.</p>

<p>This project appears to have been geared toward gathering information about farm management and operations. Saunderson and Gilman are listed as the main authorities for the project, which was conducted in 1929. There is earlier information present, including crop records for 1925 and 1926. Records vary from farm summaries (containing expenses and profits) to complete records that include farm labor sheets and inventories. In the latter cases, cards are also present containing information about the farmer, his family, and any laborers present on the property. There is no final report with this series, or any indication as to the nature of the project itself. The mixed correspondence files seem to deal mostly with letters to county extension officers and are filed by the addressee's last name.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This series contains much information from a number of M.H. Saunderson's projects in the late 1930s. Prominent among them are a 1937-1938 range sheep study, a cooperative grazing document, soil conservation reports, drafts of two undated papers ("Some Questions of Policy in the Use and Management of Public Lands in the Eleven Western States" and "Agricultural Conservation Program from the Viewpoint of the Northwest Livestock Producer"), and a Farm Account Book from Alfred Anderson covering the period from 1923-1930. There is no indication of the purpose of the Anderson book, and no final reports are present for the range sheep study or the cooperative grazing and soil conservation projects. The agricultural conservation materials seem to be mostly from the USDA. Conservation program information tailored for Pondera County is featured, along with some information for Yellowstone County. There is also a Work Progress Authority memo and a copy of a Montana soil conservation law (HB 298) from 1937. The range survey data seems to come from 1937, and includes some cooperative grazing agreements and information.</p>

<p>No final report for this study is contained in these records. The study seems to have been based on land sales conducted during June of 1957, although there are some earlier samples included in the voided surveys files. The study consisted of four types of interviews (Bidder, Buyer, Dealer, and Seller) conducted for land sales. The interview sheets are color-coded and further identified by county and a numeric code for each parcel of land sold. Most of the interviews were conducted by Paul Pilati, W. Rehberg, H. Walton, or Laurence (no initial was given for Laurence, which may be a first or last name). This series is organized by interview type, followed by county and then sale number. Not all the interviews are present in these records, as there are gaps between many of the numbers. A final file contains a copy of the "instructions for enumerators," a blank survey form, and notes covering three counties (Custer, Roosevelt, and Cascade) not included in the interviews. There is also an owners' survey for Golden Valley. Interview series marked with an asterisk are incomplete. The purpose of this study seems to have been to collect data regarding the price of land, reasons for buying and selling, and some occupational information about those involved.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>No final report or contextual documentation is included with this series. It consists of a number of questionnaires developed to record farm information (including labor, crops and livestock raised, hiring plans and preferences, information about the farm families, and so on) from 1941 and into 1942. The interviews were conducted during the summer of 1942 on around 300 Montana farms in a number of counties. The forms are numbered (except those marked for discard), but there appears to be no method for the numbering process. Questions on the forms include number of laborers, hiring preferences of the farmer (based on gender, town/vs farm origin, age, and racial groupings), available housing, use of employment service, labor statistics for workers and family members, crops/livestock raised during the study's period, location of the farm and its acreage, and so on. Labor figures and "Crop War Units" and "LWU's" are totaled on the accepted forms in colored pencil, but the series gives no indication as to the meaning of these markings. A set of interviewer instructions, a blank and completed example form, and a number of rejected forms are also included. Forms are rejected based on either the farmer's not farming in 1941 or incomplete entries (most often in the labor sections). The numeric system of the accepted forms has been preserved in this series.</p>

<p>There is no final report or authority with this data, which seems to have been gathered during the 1920s and up to about 1933. R.R. Renne was involved in at least some aspects of the data gathering, as his name appears on scattered correspondence in some of the files. Records include: Information on mill levies and taxes paid on selected property in the counties studied; correspondence relating to tax information from those counties; tabulated data regarding railroad tax monies and how they were used in selected counties. The data was originally packaged in folders divided into regions, and this separation has been roughly preserved. The original designations were Central District (there appear to have been two - one containing Fergus, Lewis &amp; Clark, Cascade, and Petroleum counties and another containing Golden Valley and Musselshell counties), South East District (Custer and Rosebud counties), North West District (Missoula and Flathead counties), South West District (Madison, Gallatin, and Beaverhead counties), North East District (Dawson, McCone, Sheridan, and Valley counties), South Central District (Carbon, Big Horn, Sweet Grass and Yellowstone counties), and North Central District (Hill, Teton, Chouteau, and, Blaine counties). The railroad tax information is limited to 1933 and focuses mainly on its use for education.</p>

<p>This series consists of cards recording farm foreclosure information for a number of Montana counties from about 1900 through 1936. The period covered seems to depend on the county being surveyed. Most of the cards contain notes, and some even show that they have been researched a second and third time. However, there is no indication in this series as to what this data was used for. It is possibly the original source data for the reports contained in Series 32, although the periods being studied do not match and there is no correspondence or other information to back up this assumption. There is also a discrepancy between the counties used in the Series 32 study and the counties with completed cards in this Series. In all, fourteen counties were studied, with a number of reclassifications being done. The final folders contain tabulated data on all bankruptcies and foreclosures of Montana farms between 1898 and 1937.</p>

<p>The Sylvester Nemes Papers primarily contain research, notes, drafts and manuscripts of Nemes's books, both his published works on fly fishing, as well as two unpublished works of historical fiction. His research materials include typed pages and handwritten notes in spiral-bound notebooks, as well as galley proofs and artwork. The collection also contains a large amount of correspondence from readers and fans who expressed the admiration for Nemes's work, and submitted orders for his books and hand-tied flies. A small amount of biographical material is also included in the collection, and includes family correspondence, a brief biography, miscellaneous personal records, and his obituary. Nemes's business and professional records mostly consist of correspondence with publishers, book and fly orders and invoices, and other records related to the writing and publishing of his books. In the final series there are photographs, negatives, memorabilia, and several binders of slides taken by Nemes of flies, landscapes in the West and in England and Scotland, fish and rivers, and friends and family.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Nemes's biographical materials include a small assortment of personal items and descriptions of his life.

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Personal materials; business correspondence and photo orders; operational papers from the Yellowstone, Saint Paul, Fargo studios and Haynes Palace Studio Car; operational papers from several stage companies. Personal information forms only a small part of the extant papers. The bulk of material is grouped around the business activities of Haynes' photography studios, especially customer order and supply correspondence, and the business records of the Monida and Yellowstone Stage Company and the Yellowstone-Western Stage Company. Small sections of material from the Yellowstone Park Stage Company and the Montana and Yellowstone Park Transfer Company are available, as well as a box of information on the short-lived Cody-Sylvan Pass Motor Company, the Park's first motorized transportation line.</p>
<p> Records from the various business activities of the firm F. Jay Haynes (including F. Jay Haynes and Brother) constitute about half the bulk of the collection. General business records including bills, invoices, and supplies orders are found here and are paralleled by invoice ledgers found in Collection 1501. The scope of Haynes business as a purveyor of photographs is represented only in a not-quite-statistical sample. Routine photography orders for the year roughly between October 1886 and November 1887 are the only reasonably complete files of this record type, but give a fair indication of the scope and volume of business. Researchers using the business correspondence should compare the invoices and bills found in other sections of the collection as well as in the bound books in Collection 1501. The activities of the Haynes Palace Studio Car are related in the narrative reports furnished to Haynes by his operators, and business activity through the mobile studio can be glimpsed in the "waybills" reporting the negatives taken during a given period. Other records for the car are in the Haynes papers at the Montana Historical Society.</p>
<p> Information from Haynes photographic concession activity in Yellowstone, primarily in the Mammoth studio, is found in the papers, though not as comprehensively as could be wished. Data in this section relates specifically to business; subsistence expenses will be found in the general business papers (except for Yellowstone Park Association bills, which are interfiled in this section). Sales accounts from the stands in the hotels and photo orders taken in the Park for later delivery are also included.</p>
<p> A small section of papers survive from the period of F. Jay Haynes' part-ownership in the Wylie Permanent Camping Company. Haynes had attempted to organize a lodging company similar to the permanent camps and was powerful enough that to keep him from doing so he was allowed to buy out one-third interest in the Wylie Company.</p>
<p> Perhaps the most colorful section of the papers relate to Haynes' most successful Yellowstone ventures, the transportation companies. He became half owner with George Wakefield of the Yellowstone Park Stage Company in 1885, moving tourists between Cinnabar and Mammoth in direct competition with the larger stage lines. Operating without a license the company was barred from the Park and folded. The Monida and Yellowstone Stage Company, organized in 1898 and incorporated in 1900, became the largest stage business in the Park partially due to its connection through the Park's west entrance to the Oregon Short Line Rail Road and consequently to the larger Union Pacific. Due to the loss of his concession over ticket pricing Haynes organized a parallel company under the name Yellowstone-Western Stage Company, recaptured the concession, and bought out the plant of the Monida and Yellowstone Stage Company. Significant topics covered in this section are the 1903 controversy with the Yellowstone Lake Boat Company, the 1912 stock suit and 1913 revocation of the Monida and Yellowstone Stage Company concession, the organization of the YW, and the dissolution of the YW and liquidation of its plant. The bound financial, passenger, and stock ledgers from the MY and YW are found in Collection 1502. Toward the end of the Yellowstone-Western Stage Company section of papers will be found a small collection of materials related to the Cody-Sylvan Pass Motor Company which operated only for the 1915 season transferring passengers between Cody, Wyoming, and Yellowstone Lake. The park's first motorized stage line, it served as the prototype for the 1916 reorganization of the transportation business.</p>

Agricultural College at Bozeman and the College of Montana at Deer Lodge; social life and
customs in Bozeman during the turn of the century; courtship and marriage. Newspaper
clippings, various programs from recitals he attended, photographs, and pamphlets have been
retained with the letters. In addition to letters Cobleigh wrote is one letter written to
his father. Also in the collection are two letters to his mother, one from a niece and one
from Cobleigh's sister, Elma Gallager. Several letters written to Esther Rose Cooley from
her friends are also in the papers. A few picture of friends and relatives from California

<p>The Beryl Stith papers consists of research and paste-up masters for her book <title render="italic">Terry Does Exist</title> and her family's personal and business papers.
Included are: fragments of original correspondence from John W. Stith and his wife Cornelia
which were mutilated by Beryl Stith when preparing the paste-up for her book; business
communications pertaining to Stith's real estate, insurance, and hardware operations; Terry
school board transactions, Justice of the Peace case documents; Custer County Commissioner
correspondence; miscellaneous invoices, receipts, and business letters. Fifty original
photographs of Stith family members, friends, and Terry, Montana, some of which were used in
Stith's book, are also included.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Copy pasteup, research papers, and mutilated original documents used by Stith for the
publication of <title render="italic">Terry Does Exist</title>. The book is divided into
three sections; the establishment of the town of Terry and two sections dealing with the
Stith family and their place in Terry's history. When assembling her book, Stith took
original letters exchanged by her parents and cut them into pieces to use as facsimile
illustrations for printing plates. The letters fragments in folder 6 were the result of
this practice and are impossible to collate into proper order.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>The Stith family papers consist of collected business files of John W. and Cornelia
Stith's professional careers. Cornelia Stith was Postmistress and Sunday School Teacher
in Terry for many years and collected listings of Sunday School books and documents
dealing with the delivery of mail. John Stith was a respected business man and public
servant during his time in Terry. His school clerk records consist of teacher and
maintenance contracts, apportionments, and correspondence from 1883 to 1907. John's time
as a Custer County commissioner are represented by constituent correspondence, petitions
for road and bridge construction and improvements, commissioner journals, and contracts.
Stith's Justice of the Peace (JP) files contain case files for minor civil actions
brought before the Terry, Montana court regarding cost recovery suits, witness
statements and judgments. One folder of JP papers includes bounty warrants for the
killing of coyotes, bobcats, and wolves. Stith's business interests in Terry are
represented by the balance of the files in this series. They include: real estate
transaction papers; insurance sales and correspondence; shipping bills and invoices for
wool buying operations; customer and client correspondence; merchandise orders for
Stith's hardware store; bank statements and a selection of cancelled checks.</p>

<p>The William H. Storrs diary (January 21, 1862-September 27, 1864) sporadically covers his
activities preceding his 1862 enlistment through his 1864 march from Little Rock to
Pocahontas, Arkansas. Many of the entries appear to have been written in retrospect, and two
lengthy gaps are represented: from August 21, 1862 to July 31, 1863, and from December 18,
1863 to September 19, 1864. Important events discussed in the entries include detailed
description of the battle of Shiloh, Tennessee, the advance on Corinth, Mississippi, and
return to Memphis, Tennessee in the spring of 1862. The 1863 march from Helena, Arkansas to
Little Rock and subsequent occupation of Little Rock are also described with some detail.
Entries concern troop movements, weather, fellow staff officers of the 77th and camp
conditions. Other Arkansas locations mentioned in the diary include DuVall's Bluff and
Brownsville.</p>

<p>The Keyes photograph album contains snapshots taken by Keyes and perhaps a few of his
friends during their hike through southwest Montana. The album contains images of
the steamship <emph render="italic">North Land</emph>, Mackinac Island, the North
Dakota Badlands, Bozeman, Bridger Canyon, Gallatin Canyon, Lone Peak, Virginia City,
the Red Rock valley, Sawtell's Ranch at Henry's Lake, Upper Geyser Basin, and Lake
Yellowstone. People pictured are Keyes and his companions, Edward C. Alderson, Jack
Bean, and Felix G. White. Two photographs of Yellowstone bears are also included.
Many of the photographs are captioned.</p>
<p>The diary contains entries created by Keyes simultaneously with the photographs he
took in the album, starting on July 3, 1899 when he and the student party left on
the train to Buffalo and ends with his entry of August 19, 1899. His notations are
incredibly detailed, noting the scenery, the content of his meals, and even the time
of day when certain described events occurred. Many of his fellow students are
mentioned, and geographic details and wildlife sightings recorded. Particularly
poignant are his entries from August 5, when he had his accident, through the end as
he bravely faces the fact he will be unable to complete the journey with his fellow
expedition members. In addition to the detailed diary entries, Keyes kept a table of
distances covered by the expedition on each day, given in miles covered and with
notations identifying camping spots. He also devotes several separate pages to trip
expenses, various contact addresses, and even a few hand-drawn sketches of wildlife
and camping sites.</p>

<p>This collection of published materials contains periodicals and newspapers (including clippings) by and about Wallace Stegner throughout his prolific writing career. Besides his large body of monographic works, he wrote fictional short stories; accounts based on his childhood in the west; articles on writing, conservation, western U.S. history, Mormons, the wilderness, and politics (primarily of the west and its future). The collection is organized into five series which, for the most part, conform to the arrangement of the sections in Colberg's published bibliography of Stegner. Series 1 contains Stegner articles from periodicals and newspapers. Series 2 is an assortment of short stories in periodicals. Series 3 consists of published interviews; articles about Stegner's body of work; book reviews by and about Stegner; miscellaneous materials containing lectures, addresses, reprints and quotes from his writings; articles by his son, Page and book announcements and collecting information. Series 4 contains the letters and postcards from Wallace Stegner to Nancy Colberg. Series 5 is a set of business correspondence between publishers, individuals, educational institutions and others and Wallace Stegner.</p>

There is also a small group of personal papers containing familial correspondence and genealogical information on the Burlingame family. Original documents created or collected by the William W. Alderson family, Gustavus C. Doane, and Harriette Cushman are also part of the Burlingame papers.</p>
<p> Original and photocopied correspondence, research notes, literary manuscripts, photographs, microfilm, and audiotapes created or collected by Merrill Burlingame were originally maintained by him in several four-drawer filing cabinets during the lengthy course of his career. The subject headings Burlingame assigned to the various folders were not consistent, and much repetition in these headings occurred over the years as he added to his collection. This duplication, along with Burlingame's practice of producing multiple carbon copies of his letters and notes, resulted in a great deal of redundancy in his filing system. The present arrangement represents a compromise between preserving Burlingame's original arrangement and efficiency in retrieval for researchers. Researchers should be cautioned, however, of the need to check the inventories of more than one series for pertinent material due to the difficulty in properly classifying the folder subject headings within any particular group. An asterisk (*) following a folder title indicates that material (either photographs or oversize documents) has been removed for storage elsewhere in the collection.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Notes, letters, printed materials, photocopied and original documents pertaining to a wide variety of historical personages, mostly connected with the development of Montana. In addition to the research notes that Burlingame created, some files contain actual manuscript materials created or collected by the biographical subject. While some of the subjects represented in this series figured prominently in the development of Gallatin County, most substantial biographical files of Gallatin County pioneers have been placed in series 2. There are also research files of a biographical nature in series 3, Montana and the Pioneer West. The materials in this series have been arranged alphabetically by the name of the biographical subject.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Notes, correspondence, photocopies, and original documents pertaining to the history of Gallatin County, Montana and the city of Bozeman, Montana. The topically labeled folders cover a wide variety of people, places, and events associated with Gallatin County history. Original documents created or collected by the W. W. Alderson family are included with this series as are files of biographical information on many prominent local personalities. Again, other biographical files of prominent Montanans can be found in series 1, Biographical files and series 3, Montana and the Frontier West. Research materials pertaining to Montana State College (Montana State University) in Bozeman have been placed in series 7. Much of the material dealing with the Christian Church in this series pertains to Burlingame's historical research on the Bozeman congregation and original copies of the Bozeman church's newspaper. For other Christian Church materials of a personal nature see series 8 and 10.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Notes, correspondence, photocopies, and original documents pertaining to the history of Montana and the pioneer west. These topically arranged folders cover a wide variety of material that documents Burlingame's research interests in Montana's past beyond Gallatin County and Bozeman. Original documents created or collected by Captain Gustavus C. Doane and his wife, Mary Hunter Doane, are included in this series, along with drafts of an unpublished manuscript biography of Doane written by Burlingame in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Some material on Montana Native Americans is included in this series, usually in the context of the Indian Wars and the frontier military. More complete research in this area is represented in series 6, Indians.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Letters written to or by Merrill Burlingame on a wide variety of research topics and matters of personal interest. Unlike correspondence found in the other series, these letters were maintained by Burlingame as a separate file regardless of their subject content. As a result much of the information contained within the letters pertains to subject files listed elsewhere. Most files are quite scant, containing few reference queries or brief replies from Burlingame. An important exception are the letters of W. J. "Duke" Ellington, an employee of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and administrator at the Rocky Boy reservation in the 1940s. The folders have been alphabetically arranged by the title Burlingame assigned them.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Primarily research notes and summary forms documenting a comprehensive list of Montana place names created or collected by Burlingame. Material explaining the origin of the particular name is included in some files along with pertinent correspondence from interested individuals.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Notes, correspondence, photocopies and original documents pertaining to Native American tribes. Montana groups predominate, but some of the files are of a general nature. Some of the files were created while Burlingame conducted research for court cases involving the Crow, Salish, Kutenai, Blackfeet and Gros Ventre tribes during the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Notes, correspondence, photocopies, and original documents pertaining to the history of MSU and selected administrators, faculty, and staff.

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Microfilmed primary source materials collected by Burlingame from various institutions in the United States and Canada pertaining to a wide variety of historical subjects and persons. Institutions from which the microfilm was ordered includes Harvard, Yale, New York Public Library, Missouri Historical Society, and the Manitoba Archives. Permission to use any of this material must be granted by the institutions holding the original documents. Information in brackets has been taken from the order form Burlingame filled out for some institutions and may refer to that institution's control number of the documents that were duplicated.

<p>The Datus C. Proper papers consist of journals, correspondence, family history documents, literary manuscript drafts, galley proofs, research notes, publisher correspondence, photographs and other memorabilia which document Proper's life as a student, United States Foreign Service officer, and outdoor writer. His family history documents feature materials pertaining to Proper's extended family ancestors, including notes and clippings about Ida Sedgwick Proper, and the Civil War diary of Datus DeWitt Proper, corporal, 19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry. Datus Proper's journals document his early interest in fly fishing and hunting, containing both diary-like entries and miscellaneous notes that he later used in his published writings. The manuscript drafts encompass many, but not all, of Proper's articles for magazines like <title render="italic">Field and Stream</title>, and his four full length books. A research vertical file of clippings and miscellaneous notes maintained by Proper for reference purposes has also been preserved within this collection, along with a small collection of photographs, some of which were used to illustrate Proper's published articles. The subjects of Proper's writings encompass the full spectrum of fly fishing for trout, from stream side entomology to the ethics of catch and release angling. Hunting, particularly pheasant hunting and the training of dogs for the sport, is another subject heavily represented. Proper also wrote on Portugal, a country in which he had served during his career with the State Department, and in addition to his writings he saved some letters and documents written in Portuguese. Correspondents found in this collection include Vince Marinaro, Nick Lyons, Paul Schullery, and other prominent fly fishing and hunting writers. Oversize materials include topographical maps marked with locations of Proper's hunting and fishing trips, certificates and awards, and tracings of fish that Proper caught and measured.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's journals document his hunting and fishing experiences and feature entries related to his article and book ideas. Proper's earliest fishing journal dates from 1951 and documents trout fishing while a student in New Hampshire. The bulk of his journals date from Proper's active writing career between 1965 and 2003, and detail his experiences fishing and hunting in Brazil, Portugal, Ireland, Montana, and elsewhere in the United States. The inclusive dates for each journal are approximate, and many diaries have laid-in notes placed by Proper in reference to his magazine article compositions.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's correspondence files feature incoming and outgoing letters with publishers, readers, reviewers, family, friends, and other sportsmen. The bulk of the correspondence relates to Proper's writing career and includes feedback from readers and editors, hunting and fishing tips exchanged with friends and colleagues, and information requests from Proper to other writers and sportsmen. Proper maintained these files during his lifetime, and created generic alphabetical groupings based on correspondent name or created individual files for more frequent correspondents.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's family papers document his personal life and family history. They include several personal items from his childhood including a baby book, school ephemera from Exeter Academy, student essays, and report cards. They also include a small amount of family correspondence and records documenting his career as a Foreign Service officer at the State Department. Records documenting his family history include genealogical records and collected items and biographies of Proper's distant relatives Datus Dewitt Proper (1844-1922), Ida Sedgwick Proper (1876-1957), and Datus Edwin Proper (1896-1965). Among these collected items is a Civil War diary written by Datus Dewitt Proper between 1864 and 1865, documenting his service in Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's magazine articles include manuscript drafts, galley proofs, notes, publisher correspondence, research letters, and a partial physical bibliography of Proper's magazine publications. Proper's drafts touch on a wide range of topics including fishing, fly tying, dogs, hunting, game birds, cooking wild game, wilderness, and life in the outdoors.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's book publication files document the production of his four published books: <emph render="italic">What the Trout Said</emph> (1982; rev. ed. 1989); <emph render="italic">Pheasants of the Mind</emph> (1990; rev. ed. 1994); <emph render="italic">The Last Old Place: A Search Through Portugal</emph> (1992); and <emph render="italic">Running Waters</emph> (2001). Each draft combined portions of previously published essays with new original compositions. These files contain manuscript drafts, publisher correspondence, published book reviews, reader's letters, and notes pertaining to each book.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's unfinished book manuscript features chapter drafts from a book he began working on during the end of his life titled variously as "The Home Place" or simply "Home." The book draws from Proper's previously published articles and attempts to examine his personal relationship with nature and how his chosen lifestyle had been affected by the land and the elements. The manuscript is organized into twelve chapters named after the months of the year and address broader themes such as home building in an environmentally sensitive area, hunting, fishing, and mankind's ever-changing relationship with nature. Proper intended to use many of his earlier magazine articles as a basis for each chapter and named the chapter title drafts the months of the year. He annotated the composition with comments about where to cut certain passages, add other passages, and consider other chapters where the composition might be better placed. Throughout his writing and editing process, Proper solicited feedback from his agent, Knox Burger, and other readers, and included their suggestions in with his drafts. As a result, there is a great deal of repetition between the contents of this incomplete manuscript and Proper's published articles.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's subject vertical files feature topical files maintained by Proper in support of research for his publications. The files relate to topics of interest to Proper including fly fishing, hunting, streams and rivers, dogs, guns, and wild game. Although most files contain little more than printed materials, occasionally Proper would place letters or notes he felt relevant to the folder's title.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's memorial service materials include a small set of documents from his funeral and letters of condolence to his widow. They feature obituaries, testimonials, and a recording of his funeral service.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>Proper's photographs feature sets of 35mm slides and prints he selected for use in his publications. Although most were never featured in his published works, the images relate to topics addressed in Proper's books and articles including fly tying, trout stream fishing, and hunting dogs. Several sets of prints also document his travels in Portugal, which he detailed in his 1993 book, The Last Old Place: A Search Through Portugal. A very small set of photos include photos of Proper during his childhood and portraits of him as an adult.</p>

<p>Winifred's diaries are actually typed transcripts, prepared by library personnel from
originals Considine loaned in 1963 and which were returned to her. They concern her
activities on the Considine ranch, including her interests in horticulture and gardening.
Entries during the early years are sporadic and generally conform to the growing season
(March-October), but as time progressed Considine began to record her experiences with more
regularity throughout the year. Some entries are quite detailed, describing Mart's
activities planting, harvesting, and working with cattle. Winifred describes her neighbors
and her reactions to national news events as well as giving in depth accounts of what
particular garden plants she worked with, the production of her chickens, and weather
observations. The typed transcription has been completely paginated, and the transcripts are
divided by years with the sequential page numbers included in the folder title.</p>

<p>In 1906 Mary Kirk enrolled in Professor Helen Brewer's American history class at the
Montana College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts. To complete the major assignment of the
course work, Kirk interviewed several Bozeman, Montana pioneers to compose an essay on
pioneer transportation methods that she titled "Early Travel in Montana." The piece consists
of both typescript and handwritten pages, and two vintage photographs have been pasted on
separate pages to illustrate the narrative. The essay itself is brief, but the annotations
refer to the additional paraphrased interviews Kirk conducted from February through April,
1906 and presented as appendices to her paper. The interviewees and their subjects are:
White Calfee (b. 1840), discussing freighting operations by mule train from Bozeman to Crow
Agency and other locations; Walter Cooper (1843-1924) and Mrs. Mariam Skeels Cooper
(1852-1925), describing Mrs. Cooper's 1865 trip to Montana Territory by steamboat and wagon,
and subsequent trips with her husband by wagon hauling furs to both steamboat and railroad
shipping points; Mrs. Susan Celesta Hunter (b. 1835) relating her 1864 journey to Montana
along the Bozeman Trail and subsequent settlement at Hunter's Hot Springs; Henry Monforton
(b. 1829) relating his experiences traveling from Missouri to Virginia City, Montana in
1863; Mrs. Sarah Jane Bessey Tracy describing her journey by a Missouri River steamboat to
Fort Benton, Montana in 1869; Edward M. Davidson (1843-1916) gives an account of crossing
the plains from Wisconsin to Montana by ox cart in 1864; Mrs. Catherine Boyd Waterman (b.
1835) who traveled from New York to California via the Isthmus of Panama in 1865, and then
overland by stagecoach to join her husband in Virginia City, Montana; Mrs. Rosa V. Beall
(1838-1930) who came to Gallatin County, Montana in 1864 from Iowa via the Bozeman Trail;
Mrs. Blanch A. Sloan (1853-1917) who came to Montana in 1877 by rail from Kentucky to
Corrine, Utah, and then by wagon to Gallatin County; Thomas Lewis (b. 1843) who ran a
freighting outfit for the Bozeman firm of Willson and Rich during the 1870s. The interview
summaries of White Calfee, Mariam Cooper, and Blanch Sloan have been signed by the
interviewees.</p>
