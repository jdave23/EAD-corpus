<p>Material in the F. Jay Haynes papers originated in several businesses with operations scattered in offices diverse locations. Despite the volume of material that survives it is obvious that much material is now missing or was never kept. No series or file should be considered more than representative of Haynes' activities in that business. Much of the bulk, including the bound ledgers now in Collections 1501 and 1502, was kept in Haynes' Saint Paul studio until his death in 1921. Son Jack Ellis Haynes came to possess his father's papers in several stages: first when he assumed the Yellowstone photography concession in 1915, when he bought from his father the entire family photography businesses in 1916, then as executor of the estate upon F. Jay Haynes' death.</p>
<p>In 1945 Jack E. Haynes moved the Haynes business from St. Paul to Bozeman, Montana. He closed the Minnesota studio and transferred the records and negatives to the new Haynes Studios Inc. warehouse. In the early 1950s, while beginning to compile a book of general Yellowstone history, Haynes began to rearrange F. Jay Haynes's business and personal papers, interfiling much of it into his own research files and occasionally adding thereto. Jack planted most of his father's papers (primarily correspondence) and stage company documentation, as he did his own working correspondence, within his own files in alphabetical order under "Haynes, F. Jay." Jack's death in 1962 halted work on his book. With permission of Isabel Haynes, the combined research files were used by Aubrey Haines for producing a work similar to Jack's book, a two-volume narrative history completed in 1977, <title render="italic">The Yellowstone Story</title>.</p>
<p>In 1977 Jack's widow Isabel Haynes deeded the family's collected library with the business and personal records, family photographs, and research files (including the materials in this collection) through the Haynes Foundation to the Montana State University Libraries. Memorabilia and the 20,000-negative collection and records relating to it (registers, copyright documents, etc.) were given to the Montana Historical Society.</p>
