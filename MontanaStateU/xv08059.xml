      <p>Merrill G. Burlingame (1901-1994) was a professor of history at Montana State University
        and an avid collector of historical documents for his own research. Many times during his
        career he donated some of the material he had collected to various institutions such as the
        Museum of the Rockies, the Montana Historical Society, and Montana State University. With
        these donations, Burlingame would sometimes provide provenance information, but just as
        often not, as is the case with "The History of a Bridle: A True Story and Confession of Road
        Agents and Horse Thieves in Montana." A 45 page handwritten manuscript done in pencil on
        highly acidic paper, "The History of a Bridle," came into Burlingame's possession sometime
        around 1955. He considered the essay important enough to engage Mrs. Rosemary S. Barnett to
        transcribe the document that year, but by the time he donated the piece to MSU Burlingame
        provided no more information other than the identity of the typist. As a result the MSU
        library staff erroneously listed Mrs. Barnett as the author when the essay was described in
        the public access catalog. The original manuscript itself could possibly be a transcription
        from another source, but the handwriting does not appear to be Burlingame's and there are no
        clues as to where such a source might have been consulted.</p>

      <p>"The History of a Bridle" is a narrative of Montana's vigilante activity starting in 1864,
        although it appears the document was composed much later in the nineteenth or early
        twentieth century. The unknown author, writing in the first person, describes his trip from
        Denver to Virginia City in the spring of 1864 in company with a mule train laden with
        supplies for a mercantile operation. At one point of this journey the author claims to have
        ridden on the overland stage line and identifies "Rowdy Pete" as his driver. After working a
        claim in German Gulch, the author describes a horseback trip to Atchison, Kansas in 1865 and
        his return to Helena, Montana in 1866. The narrative thereafter describes a great deal of
        vigilante activity primarily in the Helena area, although the chronology of the events is
        not always apparent. Most of the participants are identified by initials only, and their
        organization is identified as the "3-7-77 Committee." The essay apparently takes its title
        from the description of a hair bridle fashioned by an outlaw named "Henry" serving his
        sentence in the territorial prison. The original essay and its typed transcription have been
        placed in separate folders.</p>
