            <p> Joseph Henry "Joe" Rawlins was born at Crow Agency, Montana on July 13, 1920. He was
                a proud member of the Crow tribe and his name in their language was Shikaakiiche
                (Good Boy). Joe joined the military in World War II and served as a pilot in that
                conflict and also Korea. He attended the University of Montana and graduated with a
                geology degree, working thereafter as a consultant to many of the major gas, oil,
                and coal companies operating in eastern Montana. His office was in Billings, and
                much of his work was done in that area and the adjacent Crow reservation. Joe
                married Gladys Habener on March 10, 1947 and the couple had two sons. Joe Rawlins
                died on January 20, 1997.</p>

            <p>The Rawlins diaries consist of thirty one individual annual volumes dated from 1968
                to 1997 (there are two for 1981). Information in the diaries includes appointments,
                travel, consultations, technical data, and some personal observations of Rawlins as
                he worked as a consulting geologist. Many of the named Rawlins contacts are members

                Rawlins advised on water well locations for named individuals. A small amount of
                laid-in materials such as receipts and notations have been retained in those volumes
                where they were found.</p>
