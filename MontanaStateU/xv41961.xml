            <p>George Suckley was born in 1830 in New York City. In April 1853 Suckley was appointed
                assistant surgeon and naturalist to the Pacific Railroad Survey of the 47th and 49th
                parallels between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Fort Vancouver, Washington Territory,
                under the command of Isaac I. Stevens. His work on the survey included a 1,049 mile,
                53-day canoe trip down the Bitter Root, Clark's Fork, and Columbia Rivers to Fort
                Vancouver, during which he made extensive natural history collections. Although
                commissioned as a surgeon with the U.S. Army, Suckley resigned to pursue his work as
                a naturalist during the latter 1850s. On the outbreak of the Civil War, Suckley
                rejoined the Army and was commissioned Surgeon of Volunteers. He served for the
                duration of the war, resigning April 22, 1865. Suckley died July 30, 1869, in New
                York City.</p>
            <p>Isaac Ingalls Stevens was born in 1818 in Massachusetts. He was the first Governor of
                Washington Territory, serving 1853-1857. He also served as a United States
                Congressman and a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War
                until his death at the Battle of Chantilly in 1862.</p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
            <p>The Suckley papers consist of three autographed letters he received from Isaac I.
                Stevens, a newspaper clipping, and two engravings of Stevens printed during the
                Civil War. The earliest letter, dated October 2, 1853, Flathead Village, St. Mary’s
                Valley, gives Suckley his specific orders for exploration by the most practical
                route to Olympia, Washington Territory. The second letter, dated April 18, 1853 is a
                “true copy” of an order written by George Simpson of the Hudson Bay House, Lachine,
                Canada. The order advises all Hudson Bay employees to extend courtesies and supplies
                to Isaac Stevens and his surveying party while passing through the northwest on
                their surveying trip. This letter has a handwritten endorsement by Stevens dated
                October 3, 1853, St. Mary’s Valley, for Suckley’s use during his reconnaissance. The
                final letter was written by Stevens on August 4, 1858 from Washington, D. C.,
                requesting that Suckley provide him with specific information on various rapids
                along the Columbia River and river boat navigation possibilities. The newspaper
                clipping is from the December 30, 1859 edition of the Puget Sound Herald and
                concerns a critique of the territorial governor’s recently published message. The
                engravings are a formal portrait of Stevens and a depiction of his death at the
                battle of Chantilly, Virginia.</p>
