      <p>Victor E. George was born on June 6, 1893 in Carbon County, Montana. He grew up on his
        parents' ranch near the present day town of Roscoe, Montana and attended the Billings
        Polytechnic Institute where he earned a teaching certificate in 1911. That year George began
        teaching school in rural Carbon and Stillwater Counties, but he left the profession after
        five years to resume ranching full time. He married Margaret Ryan on December 31, 1931 and
        the couple had four daughters. In 1950, George retired from ranching and moved to Billings,
        Montana where he worked in retail sales and real estate. He died in 1980 at his home in
        Billings.</p>

      <p>The Victor George diary is a positive photocopy of a ruled notebook containing entries
        which document his activities from 1907 to 1931. Although presented in chronological order,
        it does not appear as if the entries were written on the recorded dates but rather
        transcribed at a later time from memory or another source. Most of the entries are quite
        terse, and few are beyond a single sentence that summarizes a day's activities such as
        teaching school, travel to different Montana towns, and ranch chores. Beyond the
        chronological entries, George recorded in his notebook cattle and livestock numbers and
        sales, family birthdays, and short essays regarding particular events or people in his
        extended family.</p>
