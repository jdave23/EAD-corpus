            <p>Margaret Patten was born on January 30, 1903 in Helena, Montana to Lawyer George
                Patten and his wife Eleanor Patten. Margaret grew up in Bozeman with her two-younger
                sister, Mary who was 2 to 3 years younger, and Eleanor who was about 10 years
                younger than Margaret. Then in 1930 she moved to Chicago where she lived in a
                boarding house and had the occupation of stenographer. She then passed away on
                January 31, 1961 and was buried in Sunset Hills Cemetery in Bozeman, Montana.</p>

            <p>The Margaret Patten Letter to “Alice” consists of an original letter and typed
                transcription dated February 10, 1921 and was titled "A Strange Disappearance". The
                letter was addressed to someone who can only be identified as Alice. The letter
                discusses her recollection of a story that was told to her by the host of her camp
                about the deserted cabin of Andrew Levinski. The host tells her that Levinski had
                come to the United States from Poland many years ago and after getting here he was
                quite disappointed. He came to Gallatin Canyon in hopes of hitting it big with
                prospecting. This was not the case and this caused him to live a hermit lifestyle.
                Levinski thought that he had found a gold mine in the mountains of Gallatin Canyon,
                but his discovery had brought more prospectors to the area. The other prospectors
                had grouped together, and they formed a corporation that Levinski was not included
                in. Levinski, from the forming of the corporation on, thought that they were out for
                his claims. One day while walking up the mountain he was confronted by two members
                of the corporation, they were supposedly armed, causing Levinski to shoot them in
                self-defense. Levinski confessed to the murder which caused him to go to jail until
                his trail occurred in the summer. Once the trail was held he was acquitted with the
                verdict of Self-defense and then he went back to his cabin. Then next spring, they
                investigated his cabin after no one had heard from him and found it deserted;
                Levinski was not heard from again. She then finishes the letter by saying that they
                were saddling the horses for a trip to a scout station on the park line.</p>
