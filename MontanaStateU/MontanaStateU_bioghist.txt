<p>John Young was assigned to the Blackfeet Indian Agency in 1876 and served through 1883 when
a famine killed a number of the Indian residents. His administration was controversial, with
accusations surfacing that he had misappropriated funds earmarked for the Indians and gave
choice employment positions to relatives. One relative in particular was his daughter, Lucy
("Dotie") Young Ford, who joined her father during the summer of 1877 as a schoolteacher.
She was the wife of Edward Lloyd Ford, a publisher, born in Oswestry, Shropshire, England.
Ford had come to New York in his early youth and was a Civil War veteran, having served in
the Union Army. In 1867 he became a partner in the newly established publishing house of J.
B. Ford and Co., whose major periodical publication was the <title render="italic">Christian

apparatus, and devices for printing two sheets simultaneously, and for folding and pasting
one within the other.</p>

<p>In the late 1880s, a group of wealthy New York and Brooklyn maltster became interested in the farming opportunities in Gallatin County. By 1891 they bought 13,000 acres of land next to Manhattan and planted barley. The newly created Manhattan Malting Company was ran by an elite force from back east. Henry Altenbrand, Sr., a wealthy maltster from New York, was named president; Jacob Rupert, vice-president, owned the largest brewery in the world; and George Kinkel, Jr., son of the owner of the New York Yankees, was manager. These men were so influential that in 1891 they had the name of the town changed from Moreland to Manhattan after the Democratic Manhattan Club in New York where most of the stockholders were members. The company quickly grew. By 1892 the first elevator was completed which had a holding capacity of 275,000 bushels of barley. The malting plant was finished a year later and could hold an additional 250,000 bushels. The company purchased a Jacob Price Field Locomotive steam plow in order to farm its vast lands. This plow was the first of its type used in Montana and could plow forty acres a day. The company was building worldwide? fame as well when its first brewmaster, Louis DeKregnasis's product was famed across the country and was especially liked in Germany. In 1905 the Manhattan Malting Company sold its land to the Manhattan (Ranching) Company. The malting company continued to grow and in 1914 won the award for best malted barley by the Pabst Brewing Company in Milwaukee. The company could not, however, overcome prohibition. The plant closed early in 1915 when Idaho, Oregon and Washington became dry states. The company was forced out of business in 1919 when Montana passed prohibition on 1 January 1919. The malt house was condemned after the earthquake of 1925, but the farm houses of the company are still standing today and are occupied. Many of the older citizens of Manhattan still refer to the buildings as Number One and Number Two, as the malting company designated them. Harry Altenbrand, Jr. was the Manhattan Malting Company manager from 1905 until it closed. His house is now the Masonic Temple in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Merrill G. Burlingame (1901-1994) was a professor of history at Montana State University
and an avid collector of historical documents for his own research. Many times during his
career he donated some of the material he had collected to various institutions such as the
Museum of the Rockies, the Montana Historical Society, and Montana State University. With
these donations, Burlingame would sometimes provide provenance information, but just as
often not, as is the case with "The History of a Bridle: A True Story and Confession of Road
Agents and Horse Thieves in Montana." A 45 page handwritten manuscript done in pencil on
highly acidic paper, "The History of a Bridle," came into Burlingame's possession sometime
around 1955. He considered the essay important enough to engage Mrs. Rosemary S. Barnett to
transcribe the document that year, but by the time he donated the piece to MSU Burlingame
provided no more information other than the identity of the typist. As a result the MSU
library staff erroneously listed Mrs. Barnett as the author when the essay was described in
the public access catalog. The original manuscript itself could possibly be a transcription
from another source, but the handwriting does not appear to be Burlingame's and there are no
clues as to where such a source might have been consulted.</p>

in 1878 to Coulson in the Yellowstone Valley and again took up farming. The location of
their farm was about two and one half miles from the depot at Billings, and during the 1880s
they sold garden truck to W.A. Perry, the purchasing agent for the newly constructed
Northern Pacific railway. The Newman farm was near a ford on the river and many Indians
camped near the area as a result. In this context, Orson met Plenty Coups with whom he
maintained a long friendship. In 1858 Newman married Elizabeth Matilda Tripp and the couple

The group supports policies which will protect the environmental integrity of
Yellowstone National Park and maintain to the highest possible extent the natural
condition of the lands surrounding Yellowstone which together with the park comprise
the Great Yellowstone Ecosystem. They are a nationally known advocate for the idea
that ecosystem level sustainability and science should guide the management of the
region’s public and private lands. States that are a part of this coalition include
Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Issues that the GYC takes on include environmental
impacts, as well as conservations battles to preserve the Yellowstone National Park
ecosystem and the areas that surround it. The GYC covers more than 20 million acres,
three states, and Yellowstone National Park.</p>

Valley County) Montana and married Emily Lang in 1911. Balgord eventually became a sales
clerk and automobile dealer in Lavina and was elected to the Montana legislature as a
representative from 1933 to 1939 and a senator from 1941 to 1966. He also served on the
State Water Board and was a primary backer of the Deadman's Basin Water Project. The project
consists of a diversion canal from the Musselshell River into a natural basin where an
earthen dam forms a reservoir and two outlet canals provide irrigation water to users in
Wheatland, Golden Valley, and Musselshell counties. The project was begun in 1934 by the
federal government and completed in 1941 with the active involvement of the Montana State
Water Conservation Board and other state agencies. Balgord considered his work on the
project and statewide water policy to be his main legislative achievements before his death
in Billings, Montana on October 30, 1974.</p>

<p>Robert (Bob) and Genevieve (Gennie) DeWeese were pioneers in the modernist movement in the state of Montana. Primarily painters and printmakers, both artists influenced a generation of students through their teaching and involvement with the Montana arts community. Bob was Professor of Art at Montana State University from 1949 to 1977. Prior to that, he taught classes at Texas Tech University and Ohio State University. He earned his B.S. from Ohio State University and his M.F.A. from University of Iowa in 1948. In 1946 he married Gennie, who was a fellow art student at Ohio State. </p>
<p>They had five children together: Cathie, Jan, Gretchen, Tina and Josh. According to Tina, "Art was certainly their common ground, but family is what held them together." Both were also committed to "equal studio time"; Tina has observed that "Gennie was a feminist before the word was known."</p>
<p>Both Bob and Gennie exhibited extensively throughout the state and major retrospectives of their works were presented at the Montana State University School of Art (1979) and the Yellowstone Art Center (1991) for Bob, and at the Missoula Art Museum (1996) for Gennie. In 1995 Bob and Gennie received the Montana Governor's Award for the Arts. That same year, Gennie was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Montana State University in Bozeman. </p>

<p>The Morris State Bank was opened in Pony, Montana, in 1902, with a capital stock of
$50,000. The bank moved into a newly constructed building in early 1903. William W. Morris
was president of the Morris State Bank until his death in October 1904. Thomas Duncan served
initially as vice president and then succeeded to the presidency in 1905. Following his
death that same year, Mary B. Elling became president. Charles E. Morris served as a
director in 19O2 and became vice president in 1905. Cashiers for the bank included Philip H.
(Harry) Gohn and Fred G. Smith. Other officers included M. M. Duncan, a Virginia City
attorney, who served as a director, and Henry J. Schreiber who was a vice president
beginning in 1904. By June 1906, the Morris State Bank had achieved deposits in the amount
of $200,000 and was conducting business with banks in Montana and throughout the country. A
close business relationship existed with the Elling State Bank of Virginia City and the
Union Bank and Trust Company of Helena, whose president was George L. Ramsey. The Morris
State Bank closed and went into voluntary liquidation on February 1, 1926. At that time the
board of directors borrowed $96,000 from the Elling Estates Company so that all depositors
could be paid. The bank then came under the jurisdiction of a liquidating agent. The
officers and directors of the Morris State Bank were businessmen and active members of the
Pony community. Several mining operations and other businesses were connected to the bank
through these people. Henry Elling and William Morris were partners in Elling and Morris,
which bought the Boss Tweed-Clipper mines in 1880. In 1882, Morris bought the Strawberry,
Willow Creek and Ned mines. In 1883, Henry Elling erected a stone 20-stamp mill. In 1884
Morris bought half interest in the mill, which thereafter was known as the Elling-Morris
stone mill. Elling died in 1900, and the properties were sold outright in combination with
the Bell, Eclipse, Charity, and Summit, to a Boston syndicate and reorganized as the Indian
Mining Company. By 1901 the company made large-scale improvements, but relinquished its
ownership to the mine to W. W. Morris and Sons and Associates a few years later. Most mining
activity in the area ceased as the ore played out in the early twentieth century and the
town of Pony today is all but abandoned.</p>

<p>The Extension service originated with the agricultural societies founded in the early days of the American republic which provided educational opportunities for farmers and industrial workers. These agricultural societies were influential in the passage of legislation in 1862, permitting the establishment of Colleges of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in all states. In 1887, Agricultural Experiment Stations were authorized and the Cooperative Extension Service was established in 1914 by the Smith-Lever Act. In Montana, the first county agents predated this federal legislation, with Milburn L. Wilson assigned to Custer and Dawson Counties, and Carl H. Peterson assigned to Fergus County. Gallatin and Missoula counties were the next to receive agents, and the entire program expanded rapidly in 1917 when the State Defense Council demanded more coverage in response to the United States declaration of war on Germany. Eventually almost every county in Montana had at least one agent assigned, as well as a Home Demonstration Agent. Although primarily agriculturally related in its early years, the major function of the Extension Service evolved to provide informal adult and youth education directed to helping people solve the various problems which they encounter from day to day.</p>
<p> All agents filed annual reports of their activities, detailing any special programs or presentations they may have performed during the year for their constituents. Information occasionally includes crop statistics, livestock statistics, weather summaries, and organizational efforts. These reports were typed in multiple carbon copies, with one sent to the state administration offices, one to Washington, D.C., and one retained by the agent.</p>

<p> Montana State University (MSU) was founded in 1893 as the state's land-grant
college, and named the Agricultural College of the State of Montana. Later renamed
the Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, by the 1920s it was commonly

excellence in undergraduate and graduate education, the state assembly renamed the
institution Montana State University on 1 July 1965. Although the school was
consistently overseen by an appointed president since its founding, MSU's various
subdivisions have been renamed and reorganized numerous times. This is especially
true for the various colleges, which prvious to 1965 were referred to at different
times as "schools" or "divisions." These various academic subunits were sometimes
headed by a person designated as either a director or a dean. The date of
establishment for each of the colleges that presently comprise MSU, partially based
on their designation of the academic unit's head as a "dean," are: College of
Agriculture, 1915; College of Arts and Architecture, 1976, College of Business,

<p>Salmon poisoning is caused by the microorganism Rickettsia that lives within members of the Salmonid family. Most cases of Salmon poisoning occur when canids eat dead fish or their remains from riverbanks that are prevalent during spawning. Salmon poisoning is mostly found along the western slope of the Cascade mountains. After canids ingest the poisoned fish, they become ill within seven to twelve days. Before extensive research into the cause, an infected canid had a ninety percent chance of the disease becoming fatal. In the early 1920s, Dr. Bennett T. Simms, a professor of veterinary medicine at the Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University) in Corvallis, began collecting research data on salmon poisoning. His work was continued by Dr. J. N. Shaw, also of OSU, in the 1940s. Dr. Knapp collected the research notes of Simms and Shaw during the course of his own work on the topic.</p>

The Alpha Psi Omega Society and the Sock and Buskin Club produced multiple plays annually in the first decade of the twentieth century. Eventually, professional development in terms of courses offered, minors, and finally a major being offered at MSC/MSU occured. Theater courses first appeared in the 1958-60 catalog, and theater first appeared as a separate minor (teaching) under the Department of Education in the 1962-1964 catalog. From 1962-1971 it appeared In the College of Letters and Sciences English Department as a Major Option. (Speech and Theatre Arts). In 1972 it became a separate department in L and S with 3 options and continues as a teaching minor in the Department of Education. In 1984 theater switched over to the College of Arts and Architecture with an addition of a "non" teaching minor being offered as well. A separate Media and Theatre Arts Department emerged in 1988 under the MTA option and listed a Motion Picture/Video/Theatre option for a major. By 2005 the teaching minor had ceased and in 2010 the word "theatre" is dropped from the option title and the department becomes the School of Film and Photography. At present courses are still offered as electives, but there are no options or minors still in existence. In the years when the college lacked a formal degree program in the dramatic arts, the students generally worked with a faculty advisor to facilitate the presentations. Alumni of note who were part of the MSU theater program over the years include Chet Huntley, Bill Pullman and Anthony Zerby. The location of the productions varied over time. Students generally put on about three to five plays per year, and a proper theatre and production facility was built in the Strand Union around 1957. In 2005 all production moved to the new state-of-the-art Black Box Theatre on the western side of the campus. Production evolved from simple box sets through advanced staging and lighting and to compact, durable traveling productions that tour for months at a time such as the Shakespeare in the Parks program.</p>

Her siblings were named Ben, Dan, Elmer, Adine, Inga, and Palmer. After growing up on Puget Island, she decided to attend Heald College in San Francisco in 1940. Following the United States entrance into World War II and the creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in 1943, Harriet left Heald and joined the Women's Reserve. While serving in the Reserve, she met Jack Hayne, who was serving in the Navy as an officer.</p>
<p> Jack Hayne, born in Great Falls, Montana on November 22, 1920, was one of two children of George Roy and Effie McVicar Hayne. His father Roy served in World War I and was a homesteader in Teton County. Jack's sister was named Margaret Sue. When the U.S. entered World War II, Jack enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served for the duration of the conflict. On April 3, 1946, he married Harriet in New Orleans. The couple moved to Seattle to attend Washington State University. Completing their studies, the Haynes then moved to Dupuyer, Montana where they established a farm and permanent residence. Harriett got involved with Montana politics and community affairs, becoming a state representative for the Republican Party and accumulating almost twenty years of political experience. Jack took an interest in the history of the West and Montana. His studying and research of Montana history would lead to his appointment to the Montana Historical Society board of trustees.

<p>The Three Forks, Montana community hosted several Lewis and Clark expedition observances
and outdoor pageants in their town and at the nearby Missouri Headwaters State Park during
the 1940s and 1950s. As early as 1945 the town sponsored a rodeo, street dance and barbeque.
Planning for the first outdoor dramatic pageant had its origin in the founding of the Three
Forks chapter of the American Pioneer Trails Association in 1947 with Ray Bacon as
president. The organization continued to assist with the summertime parades and rodeos, but
in 1950, with the assistance of Professor Bert B. Hansen of Montana State University in
Missoula (now known as the University of Montana) a pageant was staged to commemorate the
journey of Lewis and Clark for the first time. Hansen continued his involvement with the
pageant until 1957, writing scripts and directing the cast of actors, animals, and musicians
for each summer's show. The performances took place each summer, with the exception of 1954,
and the scripts used were variously titled "Corridor to an Empire," "Two Captains West,"
"Louisiana Purchase Explored," "Outward Bound," and "Homeward Bound."</p>

<p>On 2 February 1865, the territorial legislature of Montana created Gallatin County with
Gallatin City as the designated county seat. The first county commissioner organized the
county government and established the judicial offices on 11 March 1865. In the same year J.
S. Mendenhall was elected the first sheriff and John Bozeman was elected probate judge. Over
the next four decades the county rapidly grew. In 1869, construction started on the first
county jail, but by 1881 it was already inadequate for the growing community. By 1910, the
population of Gallatin County more than doubled. The sheriff's office was responsible for
keeping law and order in the growing area as well as other various duties such as cattle
inspections and registering firearms. In the first half of the 1900s, Gallatin County
elected eleven sheriffs: Thomas J. Fowler (1901-1905); Ed Reynolds (1906-1909); A. H. Sales

<p>The roots of the Agricultural Economics Department at Montana State University reach back to the Farm Management program in 1913. Classes in the beginning stages were instructed by E. L. Currier, whose main priority was teaching basic accounting principles to working farmers after these practices were found to be deficient. With the passage of the Purnell Act in 1925, the college was granted much needed funds to begin a curriculum focusing on the agricultural economics field. Director Linfield dismantled the Farm Management Department and put this new field under the wing of the Experiment Station. Although M. L. Wilson was named its first head, actual leadership came from former M. S. C. president James Hamilton while Wilson finished up his graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. Once Mr. Wilson took charge of the department in 1925, he was not an instructor but a researcher with the Experiment Station. His projects in collaboration with E. A. Starch deal with transforming dry farming and making agriculture more profitable. Aside from his work on the "Fairway Farms project," Wilson also did a great deal of research to publish <emph render="italic">Dry Farming in the North Central Montana Triangle, Extension Service Bulletin 66</emph> (Bozeman, Montana State College: June 1923). The study centered on an area roughly encompassed by Havre, Great Falls, and Cut Bank, Montana, and discussed the reasons for the success and failure of the region's farmers. Many of the Agricultural Economics faculty and staff assisted in gathering the data used for this report, and when Wilson left the University to take a post within the Roosevelt administration and E. A. Starch took over as Head of the Department in 1933, research projects on all aspects of Montana agriculture continued, not necessarily restricted to the "triangle" area.</p>

<p>Sylvester Nemes was born on April 2, 1922 in Erie, Pennsylvania. His parents, Dominic Nemes and Pauline Angel, were Romanian. He grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was introduced to fly tying by a friend and mentor, and traveled frequently to Pennsylvania with his homemade flies to fish the rivers and streams there. Nemes enlisted in the Army at age 19 as the U.S. was entering World War II. He was stationed at the Ibsley Air Field in Hampshire, England as a member of the Fighter Control Squadron with the Eighth Air Force. While stationed, he was set up on a blind date with Hazel Mary Barclay, an English nursing student. Nemes landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day, staying there for nine months as part of a team directing fighter aircraft. When he returned to England, he married Hazel on March 17, 1945 in Southampton, Hampshire. After the war, Hazel and Sylvester's first child, Diana, was born in England. The family moved to the U.S. where their second and third children, Eric and Gregory, were born. While the couple raised their family, Nemes earned a bachelor's degree in English from Kent State University. He went on to work as a copy writer and a photographer in Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago. Nemes, Hazel, and their children moved to Crown Point, Indiana in 1961, where Nemes worked as a photojournalist and continued to cultivate his love of fly fishing.</p>
<p> Nemes published his first book in 1975 through Chatham Press. <title render="italic">The Soft-Hackled Fly</title> championed wet fly fishing and the beauty and utility of flies tied with bird feathers in an era when dry fly fishing was the dominant trend. In the book he details the history of the soft-hackled fly and gives instruction on tying them and using them in fishing. Nemes went on to become a prolific author on the subject of fly fishing, writing <title render="italic">Learn How to Fly Fish in One Day</title> (1986), <title render="italic">Soft-Hackled Imitations</title> (1991), <title render="italic">The Soft-Hackled Fly: A Trout Fisherman's Guide</title> (1993), <title render="italic">The Soft-Hackled Fly Addict</title> (1993), <title render="italic">Spinners</title> (1995), <title render="italic">Six Months in Scotland: an American View of its Salmon Fishing</title> (1998), <title render="italic">Two Centuries of Soft-Hackled Flies: a Survey of the Literature With Original Patterns, 1747-Present</title> (2004), and <title render="italic">The Soft-Hackled Fly and Tiny Soft Hackles: a Trout Fisherman's Guide</title> (2006). He wrote two unpublished novels: "Goodbye, Crown Point," about John Dillinger, the Depression-era bank robber, and an unnamed manuscript about World War II-era P38 fighter aircraft pilots. Hazel and Sylvester moved to San Francisco in the early eighties before settling in Bozeman, Montana, at the base of the Bridger Mountains, in 1984. Nemes continued to fish, create his own fly patterns, and write books. He had admirers as far-flung as Japan, where fans of his started a fly fishing club devoted to the use of the soft hackle, and a Nemes-branded fly fishing rod was produced and sold. He was honored by Trout Unlimited in Bozeman in 2008 with their Legends of the Headwaters award. Nemes died at home on February 3, 2011 outside of Bozeman.</p>

<p>Photographer F. Jay Haynes (1853-1921) was one of the 19th century Northwest's best-known individuals. Beginning with a studio business in Moorhead, Minnesota, on the Minnesota-Dakota Territory border, Haynes became well known for his photographs of the great bonanza farms of the 1870s; for his portraits of Indians; his views of the Northern Pacific Rail Road route; and most especially for his successful career as photographer and concessionaire in Yellowstone National Park. Haynes toured the park with his camera every year between 1881 and his death forty years later. First selling photoprints, then pictorial souvenirs, and eventually postcards, Haynes' images were probably the most widely distributed and popularly recognized of any photographer of the American West. Between 1885 and 1905 Haynes also operated a travelling photo studio in a converted Pullman railroad car. This mobility not only made Haynes Palace Studio Car one of the best known features of the Northern Pacific, but also gave him camera access to sights from the Great Lakes to Puget Sound.</p>
<p> Haynes' base of operations began in Moorhead, Minnesota, was moved to Fargo, North Dakota, in 1879 and in 1889 to Saint Paul, Minnesota There he maintained a central studio and photo printing operation, and operated winter offices for his Studio Car and Yellowstone Park photography and transportation concessions, the Monida and Yellowstone and later Yellowstone-Western Stage companies. The Studio Car ceased travelling after the 1904 season and Haynes severed his ties to the Northern Pacific to court ties to the Union Pacific, a working relationship that fed the growing stage line he loved. When the Secretary of the Interior cancelled the MY concession lease in September, 1913, as a result of a suit, Haynes regrouped and was able to have a new lease renegotiated by the end of the year. It was in force until the consolidation of Park concessions in 1916, the year that Haynes retired and sold his business to his son Jack Ellis Haynes. Yellowstone's "Grand Old Man" still made annual trips to the Park until heart failure claimed him in 1921.</p>

Assistant Professor and was Acting Head of the Department during 1923-1924. During her time
there, she directed a pageant of the Gallatin Valley in 1919 and in 1927, the production
"The Masque of the Absaroka" depicting the Crow Indian cosmogony that involved Native
Americans, students and townspeople. Interested in furthering programs for women students,
she helped found Cap and Gown (the precursor to Mortar Board), the Women's Athletic
Association and most notably the Spurs, for which she wrote the initiation ritual. She
resigned from the college in 1929 and earned her MA in Anthropology from the University of
California in 1930. In 1931, she married James Willard Schultz, noted for his books about
the Blackfeet Indians, with whom she co-authored the book "The Sun God's Children" (a story
of the Blackfeet) and started a career as a worker at the Blackfeet Indian Reservation at
Browning, Montana. There she became the Community Worker under the WPA from 1937 to 1941.
She helped to establish a craft shop at St. Mary, Montana for Blackfeet that featured their
native costumes, equipment and tools. These craft industries eventually became a cooperative
that substantially raised the income of the Blackfeet. She fostered the careers of
individual Indian artists and was instrumental in the establishment of the Plains Indian
Museum in Browning. She started a lending library and did social welfare work among the
members of the tribe. From 1941 to 1953, she served the same type of position with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming for the Shoshone and
Arapaho tribes. The cooperative movement she started was embraced by many Northern Plains
Indians and still functions across many reservations of the west. Following the death of
James Willard Schultz in 1947 and Jessie's retirement in 1953, she married Harry L. Graham
and moved to California where she continued to work on fictional and factual writings about
Native Americans of North America. Her published works appeared in <title render="italic">Ladies Home Journal</title>, <title render="italic">Woman's Home Companion</title>,
<title render="italic">Popular Mechanics</title>, <title render="italic">Montana the

Kainah (Blood) and Peigan] of Montana and Canada during the summer months. In 1961, she was
the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Montana State University. In the late

graduated from Harvard in 1901. He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, graduating from that institution in 1904. Keyes began practice as an
architect in New York with Herbert D. Hale in 1905 before returning to Boston in
1907 where he worked with Guy Lowell. Keyes established his own firm shortly
thereafter. He worked on a number of projects in the Boston area, the best known
being the present day "New England Fish Pier," designed in 1914. Keyes married in
June 15, 1905 to Marian Brewer Call, and the couple had two children, Elisabeth
Brewer, born on January 7, 1908, and Juliet Frances, born February 21, 1913. The
family made their home on Penniman Road in Brookline, Massachusetts at least until
1930. Henry Keyes died in 1933.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1899, Henry Keyes and twelve other Harvard students went on an
expedition sponsored by the Harvard Summer School of Geology and led by instructor
Jay Backus Woodworth in cooperation with Professor Nathaniel Shaler. Other students
were Samuel W. Duncan, Corey C. Brayton, Burt Z. Kasson, Roger Flint, Robert W.
Sayles, Carl C. Shippee, Edwin M. Brush, George A. Hathaway, Albert P. Chittenden,
Marcus L. Goldman, Howard Lane Blackwell, and Samuel C. Wiel. Keyes traveled by
train to Buffalo, New York on July 4, and from that point took a steamship <emph render="italic">North Land</emph> through lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior before
landing at Duluth, Minnesota on July 7. The next day they took the train to Bozeman,
Montana where they arrived on July 11. On July 13 they left to begin their hike at
the Peter LeBeau ranch near present day Gallatin Gateway. There contractors Jack
Bean and Edward C. Alderson loaded mules with supplies for their journey into
southwest Montana. The Harvard men hiked for the entire trip which took a circuitous
route to the park through the Gallatin Canyon, Lone Peak, Jack Creek, Ennis,
Virginia City, the Red Rock lakes, Henry's Lake, and entering Yellowstone on August
2. They went up the Madison River to the geyser basins where, on August 5, Henry
Keyes scalded his foot after breaking through the thin crust above a hot spring.
Keyes and Shippee followed the hikers by stagecoach to the Canyon Hotel, but were
forced to leave the expedition on August 13 due to Henry's injury.</p>

<p>Nancy Colberg, a librarian, author of <title render="italic">Wallace Stegner: A Descriptive Bibliography</title> (Confluence Press Inc., 1990) and retired owner of Willow Creek Books, a used and rare book store in Denver, Colorado, collected one of the country's largest collections of publications written by and about Wallace Stegner - writer of fiction, history and essays on the U.S. west including: history, literature, public policy and conservation. In 1982, Colberg met Stegner and, as she collected works by him, she realized a need for an in-depth descriptive bibliography. When Stegner learned of her project, he granted her access to his books and papers and gave her a corner desk in his study when she visited at his California home. He also wrote letters of introduction for her to libraries and other sources of materials for her research. Colberg eventually gathered 54 original letters and postcards from Stegner written to her, photocopies of 370 Stegner letters written to others, and about 600 books, journals and article offprints created by or written about Stegner. All of Colberg's collected monographs have been individually cataloged and are available in Special Collections. The journals, articles, correspondence and other miscellaneous materials by and about Wallace Stegner are included in this collection. A second and smaller private collection of monographs and journal articles belonging to the late Thomas H. Watkins, who intended on writing a biography of Stegner, has been incorporated into this collection.</p>

<p>The Greater Yellowstone Coalition (GYC) was founded in May 1983 by a group of 35 conservation organizations in response to a number of increasing threats to the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem in the western United States an area which spans 20 million acres and extends into three states (Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana) as well as two national parks (Yellowstone and Grand Teton). The stability and health of this ecosystem was actively endangered by mining, drilling, geothermal development, logging, roads, subdivisions, and human overuse. The group felt that the area lacked a state/federal administrative structure that could properly respond to these threats, and sought to create an environmental advocacy group which could manage multi-state coordination efforts. </p>
<p> The area that the coalition focuses on encompasses two national parks and surrounding protected lands. Established in 1872, Yellowstone National Park was the country's first national park, set out over 3,500-sq area covering parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Prior to the formal establishment, humans had been living and traveling in the area for over 11,000 years. First, a variety of Native American tribes lived in and traveled through the park, and then in the early 1800s European Americans began to explore it. The area also includes the Grand Teton National park, which is located in Wyoming. First founded in 1929, the original park included a smaller area than today, just the Teton Range and surrounding lakes. Over the years, more land was set aside for the park, by Congress and a section purchased by John D. Rockefeller with the intention to donate. In 1950, the park in its current state of 480 sq miles was established with the combination of the original land, the Jackson Hole National Monument and the Rockefeller donation. </p>
<p> GYC's founding mission, established at the group's 1983 founding convention at the Teton Science School in Jackson, Wyoming, embraced protection of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem in its natural condition. Convention attendees elected a thirteen-member steering committee, made up of members from Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, comprising the first GYC Board of Directors. They adopted three primary goals: fostering citizen action through outreach efforts, developing both regional and national awareness around the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, and promotion of the scientific concept of the ecosystem itself. </p>
<p> Robert L. Anderson was appointed GYC's first Executive Director in 1984, and the group debuted at the 1984 annual meeting, held at Yellowstone National Park's Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. By then, the organization's primary office had been established in Bozeman, Montana, and infrastructure efforts began to transition into coalition-building and garnering member support. Both 1984 and 1985 saw the group's environmental advocacy efforts crystallize and gain traction, particularly around protection of the Yellowstone grizzly bear population, the reintroduction of wolves into the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, advocacy for expanded wilderness designations, site-specific issues and protection, and support for state-level and Congressional wilderness bills. </p>
<p> In the nearly four decades that GYC has been in operation, it has served as the focal point for education, advocacy, and outreach around the preservation of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem. One of the group's first projects centered on the development of the New World Mining District in the Gallatin National Forest, Park County, Montana. GYC was a leader in the fight to ensure that the northeast corner of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem was kept from becoming a gold mine. In 2007, GYC was part of a group that sued to block the de-listing of grizzly bears from the U.S. list of endangered species. The group has been instrumental in the protection and preservation of several rivers in the ecosystem, including portions of the East Rosebud River, the Snake River, and the Yellowstone River. It has successfully pushed for legislation preventing mining and development in public lands and driven efforts to protect bison, wolves, native fish, and grizzly bears residing in the ecosystem. </p>
<p> The organization holds an annual convention each year, drawing academics, legislators, students, and advocates for several days of scientific education, recreational outings, brainstorming sessions, and policy-setting. </p>
<p> Notable Events:</p>

<p>The Willson and Rich firm of Bozeman, Montana Territory was a merchandising operation
founded in 1866 by Loren W. Tuller and Charles V. Rich, both of New York. Encouraged by
their friend, Lester S. Willson, Tuller and Rich pooled their resources to organize an
expedition to Montana and establish a store. In company with Lester's brother, Davis, the
partners left Canton, New York in May of 1866. After a stop in Omaha, Nebraska to purchase
stock, the party crossed the plains and reached the new town of Bozeman on September 2,
1866. At first they sold goods out of a tent but by November of that year they rented space
in a two-story log cabin owned by the local Masonic order. They continued in business at
that location until Lester Willson arrived in the spring of 1867. He became the senior
partner in the firm and, on the departure of Loren Tuller in the fall of 1867, the senior
partner, changing the name to "Willson and Rich." The firm built a new store in 1868 and
Lester Willson eventually incorporated the business in 1893 and sold it in 1914.</p>
