            <p>Henry Francis Keyes was born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts on July 21, 1879 to
                Charles Gilman and Juliet A. Keyes. He attended the Roxbury Latin school and
                graduated from Harvard in 1901. He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology, graduating from that institution in 1904. Keyes began practice as an
                architect in New York with Herbert D. Hale in 1905 before returning to Boston in
                1907 where he worked with Guy Lowell. Keyes established his own firm shortly
                thereafter. He worked on a number of projects in the Boston area, the best known
                being the present day "New England Fish Pier," designed in 1914. Keyes married in
                June 15, 1905 to Marian Brewer Call, and the couple had two children, Elisabeth
                Brewer, born on January 7, 1908, and Juliet Frances, born February 21, 1913. The
                family made their home on Penniman Road in Brookline, Massachusetts at least until
                1930. Henry Keyes died in 1933.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1899, Henry Keyes and twelve other Harvard students went on an
                expedition sponsored by the Harvard Summer School of Geology and led by instructor
                Jay Backus Woodworth in cooperation with Professor Nathaniel Shaler. Other students
                were Samuel W. Duncan, Corey C. Brayton, Burt Z. Kasson, Roger Flint, Robert W.
                Sayles, Carl C. Shippee, Edwin M. Brush, George A. Hathaway, Albert P. Chittenden,
                Marcus L. Goldman, Howard Lane Blackwell, and Samuel C. Wiel. Keyes traveled by
                train to Buffalo, New York on July 4, and from that point took a steamship <emph render="italic">North Land</emph> through lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior before
                landing at Duluth, Minnesota on July 7. The next day they took the train to Bozeman,
                Montana where they arrived on July 11. On July 13 they left to begin their hike at
                the Peter LeBeau ranch near present day Gallatin Gateway. There contractors Jack
                Bean and Edward C. Alderson loaded mules with supplies for their journey into
                southwest Montana. The Harvard men hiked for the entire trip which took a circuitous
                route to the park through the Gallatin Canyon, Lone Peak, Jack Creek, Ennis,
                Virginia City, the Red Rock lakes, Henry's Lake, and entering Yellowstone on August
                2. They went up the Madison River to the geyser basins where, on August 5, Henry
                Keyes scalded his foot after breaking through the thin crust above a hot spring.
                Keyes and Shippee followed the hikers by stagecoach to the Canyon Hotel, but were
                forced to leave the expedition on August 13 due to Henry's injury.</p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
            <p>The Keyes photograph album contains snapshots taken by Keyes and perhaps a few of his
                friends during their hike through southwest Montana. The album contains images of
                the steamship <emph render="italic">North Land</emph>, Mackinac Island, the North
                Dakota Badlands, Bozeman, Bridger Canyon, Gallatin Canyon, Lone Peak, Virginia City,
                the Red Rock valley, Sawtell's Ranch at Henry's Lake, Upper Geyser Basin, and Lake
                Yellowstone. People pictured are Keyes and his companions, Edward C. Alderson, Jack
                Bean, and Felix G. White. Two photographs of Yellowstone bears are also included.
                Many of the photographs are captioned.</p>
            <p>The diary contains entries created by Keyes simultaneously with the photographs he
                took in the album, starting on July 3, 1899 when he and the student party left on
                the train to Buffalo and ends with his entry of August 19, 1899. His notations are
                incredibly detailed, noting the scenery, the content of his meals, and even the time
                of day when certain described events occurred. Many of his fellow students are
                mentioned, and geographic details and wildlife sightings recorded. Particularly
                poignant are his entries from August 5, when he had his accident, through the end as
                he bravely faces the fact he will be unable to complete the journey with his fellow
                expedition members. In addition to the detailed diary entries, Keyes kept a table of
                distances covered by the expedition on each day, given in miles covered and with
                notations identifying camping spots. He also devotes several separate pages to trip
                expenses, various contact addresses, and even a few hand-drawn sketches of wildlife
                and camping sites.</p>
