    <bioghist encodinganalog="5450_">
      <p>Prior to the establishment of the Montana State University Library's Special Collections, history professor Merrill G. Burlingame began collecting oral history interviews of Montana pioneers still living in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His work continued through his student, David Swingle in 1964, and by librarian Minnie Paugh. The recordings were amateurish, often difficult to hear, and were not transcribed. After 1964 the recordings were, for the most part, given separate accession numbers and accessed infrequently through a card catalog system. Bringing all these disparate tapes together into one collection is an attempt to increase their research profile and better assist bibliographic control.</p>

He moved to Three Forks afterwards and established a dairy operation until his retirement in 1955. Batchelder died on December 20, 1975 in Bozeman. In a 1970 note to then Montana State University librarian Minnie Paugh, Merrill G. Burlingame stated that Ed Willson had also worked on the Daly ranch and reminisced with Batchelder on the tape. "Their recall was not good, we did not have the right questions, and the interview does not have much that is worthwhile, and they talked in a very low tone."</p>

Malcolm attended local schools before enrolling in the Culver Military Academy and the Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He married Rose Ashby on Sept. 18, 1924, in Madisonville, Ky. After their marriage, they moved to Los Angeles where they lived for several years. He moved back to Montana in 1933.

          <p>William, James, John and Alex Glass formed a real estate operation 1904. In 1908 they reorganized with Frank Lindsay to form the Glass-Lindsay Land Company and contracted with the state Carey Land Act Board to build several reservoirs and irrigation canals as part of the Big Timber project. In addition to two reservoirs, the company built thirty-five miles of canals to transport water to irrigate sugar beets and fruit. The project was completed about 1915. Among the settlers who came to the area to establish farms were members of the Church of the Brethren. This tape created by librarian Minnie Paugh features twenty-five residents of the Big Timber area who met to share their memories of the Glass-Lindsay development.
