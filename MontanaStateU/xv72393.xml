            <p>William Fisk Brewer was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on August 26, 1870. He
                grew up in Iowa and graduated from Grinnell College in 1891. He taught in Oregon and
                Illinois before he joined the faculty of the Montana College of Agriculture and
                Mechanic Arts (later Montana State College) in 1895 as a professor of Greek and
                Latin. During a leave of absence from the college in 1898 he earned a masterâ€™s
                degree from Harvard University. He eventually became the head of the college English
                department until his retirement in 1942. Brewer was active in the Montana Education
                Association during his time in Montana, serving as a delegate to several meetings of
                the organization. He was also an advocate for the blind and helped organize the
                annual summer program for blind at Montana State College. Brewer and his wife Mabel
                moved to Lodi, California after his retirement and he died there on June 14,
                1963.</p>
