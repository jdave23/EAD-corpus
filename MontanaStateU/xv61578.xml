            <p>Millard E. Peterson was born Aug. 20, 1897, in Twin Valley, Minnesota to Louis and
                Valmina Peterson. In 1912 the family moved to Culberson, Montana. Peterson attended
                Intermountain College in Helena before transferring to Montana State College in
                Bozeman where he graduated in 1923 with a degree in science. He later earned a
                master's degree in science in 1939 from the University of Montana. From 1923-1927,
                Peterson taught at Darby High School until moving to Missoula, where he taught at
                Missoula County High School. He married in 1938 to Jean Morgan Mair and retired from
                teaching in 1961. While attending Montana State College, Peterson was a member of
                Beta Epsilon, a locally established fraternity that became inactive around 1934. He
                was also a member of the Sigma Xi Science Honorary fraternity, a life member of the
                Montana Education Association, and former president of the Missoula Retired Teachers
                Association. He was a sponsor of the MCHS National Honor Society for 10 years. Mr.
                Peterson was a ranger naturalist in Glacier Park for three summers and a resident
                naturalist at Hyalite summer camp for the Montana School for the Deaf. Peterson died
                on February 12, 1989.</p>

            <p>The Millard Peterson Scrapbook contains memorabilia, photographs, pamphlets and other
                documents collected by Peterson while a student at Montana State College from 1919
                to 1923. Peterson was an enthusiastic member of the Beta Epsilon fraternity and many
                of the documents included in the scrapbook pertain to the fraternity's activities.
                Photographs include those of Peterson and his friends, along with views of the Beta
                Epsilon fraternity house at 501 South Grand Avenue. Dance cards and playbills for
                events and performances held on campus and in the Bozeman community are also
                included. The scrapbook contains several issues of the Beta Epsilon fraternity
                quarterly newsletter, 1921-1922 and documentation for the fraternity's unsuccessful
                attempt to affiliate with the national Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.</p>
