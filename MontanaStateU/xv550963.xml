            <p>Laura Jane Osborne was born on March 20, 1911 in Toston, Montana. She married Alfred
                W. Taft in 1933. Laura served as the superintendent of public schools in Glacier
                County, Montana and the couple lived in Cut Bank. Laura and her husband were
                particularly interested in Siksika culture and attended many of the performances of
                tribal “fancy dancers,” including the Starr School group which was active during the
                1950s. Laura Jane died on March 4, 1993 and her husband Alfred died in 1994.</p>
            <p>Fancy dance or Pan-Indian dancing is a style of dance some believe was originally
                created by members of the Ponca tribe in the 1920s and 1930s in an attempt to
                preserve their culture and religion. Fancy dance was considered appropriate to be
                performed for visitors in exhibitions, but today, fancy dancers can be seen at many
                powwows across the nation and even the world. They are performed by many different
                tribal groups including the Siksika.</p>
