            <p>John Stands In Timber was a member of the Cheyenne Indian tribe, born in Birney,
                Montana in 1882. Among his ancestors was Lame White Man, a Southern Cheyenne chief
                who was killed at the Little Bighorn in 1876. John received his education at the
                Haskell Institute, an industrial training school for Indians in Lawrence, Kansas. He
                returned to Montana where he first worked as a maintenance man at a school in Busby
                and a cowboy. He became active in tribal governance at the Northern Cheyenne
                reservation and eventually became a historian of the tribe. In 1955 he met Margot
                Liberty, a schoolteacher who was also pursing graduate work in anthropology. She
                began interviewing Stands In Timber in 1956, continuing until 1959, covering mostly
                topics dealing with tribal history. The tapes Liberty used to record the interviews
                were erased after she had transcribed them and only a few survived. In 1967, the
                same year Stands In Timber died, Liberty published an edited version of selected
                interview transcriptions, <title render="italic">Cheyenne Memories</title> (New
                Haven: Yale University Press). In 2013, Liberty published a compilation of all her
                interviews with Stands In Timber titled <title render="italic">A Cheyenne
                    Voice</title> (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press).</p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
            <p>The John Stands in Timber interview was conducted by Margo Liberty, Merrill G.
                Burlingame, Virginia S. Burlingame, Verne Dusenbery, and Betsy Miles at the Liberty
                home near Birney, Montana in October 1959. Most of the conversation on the audio
                recording reel concerns the ages and actions of various Cheyenne men who had either
                participated in the Custer battle or other incidents of tribal history. A
                handwritten summary of the conversation prepared by Merrill G. Burlingame is also
                included, although it is not an exact transcription. There is no paragraph
                separation between the questions and answers on the summary. The text roughly
                follows the same information found on pages 326-327 of <title render="italic">A
                    Cheyenne Voice</title>, but there are several omissions and additions to the
                wording. A brief recording of Liberty speaking to an unknown group regarding the
                Missouri Headwaters area precedes the interview with Stands in Timber.</p>
