      <abstract encodinganalog="5203_">The Lucy Young Ford Letter was written by Mrs. Ford to her
        husband to report to him on her activities as a schoolteacher at the Blackfeet Agency. The
        letter mentions many of the couple's friends back east in the context of asking about their
        health and activities. Other descriptions include regarding the students in her school, a
        description of the funeral of an Indian child who was buried in the ground contrary to the
        tribe's traditional method, and the social and leisure activities of the Anglo members of
        the agency staff like amateur theatricals and playing croquet.</abstract>

      <p>John Young was assigned to the Blackfeet Indian Agency in 1876 and served through 1883 when
        a famine killed a number of the Indian residents. His administration was controversial, with
        accusations surfacing that he had misappropriated funds earmarked for the Indians and gave
        choice employment positions to relatives. One relative in particular was his daughter, Lucy
        ("Dotie") Young Ford, who joined her father during the summer of 1877 as a schoolteacher.
        She was the wife of Edward Lloyd Ford, a publisher, born in Oswestry, Shropshire, England.
        Ford had come to New York in his early youth and was a Civil War veteran, having served in
        the Union Army. In 1867 he became a partner in the newly established publishing house of J.
        B. Ford and Co., whose major periodical publication was the <title render="italic">Christian
          Union</title>. He invented and patented folding combinations, folding and pasting
        apparatus, and devices for printing two sheets simultaneously, and for folding and pasting
        one within the other.</p>

      <p>The Ford letter, signed only as "Dotie," was written by Mrs. Ford to her husband to report
        to him on her activities as a schoolteacher at the Blackfeet Agency. The letter mentions
        many of the couple's friends back east in the context of asking about their health and
        activities. Mrs. Ford's description of the Blackfeet Agency includes information regarding
        the students in her school, and mentions several adult Blackfeet, specifically "Fancy Jim"
        and "White Calf." Particularly interesting is her description of the funeral of an Indian
        child who was buried in the ground, contrary to the tribe's traditional method of using
        scaffolds. She also describes the social and leisure activities of the Anglo members of the
        agency staff like amateur theatricals and playing croquet. Mrs. Ford also mentions "Mr.
        Warner" and "Mr. Welch" as agency employees. A stamped, addressed envelope is included with
        the letter.</p>
