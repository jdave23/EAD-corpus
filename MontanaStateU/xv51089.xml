      <p>The Columbus Creamery Company was registered with the state of Montana for incorporation on
        April 6, 1906 by several prominent citizens of the community. Among the founders were J.B.
        (Joseph Burt) Annin and George H. Simpson. Annin, a Methodist minister born on October 26,
        1865 in Leroy, New York, moved to Columbus in 1892 where he operated a mercantile business
        and was elected to the Montana State Senate in 1914. He died on June 22, 1918. Simpson, a
        Canadian born on March 15, 1856, moved to Columbus in 1893 and served as the secretary for
        the Columbus Creamery Company. He was also an attorney, justice of the peace, and for a
        time, Deputy Assessor of Yellowstone County. He died May 25, 1927. The Columbus Creamery
        Company ceased operations sometime prior to April 6, 1926 when the corporation was
        officially designated as inactive by the Montana Secretary of State office.</p>
