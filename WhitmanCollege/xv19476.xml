Bonnie Jean parented 22 young women through their teenage years, providing a home for the students who needed a place to live. The couple started this project during the Depression when many families had to split up because of financial problems. Since the Joneses didn't have children, the young women became their family and they helped them through Whitman College. They also adopted one of the girls, Ingrid Hylland from Norway. Bonnie Jean died in 1988.</p>
