<p>The Whitman College Employees Association (WCEA) was formed on January 25, 1978 by a nearly unanimous vote of forty seven college staff members. According to the WCEA constitution and bylaws, the purpose of the organization was to "promote the welfare of the employees of Whitman College and to secure a better means of communication with the administration of the College." The formation of WCEA began in 1977 when Whitman staff members Claire Norsworthy, Sandi Jensen, Sharon Kespohl, Sally Weakley, Donna Chiarelott, Mike Soper, and Carol Paynter, distributed a questionnaire to women staff members employed by the college. The questionnaire included questions about salary, job classification, opportunities for promotion, and workplace satisfaction. A majority of the responses indicated dissatisfaction with working conditions at Whitman, including unfair salary practices, no written set of regulations or policies, and informal job descriptions.
Over the next several years, the WCEA was able to negotiate a slight increase in staff salaries, the publication of a staff handbook which included information about fringe benefits and job categorization, and a formal grievance policy. The association also organized several additional salary surveys, worked to educate staff about their rights as employees, and continued to push for pay equity. According to the records, the WCEA appears to have no longer been active after 1987 due to low membership, but at its height more than fifty percent of staff were involved.</p>

The Brattain family had many Whitman College connections: Ross and Ottilie met at Whitman and Ross graduated from the college in 1901. Walter graduated from Whitman in 1924 with majors in Physics and Math under Professors Benjamin H. Brown (Physics) and Walter A. Bratton (Math). </p>
<p> There were three other physicists of note who graduated in Walter Brattain's class: Walker Bleakney, E.J. Workman, and Vladimir B. Rojansky, with whom he collaborated over the years. The four of them were known as Whitman's "Four Horsemen of Physics." While a Whitman student, Brattain was passionate about math, an excellent tennis player and member of the Kirkman Club, a fraternal group. </p>
<p> After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree from Whitman, Brattain was awarded a Masters of Arts by the University of Oregon in 1926 and a Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Minnesota in 1929. After completing his graduate studies, Brattain worked for the radio section of the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., from 1927 to 1928. In 1929 he joined the technical staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories and worked as a research physicist until his retirement in 1976. During World War II, he was associated for 22 months with the National Defense Research Committee at Columbia University, working on magnetic detection of submarines. Brattain was a visiting lecturer at Harvard University during the fall of 1952 and a visiting lecturer at Whitman College between 1962 and 1963, becoming a visiting professor between 1963 and 1972 and an adjunct professor from 1972 until 1976. He remained afterwards as a consultant at Whitman. </p>
<p> Brattain was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956, with Dr. John Bardeen and Dr. William B. Shockley, "for research on semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor effect." These three American physicists invented the transistor on December 23, 1947, at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company at Bell Laboratories. The transistor's name derives from the descriptive phrase "transfer of signal through varsitor." The transistor is a solid state device involved in connecting battery power to signal power. As a key element in amplifying small electrical signals and in processing of digital information, it is today an active component in all electronic systems. Brattain received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Portland University in 1952, from Whitman College and Union College in 1955, and from the University of Minnesota in 1957. In 1952 he was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute, and in 1954 the John Scott Medal. The degree at Union College and the two medals were received jointly with Dr. John Bardeen, in recognition of their work on the transistor. In 1974, he was named to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. </p>
<p> Brattain was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Franklin Institute, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also a member of the commission on semiconductors of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and of the Naval Research Advisory Committee. At Whitman, he was nominated to membership in Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. He also served as an Overseer for the college. </p>
<p> The chief field of Brattain's research was the surface properties of solids, as well as research directed at (1) thermionic emission and absorbed layers on tungsten, phospholipids bylayers or membranes rectification and (2) photo effects at semiconductor surfaces (ergo, cuprous oxide, silicon and germanium). Among his contributions are the discoveries of photo effect at the free surface of a semiconductor, the invention of the point-contact transistor jointly with Dr. John Bardeen, and shared research on piezoelectric frequency standards, magnetometers, blood clotting, and infrared detectors. </p>
<p> Walter Brattain married Dr. Keren Gilmore (chemist) in 1935 and had a son, William G. Brattain, in April, 1943. Keren died in April 1957. In May, 1958, he married Mrs. Emma Jane (Kirsch) Miller, a Whitman College alumna. He had three stepchildren and 10 grandchildren. Walter Brattain died on October 13, 1987, in Seattle, Washington, of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>The first Chinese to immigrate to Walla Walla arrived in 1872 and were manual laborers constructing the Dorsey S. Baker railroad which ran from Wallula to Walla Walla. The Chinese settlement in Walla Walla grew to upwards of five thousand Chinese living in what was referred to as "Chinatown" located on Second Avenue between Main Street and Alder Street. The population decreased significantly after the completion of the railroad. However, a strong Chinese community remained and many new Chinese moved into the valley from Canton, modern day Guangzhou, to become gardeners and farm laborers. An organized group of vegetable gardens and dwellings were located in what was known as the "bottomlands" on Dalles Military Road and the land was farmed by an estimated eighty Chinese. At this time, the center of activity for the Chinese shifted as a two story brick building was constructed at Fifth Avenue and Rose Street. This building was used as a community building for the local Chinese population and contained as many as seven stores including a grocery, department and traditional artwork stores. There were a total of eleven Chinese owned businesses in Walla Walla in the early 1900s and they included restaurants and grocery stores. It was also common for many Chinese to be cooks for local families.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck the Chinese community and the collection includes information about the Chinese massacre of 1887 on the Snake River in which an undetermined number of Chinese miners were killed, between ten and thirty-one, at the hands of seven white men from Wallowa County. Additionally, there are newspaper articles which describe a fire in a Chinese hotel during the New Year's festivities that took the lives of eleven Chinese people. Other information includes several accounts of murder and the report of the first hanging in the Walla Walla Valley: a Chinese man.</p>
<p>Chinese New Year, in Walla Walla, was a memorable event as reported in newspapers, written accounts, and tape recordings which highlight the traditional Chinese ceremonies and rituals for the New Year celebration.</p>
<p>The newspaper articles within this collection aid in providing a partial timeline with regard to the fluctuation of the Chinese population. The height of the population, at nearly five thousand, in the 1870s to 1880s, diminishes to an estimate of fifty in the 1950s.</p>

<p>The history of the Walla Walla Balloon Stampede and Ginger Kelly's ballooning career both began in September of 1972, when Chauncey Dun and his all female balloon crew flew for a demonstration at the Whitman College homecoming weekend at the request of alumni director, Jack Riehl. This event caught the attention of several Walla Walla Valley locals, including Nat Vale and Ginger Kelly of Prescott, Washington. The two began taking ballooning lessons and were certified as commercial balloon pilots in February 1974. They purchased their first balloon, Demeter, in March of that year, and flew her in the Expo '74 World's Fair in Spokane that May. The first Balloon Federation Association sanctioned balloon race in the Pacific Northwest occurred on the grounds of Walla Walla High School in May 1976. It was organized by Nat and Ginger, and their friend Bill Loyd. In 1977, Ginger placed 3rd in the first all female race during the First National Balloon Federation of America FA Balloon Races in Reno, Nevada. Ginger Kelly continued to be involved in ballooning events across the Pacific Northwest, and in 1994 she was named the Walla Walla Balloon Stampede volunteer of the year. In 1999 she served as the Honorary Balloonmeister for the Walla Walla Balloon Stampede, and in 2004 she was presented with a Balloon Federation of America award for outstanding service to the history of ballooning. The Walla Walla Balloon Stampede has continued to hold a valued position as an annual community and regional event, and in 1990 the site moved from Walla Walla High School to its current location at Howard Tietan Park.</p>

<p>A Whitman College Athletics Association formed in 1886, due in part to a desire of students to participate in baseball. The first football team was formed in 1892. Women's basketball was being played as early as 1897, and tennis was a popular early activity. The arrival in 1906 of Raymond Vincent Borleske was a seminal moment in the development of Whitman athletic programs. Borleske was considered the greatest football running back in the West during his playing days. Borleske graduated in 1910 and returned in 1915 to teach and coach, becoming the dominant figure in Whitman athletics until 1947.</p>

<p>Whitman College was one of the original members of the Pacific Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (PNIAC), which, at the time of its conception in 1910, contained schools such as the University of Washington, University of Oregon, and Washington State College, later Washington State University. In later years, most of the larger schools withdrew, leaving Whitman, College of Puget Sound, Linfield College, and Pacific University, all of which belong to the present-day Northwest Conference.
