         <p>Ava Kidwell was born on October 10, 1896 in Rising City, Nebraska as Ava Colwell. Her family moved to Silverton, Oregon in circa 1903, and then moved to Walla Walla, Washington, in 1905. Kidwell began to work for the city of Walla Walla on January 3, 1921, and filled numerous office duties for the next 40 years. She was a cashier-bookkeeper for the water department until she was appointed city clerk on June 26, 1923, making her the second woman clerk in Washington at the time. Kidwell resigned as city clerk when she married Harry Kidwell on May 4, 1927. Her husband died in 1938, but Kidwell worked as the accountant for the office of R. F. McClean, the Walla Walla water superintendent, until October 10, 1961. Kidwell also worked as a part-time bookkeeper for the Crescent Drug Company from September 1, 1921 to December 31, 1975, when the business closed. She was a member of the Pioneer United Methodist Church, and a member of United Methodist Women, Susannah Wesley Circle, and the Women's Auxiliary of the Walla Walla Rescue Mission. She died on May 3, 1987 at the age of 90.</p>
