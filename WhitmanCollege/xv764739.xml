      <bioghist encodinganalog="5450_">
    
         <p>Arthur Henderson Smith, born on July 18, 1845, was a missionary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. He spent 54 years as a missionary in China, and documented much of the culture he encountered in books for foreign readers. He served in the Civil War, graduated from Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin in 1867, and became ordained into the Congregational ministry. He and his wife moved to China in 1872, where they lived in Pangjiazhuang, Shandong. He died in 1932 at the age of 87.</p>

Though most of these materials were collected by Smith, items from other sources were added to the collection, probably by previous archives staff.</p>
