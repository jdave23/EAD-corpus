         <p>The Walla Walla Presidents' Council of Federated Women's Clubs was affiliated with the General Federation of Women's Clubs, a national organization founded in 1890. The Walla Walla Presidents' Council was formed in September 1929 to bring together the leaders of local women's clubs and was part of the Southeastern Washington District of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.</p>
         <p> The Walla Walla Presidents' Council united local women's groups in common purposes, such as fundraising and community service. Clubs represented from the inception of the council include the Park and Civics Club, Delphian Culture Club, Art Club, Reading Club, Shakespeare Club, Russell Creek Club, and the Educational Club. From 1929 to 1953, at least 15 clubs were represented in the Walla Walla Presidents' Council.</p>
         <p> During its monthly meetings, the Walla Walla Presidents' Council planned fundraising activities to benefit veterans and the war effort, and luncheons that brought together members of Walla Walla's various women's clubs. Club members also presented talks on social topics such as education and American citizenship and occasionally hosted officials from the Washington Council of Federated Women's Club. Walla Walla Presidents' Council work was divided among committees, including the Public Welfare, Endowment Fund, Foundation Fund, Press and Publicity, Motion Pictures, Music and Civic Art, and Junior Clubs Committees. Although the Walla Walla Presidents' Council continued at least until 1961, the 1953-1961 minute book was lost.</p>
