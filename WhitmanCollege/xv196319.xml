         <p>Starrett's Seed Company was Washington's pioneer seed company and was one of the preeminent businesses of Walla Walla in the late 1800s, with its influence reaching across the Palouse region as far north as Pullman and as far west as Yakima. Established in 1873 by George Starrett, who moved to Walla Walla on October 9, 1870, their first seed catalog was published in January, 1874. George Starrett passed the company to his son William George Starrett in 1897, and died on April 5, 1906. The business was passed to George Starrett's youngest daughter, Derotha in 1935, after William George's death on July 13, 1935. The last record of the Starrett Seed Company in the Walla Walla city directory is in 1958.</p>
