         <p>The First National Bank of Walla Walla was founded in 1878 by Levi Ankeny. Ankeny was born in St. Joseph, Missouri and migrated to Oregon at the age of six. He conducted business throughout the Pacific Northwest and ultimately settled in Walla Walla to pursue banking. Before the purchase and charter for National Bank status, the bank was known as the Reynolds Banking House. The Reynolds Banking House was formed by the partnership of Almos H. Reynolds and Dr. J.H. Day.</p>
