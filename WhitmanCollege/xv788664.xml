         <p>William Dement Church was born on June 3, 1873 in Oregon City, Oregon Territory. He moved to Walla Walla, Washington in 1890 to become an accountant for his uncle's grain mill. On November 23, 1898, he married Bertha Ballou, born April 18, 1874 in Santa Rosa, California, with whom he had six children. In approximately 1903, he was put in charge of mining operations at the Tom Thumb mine, as well as the grain mill's head secretary.  He died July 23, 1969, at the age of 96.</p>
