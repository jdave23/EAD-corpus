         <p>On December 20, 1859, Reverend Cushing Eells convinced the Washington Territorial Legislature to grant a charter to form the Whitman Seminary in honor of his fellow missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman. By 1866, construction of an initial two-story building was completed and the school opened in the city of Walla Walla. On November 28, 1883, the legislature issued a new charter, transforming the seminary into a four-year degree-granting private college.</p>
