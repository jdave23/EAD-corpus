         <p>Harper Joy was born in Missouri in 1894, was orphaned shortly after and was later adopted by Henry and Annie Joy. Joy grew up in Walla Walla and later attended Whitman College, where he graduated in 1922. Directly after his graduation, he began to work for Ferris and Hargrove and continued on with this company for 40 years, seeing it merge into Pacific Northwest Company, and later the National Fidder-Peabody Brokerage Firm. Not only was Joy well-known in the business world, but he also was fond of clowning. Harper Joy died in 1972  at the age of 74 and was survived by his wife, Dorothy Joy, and their four kids.</p>
