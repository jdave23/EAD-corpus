         <p>Charles Besserer was born October 10, 1838, near Heidelberg, Germany. At 17 years of age he enlisted in the English army. While a member of the army he was sent to Washington Territory. When his term of enlistment was over he decided to remain in Walla Walla, Washington and served with the Union Army in the Civil War. He briefly was engaged in the grocery business, but in 1875 turned his attention to newspaper publication. He purchased a paper called Spirit of the West, which was later renamed the Watchman. He continued in the publishing business in Walla Walla until 1898 when he moved to California. He died there in 1912.</p>
         <p>John McFeely was born near Dayton, Ohio, on March 3, 1868. He came to Walla Walla, Washington in 1891, where he found employment as a horseshoer. He eventually opened his own shop on the corner of 4th and Alder Street in Walla Walla. Later he built the three-story McFeely Hotel. He also owned eight hundred acres of wheat land near Prescott, Washington. He was married December 9, 1899, to Miss Martha Besserer, the daughter of Charles Besserer. He also served as Chief Engineer of the Walla Walla Fire Department. He died in 1938.</p>
