         <p>The Purdy Cornelison and  Anita Blucher Scrapbooks , which spans from approximately 1934 through 1938, consists of two scrapbooks belonging to two Whitman College students, one belonging to [Vernon] Purdy Cornelison and the other to Anita Blucher. The scrapbooks contain letters, and memorabilia from Sigma Chi and Delta Delta Delta, two greek organizations Blucher and Cornelison were a part of. The scrapbooks also contain programs from college concerts, plays, and commencements, newspaper clippings, photographs, telegrams, and other college ephemera. This collection gives insight into what Whitman College was like during this time period, and the organizations and social engagements students participated in.</p>
