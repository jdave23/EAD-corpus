   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Cornelia Marschall Smith was born 1895 October 15 on a ranch in Llano County, Texas, the youngest of four children of Lucy and Ernst Marschall. Cornelia attended public schools in Llano, finishing high school in three years. She then pursued a State Teacher's Certificate and taught at a
private one-teacher school for one year. </p><p>In 1915, Cornelia entered the pre-med program at Baylor University and graduated in 1918. She accepted a position at Waco High School upon graduation and taught biology there until 1925. While teaching high school, Cornelia completed the requirements
for the Master's program in botany at the University of Chicago, finishing in 1923. It was in 1923 that Cornelia met Professor Charles G. Smith whom she married in 1926. Cornelia then entered Johns Hopkins University where she received her PhD in biology in 1928. </p><p>In the fall of 1928, Cornelia
was appointed Assistant Professor of Botany at Baylor University, where she taught General Biology, Bacteriology, Methods of Teaching Biology, and other courses. Her husband, Charles, was also a professor of English at Baylor during this time. In 1930, however, Baylor instituted a policy prohibiting
a husband and wife from both teaching at Baylor. This led Cornelia to give up her position as professor and take up research. She studied in Baylor's English department and maintained her own research schedule in botany.</p><p> </p><p>In 1935, the Smiths moved to John B. Stetson University where
Cornelia served as Chairman of the Botany Department and Charles served as Dean of the University. Their appointment at John B. Stetson lasted until 1940 when Baylor President Pat Neff asked the couple to return to Baylor, with Cornelia as Professor of Botany until 1943, when she became Chair of the
Botany Department and Curator of the Strecker Museum. She served in this capacity until 1967. For almost a quarter of a century, Cornelia Marschall Smith instructed all pre-med and pre-dental students who enrolled at Baylor.</p><p> </p><p>Cornelia held numerous positions during her tenure at Baylor,
both within the university and within the community. The governor appointed her to the State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences in 1949, and she was their secretary-treasurer until she retired in 1967. In 1959, she was a part of the committee to formulate and initiate Baylor's Honors program.
She was also a member of the pre-med and pre-dental advisory committee.  In 1965, she was appointed chairman of the committee to plan the biology section of the new Sid Richardson Science Building. Cornelia was also the faculty advisor to Beta Tau Chapter of Beta, Beta, Beta, the National Honorary
Biological Society, was voted Outstanding Woman Faculty Member of Baylor in 1963 and Teacher of the Year in 1966. In 1972, she was voted Outstanding Baylor Alumni and in 1980, Baylor initiated the Cornelia M. Smith Professorship in her honor.</p><p> Cornelia's community interests were also
wide-ranging. She was a member of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, the American Association of University Professors, American Association of University Women, Modern Language Association, Texas Ornithological Society, Central Texas Chapter of the National Audubon Society, American Society of
Zoologist, North Texas Botanical society, and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. Along with these organizations, she also worked in the Waco community on boards and committees such as the McLennan County Unit of the American Cancer Society, Waco Garden Club, and was a charter and
lifetime member of the Historic Waco Foundation. She was also instrumental in establishing the Waco Symphony Association.</p><p> </p><p>Cornelia continued to be involved with Baylor University and the Waco community after her retirement in 1967. She lived to be 101 years old, passing away in 1997
August, and is buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Waco, Texas.</p>
