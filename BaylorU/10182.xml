   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>A popular writer of Texas and New Mexico history articles, Gertrude Harris Cook was born in Moulton, Texas, in 1886. She attended Texas Technical College and Sam Houston College, and received a teaching certificate from Sam Houston College. Cook married at 22 years old, in 1908, but was living
in Lubbock, Texas, with her mother and a daughter in 1930. It is unknown whom she married or how many children they had together.</p><p>Her literary career included writing many articles for the <emph render="italic">New Republic</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Dallas Morning News</emph>, as well as several books. Her earliest noted article was
written in 1930, but she was still writing in 1955, twenty-five years later. </p><p>Included in the collection is a manuscript Cook wrote on the Battle of Glorieta Pass, a Civil War battle in New Mexico that was part of the Confederate invasion of New Mexico and Arizona in 1862. Despite an apparent
Confederate victory in the battle, the Confederacy lost their bid for invasion when their wagon train, with all their food and other stores, was destroyed by a detachment of the Union army. This catastrophe forced the return of the Confederates to Texas, and was considered the "high-water mark" of
Confederate far-west ambitions.</p>
