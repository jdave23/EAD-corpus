   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Alexander Bumpass “Tip” Jones was born on 1868 April 10 in Copeville, Texas. He was the son of James Edwin Jones and Nancy Adams Bumpass. As indicated by letters to his son, Alexander pursued a career in the cattle business. On 1893 April 9, the day before his twenty-fifth birthday,
Alexander married Lula Yeary. The couple had four children over the course of their marriage: David, James Weldon, Pat Neff, and Nannie “Tippie.” The eldest child passed away at the age of three, but the three youngest children all reached adulthood. Alexander passed away in Quanah, Texas, on
1963 March 2.</p><p>James Weldon Jones, the second oldest child of Alexander and Lula Jones, was born on 1896 February 28 in the same town as his father. Along with his younger brother Pat, James attended Baylor University in the late 1910s. James was particularly involved in Baylor community life.
In addition to serving as the junior class poet and the Vice President of the Student Self Government Association, James was a member of a debate team, the university chorus, and the Panhandle Club. </p><p>In 1917, when the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies, James enlisted
in the United States Army as a private. The bulk of this collection contains letters sent from Alexander Jones to his son James as the latter trained in San Antonio and eventually sailed overseas to France. </p><p>James Weldon Jones survived the Great War and returned to the United States. Later in
life, he earned political appointments in both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. From 1934 to 1940, he served as the Insular Auditor and Financial Adviser to the High Commissioner as well as Acting High Commissioner to the Philippines. From 1941 to 1955, Jones acted as the Assistant
Director of the Bureau of the Budget. </p><p>James passed away on 1982 November 24 in Harris County, Texas. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The James Weldon Jones papers span from 1917 to 2010. The correspondence series, which consists of letters written from Alexander Bumpass "Tip" Jones to his son James Weldon Jones, ranges from 1917 to 1919. James Weldon Jones joined the American military effort in World War I and the materials
in the first series represent his father's attempts to keep in contact with him.</p>
   <p>The literary productions series consists of one folder of biographical materials collected by an unknown source. Included in this folder are genealogical materials for the Jones family, bibliographic citations for other James Weldon Jones materials, and a xeroxed photograph of James Weldon
Jones' gravestone.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to processing, the James Weldon Jones papers consisted of nine folders. Although there was no inventory, the materials had been organized chronologically with the original letters placed in acid-free sheet protectors.</p>
   <p>An inventory and preliminary processing plan have since been created. The original organization has been maintained. </p>
   <p>There are two series in this collection: I. Correspondence and II. Literary Productions.</p>
