   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University. </p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals. </p><p>The Keston Center received materials regarding the Soviet Union Murashkovtsy from 1968 to 1973. The content primarily regards the size of the group in
Kazakhstan with specific reference to the Semipalatinsk region. </p><p>The Murashkovtsy (Holy Zionists, Evangelical Christians of the Holy Zion) was a Pentecostal group founded during the 1920s or 1930s by Ivan Murashko, who asserted that he was Elijah and declared that Ol’ga Kiril’chuk was
the Mother of Zion. Although possibly a false imputation against the group, various sources mention allegations of ceremonies involving Kiril’chuk’s blood. Although Muraschkovtsy is categorized as a Pentecostal group, it also contained millennialist characteristics. The sect emphasized “the
idea of creating a ‘Holy Mount Zion’ in their local area while awaiting the imminent Second Coming” (Dennen). The movement continued in Eastern Europe after both leaders moved to Argentina in   1938.</p>
