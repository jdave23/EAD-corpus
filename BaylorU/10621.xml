   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The United Confederate Veterans (UCV) organization was founded in New Orleans in 1889. This was one of many groups founded after the American Civil War to support Confederate veterans and their families, give a space to socialize and reminisce, and promote the Confederate understanding of the
Civil War. The Grand Army of the Republic functioned as the equivalent organization for United States veterans during this time.</p><p>Organizational structure included local groups, called camps, and state, regional, and national officers. Many previously independent local Confederate veterans'
organizations across the South affiliated with the new national group, while other local camps were established from the start as local UCV groups. Approximately 80,000 Confederate veterans, spread across the South in 1,555 camps, were members at the height of the organization, in 1898. National,
state, and local reunions were an early feature of the group, which usually featured multiple-day gatherings of veterans and their families for a time to visit, hear speeches, and reminisce about the Civil War. The organization also sponsored a periodical, the <emph render="italic">Confederate Veteran</emph>. </p><p>The United
Confederate Veterans organization continued until the last annual reunion in 1950, when only one elderly member could attend. However, various organizations had been taking the lead for many years on organizing reunions and promoting the Confederate view of the war by that time, including the Sons
of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. These organizations continue today.</p>
