   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Lily McIlroy Russell (1887-1958) was born in Kerrville, Texas, on 1887 January 24. Her father, Reverend Chester A. McIlroy, moved the family to New Mexico after the death of his wife, Mary Francis Laro McIlroy. After several years of living in New Mexico, the Russell family moved to Oklahoma
and eventually Waco, Texas. </p><p> </p><p>Lily Russell attended Baylor University where she received her bachelor and master's degrees in 1911 and 1931, respectively. Her family ties to Baylor reach back at least one or more generations, as her father attended Baylor University in Independence.
Prior to joining the faculty at Baylor as an instructor in English, she taught at Baylor Academy from 1912 to 1917. Russell taught English at Baylor for five years.  </p><p>On 1917 May 4 she married Junius Brownrigg Russell; they had one  daughter, Mary Claudia Russell, and an unnamed son who
presumably died at birth. Lily Russell  and Junius Russell later divorced at an unknown date. </p><p>Lily Russell moved to Oregon in 1924 December, but returned to Baylor in 1926. That same year, she became an assistant to the Dean of Women. President Pat Neff appointed her as the Dean of Women in
1931, a position she held for the next nine years. In 1940 Russell became the Director of Public Relations, and served eight years in that role. As director, she chaired the Baylor Centennial Committee. She also served as Dean of the Union Building. Outside of Baylor, she was also a member of the
William Tryon Chapter of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, the  American Association of American Women, and the Waco Convention Bureau. Her final position at Baylor was as official university historian, starting in 1950. In her capacity as historian, she worked closely with Frank Burkhalter
and others in the Baylor Historical Society, as they worked to preserve Baylor University history. Lily Russell died on 1958 August 21 following complications of a broken hip.  She was  buried in Oakwood Cemetery next to her unnamed son.</p><p>Upon her death, her dream of writing a book on the
history of Baylor University was carried out by Baylor employees Lois Smith Douglas Murray Strain and Sue Moore, who used her files to write <emph render="italic">Baylor at Independence.</emph></p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>This collection contains Russell's personal  collected materials, literary productions, photographs, and personal  correspondence. Much of the material is connected in some way with her  longtime work at Baylor University. The two largest series are Alumni Files and Correspondence. The
collection starts prior to Russell's hiring at Baylor University as Assistant Dean of Women in 1929 and continues past her 1958 death into the mid-1960s. Following Russell's death, her secretaries continued to add to her personal files and her colleagues continued her work of writing a history of
Baylor University. All series are in good condition.</p>
   <p>The alumni files were  compiled by Russell and her secretaries starting around 1942, while Russell was Director of Public Relations, and continued up to her death while she was Baylor's official university  historian. Upon her death, Russell's primary secretary Dulce Ware  continued adding to
these files until the mid-1960s. Russell saw her work at Baylor University as gaining a "lifetime full of Baylor history children." Russell kept in constant  contact with Baylor missionaries, writers, artists, educators, and politicians. By keeping up to date with the activities of notable  Baylor
graduates, Russell sought to write a book on vocations and  another book celebrating the centennial  of the Baylor University  Volunteer Band.</p>

<p>The Lily McIlroy Russell papers had been organized prior to this finding aid, but with no inventory of the final collection or existing finding aid. It was not clear if this arrangement was in the original order or imposed by an archivist upon accession. Arrangement and titles were derived from
the existing materials. In order to enhance access, minor alterations were made and those changes are noted in the finding aid. </p>

   <p>The series was created by Lily McIlroy Russell and posthumously by her secretary, Dulce Ware. It spans Russell's various positions held at Baylor University, as the bulk of the files are from 1942 to 1958. Dulce Ware continued compiling these alumni files following Russell's death in 1958,
causing many of the files to date up to the late 1960s. The files cover many of the academic areas and professions that Baylor University offers to its graduates. The majority of the files are focused on missionaries from Baylor, as Russell was asked to collect artifacts from missionaries for the
newly-built Tidwell Bible Building, write a book on vocations, and ask former Volunteer Band members to submit their work to a publication for the centennial commemoration of the Volunteer Band.</p><p>Russell filed her alumni files by broad category title, often by a  more specific subcategory as
well, and then the name of the subject file. These  original file titles have been kept to preserve Russell's original  intent. Often extra information, such as the location of a missionary,  was also written on the file title. This information has now been included in the file itself.</p><p>This
series is in good condition, with minor rips and tears.</p>

assignment at Baylor as Assistant Dean of  Women in 1929 and continues past her death in 1958. It contains letters from her friends, family members, colleagues, and several presidents of Baylor University. </p><p>Russell's correspondence to Baylor alumni documents the university's growth and
development through the years. She consistently describes life on campus, new construction, capital campaigns, and the university's enrollment numbers. </p><p> </p><p>This series is in good condition. Russell's correspondence has minor rips and tears.</p>

   <p>The series of Literary Productions is composed of writings Russell produced for Baylor University and those she wrote for personal enjoyment. While Russell's death prevented her finishing the history of Baylor University, several of her initial chapters and many of her notes are included in
this series. </p><p> </p><p>All of her literary productions are undated. This series is in good condition, with minor rips and tears.</p>

   <p>The series contains photographs and tintypes. The photographs are of Russell's family, the Claypool family, and friends. There are two types of tintypes in this series. One group of tintypes is loose and have been removed from their original frames. The group of tintypes are set in decorative
frames and plush-box holders. These tintypes were given to Russell by Jack Standard and believed to be Baylor family members. </p><p> </p><p>Some of the loose tintypes have been damaged by scratches and wear and tear due to age. The tintypes in the decorative frames are in excellent condition. The
other photographs in this series are in good condition, with minor creases and tears on the edges of the photographs.</p>
