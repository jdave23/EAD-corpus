   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The advent of the railroad marked a significant development in Texas history.  As more and more railroads were constructed, sparsely populated regions of Texas were opened to urban markets across the United States.  Many towns, including Lawrence, Texas, sprang up in direct response to the
railroad.</p><p>The Texas and Pacific Railway Company was particularly active during the 1870's.  As its name suggests, this railroad was designed to connect cities in eastern Texas to the Pacific Ocean. In 1872, the Texas and Pacific Railway Company completed a line in what is now Kaufman County.
Investors saw great potential for the lands around the growing Dallas area.  One such group, the Texas Colony Association, purchased significant tracts of land thirty miles to the east of Dallas.  The Texas Colony Association established two main offices for its operations: one in Chicago, Illinois,
headed by John A. Francis and the other in Austin, Texas, led by Colonel J. W. Lawrence. </p><p>  </p><p>The Texas Colony Association encouraged Americans from across the country to move to Texas for its excellent climate, fertile soil, and abundant natural resources.  The broadside that comprises
this collection serves as a testament to the marketing angle that investors implemented.  Membership in the association cost $15 and secured a 25’ by 125’ lot in the newly established town of Lawrence.  While the upstart town did have its own post office by 1874 along with corn and grist
mills, Lawrence did not live up to the investors' lofty expectations, and has historically been home to only a few hundred residents.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>This collection contains a single broadside produced by the Texas Colony Association in the mid-1870's.  The broadside was created to attract people to migrate to Texas, particularly to Lawrence in Kaufman County, following the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railroad through that area
in 1872.  The broadside is in good condition and is currently framed.</p>
