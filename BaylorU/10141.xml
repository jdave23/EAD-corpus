   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Nicholas Guy Pocock, the son of Derek and Mabel Winifred (Knight) Pocock, was born on 1934 June 15 near London, England. When he was thirteen years old, Nicholas experienced his first airplane flight as a passenger, and decided to go into the aviation field. In 1952, at a mere seventeen years
old, he had obtained his pilot’s license.</p><p>After attending a technical college, Pocock joined the Royal Air Force as an instrument fitter. In the early 1960s, he began competing in various air shows around Europe. At one particular world aerobatics show in Czechoslovakia, Pocock met Waco
pilot Frank Price. The two competitors quickly became good friends.</p><p>In 1962, Pocock was named Great Britain’s Top Aerobatic Pilot. The following year, Pocock agreed to visit Waco to help Price with an air show the latter had organized. Pocock decided to stay after meeting his future wife,
Alvena Prause Trull of China Spring. The two married on 1963 December 7 and had four children: Stephen, Terry, Alicia, and Neva.</p><p>Upon settling in central Texas, Pocock continued to follow his passion for aviation. He flew for a crop-dusting division for Delta Airlines based out of Bryan until
a crash in 1964 temporarily placed him out of action. Later, he became an engineer for Certainteed Products in Hillsboro, a position he held for sixteen years. </p><p>In addition to his practical experiences as a pilot, Pocock was also a scholar. He composed two books in his life, one concerning the
Grumman/Schweizer AG-CAT aircraft and another pertaining to W.D. Custead, a man who claimed to have flown a “flying machine” near Elm Mott before the Wright Brothers’ famous flight in Kittyhawk, North Carolina. Pocock also served as a professor at nearby T.S.T.C. for twenty years, retiring
in 2005.</p><p>Pocock passed away in his hometown of China Spring on 2009 November 29. He was seventy-five years old.</p>
