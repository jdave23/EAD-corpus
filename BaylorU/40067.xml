   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports, and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center has collected documents related to the Tolstoyans from the 1980s. These focus on the history of the group, especially around the
time of the beginning of the Soviet Union and persecution. A few samizdat journals from the movement are included.</p><p>Tolstoyanism, which began in late 1800s Russia, is defined as “a Christian anarchist movement.” As implied by the name, the belief system prioritizes the teachings of Leo
Tolstoy, and thus supports the ideas of pacifism and vegetarianism. However, Kelsey Osgood, writer for <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph>, states in “Life at One of England’s Last Tolstoyan Communes” that Tolstoy “belie[ved] in Jesus Christ as a human prophet.” Therefore, the Christian characteristic of
this religion is unknown. Tolstoy never promoted Tolstoyanism, and many have cited his dismay at the formation of a religious following.</p><p>Soviet authorities persecuted Tolstoyans for their criticism of government policies and for promoting the ideas of radically changing international, social,
and personal relations in the spirit of love and non-violence. By the late 1930s, authorities completely suppressed the movement, and it remained underground until its rediscovery by Soviet dissidents and representatives of alternative culture in the 1970s. In September 1978, dozens of Tolstoyanism
sympathizers and religious pacifists, including Alexander Ogorodnikov’s Christian seminar group, gathered at Yásnaia Poliana for the celebration of the 150th Anniversary of Leo Tolstoy. At the event, heavy police presence prevented free gatherings and discussions between Tolstoy’s followers
and religious dissidents. During the 1980s, Tolstoy’s ideas of pacifism and non-violence became popular among representatives of the Soviet underground culture. In the late 1980s, Soviet pacifists produced a number of Samizdat publications. From 1987-1991, a prominent member of the movement,
Georgii Meitin from Riga, published the pacifist and antimilitarist Samizdat journal “Iasnaia Poliana,” which was also highly regarded by Soviet anarchists.</p>
