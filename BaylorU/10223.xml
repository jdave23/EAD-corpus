   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>A.J. Cooksey was born on 1833 July 3 in Alabama. At some  point Cooksey moved to Texas, and he married Elizabeth Henson Tubb  Cooksey on 1860 February 21 in  Montgomery County, Texas.  Together they  had four children: Luella born 1861 April 17, James Alvis born 1862  December 24, Anne
O’Neal born  1867 August 20, and Anner Jackson born  1880 June 25. At the time of the Civil War, the Cooksey family still  lived in Montgomery County.  </p><p>Finding enough men to serve in the  Confederate army was a constant problem, and this issue drove the South  to pass a draft law in early
1862. While the conscription law certainly  brought in new men for the army, many civilians enlisted immediately  upon passage of the law so that they could have some choice in the  matter, instead of being forced to serve. In this political climate  immediately after the conscription law passed,
the 20th Texas Infantry  was formed in the summer of 1862. A.J. Cooksey joined Company H of the  20th Texas, which was also known as Elmer's Regiment. </p><p>Cooksey  served for the rest of the war with the 20th Texas, which was assigned  to guard the Texas coastline for the duration of the war. For
three long  years, Cooksey helped patrol the area around Galveston, watching for  Union naval activities. His regiment, or perhaps his company, seemed to be based in Oakland, Brazoria County (close to Galveston) for most of the war, as indicated by addresses on his letters. Andrew Jackson Cooksey
died  on 1880 April 2, three  months before the birth of his youngest child.</p><p>Other Civil War  letters in the collection appear to be from the Robertson family. None  are originals, but a transcript of one letter indicates he was in the  7th Texas Infantry, Gregg's Regiment, Granbury's Brigade,
Army of the  Tennessee.</p><p>The Robertson family connection to the Cooksey family  is through A.J. Cooksey's son, James Alvis Cooksey. His granddaughter  Reba Laucille Rushing married Henry W. Robertson, and the birth  certificates for Reba and Henry’s children,  as well as other materials
from the ancestors of A.J. Cooksey, can be found in the collection.</p><p>This collection provides a rich historical look at guarding the Gulf Coast during the American Civil War.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Cooksey-Robertson Family papers describes the service of   two men in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. Through   letters home, these men give a picture of army life, along with advice   about how to run the farm back home, regret that they are away from   their families,
and wishes for more letters from home.</p>
   <p>The Cooksey-Robertson Family papers consist of letters, birth certificates, tax receipts, and log books. There is one piece of original Confederate currency in the collection. </p>
   <p>The bulk of this collection are the letters A.J. Cooksey wrote home to his wife, Elizabeth Henson Tubb  Cooksey. In many of the letters, he refers to her by two nicknames: "Turnip" and "Lizzie." He mentions their daughter Luella (he calls her Lula) frequently as well. Since Cooksey was posted
to guard the Texas coast, he does not write about many battles or marching from place to place, but instead describes camp life, news from the battle front, and his instructions to his wife about how to run the farm in his absence. All of these letters are transcribed, and each description is with
the original letter in the collection.</p>

<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior this finding aid, the Cooksey-Robertson Family papers were organized loosely with an earlier legacy finding aid. The two series from the first finding aid, though not called series, were preserved. </p>
   <p>Currently, the Cooksey-Robertson Family papers are arranged in two series: I. Cooksey Family and II. Robertson Family.</p>
