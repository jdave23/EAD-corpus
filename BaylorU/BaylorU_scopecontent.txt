1859-1916 that can be added to by the compilation of business records in scrapbook-like bound document volumes. Extensive records on books in the possession and protection of the Philomathesians maintain complete inventories and book circulation from various years, showing the growth of the
Philomathesians’ collection until they donated all of their books to the Baylor library in the early 1900s. The periodical records from 1896-1900 document which periodicals and formal magazines the society subscribed. One book titled the Philomathesian Literary Review documents articles written
by members for various volumes of the society’s publication from 1869 to 1876. Correspondence records exist in this collection between the Philomathesians and Erisophians that occurred between 1912 and 1913 on a disagreement about how the debates from that year should be structured. These fight

<p>The Jones Texas Broadside collection is comprised of historical broadsides, organized by date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This collection of over 120 historical Texas broadsides date from 1822 to 1845. For the first fourteen years of this time period, Texas was a remote outpost of the newly formed nation of Mexico, which had broken away from Spain in 1821. Texas, after a large influx of Anglo-American
settlers, declared their independence from Mexico in 1836. The Republic of Texas period continued until 1845, when Texas became part of the United States of America.</p>
<p>These materials offer a unique insight into the state of affairs that existed between Texas and Mexico in a tumultuous period of their shared history. The broadsides, which are exclusively written in Spanish, are meant to inform the reader of particular events, much like a poster today.
Some of these broadsides are quite rare, as they do not appear in Thomas Streeter's five-volume work <emph render="italic">Bibliography of Texas</emph>, which is a recognized resource on broadsides.</p>

there are no tears or other damage.</p>
<p>The General Tire and Rubber Company opened in Waco in 1944 November as the first major tire factory in the southwest. In 1946, members of the Congress of Industrial Organization led a strike at the plant that lasted at least 60 days; the strikers demanded higher wages to meet the rising
cost of living after World War II. At its height, the plant occupied a 2 million square-foot facility and employed over 1,500 workers. After several decades of successful business, the plant became obsolete and tire production was phased out in 1986; layoffs lasted for several years. The General
Tire headquarters in Akron, Ohio, eventually closed as well and became a subsidiary of Continental General Tire, based in Hannover, Germany. Over the years, the Waco plant building retained the name General Tire, but was divided for use among various companies, including Clarke Products and
Caterpillar Logistics. In 2010, Baylor Research &amp; Innovation Collaboration renovated portions of the General Tire building. It was then donated to Baylor University.</p>

<p>This collection houses primary source materials relating to Baylor University’s involvement in the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program in World War II. The materials, which are in good condition, are dated 1943-1944. Colonel Ralph Durkee, the former commandant of Baylor's Army

<p>The United States government initiated the Army Specialized Training Program in 1943. In an effort to develop educated and well-rounded military officers, the U.S. War Department worked in cooperation with colleges and universities across the nation to create an appropriate curriculum. After
persistent negotiations by Baylor University President Pat Neff, Baylor was approved as a training site on 1943 April 1. Students underwent rigorous training, both physically and intellectually. The program ultimately ended in 1944, however, with the Allied invasion of Europe. The military needed
all available men and women for the offensive.</p>

<p>The Mamie Boone papers contain poetry, trip to Europe postcards and scrapbooks, recipes, family and travel photographs, and photographs of the dedication of an elevator on-campus by the NoZe Brotherhood, an unofficial student organization present at Baylor University. The NoZe Brotherhood
materials appear to have been mailed to Mamie Boone. Very little of the collection documents Boone's professional career; instead, it documents her leisure time traveling and her personal schoolwork. There are many photographs of various U.S. presidential birthplaces and homes; it was a personal
goal of Boone's to visit every presidential birthplace.</p>
<p>The Mary Cole Boone series contains information on Mamie Boone's mother, Mary Cole Boone, (1856-1923) attended Waco University in the 1870s (consolidated with Baylor University in 1886). She married Joseph P. Boone (1851-1934) and moved to Dallas, Texas.</p>

<p>This collection contains a variety of printed materials collected and produced by Dr. Rufus B. Spain over the course of his lengthy career at Baylor University. The earliest materials date to 1960 and the latest to 2012, but the bulk of the collection ranges between 2002 and 2012. Taken
together, these materials both reflect Spain’s personal role in the Department of History and provide a window into broader events in Baylor’s history, particularly the implementation of and responses to the Baylor 2012 strategic plan. The materials are in good condition.</p>
<p>The first series, Series I. Active Faculty Files, reflects Rufus Spain’s tenure as a full- and part-time professor at Baylor, and covers the 1960s to the 1990s. The yearly files in this series primarily consist of administrative documents and correspondence related to the Department of
History. This series also includes a number of obscure or independent student newspapers, including the NoZe Brotherhood’s <emph render="italic">The Rope </emph>and protest-oriented Vietnam War-era publications; chapel and Focus Week schedules; lecture- and conference-related materials; and newsletters from Texas politicians
in state and federal office.</p>
<p>The final three series are, in contrast, products of Rufus Spain’s later “retirement” (but effectively part-time work with Baylor retirees). Correspondingly, the final series, Series IV. Retirement: Literary Productions, contains often-annotated newsletters of the Retired
Professors/Administrators Program (RPAP). Most materials in these latter series, however, actually relate to larger topics in the life of Baylor University, particularly the presidencies of Robert Sloan, John Lilley, and Kenneth Starr, and common responses to the implementation of the Baylor 2012
strategic plan. The second series, Series II. Retirement: Correspondence, largely consists of printed email correspondence and internet articles related to Baylor 2012. The third series, Series III. Retirement: Subject Files, contains subject files largely relating to the same topic yet with
particular emphases on theological conflicts and clashing institutional visions within Baylor University. Series IV, in addition to RPAP newsletters, also contains a small number of newspaper clippings and newsletters relating to Baylor 2012. (In most cases, clipped articles previously preserved in
this collection have been replaced by indices and can instead be referenced in the Texas Collection's newspaper holdings.) It should be noted that these materials rarely reflect Spain’s own views and instead document a broad spectrum of perspectives on Baylor’s future, though most reflect the
orientation of those who opposed the implementation of Baylor 2012.</p>

<p>This collection begins in 1926 and ends in 2005, with some undated materials. The collection contains materials pertaining to the Spanish Department at Baylor University. The majority of these materials were obtained from former Spanish professor Dr. Thomas F. Walker after his retirement. The
collection is divided into two series: T. F. Walker and Administrative. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Series I. T. F. Walker consists of materials from Walker’s time as a PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin, the bulk of which are between 1948 and 1950. The first two folders contain teaching materials, such as syllabi, handouts, blank exams, and instructions for the professors
from the department. Folders 3-8 contain materials pertaining to Walker’s studies. These include notes, papers, and exams. Graded materials are restricted. The rest of the materials in Series I. derive from Walker’s time as a professor at Baylor, and range in date from 1950 to 1962. The first
ten folders contain students’ term papers arranged by class. The last five folders contain Walker’s research materials and drafts of essays. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Series II. Administrative comprises of various materials pertaining to the department, but not belonging to Dr. Walker. This series has the widest date range, with the bulk of it coming from between 1930 and 1980. The first six folders contain student papers submitted to other professors in
the department and are restricted. The remaining eight folders contain teaching materials, departmental correspondence, newspaper articles, and promotional materials for events, courses, and study abroad opportunities.</p>

<p>The John N. Rowe III papers span from 1510 to 1989, with the bulk of the material covering 1830-1880. The papers predominately deal with Galveston county, though Nacogdoches, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana are also featured prominently. The majority of the papers were originally identified
individually and that detail of processing is maintained throughout. The materials are now divided into three series: I. Spanish Documents, II. Early Texas Documents, and III. Early United States Documents. </p>
<p>The first series, Spanish Documents, contains Spanish language materials from Spain and Mexico. There are religious proclamations, political declarations, general correspondence, and financial records in this series. It also contains a concentration of documents about Puerto Rico and a group
of around 150 documents to and from a Señor Antonio de Perez Galvez.</p>
<p>The Early Texas Documents series contains materials that are pre-Republic of Texas up to the early 20th Century. You can find many of Austin's Old 300 in this section of the papers. It is further divided into four subseries: correspondence, legal, financial, and other. The correspondence
subseries consists of general correspondence of different individuals, among them Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin and Moses Austin. The largest section, legal, consists of materials covering land grants, land titles, wills, marriages, court documents, and documents pertaining to legal
representation. Notably in this subseries are two muster rolls from the Army of The Republic of Texas in 1840. The muster rolls are of Company E, 1st Texas Infantry Regiment, under Colonel Edward Burleson. The third subseries, financial, is made up of financial documents in the form of treasury
warrants, inventories, receipts, bonds, Republic of Texas and Civil War currency, and checks. Other, the fourth subseries, contains materials in other languages than English and Spanish, early flyers, sheet music, invitations, tickets, circulars, publications, a section of letters and documents from
the Stiles family, and a James W. Fannin letter from Cuba in 1832.</p>
<p>The third series, Early United States Documents, contains early materials from states other than Texas, correspondence, publications, treaties, Civil War currency, and United States currency. </p>
<p>The strength of the papers lies in the collective vision and nature of the documents themselves, first as historic pieces and then as a whole, and what they say about early Texas and Mexico. Each item is unique and valuable but, taken together, gives a broad glimpse into the legal, political
and financial matters that helped to shape the state of Texas.</p>

for American History at the University of Texas in Austin, and The Texas Collection at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. The Ima Joy Chodorow Gandler Texas Jewish Collection houses Gandler’s personal and family papers in addition to highlighting her genealogical interests and participation with
numerous organizations. </p>
<p>The Family series consists of materials produced by and about Gandler’s family. The Borschows, Chodorows, and Gandlers provide a bulk of the information, but other branches are represented as well. The Personal series is an extension of family papers but focus specifically on Ima Joy’s
activities. Her interests in the arts, travel, research, and personal relationships are documented in addition to her philanthropic and organizational participation.

<p>The Genealogy series consists of original and photocopied materials documenting activities, events, and accomplishments of individuals and families within the Waco Jewish Community. Documentation shows that original materials were made available to Ima Joy Gandler and returned to the families
after photocopying with knowledge that the information would be distributed through the Texas Collection at Baylor University and [Waco] Temple Rodef Sholom. Multiple generations of families with deep ties to the Waco Jewish Community are documented as well as several others who once lived in the
area but have moved away. Notable names include Englander, Goldstein, Sanger, Levy, Naman, Lipsitz, and Harelik. Also included are notecards created by Gandler which outline family lineages. </p>
<p>The Organizations series documents Gandler’s involvement and interests in the broader Jewish Community. As a member of local, regional, and national organizations she collected materials of such groups as the Greater Waco Interfaith Conference, National Council for Jewish Women, and the
Texas Jewish Historical Society (TJHS). She also collected material on Jewish congregations throughout Texas, identifying lost or dwindling Jewish communities in addition to those still thriving. Organizations she supported financially can also be found. Some include the Greene Family Camp, Texas
A&amp;M Hillel, and the United States Holocaust Memorial. Information on each organization varies based upon Ima Joy’s involvement from casual interest to active member or officer. This is most evident in congregational files as some have only one or two items while others are more robust with
multiple files. </p>

Belton Brick Stockholder, W. F. Beamer, was also involved with other brick companies, including the Bell County Brick Company which was also located in Belton, Texas. </p>
<p>The Administrative series provides insight into company incorporation as well as stockholder’s meetings through several contracts, stock certificates, and a minute book. The Financial series illustrates daily operations with account books and ledgers. These are also helpful as they provide
documentation of companies and persons utilizing the bricks.</p>

<p>The collection consists of records, primarily covering the years 1990-2010, and chiefly documenting Edwards’ career in the United States Congress. The Administrative files contain invitations and phone logs. The Campaign series consists of material recorded from 1990-2010. While relatively
small, the majority of the materials include radio and television spot ads for Edwards related to his various political campaigns. Edwards represented Texas’ 11th congressional district until 2005 and the 17th congressional district from 2005 to 2010. The District files contain information about
the various cities and constituencies located in those districts and are arranged alphabetically by geographic location. Topics include town halls, Fort Hood, Baylor University, and Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Legislative files from the 102nd Congress (1991-1992) through the 111th Congress (2009-2010) reflect legislative priorities such as agriculture, appropriations, armed services, budget, homeland security, and veterans’ affairs. Within each Congress, files are arranged alphabetically by
topic. Press files generated by Edwards’ office are organized by type: columns, mailers, news releases, newsletters, and radio calls. Materials are categorized as general for their broad scope and are organized chronologically. Newsletters contain documents addressed to constituents and are
organized by topic. Speeches range in date from 1989-2009 and reflect Edwards’ service in the U. S. House of Representatives and part of his tenure in the Texas Senate. Arrangement is topical and chronological. Topics include campaigns, commencements, fundraisers, House floor speeches, and
impeachment. Many of the speeches are written in Edwards’ own hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Topical series cover the gamut of activities and interests over his twenty years of service in the House. Of particular interest are records relating to the Branch Davidians, the Clinton Impeachment, and Religious Liberty. In 1993 February, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms, and
the FBI laid siege to the Branch Davidian compound, located ten miles from Waco. After 51 days the siege ended tragically when a fire killed 76 people inside the compound, including the leader David Koresh. Materials include a copy of a response by Edwards to remarks made by Representative Ron Paul
regarding the role of the federal government in the tragedy. The Clinton Impeachment proceedings in the House began during the second session of the 105th Congress and were completed in 1998 December. The Senate proceedings began in 1999 January. Of the impeachment proceedings, Congressman Edwards
said, “Bill Clinton’s crime was poor judgment and immoral acts, not bribery, not treason, not high crimes and misdemeanors as the Founding Fathers demanded.” Materials include correspondence, Democratic Party press, proceedings, and research on the topics of impeachment, censure, and the
Constitution. Edwards was a strong and effective voice on behalf of religious liberty, largely due to the influence of former Baylor University president Herbert H. Reynolds. Religious liberty documents are arranged alphabetically by topic. Each topic represents a major religious liberty/separation
of church-state issue that transpired over his time in office. Included among the topics are: Charitable Choice (1995-2007), Religious Freedom Amendment (1994-2002), Religious Liberty Protection Act (1998-1999), and posting the Ten Commandments on public property (1997-2005). Edwards once stated,
“The best way to ruin religion is to politicize it.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The collection also includes Voting Record files that include scorecards and data regarding Edwards’ votes compiled by various special interest groups (Children’s Defense Fund, NAACP and ACLU), the Democratic Party, and his own office. These materials are organized chronologically by
congress. Audiovisual Materials include images, audio, and video recordings from 1990-2010. It contains radio and television campaign ads, recorded speeches, press reports, and other recordings. Data formats include: computer diskettes, videotape reels, audio cassettes, Digital Audio Tape (DAT), VHS

persons in post-war Europe and the Texas tidelands conflict. These last two subjects make up the bulk of the materials. Many of the materials on the other topics take the form of publications like magazines, weeklies, or newspaper articles and advertisements.</p>
<p>Aside from describing Gossett’s legislative activities, the collection also provides insight into some American attitudes toward all these issues through Gossett’s congressional correspondence and the numerous newspaper clippings, magazines, and other publications comprising the
collection. Indeed, anti-Semitic sentiment pervades the topics of immigration, Communism, Palestine, and race relations, documenting this aspect of American thought during the post-war period. The collection contains little on personal matters. Materials on immigration chronicle Gossett’s
legislative activities and nationally visible stance to reduce immigration quotas and oppose immigration of displaced persons while serving on congressional committees for immigration and naturalization from 1943-1951. They document his opposition to what became the 1948 Displaced Persons Act, as
well as the fight to introduce tougher qualifications for immigration which eventually led to the passage of the Internal Security Act of 1950. The Tidelands series comprises information about the conflict between states and the national government over the control of submerged lands following the
1947 Supreme Court ruling in <emph render="italic">US</emph> v. <emph render="italic">California</emph>. It includes correspondence and publications documenting the battle from the states’, particularly Texas’s, perspective; statements before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees and their related bills; and filings with the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The papers and materials collected by Lola Hopper were donated to the Baylor Collections of Political Materials in the summer of 2012. The collection contains mostly campaign materials from various campaigns Lola Hopper supported over 50 years of political activity, including yard signs,
T-shirts, bumper stickers, and a large collection of political buttons. Also included are a large number of photographs taken at various occasions. </p>
<p>Hopper worked as a secretary for Texas State Senator Donald G. Adams during the 1970's. The materials in this collection include letters from Adams and his wife Linda, some office materials, photographs of Adams and his staff, and newspaper clippings. The collection also includes several items

a section on Bullock's political opponents, campaign notebooks, poll information, position papers, and publicity in the form of articles, brochures, news clippings, newsletters, press releases, assorted publications, and reports.</p>
<p>The strength of the Campaign collection lies in the 1990 Campaign series and the progression of campaign materials throughout the series. As the largest series and the first campaign for Lieutenant Governor, the 1990 Campaign shows the development, detail, and implementation of a winning
political campaign. The attention to detail in researching issues and in preparation for opponents reflects Bullock’s drive and intensity. The embracing of different campaign techniques throughout the six campaigns shows the growth and use of new mediums to reach constituents and influence

<p>Constituent correspondence are arranged alphabetically, by incoming/outgoing correspondence, and topically. </p>
<p/>
<p>The Departments and Agencies series enumerates Steelman's contact with numerous federal agencies from 1973-1976. By far, the bulk of this series illuminates how Steelman voiced a variety of constituent concerns to the U.S. Postal Service. Also of note are recommendations written by
Steelman on behalf of constituents to different federal departments such as the Department of Labor, Department of Justice, and the White House. The District series for Dallas highlights Dallas area concerns and contains photographs in the file on the Urban Park Baptist Singers. A Texas
subseries of the District series mainly consists of materials on individual cities in Steelman's district, but also holds numerous folders on general affairs in Texas or local communities. </p>
<p>Next, Legislation by Committee encompasses bills from ten different Congressional committees. Legislation on banking and currency issues make up the largest subseries, followed by the Judiciary Committee subseries. The Judiciary Committee subseries chronicles sentiment in Steelman's
district for and against bills on President Nixon's impeachment and the Watergate break in. Other notable subseries include: Government Operations, Interior &amp; Insular Affairs (both of which Steelman served on) and the Cabinet Committee on Spanish Speaking People. Land use controversies
dominates the subseries on Interior and Insular Affairs, just as revenue sharing does in the Government Operations subseries. </p>
<p> The Legislative series contains three subseries. Major topics in the 93rd Congress subseries include, ecology, the economy, commerce, Citizens Band radios, transportation, and FDA consumer vitamin labeling. Land use, conservation, the EPA, ecology, healthcare, transportation, and
veterans issues prevail in the 94th Congress series. The Topical subseries in the Legislative series itemizes some of Steelman's highest legislative priorities: AMTRAK, Big Thicket, Energy, and the Trinity River. Binders also held these materials prior to processing. Here, General materials
contain legislative analysis from the American Enterprise Institute dated 1965-1967, and later from 1973-1976. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Columns, Magazines, and Newsletters subseries of the Press are in poor condition. The Magazines subseries highlights Steelman's favorable reception by the mainstream Texas and American media upon his election and after his two terms in Congress. Steelman's Speeches and Floor
Statements are in average condition and range from 1968 to his years after Congress. All of the post-Congressional speeches are undated and the majority of the speeches are from 1973. Additionally, most of the speeches were written on a typewriter with hand-written corrections. The Voting
Record series retains alpha ordering by issue from the years 1973 to 1975. Steelman's voting by issue in 1976 is missing, but his roll call votes from 1973 to1976 exist in this series. The Photographs in the Audio-Visual series largely came out of three notebooks. A little over half of the
photographs are undated and many have negatives. A list of the monthly radio programs Steelman gave in the Reel-to-Reel items. </p>

<p>This collection consists of manuscripts, research materials, and articles collected by Dick Russell, most of which pertain to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Although Russell had a long and successful career as an environmental journalist, the materials in the Dick Russell papers focus
on his Kennedy assassination research. The content ranges from exclusive interviews and copious notes to collections of speculative articles. The records in the collection are from 1924-2011 with the bulk of the material spanning the years 1959-2011.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The large <emph render="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</emph> (TMWKTM) series contains years of extensive research files and drafts for Russell’s popular history of the John F. Kennedy assassination, published in 1992. The research files are arranged alphabetically with the draft manuscripts separated by year from

<p>The William R. Smith papers range from 1890-1953, and cover a portion of Smith’s personal life as well as the lives of various members of the Smith family. Included are letters between Smith and his wife Frances over the course of their courtship and marriage, discussing primarily details

<p>The William R. “Bill” Vance papers range from 1972-2009, and cover a portion of Vance’s public life as a court justice and candidate for state office. Included are a number of press clippings from throughout Vance’s career. Correspondence related to campaigns for both the 10th
Court and Court of Criminal Appeals, as well as some correspondence from Vance’s time on the 10th Court, provide additional context for some of the clippings. Also enclosed are several awards and honors Vance earned over the course of his career.</p>
<p>The 1990 campaign was not particularly ideologically driven and focused instead on the disparity between the qualifications of the two candidates. In contrast, Vance’s 2000 campaign was framed heavily around broader discussions of the state of the American justice system. The clippings
and letters in the collection display the negative view Texas media held toward the Court of Criminal Appeals, characterizing it as a partisan body so obsessed with “law and order” that it ignored evidence that might exonerate (or at least demand a new trial for) its appellants. Of particular
interest are the campaigns’ existence in the context of debates surrounding the usefulness of DNA testing for overturning convictions (the Roy Criner case, in which the CCA explicitly ignored DNA evidence, is mentioned multiple times). Vance’s opponent, Sharon Keller, was indicted as the
ringleader and mouthpiece for this unsympathetic court.</p>
<p>Vance’s time in court was mostly productive, and his statements to the press consistently emphasize his ability to work through his assigned caseloads. However, with the ascension of Tom Gray to the position of chief justice in 2003, tensions began to show in the court’s internal
workings. Gray was consistently critical of the number of cases being overturned by the court, noting that a number of these overturned cases were also being overturned by higher courts. His dissenting opinions took jabs at the other sitting justices, eventually drawing significant attention from
the popular press.</p>

<p>The Donald G. Adams papers contain materials related to Adams’s political career in the Texas House of Representatives (61st and 62nd legislatures) and Texas Senate (63rd-65th legislatures). Included are correspondence between members of government and legislative constituents, copies of
legislation, clippings, and campaign materials. Outlying materials provide additional context to Adams’s private life while working in state government.</p>
<p>Adams’s career coincided with a tumultuous series of events in Texas history. The Sharpstown Banking scandal became a salient issue in the 1972 election, leading to widespread disruption of the established legislative power structure and creating a more liberal legislature as many
moderates became tarnished by their connections to this financial legislation/stock fraud scandal. Adams’s senate run skirted this issue fairly successfully despite his opponent J.C. Stallings’s consistent efforts to utilize the scandal against Adams in both print and radio advertisements.
Stallings’s use of his personally-owned radio stations in the campaign became a part of the depiction of Stallings as an unscrupulous and litigious individual, which characterizes Adams’s approach to the issue. After defeating Stallings in the primary, Adams faced no opposition in the general
election.</p>
<p>Adams’s Senate career also coincided with the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1974. Materials related to the Texas Constitution appear throughout Adams’s career. In addition to serving as an elected delegate at the convention, Adams proposed several amendments to the Constitution in
the legislature and voted on other amendments introduced in legislative sessions. Along with constitutional amendments, Adams worked to amend the Texas Criminal Code and Family Code, especially as it related to parental rights of illegitimate children and foster families. In addition to these
sweeping legislative issues, Adams was also a consistent advocate for both volunteer and professional firefighters, proposing legislation to improve their economic standing.</p>
<p>While in the legislature, Adams was a member of multiple committees and served as chairman of the Senate Administration Committee in the 64th and 65th sessions. Despite his varied and consistent committee membership, the only committees represented in this collection are the Administration,
Jurisprudence, Intergovernmental Relations, and Counties Committees. Adams was a member of the House Counties Committee during the 62nd Legislature.</p>
<p>Adams diligently responded to constituent correspondence and appeared at community events when his schedule permitted it. This collection contains letters related to a broad range of legislative, community, and personal issues as well as a number of Adams’s responses.</p>

political opposition in candidates such as Murray Watson, Jack Burgess, and Lane Denton. The scope of the collection concludes with Poage's retirement in 1978 and his careful monitoring of the election that year, a race won by Marvin Leath.</p>
