   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Davis Robert Gurley (1836-1914) was born in Alabama on 1836 October 17, and moved to Waco in 1853 with his two brothers. He attended Wesleyan University in Alabama, graduating in 1858. Gurley enlisted in Company G, 6th Texas Cavalry, as a lieutenant in 1861. However, when Lawrence Sullivan
Ross became commanding colonel of the regiment, he transferred Gurley to his staff, where he served as adjutant. When Ross' Brigade was formed, Gurley was promoted to major and became adjutant of the brigade. He served in this capacity for the rest of the American Civil War. </p><p>After the war,
Gurley returned to Waco and married Louisa Wells Loulie Earle Gurley. The couple had four daughters and a son together. Entering local politics, Gurley was elected as district clerk in 1866, and served as adjutant general of Texas under Governor James Throckmorton. After his brief political career,
Gurley raised cotton and Jersey cattle on a farm south of Waco. As a Mason, he was heavily involved with J.H. Gurley Lodge #337 in Waco. He was a member of Fifth Street Methodist Church in Waco. Davis R. Gurley passed away on 1914 January 11 and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Waco.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Davis Robert Gurley Family collection contains an account book, family Bible, and copies of genealogical information from the family Bible. The account book is possibly from the Gurley family plantation near Waco, and contains financial information and a will with a list of enslaved
people.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The Davis Robert Gurley Family collection was in multiple untitled folders prior to processing, with no existing finding aid or inventory. At some point, the Bible had been transferred to the Family Bibles collection #122. It was brought back and reunited with this collection as part of current
processing.</p>
   <p>Currently, the Davis Robert Gurley Family collection is arranged in two series: I. Financial and II. Family Bible.</p>
