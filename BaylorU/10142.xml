   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The religious sects known as the Davidians and Branch Davidians were the products of a reform movement within the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Problems began when a group of Adventists, led by Bulgarian immigrant Victor Houteff, started to challenge the traditional hierarchy of the
denomination. Houteff claimed to have received personal revelations from God and published his controversial views in a book entitled <emph render="underline">The Shepherd’s Rod </emph>(1932). Houteff and his followers, the Davidians, believed that the spiritual gift of prophecy was necessary for effective leadership so that
King David’s earthly kingdom could be re-established on earth prior to the second coming of Jesus Christ. After the leaders of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church excommunicated his sect, Houteff moved to Waco, Texas, and continued to preach until his death in 1955.</p><p>Upon Houteff’s death,
the Davidians splintered into competing groups. Benjamin Roden and his wife Lois commanded one such faction, calling themselves the Branch Davidians. For over two decades, the Rodens led the Branch Davidians without significant opposition. The 1980's, however, brought about division. A newcomer
named Vernon Howell had joined the Branch in 1981. Three years later, a schism occurred within the group, with Howell leading his followers to a new site in Palestine, Texas. Through a series of confrontations between Howell and George Roden, the son of Ben and Lois Roden, control of the Branch
Davidians’ headquarters in Waco passed to Howell who legally changed his name to David Koresh in 1990. Rumors concerning polygamy, abuse, and arms dealing within the Branch Davidian group aroused the suspicions of the federal government. Thus, federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives began to monitor the group. </p><p>In response to a stockpiling of illegal weapons, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives secured a search warrant for the investigation of the Branch Davidians’ compound
near Waco, Texas. From February 28th until April 19th, 1993, Branch Davidians under the leadership of David Koresh resisted federal agents’ attempts to storm their Mount Carmel Center. The fifty-day siege ended when the compound erupted in flames, killing David Koresh and most of his followers.
This collection was donated by Andy Segal, a Senior Producer at CNN, in 2010 December. Segal grew up near Louisville, Kentucky. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago and has made his career in journalism.  His research in the Branch Davidians led him to file a Freedom of
Information Act with the United States government for access to the materials in this collection.</p>
