   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Mary McCauley Maxwell was born in Moody, Texas, on 1884 October 8. She attended Baylor Female College (now the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor), graduating in 1904. She then attended Baylor University, where she was a member of the Calliopean Literary Society, and graduated in 1908. She
served as the head of the History Department at Baylor Female College until she married F. O. Maxwell in 1913. The couple had three children.</p><p> </p><p>Mary McCauley Maxwell developed an interest in Judge R. E. B. Baylor, one of the founders of both of her alma maters, in the 1930s, and she
began to collect his relics. She donated the items to the university at the 90th Commencement in 1935. Because of her research and contact with the Baylor family, she persuaded them to donate several valuable family relics to Baylor University as well. Maxwell was one of the primary people working
to preserve Baylor's original campus in Independence, Texas. She also persuaded the Centennial Commission to give $14,000 to Baylor for a statue of Judge R. E. B. Baylor, eventually created by Pompeo Coppini. She was invited to join the State Historical Society in 1954. Mary McCauley Maxwell died in
Waco, Texas, on 1963 January 31.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>This collection begins in 1907 and ends in 1936, with some undated material. The bulk of the material comes from 1907-1908, which was Mary McCauley Maxwell's senior year at Baylor University. She collected clippings, photos, and other materials related to the senior class's activities. Several
articles about her later work with Judge R. E. B. Baylor's relics are interspersed throughout the scrapbook seemingly at random. Numerous clippings are undated.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to current processing, the materials were bound together in a scrapbook with clippings and other materials stuck between the pages. Currently, this original order is maintained in the collection's organization, although some of the clippings were copied and duplicate materials
deaccessioned. The scrapbook is housed in one folder, comprising one series. I. Collected Materials.</p>
