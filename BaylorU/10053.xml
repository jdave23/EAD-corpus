   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>J. Frank Dobie was himself a legendary figure.  Born in Texas in 1888, he grew up on the family ranch in Live Oak county, a heritage that stayed with him in his writings.  Dobie completed an undergraduate degree from Southwestern University and a master’s degree from Columbia.  He married
Bertha McKee Dobie in 1916, and found work as a teacher, reporter, and finally became a university professor at the University of Texas in 1914.  With the United States’ entrance into World War I, Dobie served two years in the army.  Back in Texas, he breathed new life into the dormant Texas
Folklore Society and did good work at the university, but left for a time when the school would not promote him.  He returned after two years away in 1925 and published his first book, Vaquero of the Brush Country, in 1929.  This launched a career of prolific book-publishing, briefly interrupted by
World War II, which he spent on a leave of absence teaching American literature in England.  Returning after the war, he applied again to teach abroad, and when rejected, he severed his ties forever with the University of Texas.  With more time to write, he completed literary works at a rapid pace,
finishing six in the 1950s.  After writing numerous books, and given many awards, educator J. Frank Dobie died on 1964 September 18.  He is buried in the Texas State Cemetery.</p><p>    With Dobie’s fascination with a good story, he was interested enough in Jim Bowie to write an essay for the
book Heroes of Texas, which can be found in this collection.  James Bowie, born in 1796, grew up in Louisiana as the son of a prominent plantation owner.  He did various work on the frontier, including lumber work, slave trading, fighting in the War of 1812, and land speculation.  Jim also earned
notoriety as a knife fighter in the Sandbar Fight brawl.  In the 1820s Bowie operated a plantation with several of his brothers in southern Louisiana which they sold in 1831 for $90,000.  After a decade of plantation life, James Bowie set out for Texas, arriving in Nacogdoches in 1830.</p><p>    In
Texas, Jim Bowie began new operations, marrying into the prominent Veramendi family of San Antonio and purchasing a textile mill for $20,000.  He did not stay around San Antonio long, though, as he took several long scouting trips west of San Antonio, looking for abandoned silver mines.  On one of
these trips, his group of eleven held off a series of American Indian attacks for thirteen hours.  He also participated in the 1832 Battle of Nacogdoches, a disagreement between Mexican authorities and American colonists which took place well before the Texas Revolution three years later.</p><p> 
In 1833, while Bowie was sick with yellow fever in Natchez, his wife’s parents, his wife, and his children all died of cholera in Monclava.  These deaths deprived Bowie of his connection to the old Mexican families in Texas, but strengthened his interest in land speculation and in fighting for
Texan freedom.  When Stephen F. Austin called for an army to seize San Antonio in 1835, Bowie joined the rapidly-growing Texan army.  He was the victorious commander in the Battle of Concepción, where his 92 men fought off 400 Mexican infantry and cavalry in a three-hour fight.  Bowie also commanded
a detachment in the Grass Fight close to San Antonio later in the campaign.  Sam Houston dispatched Bowie from Goliad in 1836 with orders to destroy any fortifications, take command of any troops, and bring them to Houston, but Bowie spoke in favor of keeping the fortifications and stayed.  The old
Spanish mission of the Alamo became the main fort, where Bowie gathered various independent groups under his command.  When the Mexican army under Santa Anna arrived in February, Bowie had pneumonia or tuberculosis, and was unable to help much in the defense of the Alamo.  He died in 1836 March 6
along with the entire garrison after a thirteen-day siege.  An account of Bowie’s life, along with J. Frank Dobie’s comments, can be found in the collection.</p>
