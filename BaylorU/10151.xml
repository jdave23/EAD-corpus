   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Walter Hale McKenzie was born on 1885 September 17 in Dublin, Texas, to James Wilson McKenzie and Lauren Winn McKenzie. McKenzie was a prominent Texas Baptist leader from a young age. He received his A.B. from Baylor University and his Master's degree in Theology from Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary. He was ordained to the ministry in 1907. While preparing for ordination, McKenzie taught a course on the Bible at Goodnight Junior College for three years. </p><p>A well-known minister, McKenzie served a number of pastorates in Texas throughout his career, including
Burkburnett, First Baptist in Waxahachie, and University Baptist in Austin (1931-1943). After giving the baccalaureate sermon at Baylor commencement on 1932 May 29, McKenzie was awarded an honorary doctor of divinity degree, an honor he also received from Howard Payne College in 1931.
</p><p>McKenzie was intimately involved in Texas Baptist life. He served on the Board of Trustees for Baylor University and the Executive Board of the Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT), which he also served as chairman in the early 1930s. McKenzie's time on the Executive Board was eventful.
On 1933 March 7, the BGCT inaugurated the Texas Baptist Historical Committee. In the fall of 1933, the Executive Board elected its first women members. While on the Unification Committee of Texas Baptists in 1934, McKenzie contributed to unsuccessful reconciliation attempts between the BGCT and the
Baptist Missionary Association, which since 1901 had been separated from the BGCT. </p><p>McKenzie was instrumental in securing Baylor's financial strength during the 1930s, convincing the wealthy J.G. Hardin family--to whom he had been pastor at Burkburnett--to give $400,000 to Baylor. McKenzie
also helped persuade the Hardins to make a gift of $100,000 to Baylor College for Women--a gift that led to the renaming of the institution as Mary Hardin-Baylor College in 1934. McKenzie also maintained warm relations with other Texas Baptist luminaries George W. Truett and Pat M. Neff, who was
persuaded to take Baylor's presidency in part by McKenzie. A strong opponent of the sale of alcohol, McKenzie left the pastorate at University Baptist Church in 1943 to assume the leadership of the United Texas Drys--a position he held until his death. McKenzie died on 1952 June 13 in Dallas.
William R. White, the president of Baylor University, presided at his funeral. He is buried at Hillcrest Burial Park Cemetery in Waxahachie, Texas.</p>
