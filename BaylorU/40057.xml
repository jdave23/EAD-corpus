   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p> </p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters,
petitions, reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p> </p><p>The Keston Center received documents from 1928 through 1980 on the Tryasuny (Shakers) in the Soviet Union. However, the majority of
the content focuses on the overall history and founding of the group, so much focus is on the United States.</p><p> </p><p>The term Tryasuny within the context of the Soviet Union can indicate two things. As this word translates to “Shaker,” it can reference the traditional idea of a Shaker
although the word was also used in the Soviet Union as a somewhat derogatory term for Pentecostals who were expressive in worship. In the Tryasuny (Shaker) subject files, the majority of the content points to the concept of the Tryasuny as traditional Shaker, though it is possible that some
materials might reference other Pentecostal groups. The Shakers were formed in the mid 1700s in England under Jane and James Wardley. They have many similarities to the Quakers and hold millenarian restorationist beliefs.</p>
