   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>One of the most popular of United States patriotic songs, "America" or "My County Tis of Thee" was written by Samuel Francis Smith in the early 1800s.  This collection contains one of six copies handwritten by Smith existing in the world today.</p><p>Samuel Francis Smith was born on 1808
October 21 in Boston, Massachusetts.  He attended public school in Boston, and then attended Harvard University, graduating in 1829.  After Harvard, Smith attended Andover Theological Seminary (today Andover-Newton Theological School), and graduated from Andover in 1832.  This is about the time he
wrote "America."  Smith then served as editor of the American Baptist Magazine, Baptist pastor in Maine, professor at Waterville College (today Colby College), and Baptist pastor in Massachusetts.  Smith also served as secretary of the Baptist Missionary Union for 15 years.</p><p>Smith wrote many
hymns and poems, including "America," by far his most popular song.  Unfortunately, there are several different versions of how Smith wrote the song, and they do not always agree.  It seems he wrote the song quickly, within half an hour, after studying songs used in German public schools.  The song
was performed for the first time at a church on Park Street in Boston in 1831, for a celebration of American identity and freedom.  Since then, it has been one of the most well-loved patriotic songs of the United States.</p><p>In 1895, the last year of Smith's life, he presented a handwritten copy
of his most famous song to his friend A.F. Beddoe of Texas.  Beddoe donated his treasured copy of "America" to Baylor University in 1929.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Lyrics to "America" manuscript contains one document, the lyrics to "America."  The document was one of six written in 1832, when Smith composed the song.  However, Smith's autograph on the document includes the date 1895, the year of his death.  It is mentioned in other documentation that
Smith held onto the lyrics he wrote in 1832 until the 1890s, then gave them to friends and family.  Other documentation, including notarized documents certifying that the lyrics document is authentic, are available.</p>
