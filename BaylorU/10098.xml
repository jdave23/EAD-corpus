   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Eleanor McClerran was born on 1918 July 22 in Milam County, Texas to Casca Jackson and Irene Addison McLerren. She graduated from Baylor University in 1938 with a double major in Spanish and Journalism. Between graduating from Baylor in 1938 and enlisting in 1944, Eleanor was married and
divorced. Because of this, some of the official forms contained in the scrapbook are made out to “Eleanor M. Redmond.” In 1944, Eleanor McLerran enlisted in the WAC as a private.</p><p>The WAC was founded in place of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in October of 1943. During the
course of the war, over 150,000 women served in the WAC. Except for nurses, members of the WAC were the first women to serve within the ranks of the United States Army. Eleanor was stationed at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, the Santa Maria Army Air Base, and the Riverside Army Marching Base. She wrote
articles for various Army publications and subsequently kept clippings of many articles pertaining to the WAC. </p><p>After the war, Eleanor worked at the Disney Studios in Burbank, California and there she met her future husband, Charles DeLancey. The DeLanceys lived in Houston and were generous
supporters of Baylor University. Their most significant gift was the Charles J. and Eleanor McLerran DeLancey Endowed Chair at Truett Seminary. Eleanor died on 2004 November 3 after 55 years of marriage. Charles DeLancey died in 2011 April 4.</p>
