   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Jacqueline Presson was born in San Angelo, Texas, on 1922 March 3.  She moved to Southern California in the early 1940s to pursue her dream of acting.  She also married, but divorced after a number of years of marriage. After acting did not work out as a career, Presson transitioned to
writing.  She published her first novel, <emph render="italic">Spring Riot</emph>, in 1948. </p><p> </p><p>Presson remarried in 1955 to Broadway reader Lewis Allen with whom she had a daughter, Brook.  Due to a clerical error, Jacqueline began writing under the name Jay Presson Allen or simply Jay Allen.</p><p> </p><p>Allen
enjoyed Broadway and Hollywood success, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s.  She earned a reputation for adapting novels to screenplays including <emph render="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</emph>, <emph render="italic">Marnie</emph>, <emph render="italic">40 Carats</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Travels with My Aunt</emph>.  Her final screenplay, written in 1990, was a re-make of the literary
classic <emph render="italic">Lord of the Flies</emph>.</p><p> </p><p>Allen passed away in New York City on 2006 May 1.  She was 84 years old.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The collection is arranged into a single series, I. Literary Productions, and contains two screenplays written by Jacqueline Presson (Jay Presson Allen) in 1968 and 1972.  Both items are in good condition.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Based on the novel by Muriel Sparks, <emph render="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</emph> was one of Jay Presson Allen’s most successful screenplays.  It won acclaim in a variety of venues including the London theater (1966), Broadway (1968), and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Productions (1969). Esteemed actress
Maggie Smith won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Jean Brodie, a teacher at an all girls’ school in Edinburgh during the 1930’s.  The character runs into trouble when her idealistic views clash with the traditional curriculum supported by the school's administration.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p><emph render="italic">Travels with My Aunt</emph>, a 1972 film based on the novel by Graham Green, enjoyed far less success.  Actress Katherine Hepburn was initially part of the project, but she disliked Allen’s version of the screenplay.  Maggie Smith ultimately played the lead role of Augusta Bertram, an eccentric
woman who leads her nephew Henry Pulling on a number of comedic adventures.</p>
