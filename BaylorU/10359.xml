   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>In 1909, entrepreneurs and investors came together to establish the Waco, Belton, and Georgetown Railway Company.  These three towns were the county seats of McLennan, Bell, and Williamson Counties, respectively, and were all influential markets in the Central Texas cotton trade at the turn of
the century.</p><p>   </p><p>Backers of the newly chartered railway company sought to build a railroad that would connect Waco to Georgetown in the south with stops at Belton, Ritchie, Moody, Salado, Prairie Dale, and Corn Hill.  The railroad was designed to stretch an estimated seventy-five miles
with the intention of completely by-passing the town of Temple.  Proposals to use portions of the Cotton Belt Railroad to shorten the length of the new railroad were also entertained.</p><p>Engineer M.D. Parlin, under the mandate of the Steering Committee, presented the Waco, Belton, and Georgetown
Railway Company with estimates for construction.  Upon considering a number of factors, Parlin concluded that the railroad would cost approximately $14,250 per mile of track.  Efforts to raise the necessary $75,000 for start-up costs failed, however, and the railroad was subsequently abandoned.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The materials in the Waco, Belton, and Georgetown Railway Company collection range in chronology from 1909 to 1910 with some undated materials from that relative time period.  It was during these two years that the railway company conducted its initial survey of the line.</p>
   <p>Series I. Correspondence consists of letters related to the aforementioned survey.  Various correspondents, including Judge G.M. Felts and engineer M.D. Parlin, exchanged letters and reports discussing the logistical aspects of the railroad as well as data related to the towns involved.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Series II. Financial Documents contains a few undated, unidentified balance sheets listing the towns' proposed contributions to the railroad.  There are also rosters of some individuals who had been prepared to purchase stocks in the company.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Series III. Literary Productions, the largest series of the collection, is comprised of the company's articles of incorporation, clippings from the <emph render="italic">Waco Daily Times-Herald</emph>, and a rough, hand-drawn sketch of a map detailing the proposed routes and stops of the Waco, Belton, and Georgetown
Railroad.  The materials throughout this collection are in average to good condition.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to the current processing, this collection was housed in four folders and organized according to material type.  Staff members created an initial box listing when the materials were purchased in 1977.  The folders bore descriptions of their contents along with their corresponding date
ranges.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The Waco, Belton, and Georgetown Railway Company collection has been re-housed into seven folders based on material type.  The collection is now arranged in three series: I. Correspondence, II. Financial Documents, and III. Literary Productions.</p>
