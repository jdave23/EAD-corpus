   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Ralph Henry Durkee, the son of Milan Charles Durkee and Elizabeth Silverthorn, was born on 1888 October 8 in Ashtabula County, Ohio.  Ralph graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in Education in 1911.  Afterwards, he served as a teacher and administrator in a number of
Ohio schools.  With the outbreak of World War I, Durkee entered an Officer’s Training Camp at Fort Benjamin near Indianapolis.  </p><p> </p><p>Following the war, Durkee moved to San Antonio where he met Mary Carter whom he married in 1924.  Durkee retired from active military duty but continued
to serve in a civilian capacity throughout his lifetime.  He was the Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War, representing the state of Texas six times.  In 1935, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.  </p><p> </p><p>Colonel Ralph Durkee served as the commandant of the Army Specialized Training Unit
at Baylor University from 1943 to 1944.  Years later, in 1979, Durkee donated this collection of programs and rosters to The Texas Collection.  He passed away on 1981 February 1 and is buried in San Fernando Cemetery in San Antonio.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>This collection houses primary source materials relating to Baylor University’s involvement in the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program in World War II.  The materials, which are in good condition, are dated 1943-1944.  Colonel Ralph Durkee, the former commandant of Baylor's Army
contingent, donated the collection in 1979.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The United States government initiated the Army Specialized Training Program in 1943.  In an effort to develop educated and well-rounded military officers, the U.S. War Department worked in cooperation with colleges and universities across the nation to create an appropriate curriculum.  After
persistent negotiations by Baylor University President Pat Neff, Baylor was approved as a training site on 1943 April 1.  Students underwent rigorous training, both physically and intellectually.  The program ultimately ended in 1944, however, with the Allied invasion of Europe.  The military needed
all available men and women for the offensive.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Series I. Literary Productions, the only series in this collection, contains graduation programs and rosters for the Army Specialized Training Program Unit #3857 with headquarters at Baylor University.</p>
