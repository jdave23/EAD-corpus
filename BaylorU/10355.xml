   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The 1880’s brought about significant growth in Central Texas, particularly in Belton.  Initially settled in the years of the Texas Republic, Belton had become a regional hub for the trade of agricultural products, especially cotton. The arrival of the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railroad,
the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, and Baylor Female College (now the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor), further stimulated economic development.</p><p>In 1895, the Belton and Northeastern Railway Company was organized by a group of local businessmen, including President George C. Pendleton.  The
railroad was designed to connect Belton to McGregor in the north.  This twenty-eight mile track would open Belton’s markets up to the Cotton Belt Railway, formally designated the St. Louis Southwestern Railway.</p><p>The project was overcome by financial hardships from the start.  Estimates from
an engineer in Galveston, Texas, suggested the railroad would cost $18,398.33 per mile of track for a sum total of $514,153.39.  The company's failure to subscribe the $336,000 bond issue and the Cotton Belt Railway's inability to assist the endeavor financially resulted in the company's dissolution
by 1899.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Belton and Northeastern Railway Company records range in date from 1895 to 1898, almost spanning the entire duration of the company's existence.  Series I. Correspondence contains letters written between the company's President George C. Pendleton and Galveston engineer M.W. Wambaugh
concerning the preliminary survey and estimated costs of construction.  There are also letters between Pendleton and the Railroad Commission of Texas in regard to the company's application for the authority to issue bonds.</p>
   <p>Series II. Financial Documents is the largest series in the collection.  These materials consist of franchise tax receipts, a directory of stockholders, and pledge sheets.  The materials in this collection are in average condition.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to processing, this collection was organized into two folders according to material type: Correspondence and Financial / Legal Papers. Documents within these folders were arranged chronologically.  Staff  members created an inventory and basic description when the collection was initially
accessioned in 1977.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>The materials are now arranged into two series that reflect this original order: I. Correspondence and II. Financial Documents.  The aforementioned legal documents pertain to financial issues, so they have been placed in the second series.</p>
