   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Rosemyrtle McLaughlin worked in the Order and Traffic office of the General Tire and Rubber Company in Waco. It is not known when she began working there or how long she worked.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The Rosemyrtle McLaughlin General Tire and Rubber Company photographic collection includes three folders of administrative files and two folders of photographs from the Order and Traffic office of General Tire and Rubber Company. The collection materials show the operations of the plant,
mostly through employee directories, from 1957 until its close in 1985.  </p>
   <p>In total, there are 5 interior photographs of the plant, 1 aerial photograph and 4 unidentified photographs of unknown locations. Only three of the plant photographs are dated, of which two are identified. Identified individuals include Roger Knudson and David Neal; the aerial photograph
includes the notation ‘Taken Aug. or Sept. 1970 per Mr. Cape’ and ‘Received because of Fair Share contribution 1972’. The photographer and studio who produced these photographs are unknown but the photographs themselves are in excellent condition; there is some adhesive on the back but
there are no tears or other damage.</p>
   <p>The General Tire and Rubber Company opened in Waco in 1944 November as  the first major tire factory in the southwest. In 1946, members of the  Congress of Industrial Organization led a strike at the plant that  lasted at least 60 days; the strikers demanded higher wages to meet the  rising
cost of living after World War II. At its height, the plant  occupied a 2 million square-foot facility and employed over 1,500  workers. After several decades of successful business, the plant became  obsolete and tire production was phased out in 1986; layoffs lasted for  several years. The General
Tire headquarters in Akron, Ohio, eventually  closed as well and became a subsidiary of Continental General Tire,  based in Hannover, Germany. Over the years, the Waco plant building  retained the name General Tire, but was divided for use among various  companies, including Clarke Products and
Caterpillar Logistics. In 2010, Baylor  Research &amp; Innovation Collaboration renovated portions of the  General Tire building. It was then donated to Baylor University.</p>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351">
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Prior to current processing, all of the materials in the collection were in a three ring binder with no apparent order. There were no existing finding aids or inventories. As a result, administrative files and photographs were placed in folders with titles and dates reflecting their contents.</p>
