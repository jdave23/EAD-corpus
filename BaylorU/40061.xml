   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>Keston College, originally founded in 1969 as the Center for the Study of Religion and Communism with the named changed to Keston College in 1974, collected and publicized details about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain, becoming “the voice of the voiceless.” After the
collapse of communism in the 1990s, Keston College moved to Oxford and downsized due to decreased funding. The name eventually changed to Keston Institute. In 2007, the Institute transferred the Keston Archive and Library to the newly created Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society at
Baylor University.</p><p>Keston collected, verified, translated, and disseminated information received from believers in the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and other communist countries. The Keston Archive and Library housed numerous letters, petitions,
reports and underground publications (Samizdat) from believers of various denominations along with officially published books and periodicals.</p><p>The Keston Center collected documents on the Unification Church in the Soviet Union from 1986-1999 with the bulk of the content focused on 1990 and
1995-1999.</p><p>The Unification Church, commonly known as “Moonies,” began in 1954. However, its influence did not reach Soviet Union until the late 1980s. The first significant event for the Soviet Unification Church occurred in 1990, when its founder, Rev. Sun Myung Moon, spoke with
President Mikhail Gorbachev. Around that time, Rev. Moon sponsored trips for Soviet students to see America with the requirement that they attend Unification Church events while abroad. Therefore, the Unification Church became stronger during the time surrounding the fall of the Soviet Union. By the
middle of 1992, the Unification Church was a registered religion; and in 2000, they renewed their registration.</p>
