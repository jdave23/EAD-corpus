   <head>Biography/Profile</head>
   <p>The Belton-Temple Traction Company built one of the earliest interurban railways in Texas when it constructed a 13-mile line between the two towns in 1904-1905. Belton is the county seat of Bell County and by the 1880's was a regional hub for the cotton trade. Temple, founded in 1881 to serve
the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway, had quickly surpassed Belton in population and offered opportunities for increased economic growth. </p><p> </p><p> In 1918, the Belton-Temple Traction Company was reorganized as the Southwestern Traction Company with Albert Bentley as its president.
However, improved roadways and the rise of the automobile industry led to the gradual decline of the interurban railways in Texas. Although citizens of Belton were able to file a Writ of Injunction through the courts to stop the destruction of the Belton-Temple Interurban line in 1918, service was
ultimately terminated by the Southwestern Traction Company in 1926. By 1948, virtually all Texas interurban railways had ceased operations.</p>

   <head>Scope and Content</head>
   <p>The [Temple] Southwestern Traction Company collection contains material related to the issue of transportation in Bell County, particularly focusing on the interurban railway between Belton and Temple.  Series I. Correspondence is comprised of letters primarily dealing with the operation of
motor buses in Bell County.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Series II. Legal Documents, the largest series in the collection, chronicles the development of several lawsuits related to the Southwestern Traction Company.  The primary focus of the series revolves around a petition filed by citizens of Belton in 1918 to stop new owners of the interurban
from decommissioning and destroying the line.</p>
   <p> The materials in the collection range in chronology from 1918 to 1927 with some undated materials.  The documents are in poor to average condition and have been sleeved because of preservation concerns.</p>
