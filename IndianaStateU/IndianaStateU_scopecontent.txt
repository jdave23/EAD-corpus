<p>The IU society met monthly during the school year. At the meetings, they discussed developments in social science scholarship and had featured speakers on a social science topic. Speakers were sometimes IU faculty members, other times campus visitors. By the mid-1930s, meetings were more infrequent, and the minute book reports "No regular meetings were held during 1936-37 or 1937-38. Special meetings were held on call of the President to consider special emergency problems pertaining to the field of the Social Sciences." At their October 3, 1939 meeting, then-President Moffatt moved that meetings be held only upon call of the officers. This is the last entry in the minute book, although there are a few loose minutes dating from the 1939-1940 school year as well as a few items in the collection from later years, including a 1950 meeting announcement. However, due to a lack of minutes, the main activities of the society are not known after 1942. </p><p> The Correspondence series is arranged in chronological order and spans 1925-1942, but the bulk of the correspondence dates from 1925-1928. In the correspondence, there is quite a bit of discussion about the establishment of the group at Indiana University. The correspondence is not only between the members of the Indiana chapter but also between members of the national organization and chapters at other universities throughout the country.</p><p> The Administrative files series spans 1924-1950 and includes membership lists for both IU and other chapters throughout the state, reports, meeting announcements, constitutions, and financial records. The financial records primarily consist of notices and payments of dues and receipts for various expenditures. There is one item in the meeting announcements folder that dates to 1950, the only item in the collection dated that late.</p><p> The final series, Minutes, 1924-1940, includes 2 folders. The first folder holds a bound minute book that begins with the group's first meeting on December 10, 1924. The last entry in the book is from October 3, 1939. The loose minutes consist of some draft minutes, minutes of the national organization's December 31, 1924 meeting, and some loose minutes that had been tucked into the minute book.</p><p> Additional information about the group can be found in Herman B Wells' presidential files.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>These files were generated by various IU participants, but seem to be primarily those of the President's office. An inventory was made in 1994, and duplicate printed material was discarded, but no attempt was made to reorganize the material within the folders. During processing, working papers were unified, financial records combined, correspondence related to planning and organization was separated from invitations and correspondence with guests, and the records arranged in chronological order. The records are organized into one series, Administrative files. Each conference represents a sub-series. Within each sub-series, folders contain working papers, organizational correspondence, invitations and related correspondence, programs and packets, requisitions and vouchers, and publicity and news clippings, all in chronological order.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The John Lunstrum papers span the time period of 1959-1965 during which Dr. Lunstrum was both the coordinator for Social Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences and an Associate Professor of Education at Indiana University Bloomington. The collection is organized into six series: Correspondence, Clippings, Councils and committees, Proposals, Programs, and Syllabi. Three sub-series exist within the series of Councils and committees: State, National, and Indiana University. </p><p> The majority of Lunstrum's correspondence is arranged alphabetically by subject. However, four general correspondence files exist within the series and are alphabetized by either author or recipient. The arrangement in this series reflects the original organization of Dr. Lunstrum's correspondence. This series consists of correspondence between Dr. Lunstrum and his professional colleagues at Indiana University, with colleagues in the community and within national organizations, and with individuals he met through his professional endeavors. No distinction has been made between personal and professional correspondence; this is in accordance with Lunstrum's original filing system. </p><p> The Clippings series consists of one file and contains an editorial written by Hugh S. Ramsey in response to changes in the Indiana high school social studies curriculum. The file also contains a response to Mr. Ramsey written by graduate students of Dr. Lunstrum. </p><p> The Councils and committees series is arranged alphabetically and is comprised of records about Dr. Lunstrum's membership in and leadership of various councils and committees on a state, national, and university level. These three levels reflect the sub-series: State, National, and Indiana University. Within each sub-series, individual files exist for each council and committee and are arranged alphabetically. </p><p> The State sub-series consist of files for each organization Dr. Lunstrum was involved with in Bloomington, Indiana, and throughout the state. Files exist for the Bloomington Citizenship Council and the I.C.S.S. (Indiana Council for the Social Studies) newsletter. Dr. Lunstrum was a proponent for change in the social studies curriculum, and this is reflected by his activity in both of these organizations. These files are arranged alphabetically. </p><p> The National sub-series consist of files about the National Council for the Social Studies. Lunstrum was the chairman of the NCSS audio-visual committee from 1961-1962. The purpose of this committee was to study the use of educational and instructional television in the social studies curriculum. These files are arranged alphabetically. </p><p> The Indiana University sub-series consist of files regarding campus organizations and committees in which Lunstrum was involved. The university became involved with the Asia Society when Lunstrum spearheaded the summer institutes on Asia and the Soviet Union with support from the organization. These institutes focused on the importance of non-western cultures, specifically Asia and Russia. These files are arranged alphabetically. </p><p> The Proposals series consists of proposals made at the university level and are arranged alphabetically. Included are the Langan-Gehrels proposal so named for the professors who penned it, it required incoming students to pass certain standards in language and mathematics upon entering the College of Arts and Sciences. This proposal failed to pass. The Anthropology Institute proposal details the development of a summer institute for Junior and Senior high school teachers in the subject areas of biology and social studies in anthropology. Lunstrum was actively involved in facilitating and coordinating both of these proposals. </p><p> The Programs series consists of files regarding both university and non-university programs and are arranged alphabetically. Files exist for High School Day and the All-Campus Party. These were university programs that Dr. Lunstrum advised. Files exist for non-university programs such as the John Hay Fellows Program. Dr. Lunstrum was heavily influenced by this program in designing the Asia Summer Institute at Indiana University. </p><p> The series Syllabi consists of one file that contains a syllabus for a course on the History of the Federation of Malaya. The uses of this syllabus are unknown.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Indiana Religious Studies Project records date between 1976 and 1997 with the bulk of the records dating between 1978 and 1985. The records are organized into five series: Newsletters; Participants; Sample lesson plans; Subject files; and Cassette tapes.</p><p> The Newsletter series contains the newsletters that were published from Spring 1981 to Spring 1985. In all cases except 1985 (when the project ended), the newsletter was published biannually â€“ once in the Spring and once in the Fall. Each newsletter contains general information about the project, the current expectations and goals of the project, and discusses several current resources for teachers of religious studies. The newsletters are approximately four pages in length and have been arranged chronologically.</p><p> The Participants series, 1977-1981, contains applications, course projects, evaluations, and some pre- and post-project correspondence between the organizers of the program and the participant. It appears that the participants produced the course projects as part of their course workload. While the projects vary in length, most projects are lesson plans designed for classroom use and contain assignments, lecture information, handouts, exams, and photocopies of secondary texts (used to verify the information and/or serve as student readings). The evaluations that, in most cases, follow the course projects were written by ISRP instructors and provide commentary and positive and negative feedback regarding the participant's work. The series has been arranged alphabetically by the participant's surname, and files include application and pre-project correspondence, participant's course projects, evaluations, and post-project correspondence. In the application materials, social security numbers have been blacked out by the processor.</p><p> The Sample lesson plans, 1978-1985, appear to be revised versions of selected participant's original projects. In similar format to the participant's projects, the sample lesson plans contain classroom assignments, lecture information, handouts, exams, and photocopies of secondary texts. The original sample lesson plans are in layout form with articles, assignments, handouts, etc. having been cut apart and taped to pages in preparation for photocopying. In several instances, the photocopied version accompanies the original sample lesson plan. Folders in this series have been arranged per the original order; consequently for some years some participants have their own folders, while for other years no distinction is made between participants. The folders in this series have been arranged alphabetically, and materials within the folders are arranged chronologically.</p><p> The Subject files series, 1976-1997, contains a wide variety of information about the project, its origins, and its yearly activities. Of particular interest to understanding the development of the ISRP may be the cover letter and description (undated), along with the final reports (1978, 1985), and the grant proposals (1978, undated), that provide detailed descriptions about the purpose and progress of the project. These reports and descriptions were written by the acting director of the ISRP. Several files provide lists of participants and their contact information (participant data, participant lists, description and participant profile), while other files offer general information about the class schedules and course work of the secondary teachers during the project (curriculum unites, schedule of classes, and syllabus by track). Although the ISRP ended in 1985, the Indiana University's religious department continued to receive requests for sample lesson plans; these letters account for the majority of the general correspondence following 1985. The Subject files series have been arranged alphabetically by subject and chronologically within the folders.</p><p> It is unclear if the cassette tapes, 1978-1980, resulted from lectures by instructors during the project or were recorded elsewhere and used as teaching aids by the ISRP. The labels on each cassette have been recorded on the finding aid. The cassettes were in no discernable original order and are currently in no established order in box 4, though they are listed chronologically.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Inter-Institutional Study Committee's records range from 1941-1961 with the bulk of the material being dated 1949-1952. It is arranged into four series: Administrative files; Four State Schools Study Data; Four State Schools Physical Plant Study; and Bound reports. </p><p> The first series is Administrative files. It consists of correspondence, minutes, reports, and a few records of a sub-committee created to study the capitol needs of the institutions. The bulk of the correspondence is either to or from Joseph A. Franklin, but it also includes a number of letters between President Herman B Wells of Indiana University and President Frederick L. Hovde of Purdue University. The reports provide details about the individual goals of the committee and document the final budget formula. It spans the years 1941-1961.</p><p> The second series, Four State Schools Study Data, ranges from 1949-1953. This series contains budgetary information, studies done by the committee, forms, and miscellaneous material from three of the institutions. The bulk of the data pertains to Indiana University and Purdue University.</p><p> The Four State Schools Physical Plant Study is the next series. It is mostly comprised of the forms that the committee used in this study but also includes instructions to the institutions on how to fill out these forms correctly. The forms have been placed into separate files except for forms 4 and 6. These are kept together since they appeared that way in the original collection and seem to compliment each other. The collection originally contained ten or so blank copies of each form, but all but one of these copies were discarded. Materials in this series are mostly undated. Those dated range from 1951-1952.</p><p> The last series is Bound reports. It consists of five bound reports made by the committee in 1952, as well as a letter from Briscoe to Franklin. The letter is accompanied by a report which, consequently, seems to be a later draft of the preliminary report made by the committee. These bound reports are summaries of the committee's achievement. The reports cover each institution separately and then together showing the school's budgets for 1952 collectively and by department.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>Charles Hyneman donated seven cubic feet containing his correspondence to the University Archives in 1982. After his death in January, 1985, another seven cubic feet comprising material of various kinds arrived at the archives. The collection relates to Hyneman's work as a member of the Indiana University faculty, and also contains material reflecting Hyneman's work at other universities and with the federal government before his arrival in Bloomington. The collection comprises ten cubic feet of records and dates from the 1920's to his death in 1985 and the posthumous publication of his final book in 1994, with the great majority of material covering the years after 1942. </p><p> Prominent types of materials in the collection include: correspondence, draft manuscripts, typed lectures, memoranda, reports, clippings, three reel-to-reel tapes and a gradebook. </p><p> Biographical Materials: This series includes 17 folders and three reel-to-reel tapes, arranged topically. Materials encompass the years 1937- 84, including transcripts of oral interviews (3 folders, 1976-79), contracts from universities (4 folders, 1937-62), Indiana University Annual Reports (1956-71), and other folders relating to a bibliography of his writings, a proposed endowment in his name, and others of a lighter nature. </p><p> Publications, Manuscripts and Research Notes: There are 51 folders in this series, chronologically arranged from his 1930's research notes to his handwritten musings on the sanctity of life. In addition to several articles are draft manuscripts of longer-term research products. Among these are manuscripts relating to the unpublished Government and Politics in the United States (6 folders), the unpublished book with Hubert H. Humphrey (23 folders), and drafts of what was published posthumously as The American Founding Experience (7 folders). </p><p> Public Lectures and Teaching Materials: The 36 folders and gradebook in this series date from 1935 to 1980, documenting a lifetime of talks given at conferences and universities across the country. The subjects of the talks range from the theory and practice of democratic government to the politics of race and protest to the concepts of the Founding Fathers. These have been filed chronologically, along with the materials relating to teaching (Teaching--Handouts and Notes-- 1935-69, Hyneman Circulars Regarding the Teaching of Political Science--1952-54, and the Gradebook, 1947-55.) Also related to teaching is the unpublished Government and Politics in the United States in Series 2, which grew out of his teaching at Northwestern University. There are no regular class lectures. </p><p> Government War Work: This series documents Dr. Hyneman's work in three government positions during the American years in World War II. Included within these 14 folders dating from 1942 to 1949 are materials from the Bureau of the Budget (2 folders), the Training Branch of the War Department (2 folders), and his work with the Federal Communications Commission (9 folders). </p><p> General Correspondence: The 201 folders included here were carefully kept by Dr. Hyneman, and comprise over half of the collection. Personal and professional correspondence is largely indistinguishable here, as the professor's professional colleagues and former students were frequently his closest friends. Material here are filed alphabetically, with organizations interfiled with individual names. More information regarding his publications may be found here, with critical correspondence of his work filed under the name of the press or under a book title. Correspondents include: William F. Buckley, Jr., Hubert H. Humphrey, Sander Vanocur, and Herman Wells.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The papers of Kate Hevner Mueller comprise 12 cubic feet and cover a span of time from her young childhood until just a few years before her death in 1984. Kate Mueller was very meticulous, she kept virtually all her correspondence and research notes, much of which is annotated to explain its importance and relevance. Most of the collection is from the 1950s and 1960s, but a great deal also exists from her childhood and college days. The papers are organized into the following series:</p><p> Biographical and Personal Material: This series is subdivided into three subseries: Clippings- Newspaper and Magazine Clippings about KHM; Childhood and Student Papers, Stories, Report Cards, and Yearbooks- Stories and poems written by KHM as a child, report cards from grade school through college, class notes from high school and college, high school and college yearbooks, which feature school pictures and articles written by KHM; General Biographical and Personal Files- Awards, financial documents, biographies, reviews of her books, her wedding announcement, contracts, college commencement announcements, resume, etc.</p><p> Memoirs and Journals: Kate Mueller began writing her memoirs, both of her private life and her professional life. Some errors exist in the manuscripts, however. Some of the dates are off by five years, and some of the order of things is a bit skewed. The journals date mainly from KHM's early teenage years through college and a brief diary (mainly of appointments and activities) from 1981.</p><p> Correspondence: Easily the largest series. Most of the letters are from the 1950s-1960s, but is fairly weighty for the other years as well. This series is separated into three categories: Correspondence with John Mueller- When they met, he lived in Oregon and she lived in Minnesota, so letters passed between them daily for a few years before they were married in 1935. Subject- These are letters which were better classified by subject rather than by correspondent because many times KHM only wrote to an individual once or at most a couple of times, or she wrote to many people about the same thing. General- This is organized in alphabetical order with the correspondent. For the most part, these people carried on a significant correspondence with KHM or it lasted over many years. Explanatory details are included on the folder and below to further identify the correspondents and the contents.</p><p> Research Notes: This is split into two subseries: Twenty-Seven Major American Symphony Orchestras: a history and analysis of their repertoires, seasons 1842-1843 through 1969-1970 - this is the book that Kate Mueller finished in 1973. Her notes for the book are numerous enough to warrant this separate subseries. The folders do not really have a consistent or adequate labeling system, but rather than take the chance on misrepresenting the contents, the original names have been retained, but have been organized into headings such as CHARTS and NATIONALITIES below to give some organization to the multiplicity of naming methods. General Research Notes- These are all her other notes which do not pertain to the book or to class work. These folders are organized alphabetically by subject.</p><p> Teaching/Class notes: Kate Hevner Mueller kept a great deal of her class materials. They are organized into these subseries: Subject- These are notes taken or collected by KHM for use in her classes. Classes- This subseries is organized by the names/numbers of the individual classes that KHM taught and contains the materials she used for that particular class, including syllabi, assignments, and final examinations. Student Work- These folders contain work submitted by students of KHM, some dated, some undated.</p><p> Professional Organizations: Kate Mueller was involved with many organizations and because of her expertise in many disciplines, she was used professionally a great deal. The material found in this series has to do with her professional activities both within groups and as an individual scholar.</p><p> Writings: This is subcategorized into the following subseries: Speeches/Radio Addresses- typescripts of speeches, outlines, and transcripts for public speaking. Reviews- Kate Mueller reviewed many books and articles in both Psychology and Guidance and Counselling. Also included are reviews about works written by Mueller. Published Works- These are articles, monographs, and drafts for books. Included are both edited drafts and final copies, in addition to the publication themselves in some cases. Other writings and books- This contains unidentified writings by KHM, or otherwise unclassified drafts. Also contained here are the editions of books she either wrote or contributed to in some way. Not all the books she wrote are included here.</p><p> Miscellaneous materials: These materials were added to the collection after it had been processed and can all be found in Box 12. It primarily consists of record albums used in Kate and John's research. Also included are microfilm of sheet music and data taken during their research.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The papers of David Andrew Rothrock comprise 2.4 cubic feet. The collection is organized into four series: Publications, Teaching and Research Materials, Student Materials, and Correspondence. </p><p> The Publications series consists of manuscripts of published materials and sometimes copies of the publications. They are organized in 7 subseries: (1) Algebra Manuscript and Notes on Functions, (2) Concerning Differential Invariants and Conjugate Functions, (3) Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, (4) Essentials of Algebra, (5) Essentials of High School Mathematics, (6) Invariants of the Finite Continuous Groups of the Plane, and (7) Solid Geometry. Items in the subseries are arranged according to the original processing arrangement. It is not clear what "Algebra Manuscript and Notes on Functions" is a draft of; however, the materials appear to have been received together under that designation and the arrangement appears to maintain the original. "Concerning Differential Invariants" and "Conjugate Functions" are separate items that were published together. "Essentials of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry" may be a revision since some of the handwritten manuscript pages contain printed clippings. There are both a handwritten and typewritten manuscript as well as a file of figures and one that appears to be lesson plans for a one hour credit course. "Invariants of the Finite Continuous Groups of the Plane" was published in 1899. Rothrock's dissertation had the same title; however, the publication varies from the dissertation. </p><p> The Teaching and Research Materials series consists of three subseries: General, Teaching Materials, and Exercises. All of the items in the General subseries are undated and thus it is not clear whether items were teaching and research materials from when he was a student or faculty. A few items appear to be copies of the work of others. Materials in the General subseries are arranged alphabetically by title. The Teaching Materials subseries are dated material and can be identified as related to Rothrock's teaching. Items are arranged by date. The Exercises subseries contain undated mathematical exercises or computations that have little or no text. Materials in this subseries are arranged by title. </p><p> The Student Series contains materials that can be identified, by date, from his studies at the University of Chicago and the University of Leipzig. Three of the items are notebooks on Sophus Lie's (1842-1899) theories of continuous groups and differential equations. It is not clear whether these notebooks are a copy of a publication by Lie or whether they contain lecture notes. A fourth notebook contains lectures by Professor H. Maschke. Also in this subseries is Rothrock's 1898 dissertation. </p><p> The Correspondence series consists of one item, a letter to the Monroe County Board of Commissioners regarding a "view out and survey" of a pike road in Bean Blossom Township. A blank page at the end has this title on the verso: Viewers Report on Wayport and Mt. Tabor Pike Road. A date in the letter suggests it was written in 1906.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The majority of this collection is comprised of the Indiana University-Bloomington Professional Staff Council Business meeting minutes (the bulk falling in-between the years 1993 and 1997) as well as information concerning the many committees, task forces, and university organizations that effected the daily operations and policies of the Professional Staff Council. The collection also contains an Administration series with sub-series concerning the Professional Staff Council's President, &amp; Vice-President; a Membership series comprised of membership lists and election information; and a Committees/Task Forces/University Organizations series with a sub-series containing meeting(s) information and minutes of the separate committees, task forces, and university organizations. Besides bearing the official title of the Indiana University-Bloomington Professional Staff Council some people refer to this professional organization as the Bloomington Professional Staff Council, the Bloomington Professional Council (most common throughout the collection), the Professional Council, or, in very informal instances, just as "the Council". </p><p> The Administration series contains documents regarding the bodies that govern the actions and policies of the Professional Staff Council. The IU Board of Trustees as well as individuals such as university Chancellor and Vice-President for academic affairs Kenneth R. R. Gros Louis and university President Myles Brand are represented here. Also in this series are the many university policies and financial summaries/budgets that have had effect on the university's professional employees. Three documents within the Administration series (IUB Staff Council &amp; IU Professional Staff Association Bylaws; IUBPSC Constitution; &amp; the Constitution of the Bloomington faculty) are closely related in that they have evolved and been amended in response to professional employee related issues since the formation of the Professional Staff Council with each file containing drafts and variations of the separate documents. In many cases the Bylaws, Constitution, and Resolutions of the Professional Staff Council are also contained in the IUBPSC Meetings &amp; Minutes series as well as certain committee(s) minutes by their corresponding year. The many drafts of the IUBPSC Constitution also contain variations of the committee's bylaws. The Vice-President and President sub-series contain individual correspondence and reports of both officers. In most cases the reports and significant pieces of correspondence by the Professional Staff Council's Vice-President and President are also contained in the corresponding IUBPSC Meetings &amp; Minutes. </p><p> The Committees/Task Forces/University Organizations series contains individual correspondence, committee reports, and other documents related to the issues for which each body is responsible. There are also many ad hoc committees, task forces, and study groups of brief existence depending upon the resolution, or lack thereof, of whatever university policy or action happened to concern the university's professional employees. There are committees of the Professional Staff Council that were created in the early years of the Council's existence and are still active today, such as the Communications, Salary &amp; Benefits, Nominations &amp; Elections, and other committees. In some cases, the committees and task forces represented in this series were actually created by the Bloomington Faculty Council with professional employees serving as active members amongst university faculty in these groups. This series also contains a sub-series titled Committee Meetings &amp; Minutes which includes the minutes of the IUB Professional Staff Council Business meeting as well as the minutes of separate committees, task forces, and university organizations. Often included in the IUB Professional Staff Council's minutes are the monthly and year end reports of the separate committees within the Council as well as reports by the Council's Vice-President and President. Over the course of the Council's existence there have been many individuals serving as the Council's Secretary who were responsible for compiling the minutes of the meetings. </p><p> The Membership series is comprised of lists of the university's Professional Staff Association and members of the Professional Staff Council as well as the Council's election related information. The membership lists cover the fluctuating professional staff population over the course of the Council's existence as both general listings and lists by electoral units/districts. The documents concerning election information are mainly election results, letters of nomination, ballots, biographical statements of the individuals nominated to the Professional Staff Council, and statements made by the individuals elected to various positions.</p> </scopecontent>

Both of these conferences were called by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as honorary chairman; the first drew nearly 2000 people from many walks of life all over the country, and the second some 7000 participants. The 1960 Conference on Children and Youth was the sixth such conference and celebrated the golden anniversary of the first, which had been called by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. The collection includes programs, newspaper clippings, reports, notes and drafts of observations by Mrs. Smith, and other materials related to the conferences, arranged by activities that took place before, during, and after the conferences, with separate publicity folders for clippings from news media covering the conferences. Note that the 1955 conference also included a preparatory state conference, the material for which is included in its own folder. Also included in the collection is a pamphlet written by Johnnie Rutland Smith in 1974. This is a history of the Hoosier Salon, an annual exhibition of work by Indiana artists, written to commemorate its fiftieth anniversary.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection is organized into two series: Correspondence and Memorabilia. The Correspondence series is further organized into three sub-series: Myron E. Greene to Lovilla Greene, Lovilla Greene to Myron E. Greene, and Family &amp; friends. The Myron E. Greene to Lovilla Greene sub-series spans the years 1933-1944 and comprises the majority of the letters in the collection. Nearly all the letters are handwritten though a portion of them were transferred to V-Mail format by the military (V-Mail was the government's answer to bulky mail â€“ rather than send 18,000 letters overseas, they would microfilm the soldier's letters and send one 16 mm reel. When they arrived in the United States, they were printed and sent on to the addressee.) While Myron served in the military as a dentist, he wrote to his wife almost daily, sometimes even finding time to write two or three letters in one day. In the letters, Myron discusses his military life as a dentist-the number of patients he saw on a given day, the number of teeth he extracted, the places he visited while on leave, the people he encountered, the weather, and the food he consumed. Nearly all letters express some amount of homesickness, and he continually reassures Lovilla of his love for her. The letters vary in length, anywhere from one page to fifteen pages; the letters are arranged chronologically.</p><p> The next sub-series, Lovilla Greene to Myron E. Greene, 1942-1943, consists of the daily letters that Lovilla wrote to her husband in his absence. Her letters describe family matters, local gossip, and situations she encountered while working in a munitions factory and coping with Myron's absence at home. In nearly every letter, she expresses her loneliness and love for Myron, optimistically counting down the days when the war will end and they will be back together again. Like Myron's letters to her, Lovilla's letters vary in length from a single page to ten pages; the letters are arranged chronologically.</p><p> The Family and friends sub-series, 1942-1944, includes letters from a variety of individuals who wrote to Myron or Lovilla. The letters primarily discuss family or local matters. Additionally, a couple of Myron's friends from the Army also wrote to Lovilla. A small set of greeting cards and sympathy cards (for an unidentified person) complete this sub-series. The sub-series is arranged alphabetically by correspondent. Abbreviations used: LG - Louvilla Greene; MEG - Myron Eugene Greene.</p><p> The Memorabilia series, 1942-1991, consists of a small sample of materials that Myron collected during his military service. These items include a small Italian Royal flag, a couple of newspaper clippings, a dinner invitation, a booklet on military insignias and decorations, and a horse racing brochure. Also found in this series is a 1991 VHS tape entitled "A World War II Odyssey of an Indiana Dentist," narrated by Greene and includes his personal movie footage and photographs from World War II.</p><p> Within the folder list, oversized materials have been listed where they would fall intellectually within the collection; physically all oversize items have been placed in Box 1.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection is arranged into seven series: Correspondence; Committees and organizations; ARO (Army Research Office) files; NSF (National Science Foundation) files; Writings; Conferences; and Reviews and evaluations. The Correspondence series is further organized into External mail, Internal mail and General mail.</p><p> The Correspondence series contains records from the years 1955-2000. Following Dr. Newton's original arrangement, the series is further organized into three subseries. The first subseries is Internal correspondence, 1969-2000. This subseries consists of Prof. Newton's with Indiana University administrators and colleagues, such as IU President Herman B Wells and Newton's colleagues in the physics department. The next subseries, External correspondence, 1969-1999, consists of correspondence with persons outside IU. Many of the letters are from former students and colleagues who are writing either for letters of recommendation or to ask questions about methods or theories relating to physics. The last subseries within the Correspondence series is General correspondence, 1955-1979. The letters found in this series are more personal in nature or are of a general nature, such as departmental memos. This series is arranged chronologically and closely follows Newton's original organization. He had all of the files organized by fiscal year, but as some were quite large, they were broken down by month in order to make the files more manageable for researchers.</p><p> The next series in the collection is entitled Committees and organizations, 1975-2003, and is arranged alphabetically by folder title. The committee folders contain correspondence between committee members, memos, and minutes of some of the meetings. The folders for the organizations contain much of the same materials, although some also contain pamphlets or business cards. Newton's records pertaining to the Indiana University Institute of Advanced Study are a prominent part of this series. Two folders in this series, "Committee to review dean of music school (Charles Webb)" and "Tenure committee," are restricted and not available for use by researchers at this time.</p><p> The third series in the Newton collection spans 1965-1975 and is the ARO (Army Research Office) files. This series includes paperwork for grants that Newton received from the Army Research Office on projects focusing on inverse scattering problems, phase transitions and critical points, lattice non-uniformities and localized magnetic moments in solids, and irreversible phenomena. Also found in the files are reports from Newton to the Army Research Office explaining his progress or any problems that he may have encountered while implementing these projects.</p><p> Records for Newton's NSF (National Science Foundation) projects make up the next series. Spanning 1968-1992, these projects focus projects related to elementary particle interactions, particle collisions, and the complex Regge Trajectory. The series includes correspondence between Newton, his colleagues, and the NSF, as well as project proposals and outlines. Detailed account statements were pulled and shredded.</p><p> The fifth series is entitled Writings, 1960-1992. The writings include works by Newton as well as articles written by his colleagues. This series also includes proofs of two of Newton's books, The <emph render="italic">Truth of Science</emph> and <emph render="italic">What Makes Nature Tick</emph>, complete with illustrations, notes, and corrections. </p><p> The next series is Conferences and consists of schedules, flyers, and pamphlets that Newton received from the various conferences that he attended during his career. Several folders in this series are labeled according to the name of the conference, but the bulk of the folders are simply labeled by year. It spans the years 1975-1987.</p><p> The last series in the collection is Reviews and evaluations. It is organized alphabetically by folder title and contains reviews of individuals, departments and programs both within and outside of Indiana University. At this time, this series is restricted and cannot be used by researchers.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of papers written by students at the Folklore Institute at Indiana University, Bloomington mostly from the <date normal="1960/1980" certainty="approximate" type="inclusive">1960s through the early 1980s</date> The files are arranged in numerical order (which was originally assigned by the Folklore Archive at the time of accessioning), which is also roughly chronological order. Accompanying materials such as cassette tapes are housed separately.</p><p>There are a number of different subjects represented including, but not limited to, architecture, craft, tombstones &amp; epitaphs, quilting, furniture, instrument making, family traditions and recipes, fashion, and food ways. Many of these papers consist of interviews with artisans and craftsmen, family members, or owners of the locations being researched. One such paper includes an account by the owner of a house near Elizabethtown Indiana which was part of the Underground Railroad used by escaped enslaved people going north to Canada during the Civil War. For those interested in more religious studies, there is a paper on food and religious practices of the Russian Orthodox Church during the week of Easter. There are also a fair number of papers written on local tombstones and instrument makers. Apple doll making and water witching seem to have been popular subjects in the sixties and seventies.</p><p> A number of the locations and craftsmen discussed are local or in close proximity to Bloomington, including a paper on the Rose Well House which is a popular fixture of legend in IU campus lore.</p><p> Most papers include samples or photographs related to the paper's subject. One paper written on coalmining in Sullivan County Indiana has a particularly interesting set of photos of coal miners and the coal mining complex. Other papers contain clippings from magazines, maps, quilt square samples, illustrations, and similar objects -- one paper written on the Kennedy family, builders of covered bridges in Indiana, has a beautiful set of covered bridge illustrations and diagrams.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The bulk of the collection consists of two bound volumes of letters from Helen D. Hopkins to her family, beginning shortly before her entrance as a freshman to Indiana University and end at the time of her commencement in 1918. During this period, Helen wrote home multiple times a week predominately to her mother Clara, but occasionally also her brother Bob (Robert O. Hopkins). Note that sections of the correspondence were bound out of order.</p><p> Early letters report on joining to the Pi Beta Phi (the Pi Phi's as she calls the sorority) and being in the library during freshman-sophomore scraps when the men were called outside and their hair forcibly cut. What we would describe as a modern-day foodie, in nearly every letter Helen reports on her meals (she seemed to have a particular fondness for potatoes and desserts), and vehemently thanks her mother for her weekly care packages of candies, cookies, bread, and wieners from home. In others she describes the contents of her friend's packages from home, including one which included "a whole fried chicken and a fruit cake." Other letters mention campus serenades, attending athletics events and dances, joining the Women's League and YWCA, late night visits to the Book Nook for wieners and burgers to hear Hoagie Carmichael play, hiking to Arbutus hill, going to the Gentry Brothers Circus, student pranks such as the night she came home to a bed filled with salt, as well as campus issues such as coal shortages, and the bad taste of the drinking water. In April 1917, she also shares the details of an incident involving a student of Russian descent (Mr. Edler) who "when he was four years old, the Russian government killed his father and mother, and ever since them he has been against the government. The authorities here found his room which he had always kept locked; and found there all sorts of different mechanisms that they think he was trying to make infernal machines of. He says he was only experimenting on watchesâ€¦.I don't know where they've sent him, but he's left here."</p><p> An exceptional student, Helen writes extensively about her studies in Latin and Greek as well as her relationships with members of the faculty such as Lillian Gay Berry (Latin), Will Hale (English), and Cora Hennel (Mathematics). She also acknowledges her election to the honorary society Phi Beta Kappa as one of two female students along with Lorena Degner.</p><p> On a national level she discusses the 1916 presidential election and in the lead up to World War I she discusses military training on campus. On March 7, 1917, she describes a campus-wide meeting of all the students and faculty where "it was voted to send a telegram to [President] Wilson expressing the faith of the Indiana students in him and the promise of loyalty to the countryâ€¦. President Bryan gave most wonderful talk, and several others of the faculty spoke." Following the official declaration of war, she reports on her volunteer work with the Red Cross knitting sweaters for soldiers overseas, female students hastily marrying before their boyfriends enlisted, the dwindling numbers of male students on campus, and the back to the farm movement, which allowed students from farming families to return home to help with the crops while still earning course credit. She also alludes to the fact that Theodore Roosevelt would be their wartime commencement speaker.</p><p> The remainder of the collection consists of the few items that were tucked into the pages of the bound volumes of correspondence, biographical clippings, a photograph of Helen at the age of 90, her commencement program, and a few cards from her grandchildren from the 1990s.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>This collection consists of one series of newsletters dating between 1980-1984. Articles in the newsletter cover recent and upcoming events, activism, and other news of interest. There is also a significant component of personal expression, as issues often contained poetry, editorials, art, and cartoons, and stories from the community. Reflecting that community, topics were sometimes more focused on activism, such as announcements of the annual Gay Awareness Conference, or protest events. At other times they were more focused on spiritual life, such as prayers that were published. Other times these concerns were combined, such as in editorials or poems that discuss the opinions and experiences of individuals trying to reconcile their faith and their sexual or gender orientation.</p> </scopecontent>
