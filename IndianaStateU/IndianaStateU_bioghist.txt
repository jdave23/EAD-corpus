<p>On December 31, 1924, representatives from 14 universities met in Chicago to discuss the establishment of a new social science honorary society. At that meeting, they approved the following resolutions:</p> <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
<item>A national organisation should be adopted.</item>
<item>Alpha Pi Zeta is a very fitting name for the organisation.</item>
<item>This organisation shall have the character of an honorary society.</item>
<item>It shall encourage investigation and scholarship in the field of the social sciences.</item>
<item>The local societies should exercise a large degree of autonomy as to the methods of work and details of organisation.</item>
<item>Until the question of uniform membership is decided by national action of the society, the matter of the determination of full, associate, honorary and permanent membership shall be left to the chapters according to their separate problems and situations.</item>
</list>
<p>The name Alpha Pi Zeta derives from the initials of Aristotle's characterization of man, "anthropos politikon zoon." The purpose of the society was to encourage the investigation and scholarship in the social sciences. Chapters could be established at any educational institution that offered a "considerable amount" of advanced graduate work in the social sciences. Active membership was open to professors, instructors, or staff members of the institution who had shown achievement in social sciences as well as graduate students who had shown "initiative, independence and ability to carry on sustained investigation in one of these sciences." </p><p> The IU society met monthly during the school year. At the meetings, they discussed developments in social science scholarship and had featured speakers on a social science topic. Speakers were sometimes IU faculty members, other times campus visitors. By the mid-1930s, meetings were more infrequent, and the minute book reports "No regular meetings were held during 1936-37 or 1937-38. Special meetings were held on call of the President to consider special emergency problems pertaining to the field of the Social Sciences." At their October 3, 1939 meeting, then-President Moffatt moved that meetings be held only upon call of the officers. This is the last entry in the minute book, although there are a few loose minutes dating from the 1939-1940 school year as well as a few items in the collection from later years, including a 1950 meeting announcement. However, due to a lack of minutes, the main activities of the society are not known after 1942.</p> </bioghist>

<p>This series of conferences was held annually at IU from 1950 through 1956. It was organized by a committee under the general direction of the office of President Herman B Wells in co-operation with the US Department of State, and with funding from the Lilly Endowment. The primary organizational work was done by Peter Fraenkel of the President's office and Austin V. Clifford of the Law School. Others who were active in organizing the conferences included Edward Buehrig, Department of Government; Frank Lee Benns, Department of History; and John T. Hays, of Hays &amp; Hays Law Firm.</p><p> The conferences sought to bring State Department officials together with academic and civic leaders from the Midwest for frank discussions of current foreign policy problems. In this they were successful. However, recognizing that they were not moving beyond discussions of current events to the deeper issues of the nature and purpose of foreign policy per se, the committee determined to end the conference in its current form in the spring of 1957. Planning for a renewed conference continued into 1960, but none was held.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Established in 1977 in response to the Supreme Court decision (<emph render="italic">Abington School District v. Schempp &amp; Murray v. Curlett</emph>, 1963) that prohibited the practice of religion in public schools though encouraged the continual teaching about religion, the Indiana Religious Studies Project sought to improve how religion was presented to high school students. The goal of the program was to further educate and train secondary teachers so they would have a better knowledge of religious studies and possess other resources, such as lesson plans and curriculum ideas, to use when teaching their students about various religions.</p><p> Each year, the Project brought together approximately 18 secondary school teachers from Indiana public schools to Indiana University for a six-week training seminar (following the 1979 program, the project was shortened to three- and four-weeks). During these sessions, the teachers attended classes and lectures taught by faculty from the Department of Religious Studies at Indiana University and Wabash College. The participants also prepared presentations and lesson plans that focused on a variety of areas of study such as world religions, religious theory, and religious texts.</p><p> The Project gained funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Lilly Foundation and flourished for nearly seven years. In 1984, the Project lost funding, and it officially ended in July of that year, though it would publish its newsletter until 1985.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Office of Military Information was created 1 July 1942 at Indiana University to advise students, parents, faculty members, and the general public about war service opportunities and regulations. Indiana University hosted several programs during World War II to prepare young men and women for military and civil service. Several of these programs placed students on inactive duty in the military until the completion of the program, at which time they were placed on active duty. </p><p> United States Naval Training School (June 1942 - May 1944) prepared men and women for service in the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Marine Corps. Two specialized Naval training programs offered additional training. The V- 12 unit furnished training for medical and dental students. The V-7 program, open to juniors and seniors, required two semesters of mathematics and one course in plane trigonometry.</p><p> Other programs included the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps (ERC) which accepted men between 18 and 45 years of age. Requirements for the ERC consisted of passing the officers' candidate physical exam and being a United States citizen who had not received a bachelors' degree.

Rosa Smith was born on October 7, 1858 to Lucretia and Charles Kendall Smith in Monmouth, Illinois. The family moved to San Diego, California in 1876. She completed her secondary education at the Point Loma Seminary in San Diego and also attended a five-week course at a business college in San Francisco. Smith had a lifelong interest in natural history and became the first woman to be a full member of the San Diego Society of Natural History. In 1879, she met David Starr Jordan, a professor of natural history at Indiana University, who invited her to study at IU. Smith studied at IU for two years and spent the summer of 1880 touring Europe with Professor Jordan and other students and faculty from IU. Family obligations caused Smith to return to San Diego in 1882 before completing her undergraduate degree.
</p>
<p>
After returning to San Diego, Smith continued her studies of fish including the blind goby fish she discovered. She published several articles that provided formal descriptions of various species of fish. Smith also worked as a journalist and as a secretary and librarian for the San Diego Society of Natural History. While at IU, she met Carl Eigenmann who was working on his Ph.D. The two continued to correspond after she returned to San Diego, and they were married at Smith's home on August 20, 1887. The Eigenmanns often collaborated with each other on their scientific research and published numerous articles together. After their marriage, they went to Harvard University where they studied the Agassiz collections of fish. Smith was also granted special student status at Harvard to study cryptogamic botany from 1887-1888. In 1889, the Eigenmanns returned to California where they established a biological station and continued their studies of fish in the region. They also held appointments as curators at the California Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the Eigenmanns spent considerable time in South America studying and collecting freshwater fish.
</p>
<p>
In 1891, the Eigenmanns returned to Bloomington, Indiana when Carl was appointed Professor of Zoology at Indiana University. Carl was later named chair of the Department of Zoology and the first Dean of the Graduate School. The Eigenmanns had five children: Lucretia Margaretha Eigenmann, Charlotte Elizabeth Eigenmann, Theodore Smith Eigenmann, Adele Rosa Eigenmann, and Thora Marie Eigenmann. Family responsibilities prevented Rosa from continuing her own research, but she worked as an editor for her husband's papers. In 1926, the Eigenmanns left Indiana and returned to San Diego. Carl Eigenmann died on April 24, 1927. Rosa continued to live in the San Diego area until her death on January 12, 1947 of chronic myocarditis after a series of difficult eye operations.
</p>
<p>
Rosa Smith Eigenmann was one of the first women ichthyologists. Eigenmann authored twelve papers on her own and co-authored twenty-five articles with her husband. The Eigenmanns have been credited with the identification of 35 new genera of fish and descriptions of almost 150 species of fish. Additionally, Rosa Smith Eigenmann is believed to be the first woman allowed to attend graduate-level classes at Harvard University, the first woman president of IU's Sigma Xi (an honorary science society) chapter, and the first woman to determine a new species of fish.

<p>The Faculty Seminar on Political and Administrative Development was established by the Department of Government, now the Department of Political Science, in 1962. Supported by a $105,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation, it quickly became known simply as the Carnegie Seminar. Professor Fred W. Riggs was the Seminar's first director, assuming the post when the initial grant was awarded in February 1962. William Siffin was also involved as a co-coordinator of the Seminar, and assumed the directorship while Riggs was on leave from September 1962 to June 1963 and following Riggs' departure from Indiana University. </p><p> The Carnegie Seminar brought together faculty and advanced graduate students at IU, as well as supporting the visits of faculty from other institutions. Funds from the Seminar's grant provided financial support which allowed faculty members to conduct research related to the Seminar's theme. Broadly stated, the Carnegie Seminar had three goals: to support studies in the field of political and administrative development using the resources and interests of Government Department faculty; to integrate diverse research by encouraging the development of basic theory; and to stimulate the flow of information between participants and scholars from other disciplines and institutions. Although funds from the Carnegie grant were exhausted in 1967, the "Carnegie Seminar" name continued to be used by the department for a number of years.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Kate Hevner Mueller was born Kate Lucile Hevner on November 1, 1898 in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania. Her father was a minister and also worked for the YMCA, while her mother was a schoolteacher. She was a middle child, her sister, Edith Dell was older and her brother, George was younger. Upon graduating from Williamsport (Pennsylvania) High School in 1916, she attended Wilson College, in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. At Wilson, her major was English, but a Psychology class sparked her interest in that discipline. After teaching mathematics at a high school for two years, she moved to New York to attend Columbia University, this time majoring in Psychology. The work of psychologist L.L. Thurstone at the University of Chicago inspired Kate Hevner to apply for a fellowship at that school to work under his direction towards a doctoral degree. Thurstone accepted her, and in 1928, she earned her doctoral degree in Psychology, with her thesis entitled, <title render="italic">An Empirical Study of Three Psychophysical Methods.</title> Coincidentally, John Mueller, her future husband, also earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1928 (in Sociology), but the two did not meet until 3 years later.</p><p> Upon earning her doctorate, Kate Hevner accepted a position at the University of Minnesota teaching Psychology. Not only did she teach introductory courses in Psychology, but also more advanced courses in Aesthetics, a special interest of hers which would lead the University of Oregon to "borrow" her to further develop her research in the study of the Aesthetics of Art. While working in Oregon in 1931, Kate Hevner first met John Mueller, who also had an interest in Aesthetics and Art. Letters began passing between the two, with greater and greater frequency, until they were married in 1935. Immediately after the wedding, the couple moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where John Mueller had accepted an associate professorship in Sociology.</p><p> Kate Mueller taught part-time at the IU extension campus in Indianapolis until she accepted the position of Dean of Women at IU in 1938, a position she held for ten years. Even though her work in Psychology and her collaboration in the study of the Aesthetics of art with her husband continued, her new role as Dean of Women moved Kate Mueller to further explore the disciplines of Personnel and Guidance. She became a part of the National Association of Women Deans and Counsellors and editor of the <title render="italic">NAWDC Journal</title> throughout the 1960s. After her resignation from the Office of the Dean of Women in 1949, Kate Mueller became an associate professor in the Education department, teaching Psychology and later moving on to teaching graduate courses in Personnel and Guidance.</p><p> Throughout these years, Kate Hevner Mueller developed into a prolific writer, a noted public speaker, and an esteemed scholar in the fields of Psychology and of Personnel and Guidance. The test for measuring appreciation of music she developed with Robert Seashore in the early 1930s became a standard for many years. In addition to scores of journal articles and corroborations with her husband, Kate Hevner Mueller also wrote <title render="italic">Educating Women for a Changing World (1954),</title> and <title render="italic">Student Personnel Work in Higher Education,</title> both highly regarded. She traveled the United States and abroad to lecture and to evaluate schools in the areas of Guidance programs, and increasingly, on the subject of women and their role in society.</p><p> In 1965, John Mueller had reached the mandatory age of retirement at the University. Just two months after his retirement, however, on September 1st, 1965, John Mueller died after a brief fight with cancer. He was buried on his and Kate Mueller's thirtieth wedding anniversary. Despite the great loss she had suffered in losing both her husband and her partner in academic pursuits, Kate Mueller continued working well into the 1970s. She continued to teach at Indiana until 1969, and then teaching for a year at the University of Florida. Even after retirement, she was still highly sought as a speaker and advisor. In 1973, she finished the study that she and John Mueller had worked on intermittently for 30 years, <title render="italic">Twenty-Seven Major American Symphony Orchestras: A History and Analysis of Their Repertoires, Seasons 1842-43 through 1969-1970.</title> She continued pursuing her interests, spending more time travelling abroad and enjoying the rich cultural atmosphere at Indiana and in Bloomington. However, the last five years of her life were marked with illness and physical limitations on the engagement of her varied interests. Kate Hevner Mueller died August 10, 1984, five days after suffering a stroke.</p><p> Throughout her life, Kate Hevner Mueller won numerous awards and honors, both for her research and her contributions to the areas of Psychology and Personnel and Guidance.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Horace Hoffman was born on 30 July 1855 near Auburn, Indiana. The son of a minister turned farmer, the importance of education was highly regarded by his family. As a result through private instructors Hoffman was prepared for life in an academic setting. After teaching in country schools for five years, Hoffman entered Indiana University in 1877, where he graduated with his A.B. in 1881. For a brief period between 1881 and 1883 Hoffman taught Greek at Indiana University. With the encouragement of President Jordan, Hoffman left the University to pursue a degree from Harvard University where he received his A.M. in 1884. </p><p> During Hoffman's service as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the faculty abolished the grading system, instead choosing to use two criteria for judging student academic performance: "passed" or "not passed". Professor Hoffman, amongst others, was instrumental in attempting to discipline I.U. students who had participated in the "grand bolt" on February 12, 1896, Lincoln's birthday. That year, Washington's birthday happened to fall on a Saturday and many I.U. students felt cheated out of a holiday which would have allowed them a day off from classes. A group of male students decided that on Lincoln's birthday they would skip their classes and try to persuade other students to do so as well. The actions of the rogue students that Wednesday morning soon led to mayhem. A mob gathered outside Kirkwood Hall, indulged in a college-yell, before storming the building and physically removing some students who refused to leave. The mob next stormed the English end of Library Hall and made a second raid of Kirkwood Hall before President Swain and a rain storm drove most of them away. Hoffman and his colleagues made the decision to require all students who were absent from class to write a letter to the Committee of Student Affairs explaining the reason(s) for his or her absence on February 12. Among other events during Hoffman's service as Dean were: the first 'Arbutus' was issued in 1894; William Lowe Bryan was elected university president in June of 1902; Professor Bannister began the publication of the Indiana University Alumni Quarterly; the Student Building was dedicated in 1902; and from 1901 - 1906, Mary Bidwell Breed served as I.U.'s first Dean of Women. Another important event was the creation of the Graduate School in 1904 which relied heavily on the faculty of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. </p><p> Hoffman was widely respected by his fellow faculty members and is given credit with having helped form Indiana University into the institution that it has become today. Upon his retirement Hoffman was awarded with an honorary LL.D and was named Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as well as Professor Emeritus of Greek. </p><p> Hoffman died on 6 October 1950 in Traverse City, Michigan, at the age of 95.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The School of Letters was originally created by John Crowe Ransom, F.O. Matthiessen, and Lionel Trilling as a part of the School of English at Kenyon College. When support from the Rockefeller Foundation ended, the program moved to Indiana University in the summer of 1951. Supported by a similar grant from IU, the School of Letters began as a summer program, but expanded into a full-year program in the fall of 1961. The School of Letters remained distinct from the English department because of its contribution to the study of literary theory and criticism. According to Stallknecht, The School of Letters emphasized practical criticism over the biographical and historical approaches to the study of literature common in the departments of English and Comparative Literature. The program grew to international acclaim and was able to attract guest lecturers from the eminent scholars of the world. The program was phased out after the 1972 session, following Stallknecht's resignation as Director.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The study of political science at Indiana University has quite a history. When Andrew Wylie became IU president in 1829 he taught a senior class which included the subjects Constitutional Law, Moral Science, and Political Economy. After the Civil War more departments were introduced, including the Department of Mental, Moral and Political Philosophy. An excerpt from the 1877-1878 catalog description reads: </p><p> In this department is taught Mental Philosophy embracing the usual topics. Moral Philosophy include(s) both the theory of morals and practical morals; the former embraces the moral sense, the grounds of right and wrong, the nature of virtue, the authority of conscience, the rules of moral conduct, and the sources from which they are derived; the latter includes the duties we owe to ourselves, to men, to society, to the State, and to God. Political Philosophy embraces Civil Polity, Constitution of the U.S., Political Economy, Social Science, International Law. </p><p> In 1885 the department of History and Political Science was established. The following year it became two departments, a Department of History and a Department of Political and Social Science. Further specialization occurred in 1890 when a separate department of European History was created leaving the Department of American History and Politics, headed by James A. Woodburn. </p><p> Amos Shartle Hershey joined the Department of American History and Politics in 1895 and was the force that led to Political Science becoming its own department. In 1906 Hershey wrote the Board of Trustees to recommend the establishment of a separate department for Political Science. In March 1914 the Board enacted Hershey's proposal. At that time there were only 35 departments of Political Science in American colleges and universities. The first curriculum was established in 1915 and remained relatively untouched until World War II. During that time the only major change in the department was a name change in 1933 from Political Science to Government. The name change reflected uncertainty in the profession as to the essential character of inquiry into politics, and was prompted in the first instance by public puzzlement over the attribute of science. The name was returned to Political Science effective fall semester 1969 due to a misperception on the part of the foreign public. When researching abroad, members of the department had been regarded as agents of the American government. </p><p> Following World War II the growing complexity of scientific inquiry and its ever mounting impact on human relations had the effect of intensifying the need for more research. With the Wells administration in place the faculty was enlarged and with new faculty came new programs. The Political Science department expanded beyond its Western orientation. Hershey taught a course on Japan, but an even better example is the Army Specialized Training Program in which the University was engaged during WWII. This program included the language, history, and politics of countries around the world, friend and foe, with which the military became involved. Through this program, more specialized foreign programs were started at IU and the growing and diverse student body helped to keep these specialized programs operating. A political science component of the Russian and East European Program began in 1950. The African Studies program added a political science component in 1961. </p><p> Not only did the expansion that took place after WWII affect the size of the department, it affected the scope also. The complexity of society was reflected in that political science overlapped with sociology, economics, and even anthropology. Walter H. C. Laves who worked hard to expand the department to include technical assistance chaired the department for 12 years beginning in 1954. Under his leadership institutes of public administration were founded in Indonesia and Thailand. The connection between science and politics was also recognized as an important juncture, not only to public policy, but also to political science. In 1965 the innovative Program in Science, Technology, and Public Policy was established, featuring a multi- disciplinary approach, encompassing research, teaching, and service. Another innovative course developed was the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. Established professionals were brought together to assess alternative policy strategies. The Center for International Policy Studies, founded in 1975, combined research with a training program at both the pre and postdoctoral levels. Its approach was interdisciplinary, including natural as well as social sciences, and its methodology was quantitative and mathematical. Unfortunately, John Gillespie, who created the center with Dina Zinnes, died in 1979 and in 1980 Zinnes accepted a position at the University of Illinois. Consequently, without of the support of its founders the center dissolved in 1980.</p> </bioghist>

<p>James Albert Woodburn was born on November 30, 1856 in a two-story brick house on North College Street in Bloomington, Indiana, to James W. Woodburn and Martha Jane Hemphill Woodburn. At the time of James' birth, his father, James W. Woodburn, was serving as principal of the Preparatory department at Indiana University.</p><p> James A. Woodburn was educated in the Bloomington Public school system before entering Indiana University in 1872. He earned his A.B. degree in 1876 and soon after began teaching at a public school in Richland Township, Rush County, Indiana, before moving on to become an assistant principal in the Grayville, Illinois, public schools. In 1879 he returned to Bloomington where he began teaching Latin and advanced Mathematics at the Indiana University Preparatory school. While employed as an instructor at the Preparatory school, Woodburn worked towards an A.M. degree in
History that he completed in 1885. Starting in 1886, Woodburn secured consecutive leaves of absence from his teaching responsibilities at I.U. to enroll at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland in pursuit of a Ph.D. degree in History. While working toward his Ph.D. degree he taught Rhetoric and Composition at John Hopkins University and, during his absence, was also named Associate Professor of American History at I.U. in 1888. </p><p> After graduation, in 1890, he returned to Bloomington and joined the faculty at Indiana University as a professor of American History and Politics. While giving lectures at the University Extension division in Indianapolis he met Caroline Louise Gelston who had been teaching in Miss Sewall's Classical school. The two were married in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on November 20, 1893 and the couple soon afterward moved to Bloomington. A little over a year later, on November 30, 1894 James and Caroline's first son, James Gelston, was born followed by the couple's only daughter, Janet McMillan, who was born in 1900. The couple also had another son, Edward Albert, who was born on July 26, 1903. He died in infancy at the age of ten weeks. </p><p> Woodburn's responsibilities at I.U. changed in 1914 when the department of History was split from the department of Political Science to form two separate, autonomous departments with Woodburn serving as the first chair of the new department. This appointment was a landmark achievement for Woodburn being that he was one of the first men in America to hold such a prestigious chair. Woodburn remained an instructor at I.U. until the 1920-21 academic year when he gave up teaching to become a research professor. He retired from the university in 1924. After his retirement he was named professor emeritus. As an acknowledgement of his contributions to the Indiana University community, was awarded an honorary L.L.D. degree in 1926. </p><p> While teaching at I.U. Woodburn received some noteworthy accolades for his academic endeavors such as being awarded the John Marshall Prize from John Hopkins University for best volume in political science in 1903 and later, in 1909, being awarded an honorary L.L.D. degree from Colgate University. Woodburn is also credited with being a charter member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at I.U. which is a highly prestigious undergraduate honors organization. </p><p> One of his most memorable contributions Woodburn made to Indiana University was the publication of his "History of Indiana University" in 1940. Prompted by then President William Lowe Bryan, Woodburn spent years researching the history of the university. The publication of the history was of such great monumental importance to the academic community in Bloomington that an elaborate testimonial banquet was held on November 30, 1940 to honor Woodburn. This event was also planned to coincide with Woodburn's 84th birthday. During the celebration Woodburn formally presented a copy of the "History of Indiana University" to then president, Herman B Wells, who accepted it on behalf of the University.</p><p> Aside from his duties at Indiana University Woodburn served in the position of visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, Leland Stanford University, University of Michigan, Cornell University, and Washington State College. His many scholarly memberships included the American Historical Association, American Political Science Association, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis Literary Club, Kiwanis Club, National Arts Club, as well as many others.</p><p> On December 12, 1943, James A. Woodburn died of pneumonia in Madison, Wisconsin and was buried at the Rose Hill cemetery in Bloomington.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The first courses in biology at Indiana University were offered in 1853-54. However, as early as 1828 John Harney was appointed to teach mathematics and "such of the natural sciences as were considered of sufficient importance to engage the attention of aspiring youth." Textbooks of the day covering "the natural sciences" dealt with such areas of biology as anatomy, some physiology, some biogeography, and much systematics. </p><p> During the early years of Indiana University, biology existed as a subset of the Natural Sciences, often in the form of zoological, botanical, or geological research. For example, Richard Owen, Prof. of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry (1864-1879) concentrated chiefly on geological studies, but extensively employed zoology and botany as part of his teaching. By 1869-70, zoology and botany appear as separate courses under Natural Sciences. </p><p> In 1879, David Starr Jordan assumed the post of Prof. of Natural Sciences and proceeded to expand and modernize the curriculum. In 1885, Jordan became president of Indiana University. Among his first official acts was the establishment of a Department of Zoology (chaired by Jordan himself) and a Department of Botany and Geology (chaired by John C. Branner). In 1891, Carl H. Eigenmann assumed control of the Department of Zoology. Among his many contributions to the department was the establishment of a Biological Station on Turkey Lake (now Wawasee) and the assembly of a distinguished faculty that included Will Scott, Fernandus Payne, and Alfred C. Kinsey. By this time, anatomy and physiology had drifted away following a separate course correlated with the medical program. Bacteriology was established as a separate department under Leland McClung and included such notable faculty as Salvador E. Luria (later Noble Laureate). </p><p> By the 1960s it was becoming increasingly evident that the biological sciences of the day were extending far beyond the issues covered in the isolated departments of Zoology, Botany, and Bacteriology. In 1963, the Indiana University Board of Trustees created the Division of Biological Sciences, comprised of the departments of Anatomy and Physiology, Botany, Microbiology, and Zoology. Tracey Sonneborn served as chair of the executive committee of the Division. Under the divisional organization, the various departments sought to create a variety of courses and programs designed to integrate the field of biology. </p><p> In 1977 it was decided to completely integrate the departments into a single Department of Biology in order to foster interdisciplinary research, pool resources and equipment, and create an atmosphere in which the different biological fields "worked together rather than against each other." Interesting sections within the department were created, including botany, cell and developmental biology, ecology, genetics, microbiology, molecular biology, and physiology and biochemistry. John Preer became the department's first chair. </p><p> Breakdown of department name changes:</p> <list type="ordered">

<p>Elizabeth Grundy Dunn, the daughter of George and Eleanor Grundy, was born in Kentucky in 1778. She married Samuel Dunn, Jr. in 1812 and they moved their family to Indiana because Samuel did not want to raise his children in a slave state. They had eight children together and slowly moved there way up to Bloomington, Indiana, where they settled in 1823 and established a large farm that was on the land that makes much of the current Indiana University campus. </p><p> George Grundy Dunn, Sr., the son of Samuel and Elizabeth Grundy Dunn, was born in Washington Co., Kentucky, on Dec. 20, 1812. His family moved to Monroe Co., Indiana, in 1823 where Dunn attended Indiana Seminary (now Indiana University) in Bloomington, Indiana. Due to a dispute with a professor, Dunn left the school in his third year. In 1833, he moved to Switzerland Co., Indiana, to teach school, and later moved to Bedford to study law. Dunn was admitted to the bar in 1835 and partnered with Col. R. W. Thompson to practice law in Bedford. In 1841, George Grundy Dunn, Sr. married Julia Fell, and the next year he became the prosecuting attorney in Lawrence County, Indiana. Dunn served in several political offices, including as a U.S. Congressman from 1847-1849 and 1855-1857 and as a State senator from 1850-1852. He was well-known for his passionate oratory skills, which served him well as a congressman. George Grundy Dunn, Sr. died in 1857, shortly after his second term in the U.S. Congress ended, and was buried in Green Hill Cemetery in Bedford, Indiana. </p><p> Moses Fell Dunn was born Apr. 26, 1842 in Bedford, Indiana, the son of George Grundy Dunn, Sr. Moses graduated from Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana, in 1862, and moved on to study French and German at Harvard University. He was fluent in several languages and traveled the world extensively. He practiced law with his brother George Grundy Dunn, Jr. and served in the state legislature from 1867-1869. Between 1895 and 1905, Indiana University approached Moses Fell Dunn to purchase parts of the Dunn family farm to be used for the campus. About twenty acres were eventually secured, including what are now Dunn Meadow and the Dunn family cemetery. A dispute over this transaction, however, caused him to become disenfranchised with the university. Moses Dunn never married and had no children, so, upon his death in 1915, he left large amounts of land to Purdue University and to Bedford's Masonic Order. Bedford renamed their city hospital Dunn Hospital in honor of Moses Fell Dunn.</p><p> Felix Clelland Dunn, a son of Samuel and Elizabeth Grundy Dunn, was born in Kentucky, April 14, 1818. He married Mary Slocum and they had two children, Elizabeth (Legg) and Samuel G., and lived in Bloomington, Indiana. He spent most of his life as farmer, but also spent some time in the mercantile business in Bloomington. Felix Dunn died in 1885.</p><p> Samuel G. Dunn is the son of Felix C. Dunn. He married Mary E. Dunn, and had a daughter Mabel. </p><p> William McKee Dunn was born in 1814 in Hanover, Indiana, to Williamson Dunn, a founder of Hanover College. He is the nephew of Samuel Dunn, Jr., and cousin to George Grundy Dunn. Dunn graduated from Indiana State College (now Indiana University) in 1832, and became a professor of mathematics at Hanover College. In 1835, he received an A.M. from Yale University, and later studied law and started a practice in Madison, Indiana. Dunn was elected a member of the Indiana State Legislature in 1848, and later served two terms in the U.S. Congress, 1859-1863. During the Civil War, William McKee Dunn served in many active roles, including volunteer aide-de-camp to Union General George B. McClellan in 1861. In 1864, he became a colonel and assistant judge advocate general for the U.S. Army and brevetted brigadier general in 1865. Dunn retired from the military in 1881 and died at his summer residence in Dunn Loring, Virginia, in 1887.</p> </bioghist>

Before arriving in Bloomington, Indiana as an Assistant Professor of History, Dr. Grant spent two years teaching at the University of Maine (1957-1958) and Harvard University (1958-1959). </p><p> Dr. Grant's teaching career at Indiana University spanned over thirty years, beginning in 1959. He was instrumental in starting the department later to be known as History and Philosophy of Science and became Distinguished Professor of both that department and History. Dr. Grant also served as Chairperson of History and Philosophy of Science between 1973-1979 and 1987-1990. </p><p> A distinguished medievalist, Dr. Edward Grant wrote prolifically throughout his professorship at Indiana University. Among his numerous books are the multi-volume A Source Book in Medieval Science and Much Ado About Nothing: Theories of Space and Vacuum from the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution. Dr. Grant also published a variety of articles and reviews in such respected journals and publications as Isis, History of Science, Dictionary of Scientific Biography, and The New Catholic Encyclopedia. </p><p> In addition to his abundant writings, Dr. Grant was also a prominent member of several organizations, such as the Medieval Academy of America, the Academie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences, and the History of Science Society for which he served as Vice-President (1983-1984) and President (1985-1986). Dr. Grant was also a frequent lecturer for organizations such as the Phi Beta Kappa Associates Panel of Distinguished Speakers (1990-1998). </p><p> Some of Dr. Grant's various achievements are recorded in listings such as Who's Who in America, Directory of American Scholars, Men of Achievement, and Dictionary of International Biography.

Dr. Grant died on June 21, 2020.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Department of History and Philosophy of Science was established at Indiana University in 1960, largely due to the persistence of Professors Edward Grant and Norwood Russell Hanson. Shortly after Grant came to Indiana University, Hanson approached him with the idea of establishing a program in the History and Philosophy of Science. After garnering the support of other faculty members, a proposal was put forth to the administration, who happily approved the plan. Concerns from the Philosophy Department led to a name change - the Department of History and Logic of Science. The Board of Trustees approved the creation of the new department February 27, 1960. </p><p> With four faculty members and nine graduate students, the first year of the Department of History and Logic of Science began the fall of 1960. At the time, the department was primarily a Graduate School program with plans to create a fully-implemented undergraduate curriculum within a few years. The 1960-61 COAS Bulletin states that the intentions of the Department was "to explore, as an independent field of study, the conceptual development of scientific ideas, as well as their integral logical structure." Dr. Hanson served as the first Chair of the department.</p><p> A growing department, by the 1963-64 school year, the department had changed its name back to the original Department of History and Philosophy of Science. In the spring of 1964, the department awarded its first degrees - 5 M.A.s, and by the late 1960s, the Ph.Ds the department granted reached record levels, with the peak coming in 1971, with ten Ph.D.s awarded. </p><p> From the mid 1970s through the 1980s, class numbers dropped due in part to lack of growth in the field and limited job opportunities. During the 1990s, however, the department experienced a revitalization. The department experienced a substantial revision of its faculty; new hirees brought new perspectives and the department neared its record in the number of Ph.D.'s it granted. In 2000, the department celebrated its 40th anniversary.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The national organization known as the American Association of University Women was founded in 1881 to promote the expansion of women's opportunities in education and employment. Established in Washington D.C. as the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, the organization sought to combat prejudices against women in academics and in the workplace by publishing studies debunking myths about the "damaging" effects of education on a woman's health and by exploring women's opportunities in traditional and non traditional careers. The organization also raised money for the funding of fellowships for women to pursue advanced degrees and to conduct research.</p><p> Today, membership is open to anyone who holds a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution. The A.A.U.W. has a membership of 150,000 individuals with approximately 1,500 branches nationwide. The organization conducts business on many fronts including education, international relations and politics. The A.A.U.W. consistently endorses legislation that promotes women's opportunities in the workplace and academic settings such as Title IX, the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 and the Civil Rights Restoration Act. In 1981 the A.A.U.W. established the Legal Advocacy Fund for the financial assistance of women seeking to combat sexual harassment and sex discrimination in the workplace. The A.A.U.W. also established the Education Foundation to fund research and fellowships for university women and the Eleanor Roosevelt Fund, expanding their focus to include K-12 Education.</p><p> By 1987 the organization extended its membership to include men holding college degrees. Today, the organization continues to support women's education and employment efforts through financial assistance, research, and the promotion of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination.</p><p> The installation of a branch of the American Association of University Women was delayed in Bloomington, as Indiana institutions went unrecognized by the National Organization until 1912. A woman's eligibility was governed by her school's acceptability under the national organizations guidelines which called on institutions to provide students with a variety of course offerings and diverse library holdings, while at the same time maintaining membership in national organizations, and equal pay rates between the male and female faculty. When Indiana University finally gained acceptance under the A.C.A.'s, as it was then still known, guidelines activity to establish a Bloomington Branch commenced. The Bloomington Branch of the A.A.U.W. began 12 February 1913 under the name of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, and the branch changed its name accordingly when the national organization of the A.C.A. adopted the title of the American Association of University Women in 1921. Sixty women signed on as charter members of the Bloomington Branch, mostly young women who had recently received their college degrees. They originally met every second Wednesday of every month in the Student Building. In the early years of the group, they were unable to raise money for substantial fellowships, but did sponsor an annual essay contest through the English Department for university women, and also sponsored a discussion contest that awarded nominal prizes to cover the cost of books.</p><p> By the 1940s and 1950s the branch had a more solid foundation and was able to raise more funds, sponsor international fellowship recipients and conduct community based fundraising efforts. The Bloomington Branch remained active throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, promoting community involvement, educational diversification, and women's occupational issues. The Bloomington Branch of the A.A.U.W. always stayed politically involved, pushing forward important legislation for the betterment of women's experiences in education and the community.</p><p> Throughout the years the Bloomington Branch was active in the Indiana Division, the Great Lakes Region, and the A.A.U.W. national organizations, with four of its branch members going on to become Divisional Presidents. Also noteworthy was one of the Bloomington Branch's charter members, Nellie Showers Teter, who became Indiana University's first woman Trustee.</p><p> The Bloomington Branch of the A.A.U.W. was disbanded in July 1996.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Indiana University Bloomington Professional Staff Council became an official university organization when it's Constitution and Bylaws were approved by university administration on October 16, 1985. This representative council was created to empower the many professional staff members at the university by giving them a voice in university policies and actions that affected the working conditions and services/benefits of their employment. Before the approval of the Council's governing laws, it was a petition circulated by a representation committee appointed by the university administration, endorsed by the university's professional employees, and later presented to the IU Board of Trustees by an ad hoc group of four professional employees that laid the groundwork for the creation of the Council. Prior to the creation of the Council, many of the university's professional staff members were members or active participants in a non-officially-sanctioned group called the Indiana University Professional Staff Association. The IUPSA was formed in 1983 as a forum for the concerns and opinions of the university professional staff members on the Bloomington campus. This association was later disbanded in 1988 in favor of the Council. </p><p> The IUB Professional Staff Council held their first meeting on May 14, 1986 as a group of 24 professional staff members elected from 10 electoral units (now 21 professional staff members elected from 7 units) representing a balanced population of the university's professional community. In it's early years the Council worked to establish productive relations with university administration. The first issues of concern for this new university organization were the status of retirement plans, health care concerns, and issues concerning the job security of many professional staff members. The Council's first president, Don Brinneman, and other executive officers were successful in gaining the attention of many members of the university administration including that of it's president, John Ryan. Since these first connections were made, many subsequent members of the university administration have actively interacted with the Council even going so far as attending their meetings often as speakers.</p><p> The Indiana University Professional Staff Constitution begins with an official description of what the university considers a professional staff member; an individual appointed at 50% or full-time employment status as coded by the university budget. Professional Staff Members are represented by 21 professional staff members comprising the Professional Staff Council. The elected members of the Council are responsible for providing their fellow staff members with a means of making informed decisions and engaging in active participation regarding any university action or policy that would effect the university's professional community. The Council is responsible for dictating the concerns of the university's professional staff through questionnaires, surveys, meetings, and other forms of interaction and presenting them as formal proposals to the university Vice-President for Administration. The Council is required to meet once a month in which such meetings are open to non-members. In terms of responsibility, the Council is required to report its decisions and other proceedings to the members of the professional staff and these reports are also required to state how each Council member or his/her proxy voted on important issues. In terms of the Council's administration, the Council's Executive committee is required to elect a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Parliamentarian. Each Council member is required, as a minimum, to serve a three-year term with the possibility of serving another consecutive term after which they are ineligible to serve for the next two elections. The Bylaws state that 1/3 of the Council's members are required to run for re-election each year. After amendments to the Professional Staff Council Constitution have been discussed by the Council, such amendments must be approved by a 2/3 majority vote of the Council before being distributed by a mail ballot to the Professional Staff Association. A minimum of a 33% vote by the Professional Staff Association in favor of adopting the amendment is necessary before the newly ratified amendment is submitted to the IU Board of Trustees.</p><p> As mentioned above, the Council's first president, Don Brinneman, was a very influential executive member of the IUBPSC as was Doris-Jean Burton, the Council's first Vice President, who addressed the Faculty Affairs committee of the IU Board of Trustees concerning the establishment of the IUBPSC. The duties of both offices are extensive and require active cooperation with the many divisions and members of the Council. The President is responsible for chairing Council meetings, referring matters to the separate committees, preparing written annual reports, representing the Council at Bloomington Faculty Council meetings, and selecting the chairs of Standing committees and Ad Hoc task forces amongst other responsibilities. The Vice President is responsible for being the contact person for other university employee organizations or campus group; chairing a committee responsible for the Council's presentations to the IU Board of Trustees; as well as assuming the responsibilities of the President in his/her absence. </p><p> Each Council member is required to serve on at least one Standing committee each year. Attendance at each of the committee's monthly meetings is required. Each Standing committee is chaired by an individual appointed by the Council's president. The chairs of these committees are responsible for delegating assignments to the separate committee members, scheduling committee meetings, setting the agenda for committee meetings, and preparing written reports to the university's professional staff amongst other responsibilities. The Executive committee of the IUBPSC has the responsibility of establishing ad hoc committees and task forces to research staff related issues and report their findings to the Council. Like the standing committees, the ad hoc committees and task forces are chaired by individuals appointed by the Council's president who creates written reports for the Council, but attendance is not as strictly regulated since such groups meet only when necessary, and may only be active for a short duration.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The formal development of an African Studies Program at Indiana University began in 1961 with the receipt of a five-year developmental grant from the Ford Foundation under the directorship of J. Gus Liebenow of the Department of Political Science. The program was strengthened in 1965 when it was designated as an African Language and Area Center under the National Defense Education Act. In the first ten years of its existence, faculty participants increased from 3 to 23, graduates specializing in African studies from 3 to 95, courses offered during the regular academic year from 4 to 79, graduate enrollments from 26 to 367, and undergraduate enrollments from 17 to 244. A cornerstone of the program was the weekly "continuing seminar," to which an ever-expanding range of national and international experts in African history and culture was invited for lecture and discussion.</p><p> In 1970, when Liebenow as appointed Dean for International Programs and Associate Dean for Research and Advanced Studies, he agreed to continue the directorship of the African Studies Program if he could have the assistance of a deputy director. Patrick O'Meara was appointed to this position, then became director in spring 1972 when Liebenow was appointed Vice President and Dean for Academic Affairs. O'Meara continued in this position until his own appointment as Dean for International Programs in June 1993. The records in this collection are from the Liebenow and O'Meara directorships. </p><p> Five areas of emphasis characterized the early years of the program: West African regional studies, African humanities with emphasis on the arts and music, problems of development, historical study emphasizing West Africa, and African languages and linguistics. Work in African languages included the preparation of teaching manuals for 14 African languages under contract with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and with the Peace Corps; coursework was offered in other languages as well. A sixth area of emphasis evolved with the extensive work of Alan Taylor in the development of the library collection on Africa and the training of African bibliographers within the Graduate Library School.</p><p> The African Studies Program was from the beginning intended to become a permanent program, drawing on faculty with appointments in established departments, encouraging recruitment of new faculty with African interests for departmental openings, and pursuing interdisciplinary efforts with other campus entities such as the Folklore Institute (joint publication of Cross-Rhythms), the Archive of Traditional Music, the International Development Research Center, and the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. Its faculty was active nationally and internationally in the development of scholarship on Africa through the support of the African Studies Association, founded in 1956, as well as through individual affiliations and extensive publications. In response to the increasing demands by African-Americans for attention to their African heritage and contributions to American society and the world in 1968, faculty from the African Studies Program were heavily involved in developing and carrying out the extensive Focus: Black America program of speakers, performers, and discussions during the 1968-69 academic year. As Liebenow described the program, it was intended "to educate the university community with respect to the many contributions being made by Black citizens to all phases of American society" and to investigate "the causes and implications of inter-racial conflict in the United States." His hope was that "Focus: Black America will not only contribute to the launching of the recently approved Program of Afro-American Studies, but will lead also to the hiring of new Black faculty at Indiana and to making the university a more attractive institution for current and prospective Black students" (Dec. 1968 Christmas letter). </p><p> Other notable projects of the program's early years were the annual Hans Wolff Lectures, bringing noted international Africanists to campus for a schedule of lectures and seminars; publications in African humanities; collection of extensive audio and video resources on Africa; the "Living Africa" television production; efforts in support of the Southern African Research Archives Project (SARAP) under the leadership of Gwendolen Margaret Carter, Director of the African Studies Program at Northwestern University and from 1974-1984 a member of the I.U. faculty; and development of the MacArthur Foundation grant that launched the Center for Global Change and World Peace.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Johnnie Wilson Rutland was born in Wildwood, Florida, 19 March 1888. She received a bachelor's degree from Florida State College for Women (later Florida State University) in 1908 and a master's degree in English literature from Columbia in 1915. Between these two periods, she taught the fifth and sixth grades and high school English in Tampa, Florida. While at Columbia, she met Henry Lester Smith (1876-1963), a native of Indiana and graduate of Indiana University who was working on his Ph.D. there, largely through summer coursework. At that time, he had already been a faculty member at Indiana University and served as Superintendent of Schools in Bloomington for six years. He also was Dean-elect of I. U.'s School of Education, on leave from the university while at Columbia. The two were married in New York City on 3 Feb 1915. Henry Lester Smith served as Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1915-1916, receiving his Ph.D. in 1916. In that same year he began a tenure as Dean of Indiana University's School of Education that would last 30 years. </p><p> Johnnie Rutland Smith continued her own education at Indiana University, earning an M.S. in education in 1931 and a Ph.D. in psychology with a minor in English in 1934. She taught children's literature at Indiana University in 1925-1926 and comparative education (through the Extension Division) in 1940, and served as a lecturer in the Extension Division beginning in 1932. She spoke German, Spanish, and French, and served as a translator of the World Conference of the Teaching Profession in New York in 1946. She co-authored <title render="italic">An Introduction to Research in Education</title> (1959) with her husband, as well as a number of articles.</p><p> In addition to these professional and educational endeavors, she was very involved in civic organizations, especially those that catered to women, promoted education, or did both. A tribute to her after her death states that "she believed that club membership was a channel of service for women in the community and a stimulus for personal development" (Nell Olsson, <title render="italic">The Herald-Telephone</title> 22 July 1977). She founded the Monroe County Department Club, the Bloomington chapter of the National Society of Arts and Letters, and the Bloomington branch of the National League of American Pen Women. She served as president of the Bloomington Council of Women (1926-1927); the Bloomington Woman's Club, a literary club (1932-1934); the Nineteenth Century Club, a literary and philanthropic organization (1933-1935); the Faculty Women's Club (1934-1935); the Monroe County Federated Clubs (1935-at least 1941); and the Junior-Senior High School Parent Teacher Association (1936-1938). In addition she also served in many other roles in these and other organizations, such as the Bloomington Hospital Board (1927-1929) and the Bloomington Council of Girl Scouts (1930-1936), and was a member of the Hoosier Salon Patron's Association for sixteen years.</p><p> Her activity in the American Association of University Women was particularly noteworthy. When she joined the Bloomington Branch of the organization in 1915, it was only two years old, and still known as the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (the name was changed to the American Association of University Women in 1921--see finding aid for Collection C209). Beginning in 1922, she served as chairman of various committees at the local and state levels, and sat on committees at the sectional and national levels of the organization as well. She was president of the Indiana Federation of Branches from 1928 to 1929 and of the Bloomington Branch from 1938 to 1940, and was selected the official representative of Indiana University and the Bloomington branch of the A. A. U. W. to the national convention in March 1937.</p><p> Her association with the Indiana Federation of Clubs also seems to have been quite significant, as her invitation to participate in the White House Conference on Education documented in this collection was addressed to her in her role in this organization (see scope and content note). Her earliest association with this group seems to have been in 1935, when she became chairman of the American Home Department, and in 1957, she co-directed a three-day Leadership Training Institute on the Indiana University campus, which was co-sponsored by the Indiana Federation of Clubs. She served as president of the organization between 1966 and 1968, and appears to have remained active in the organization afterward as well.</p><p> Despite the fact that Johnnie Rutland Smith was known as Mrs. Henry Lester Smith for most of her life, and her longest association with Indiana University was as the wife of the Dean of the School of Education, she was a highly educated woman in her own right who was engaged in the cause of education in many different roles over the course of her long and active life. Olsson calls her "one of the most beloved and distinguished women in the Hoosier state" (op. cit.). She was mentioned in <title render="italic">Principal Women of America,</title> Vol. 1 in 1932 and was given Distinguished Alumni awards by both Indiana University (in 1969) and Florida State University. Johnnie Rutland and Henry Lester Smith had three children, Martha Elisabeth (born 1917), Ruth Charlotte (born 1919), and Henry Rutland (born 1922). Henry Lester Smith died in 1963 at the age of 87 and Johnnie Rutland Smith died on 17 July 1977 at the age of 88.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Danilo Orescanin served Indiana University in a number of different capacities during his career, most notably as Chancellor of the Northwest campus and subsequently as Vice President for University Relations. In both positions, he spoke frequently to university and community groups, and worked to strengthen I.U.'s relationship with the community at large.</p><p> Orescanin was born 7 April 1932 in Mingo Junction, Ohio, to George and Nellie (Kukich) Orescanin; his father had come to the United States from Serbia at the age of nineteen. Orescanin earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from West Virginia University in 1953 and an M.B.A. from Indiana University in 1954. He became an industrial engineer at Colgate-Palmolive in Jeffersonville, Indiana; was drafted into the army, in which he served in 1955 and 1956; and returned to I.U. to pursue a doctorate in business in 1957. By the time he received his doctorate in 1960, he had already had a taste of administrative work, having served as administrative assistant to the Dean of the School of Business.</p><p> Orescanin became an Assistant Professor of Business at the University of South Florida in Tampa in 1960, where he also served as Assistant Coordinator of Evening and Summer Sessions. In 1963 he returned to Indiana University as Assistant Dean of the Division of University Extension. Over the next nine years, he performed a variety of administrative functions for the University and held appointments first as an assistant and then as an associate professor of business. He was acting director of the Southeast campus from April to August of 1965, following the sudden death of Dr. Byron K. Laird. In the fall of 1965, Orescanin went to Dacca, Pakistan to establish a new graduate program at the Institute of Business Administration, Dacca University, serving as Resident Advisor until 1967. He returned to I.U. and served first as Assistant Dean and later Associate Dean of Research of Advanced Studies, meanwhile serving as Acting Director of Data Systems and Services. In 1969, he was appointed Assistant to President Joseph L. Sutton and Associate Dean for Administration, and continued as Assistant to President John W. Ryan until he was invited to follow David R. Derge to Southern Illinois University following the latter's appointment as president there early in 1972.</p><p> Orescanin served as Derge's executive assistant at S.I.U. from February to July of 1972, when he became Vice President for Administration and Campus Treasurer. Between July 1973 and March 1974, he also held the position of Executive Vice President. However, in late February 1974, Orescanin called Derge's attention to procedural irregularities in the use of some $5,000 from the Southern Illinois University Foundation to buy alcohol for presidential functions. As the accounts were under his control, Orescanin resigned from his administrative duties and requested reassignment to a full-time teaching and research position in the business school, which Derge granted. Orescanin was charged with tampering with public records by a grand jury of Jackson County, Illinois, but was acquitted. </p><p> Orescanin served as Chancellor of Indiana University Northwest from the fall semester of 1975 until June of 1983, during which time he worked to improve the financial and physical state of the campus and to improve the image of the campus in the surrounding communities. He was involved in a large number of community organizations, and was awarded a National Award for outstanding contributions and service by the Association of Teacher Educators in 1979, the first time the award was ever given to a non-education faculty member. </p><p> In June 1983, Orescanin was appointed Vice President for University Relations, a position that had been vacant for nearly three years. In this capacity, he oversaw the News Bureau, and the offices of University Publications, Community Relations, and Special Events, as well as the offices of University Relations at all campuses. He expanded the staff, which had been reduced in size, and implemented programs intended to create a strong statewide image for I. U. He showed a special interest in communities that had not previously had a strong I. U. presence such as "the Batesvilles, the Lawrenceburgs, the Evansvilles, and the Terre Hautes," as one article put it (Heck, The Columbian, Nov. 1983). He also launched a "Speakers Team" project to invite faculty members with the needed expertise speak to community groups around the state that might have questions about a particular field. His public relations style tended to emphasize personal connections: he compiled a list of "Friends of Indiana" in a wide range of counties and occupations for University Relations use, and sponsored golf events to build ties between members of the administration and influential people outside I. U., such as the news media. He served in the position of Vice President until January 1, 1988, when he returned to teaching management and business policy classes in the business school. In 1992, he was given the Otteson Undergraduate Teaching Excellence Award. He retired in December 1992, and died 22 May 1999 at the age of 67 in Tampa, Florida. Orescanin and his wife, Kathleen, had a son, Danilo II, and a daughter, Lori, both of whom earned degrees from I.U.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Board of Student Publications was established by the Indiana University Board of Trustees on September 5, 1946, superceding the Arbutus Board of Control. According to R.L. Shoemaker, the Dean of Students in 1945, increased enrollment triggered by the G.I. Bill of Rights would cause a demand for more student publications. This board would supervise all student publications, making them more manageable by the University and more accessible to the students. </p><p> The Board was comprised of faculty from the School of Business, School of Journalism and Department of English. There were also members from the News Bureau, the Office of the Treasurer, the Student Activities Office, editors of the Indiana Daily Student, the Arbutus, two students elected by the Student Council, and the Dean of Students, ex-officio. The function of the board was to formulate policies on matters such as budgetary issues, the hiring of student staff, and general business procedures.</p><p> Before its circulation, any publication first had to be approved by the Board. The Board would examine the content of the publication and then approve or disapprove the publication. While the School of Journalism was in charge of the Indiana Daily Student, the paper was nevertheless required to run their business procedures through the Board. </p><p> In March of 1955, members of the Arbutus began discussing the idea of acting as a business independent of the Board. However, it was decided that the Board had the right to delegate any decisions made by the Arbutus staff because of the original goals the Board of Trustees set as well as the university procedures. </p><p> In June of 1969, the Board of Trustees agreed that the Board of Student Publications would meet twice a year to appoint the editor of the Indiana Daily Student. The authority to make decisions on all other business operations was returned to the organizations.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Corda Fratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs was founded at the University of Wisconsin in 1904, out of an International Club that had formed in 1903. The Corda Fratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs began to expand to other Universities and started to hold national conventions of the Cosmopolitan Club chapters in 1907. The first convention was held at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. A Cosmopolitan Club member from the University of Wisconsin, Louis Luchner, wrote to President Bryan in October and November of 1907, inviting Indiana University to form an International or Cosmopolitan Club in order to attend the first convention.</p><p> This attempt was unsuccessful; however, an Indiana University chapter of the Cosmopolitan Club was founded nine years later, on November 19, 1916, by 12 international students. The original constitutional committee consisted of: T.V. Petranoff (Bulgaria), Heinman Blatt (Russia), Y. Kodera (Japan), and Club President, J.T. Hsi (China). The Indiana University Cosmopolitan Club adopted a constitution on December 9, 1916 and received a charter from the Corda Fratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs on January 1, 1918.</p><p> On December 26-29, 1923, Indiana University hosted the 17th annual National Convention with 77 delegates of 15 different nationalities registered in attendance. This same year, the Indiana University chapter was the executive chapter for all Cosmopolitan Clubs in the United States. In conjunction with this honor, I.U. history professor, Dr. James A. Woodburn, was elected national president of the Corda Fratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs. Additional Cosmopolitan Club faculty advisors of note at Indiana University include Leo R. Dowling in the 1940's and Walter E. Burnham in the 1950's and 1960's.</p><p> As illustrated by the club motto, "Above all nations is humanity," the Cosmopolitan Club was founded to foster understanding and fraternity between foreign and American students, in order to promote international cooperation and world peace. Throughout its existence at Indiana University, the Cosmopolitan Club strove to maintain a 50/50 balance of U.S. and international members. By 1965, the club membership roster for the Indiana University chapter documented a membership of 515 individuals, representing 54 different countries.</p><p> On March 25, 1922, the <title render="italic">Indiana Daily Student</title> reported on the first 'International Revue' (held March 24, 1922), marking the beginning of the Cosmopolitan Club's long tradition of presenting international dance, music and culture to the Indiana University community. The international performances and socials led to the development of an annual International Dinner, coinciding with a week of exhibitions and activities celebrating the United Nations. The first of these dinners was held in 1953 and they continued for 16 years. The International Dinner proved to be one of the most popular and widely attended activities of the club. </p><p> Through out the 1950's and early 1960's, interest in the Cosmopolitan Club remained high, as illustrated by events programming, newsletters, and membership rosters. By 1969, however, events and publications had waned and only 6 members were pictured in the Arbutus yearbook. 1969 was the last year the club was pictured in the Arbutus, but the collection contains an invitation to the 1970 International Dinner, indicating that the club remained active after ceasing to appear in the Arbutus. This document, dated February 12, 1970, is the last transaction of Cosmopolitan Club activity in the collection.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Gerald L. Bepko was born in Chicago, Illinois, on 21 April 1940 to Geraldine F. and Lewis Bepko. Bepko was a bright student and was entered into a program called "Double Promotion" which enabled him to skip a grade during his grade school career. He graduated in 1957 from Carl Scherz High School, a co-educational institution. Bepko's father passed away in 1958, and his mother remarried in 1961.</p><p> After having spent his formative years on the North side of Chicago where he excelled as a student, he decided to enroll at Northern Illinois University where he graduated with a B.S. in 1962. He was the first member of his family to graduate from college. Eligible for the draft and unsure of what he wanted to do, he was convinced by a family friend and member of the Board of Kent College of Law in Chicago to apply for entrance into the school. He did and was accepted into the law program where he earned a J.D. in 1965.</p><p> Still eligible for the draft after graduation but protected by a deferment, Bepko felt the need to serve his country in some capacity. He applied to the United States Navy Judge Advocate General Corps (JAG), the United States Army Officer Candidate School, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). The FBI was particularly alluring to him due to the new found popularity of Ian Fleming's James Bond series. He heard first from the F.B.I. and became an agent in 1965.</p><p> During his time as an agent Bepko was involved in a very serious accident that almost cost him his life. Just married to Jean Cougnenc in February 1968, Bepko was assigned to a surveillance mission in New York City. In September of that same year the truck he was in was struck by another car, and he was thrown from the vehicle. The truck then tipped over landing on top of Bepko almost crushing him to death. Shortly after this incident, Bepko resigned from the F.B.I in 1969 and turned to teaching, which would become his life-long career.</p><p> Almost five years after his graduation from Kent College of Law, Bepko returned to Chicago to teach. He served at the school from 1969-1971. Having decided to go back to school to earn his L.L.M., Bepko applied for and was appointed the Ford Urban Law Fellow at Yale University in 1971. When he resigned his position at Kent College he had been appointed as the Director of the Institute for Criminal Justice. He received his L.L.M degree from Yale in 1972.</p><p> Bepko joined the Indiana University faculty at the School of Law-Indianapolis in 1972, becoming a full professor in 1975, associate dean for academic affairs in 1979, and dean of the law school in 1981. He has been a visiting professor at the University of Illinois, Ohio State University and Indiana University Bloomington</p><p> At the time of his appointment to Interim President of Indiana University, Bepko was serving as Chancellor of Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI), a position which he had held since 1986. He served as interim president from January-July 2003, when the university officially appointed Adam Herbert as president in August 2003.</p><p> Bepko is married to Jean B.

<p>Indiana University's Graduate School was founded, upon the recommendation of the Committee on Advanced Degrees, on February 1, 1904. The committee administered the School until 1908, when Carl H. Eigenmann was appointed as the first dean.</p><p> For many years, a university Research Committee handled the many research funding requests until the 1977-1978 school year when the Office of Research and Graduate Development (R&amp;GD) was formed to govern higher level research at IU. The first dean of this office was Homer A. Neal, who served in this role until the 1980-1981 academic year, at which time George Springer became acting dean. Morton Lowengrub took over the position in 1982 and stayed through 1988. With Lowengrub's departure, Roger Farr became acting dean until 1989.</p><p> In 1989, the Office of Research and Graduate Development merged with the University Graduate School to become the Research and the University Graduate School (RUGS). To lead this program, George Walker was appointed Dean of the Graduate School and Associate Vice President for Research. The merger combined the financial resources of the two offices while unloading some of the recordkeeping and admission duties onto the individual schools within the university. As a result, RUGS administrators were better able to work on cultivating financial resources and to study graduate student concerns.</p><p> Dr. Walker retired as Vice President of Research in 2003 (but continued as Dean of the Graduate School while the university conducted a search for his successor), ending a tenure during which several new prominent centers and initiatives had been established at IU, such as the Center on Congress, the Center for Mathematical Education, and the Advanced Research and Technology Institute.</p><p> After Walker's retirement, RUGS split into two offices, the Office of the Vice President for Research and the University Graduate School. Vice President for Information Technology Michael A. McRobbie (later named the 18th president of the university), was asked to oversee this office and was given the additional title of Vice President for Research.

<p>Elvis J. Stahr, Jr., was born in Hickman, Kentucky on March 9, 1916 to Elvis Jacob and Mary Anne (McDaniel) Stahr. After graduating high school as valedictorian in 1932 at the age of sixteen, he attended the University of Kentucky where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, the ROTC program, and the varsity tennis and debate teams. He graduated in 1936 with a degree in English Literature and the highest grades on record at the University of Kentucky. He continued his education at the University of Oxford in England as a Rhodes Scholar, where he received a B.A. in jurisprudence and a B.A. in civil law in 1938 and 1939, respectively. Later, he received his M.A. from Oxford in 1943.</p><p> After his graduation from Oxford, Stahr practiced law as an associate in the New York firm Mudge, Stern, Baldwin, and Tucker from July 1939 to February 1941. However, his law practice was interrupted by World War II. Stahr joined the war effort in October 1941 as a second lieutenant and served for twenty-six months overseas, mainly in China, but also in India and North Africa. During his military tour, he received the Special Breast Order of Yun Hui, twice awarded by the Nationalist Republic of China, and the Bronze Star medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, among other honors. He ended his stint in the Army as a lieutenant colonel. During his tenure as an officer of the United States Army, he received a diploma in Chinese language in 1943 from Yale University. </p><p> Dr. Stahr left the Army in 1946 and again joined the law firm of Mudge, Stern, Williams, and Tucker, this time as a senior associate, but left in 1947 to return to what he called his first love, higher education. He joined the faculty of his alma mater, the University of Kentucky, as an associate professor of law in 1947, but was quickly promoted to full time faculty in 1948, and soon thereafter, to the position of Dean of the College of Law. He was the youngest, (at the age of 32) to serve in this post. In 1954, he was named Provost of the University of Kentucky. During his career at the University of Kentucky, he also served as special assistant to the Secretary of the Army during the Korean Conflict, and under United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower in1956 as the executive director of the Committee on Education beyond High School. He left the University of Kentucky in 1957 to become the Vice Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh. Soon after, he left his position at the University of Pittsburgh to become the President of the University of West Virginia. He stayed in West Virginia for two years before accepting the nomination by President Kennedy to serve as the Secretary of the Army. While in this position, Stahr established the Army Intelligence and Security Branch as a separate, professional division of the Army, oversaw the reorganization of the combat division of the Army, and expanded the community relations of the Army. </p><p> Stahr gave up the position of Secretary of the Army to return to higher education as the President of Indiana University in 1962, where he succeeded his friend Herman B Wells as Indiana University's 12th President. In his inaugural address, he stressed the need for maintaining the leadership role IU had in fields where it was nationally renowned, for spending Indiana tax dollars to prepare the campus for the expected large influx of baby boom generation students, and for stressing the importance of higher education in creating jobs and security in the state of Indiana. </p><p> During Stahr's presidency, Indiana University saw its largest expansion. In the course of his term, the awarding of baccalaureate degrees at the regional campuses began, as well as the addition of majors, such as the Study of Religion; of Divisions, such as the Honors Division, and of Schools, such as the Library Science School, within the Bloomington campus. He guided plans for the building of Assembly Hall, the Student Health Center, the Optometry Building, the Graduate Residence Center, and several different residence halls, including Briscoe, Wilkie, and Forest. The University School was also built during his term. His presidency witnessed the creation of the Aerospace Research Center which acted as a clearinghouse for technology developed by the government to be adapted for civilian use. His tenure also saw a large growth in the number of students and faculty, not only in Bloomington, but also in the regional campuses. Finally, Stahr led a reorganization of the university administration into three separate and distinct areas, the Bloomington campus led by a chancellor, the Indianapolis campus, and the regional campuses as more autonomous units. </p><p> Dr. Stahr served as Indiana University President until 1968 when he stepped down due to "presidential fatigue." He wrote to the Board of Trustees stating that although he had enjoyed his term as president, he felt that he could no longer devote himself to such a large task as president. His intention, he told the Board of Trustees, was to return to Indiana University after a sabbatical as a professor of law. However, he accepted the position as President of the National Audubon Society in 1968, writing that the issue of conservation was something that could not be ignored. He retired as President of the National Audubon Society in 1978, after having seen the membership rate almost quadruple to 400,000, and being instrumental in liberalizing the tax laws in the United States to allow charitable organizations to lobby on public policy issues. Although retired, he was still active in a number of environmental and public service organizations until his death of cancer on November 11, 1998.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Realizing the need for educational alternatives for those unable to attend traditional on-campus classes, the School of Continuing Studies was established in 1975 to offer further educational opportunities to individuals who worked full-time, had families, were homebound by illness, were in the military, or were in prison. Dean Dr. Robert Richey (Dean from 1975-1978) at the time noted the need for alternative methods of delivery to students rather than the traditional in-class lecture system. He cited alternate mechanisms for delivery of content such as cable television and video cassettes, the radio-television department, the eight campuses around the state, and the already established 130 university independent study programs. </p><p> In the early days of its existence (1975-1976), the system wide school was comprised of the Division of Extended Studies, Labor Education and Research, and the Division of Continuing Education. By fall 1977, all eight IU campuses offered the Associate of General Studies and the Bachelor of General Studies degrees. </p><p> The organizational structure of the school evolved under the direction of Dean James E. Weigand (1979-1993). Focusing upon the use of independent study, he fused the Independent Study Division and the External Degree Program into the Division of Extended Studies. He furthermore approved the formation of the New Division of Professional development, which sought to develop nondegree programs for professional associations and business. Additionally, during the course of the 1980s, the School of Continuing Studies established programs in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Malaysia, and Iran. </p><p> Kathy Krendl replaced Weigand as dean in 1994 and brought a focused commitment to the use of technology for the delivery of instruction, and furthermore sought to establish a distance education plan. During her tenure until 1996, the school implemented the Multicampus Technology Project, which created state-of-the-art videoconferencing facilities on each of the IU campuses. She was followed by Howard Mehlinger as interim dean, and then Jeremy Dunning as dean in the fall of 1999. </p><p> In 2008 the School of Continuing Studies is under the direction of Judy Wertheim and is now comprised of the Office of Academic Programs, the Office of Financial Administration, Instructional Design and Development, Technology Support, the Office of Learner Services, and the Office of Marketing and Communications. In addition, to the school's General Studies degree – either the association of arts or the bachelor of arts – students are also given the opportunity to earn several certificates to further develop their career skills. In addition to credit programs, the School of Continuing Studies also offers an Undergraduate Nondegree Program for students wishing to update their jobs skills or looking to prepare themselves before entering a degree seeking program, and Professional Development and Lifelong Learning non-credit courses for those seeking to advance their career or simply seeking further education.

<p>BRYAN, William Lowe (11 Nov. 1860-21 Nov. 1955), philosopher, psychologist, and educator, was born William Julian Bryan on a farm near Bloomington, Indiana, the son of John Bryan, a Presbyterian minister, and Eliza Jane Philips. In 1876 he entered the preparatory department of Indiana University in Bloomington, which served as the local high school, and the next year he matriculated as a university student. As an undergraduate he developed his skills in public speaking and helped to revive the <emph render="italic">Indiana Student</emph> newspaper in 1882. He became a member of the Specialists' Club organized by David Starr Jordan, professor of natural sciences, to encourage promising students to pursue research careers. Bryan graduated in 1884 with a bachelor's degree in ancient classics.</p><p> After graduation Bryan was hired as an English instructor in the preparatory department. Within a few months he received an unexpected opportunity to join the regular faculty when the president of the university, Baptist minister Lemuel Moss, and Katherine Graydon, the professor of Greek, were caught up in a romantic scandal and left the university. Bryan was hired as Graydon's replacement, and in early 1885 Jordan was appointed president. Jordan, a noted ichthyologist, placed science at the center of his ideas on educational reform and stressed that <emph render="doublequote">the highest function of the real university is that of instruction by investigation.</emph> Working with limited financial support from the state he relied heavily on local talent to fill the ranks of the faculty.</p><p> Although Bryan earned a master's degree in philosophy at Indiana in 1886 with a thesis on ancient Greek logic, his interests shifted toward the <emph render="doublequote">new psychology</emph> that promised to revolutionize the study of human nature through laboratory experimentation and other empirical techniques. He went to Germany, the center of scientific psychology, in 1886-1887 to study at the University of Berlin; after returning he was promoted to full professor and granted $100 to purchase a Hipp chronoscope for experimental studies of human reaction times. In January 1888 Bryan opened the Indiana University Psychological laboratory, the second such facility established in the United States.</p><p> Bryan married Charlotte Augusta Lowe in 1889 and in her honor replaced his given middle name with her last name. His wife was a graduate of Indiana University, having earned a bachelor's degree (1888) and a master's degree (1889) in Greek. They collaborated on two books, <emph render="italic">Plato the Teacher: Selections from Plato</emph> (1897) and <emph render="italic">Studies in Plato's Republic for Teachers</emph> (1898). They had no children.</p><p> Bryan carried a heavy teaching load, and at first the psychological laboratory was used mainly for classroom demonstrations rather than original research. In 1891 he went to Clark University to pursue a doctorate under G. Stanley Hall, a prominent advocate of the new psychology. Bryan received his Ph.D. in psychology in 1892 for a dissertation on the development of voluntary motor abilities in children. He was also recruited by Hall to help organize the American Psychological Association, founded in July 1892, and became one of its twenty-six charter members.</p><p> After returning to Indiana University, Bryan expanded the psychological laboratory and was appointed vice president of the institution. He resisted repeated offers by Jordan, who had become president of Stanford University in 1891, to join the faculty of the California school. Bryan also became involved in the child-study movement, an effort to develop a scientific foundation for pedagogical techniques. He served as an officer in several national organizations, including the secretary of the National Association for the Study of Children (1893) and the president of the Child-Study Section of the National Educational Association (1894).</p><p> In the 1890s Bryan conducted pioneering psychological experiments. He investigated the process of learning to send and receive messages in Morse code on the telegraph. The research, published in the Psychological Review (1897, 1899), was among the first such studies to graphically represent its data in the form of <emph render="doublequote">learning curves</emph> and became a classic in the study of human learning. Because of Bryan's efforts, during this period Indiana University became an undergraduate training ground for notable future psychologists, including Edwin D. Starbuck, Ernest H. Lindley, and Lewis M. Terman.</p><p> In 1902 Bryan was appointed the tenth president of Indiana University. The next year he was elected president of the American Psychological Association and delivered his presidential address on the problem of <emph render="doublequote">Theory and Practice</emph> (repr., <emph render="italic">Psychological Review</emph> 11 [1904]: 71-82). His remark that <emph render="doublequote">the scholar may at great price become a statesman</emph> suggested his ambivalence about leaving the laboratory for administration.</p><p> Pious and scholarly, Bryan presided over the transformation of Indiana University from a small, traditional liberal arts college into a modern research university. He led the institution for thirty-five years and oversaw an era of enormous growth in student enrollments, physical facilities, and curricular offerings. He considered administration an exercise in practical psychology and viewed the university as a key institution for the transmission of cultural values as well as specialized knowledge. His most notable accomplishment was the expansion of graduate and professional training. During his administration, schools of medicine, education, nursing, business, music, and dentistry were established, along with many graduate programs and several satellite campuses around the state. By the time Bryan retired at the age of seventy-six, Indiana University had significantly broadened access to its programs and had dramatically increased the quality of graduate and professional education.</p><p> Bryan was known as a pithy orator, and his speeches were highly moralistic. His strong belief in the scientific study of human nature was tempered by an equally powerful conviction that it was not sufficient to provide moral and spiritual guidance. Hence he maintained an interest in ethics and metaphysics throughout his life. In 1940 Bryan published <emph render="italic">Wars of Families of Minds,</emph> a book that reflected on the consequences of different ways of knowing the world. A colleague once called him <emph render="doublequote">a philosopher tamed by science</emph>--a characterization that could have easily been applied to Bryan's intellectual hero, William James.</p><p> After retirement Bryan continued to live on campus in the president's house, and he remained a familiar sight walking along its wooded paths. He died in Bloomington. The institution he developed commemorated his work with many memorials, including the William Lowe Bryan Hall, the main administration building at Indiana University, and his hometown also named in his honor Bryan Park, a large municipal park.</p><p> * Bryan's papers are in the Indiana University Archives.

<p>Herman B Wells was born on June 7, 1902, in Jamestown, Indiana to Joseph and Anna Wells. In 1920, he graduated from Lebanon High School. Wells initially enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign but transferred to Indiana University in 1921 at the beginning of his sophomore year. While a student at IU, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity, treasurer of the Union Board, member of the YMCA Cabinet, and business manager of the YMCA Red Book. Wells graduated from IU in 1924 with a Bachelor of Science in Commerce. After graduation, Wells worked as an assistant bank cashier at the First National Bank of Lebanon, Indiana for two years before continuing his education at IU. He graduated in 1927 with a Master of Arts in Economics. Wells began studying for his Ph.D. in Economics at University of Wisconsin-Madison but left school to take a job with the Indiana Bankers Association.</p><p>In 1930, Wells became an instructor in IU's Department of Economics and Sociology in addition to working for the IBA. He became Assistant Professor in Economics in 1933 but took a two year leave of absence from IU to work for the Indiana Department for Financial Institutions. In 1935, Wells returned to IU and was appointed dean of the business school. After the retirement of IU President William Lowe Bryan, Wells became interim president in 1937 and was elected the 11th President of Indiana University in 1938. Under the leadership of President Wells, IU transformed from a small, locally oriented college to a world-class institution of higher learning through expanded enrollment, recruitment of new faculty, construction of new buildings, new program efforts, and campus beautification projects. He was a steadfast supporter of IU's faculty and students especially in the areas of academic freedom and civil rights. In 1962, Wells retired as IU's president and was named Chancellor of Indiana University, the first to hold that position. His primary duties as chancellor included special projects, fundraising, conferring with private donors, administrative duties, attending cultural and athletic events, and acting as senior advisor to the university. After the resignation of IU President Elvis Stahr, Wells served as IU's interim president from July to November 1968. While chancellor, Wells wrote his autobiography Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections which was published in 1980. He maintained an office at IU until his death on March 18, 2000, at the age of 97.</p><p>In addition to his roles at Indiana University, Wells held many appointed positions over the course of his career. He served as an economic analyst for the U.S. State Department's Office of Foreign Economic Cooperation from 1943-1944, as cultural affairs adviser to the U.S. Military Government in West Germany from 1947 to 1948, and as adviser to the Ministry of Pakistan in 1959 among other appointments. Wells was a member and served in leadership roles for several education foundations. He was a member of presidential committees on overseas voluntary activities and U.S.-Soviet trade relations.</p><p>Wells was the recipient of numerous honors and awards including twenty-eight honorary degrees. Since 1962, Indiana University has given the Herman B Wells Senior Recognition Award annually to an IU senior who exhibits a strong academic record, as well as leadership and service to the university. The IU Foundation established the Herman B Wells Scholar Program which provides four-year academic scholarships to a selective group of IU Bloomington students. The main library at IU Bloomington was named the Herman B Wells Library in his honor in 2005.</p><p>Please see Jim Capshew's brief biography of Herman Wells at <extref xlink:href="http://www.indiana.edu/~libarch/Wells/wellsbio.html">http://www.indiana.edu/~libarch/Wells/wellsbio.html.</extref></p> </bioghist>

<p>In 1914, the Bureau of Public Discussion was established as a part of the Extension Division to respond to all letters to the university requesting information. The new Bureau first functioned as a lending library for the entire state, until this type of service was developed through the Indiana State Library. The Bureau collected materials and lent package libraries consisting of materials from recent books, pamphlets, reports, official documents, and magazine and newspaper articles on topics of current interest. Besides materials on current affairs, files on biography, fine arts, geography, travel and science were also kept up to date with new publications. Aiming to stimulate intelligent discussion of current political, economic and social questions, the Bureau assisted civic discussion clubs, debating societies, and literary clubs with recommendations regarding organizational procedures and suitable questions for debate and topics for study, and with bibliographies on current issues. Furthermore, in an effort to arouse interest in public discussion within the high schools, it conducted a State High School Discussion League.</p><p> By the 1930s, the Bureau was serving schools, libraries, extension and correspondence students, forum groups, women's clubs, and other civic organizations and had expanded to include a Medical Package Library Service; Latin, music, and mathematics contests in high schools; a loan service of classical and dramatic plays and advisory services to assist local dramatic groups; and a service to teachers which provided information regarding the improvement of classroom instruction and aids to the development of school and community programming.</p><p> 1945 marked a year of transition for the Bureau of Public Discussion in that the Bureau moved from the Extension Division of the University to the more expanded program of the new Division of Adult Education and Public Service. Under the directorship of Dr. Mary F. Anderson (1946-1961) and beginning in1949 with new library services available in Indianapolis, the Package Library Service was reoriented to exclude books and supply materials from specific periodicals and pamphlets carefully selected to represent a wide range of opinions and recent facts on current subjects of discussion. Additionally, special topics briefs were sent out by the Bureau from September to May, each containing quotations from many points of view on a particular subject and a bibliography for further reading on the subject, program suggestions, and other types of materials. In 1956, the Bureau was absorbed into the Office of University Extension.</p><p> Under the directorship of Robert W. Hattery (1962-1987) and within the Division of Continuing Education beginning in 1969, the Bureau continued many of these same programs and maintained an extensive library of about a half-million publications of predominantly non-book reading materials focusing on contemporary public affairs. At the time this was one of the largest collections of materials on current affairs in the United States. The Bureau also regularly convened conferences, seminars, workshops, and non-credit short courses on topics of current interest. Furthermore, for those individuals or groups unable to attend meetings away from home, the Bureau developed a number of home-study programs which included guided readings, structured group discussions, and analytical writing exercises.</p><p> The Bureau of Public Discussion was last listed in the School of Continuing Studies Bulletin in 1980; however, Robert W. Hattery continued to be listed as the Director of the Bureau of Public Discussion in the Indiana University Register until the 1986-1987 academic school year.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Joseph Bradford was born in 1815 in Maine, the son of Isaac and Shuah Jordan Bradford. His family later moved to Ohio. Joseph married Martha McMillian, and they moved to Indiana in 1854. The couple had five children: Perry (1859-1921), Eliza (1860-1933), Clara (1862-1940), John (1864-1941), and Albert (1868-1936). Perry, John, and Albert lived on the family farm their entire lives and operated the Bradford Sand Mining Company. They were also prominent landowners and active in their community. Eliza married Grant Monical, a doctor. Grant served during the Spanish-American War. He spent most of his career practicing medicine in Morgan County, Indiana. Clara married George L. Bush. The couple lived in Riverside, California and had two children, Bernard and Selma. The Bradford family were descendants of Governor William Bradford who came to America in the Mayflower. </p><p>In the mid-1800s, Joseph Bradford and his brother-in-law, Joseph Campbell, began acquiring land in Martinsville, Indiana. In 1855, Joseph and Martha Bradford moved to what is today known as Bradford Woods. Their sons Perry, John, and Albert later discovered valuable sand on the property. In 1877, Perry Bradford successfully submitted the Bradford Sand Mining Company's articles of association to the Morgan County chamber of commerce, and the family began mining the sand and selling it to foundries. Over the years, the business grew, and additional land was acquired through the 1920s. Although the financial records of the company suggest they found themselves in some debt, the Bradfords and the Bradford Sand Mining Company survived the 1929 stock market crash. After Albert's death in 1936, all of the family's land and stock were transferred to John.</p><p>In 1938, John Bradford deeded 900 acres of the Bradford family land to Indiana University for the use of the Riley Hospital for Children. This area, now known as the Bradford Woods, was first developed by Dr. Reynold Carlson and the Indiana University Recreation Department. Under the direction of Dr. Carlson, the Bradford Woods became a day camp area for handicapped children from Riley Hospital. Today Bradford Woods provides experiential and therapeutic outdoor programs for both adults and children.</p> </bioghist>

The Board of Trustees preliminarily authorized a Personnel Division in 1940, under which an Employee Advisory Committee was appointed. The purpose of this division and committee was to serve as liaison for relaying problems, desires, and grievances from non-academic employees to the university administration, as well as to advise the administration concerning relevant employee welfare policies and interpret said policies to employees.</p><p> The Staff Council was officially authorized by the Board of Trustees in November 1951; it existed as a body of elected employee staff representatives democratically selected by and from non-academic staff at the university. The purpose of the Staff Council was to provide members of the university staff with a means of representative participation in the formulation of policies and solutions for problems affecting the general welfare of university staff personnel. The elected group provided a respected, organized medium of exchange of information between staff and administration which worked to promote the rights and benefits of personnel.</p><p> Prominent issues with which the Staff Council dealt include the establishment of an employee credit union (1956), employee benefits issues, grievances, leave policies, and educational grants.

Perhaps the most crucial objective is promoting the folklore discipline. By giving members opportunities to develop both personally and professionally, FSA seeks to aid them in preparing for their emergence as the next generation of folklore scholars. Likewise, in expanding the role of folklorists as both participants in and organizers of community events, FSA endeavors to bring folklore into the spotlight as a scholastic discipline. Through encouraging the efforts of students and facilitating familiarity with folklore among the communities in which we live, work, and study, FSA ultimately aims to propagate overall awareness of and interest in folklore as a vibrant sphere of academia.</p><p> Folklore Students' Association website: <extref xlink:href="http://folksa.wordpress.com">http://folksa.wordpress.com/</extref></p> </bioghist>

<p>Creation of a Safety Department was authorized in 1939. Throughout the period following World War II, security functions expanded to meet the needs of a rapidly growing university community. From a staff consisting of one assistant to the Dean of Students in the late 1940's, the Bloomington Safety Division grew to a force of approximately 50 officers in 20 years. The security force at the Indianapolis campus was about the same size by 1970. The other regional campuses had only informal safety or security operations prior to that year. Since the duties of these separate organizations were primarily custodial, it was considered sufficient for them to derive authority as security forces from special police or deputy sheriff commissions.</p><p> In 1970, in response to a perceived need for a more sophisticated campus law enforcement agency, the president of the University initiated a plan to reorganize safety operations statewide. In cooperation with other state universities, I.U. prepared H.B. 1358 for consideration by the 1971 Indiana General Assembly. The bill, as amended, was signed into law on March 30, 1971 (I.C. 20-12-3.5-1 et seq.), enabling the Boards of Trustees of the universities concerned to appoint police officers. On April 24, 1971, the Trustees of Indiana University passed a <extref xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/65eqezd">resolution</extref> implementing the law that established University Safety as a fully empowered law enforcement agency. The office was given jurisdiction on all regional campuses, with the exception of Fort Wayne, which was within the jurisdiction of Purdue University. A new organizational structure for the Office of University Safety, implemented in 1971 and revised in 1973, included three operational divisions (Bloomington, Indianapolis, and Regional), as well as the I.U. Police Academy, which operated a police cadet program for students.</p><p> The Department of University Safety is now known as the Indiana University Police Department. Records in this collection indicate that the terms were used in interchangeably for many years, which caused some confusion for university administrators, faculty, and students. In light of this, "Indiana University Police Department" became the favored term in the mid 1970s, though it is not clear when this change was made official.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Born July 18, 1872 on a farm near Germantown (Wayne County, Indiana), Frank Orman Beck came to Indiana University as a student in 1890, receiving his A.B. in 1894 and A.M. in 1895 both in comparative literature. As an undergraduate he wrote a series of editorials in <title render="italic">The Indiana Daily Student</title> which were instrumental in the organization of the <title render="italic">Arbutus</title> yearbook which began in 1894. He was a charter member (1892) of the university's chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity, and secretary for the YMCA.</p><p> While teaching part-time his senior year at Bloomington High School, he met then student Daisy Woodward– a native of Monroe County and direct descendent of Colonel John Ketcham, one of the original IU trustees. The two married on July 23, 1899 shortly after she received her A.B. degree from the University. That fall the two moved to Boston, where she attended the New England Conservatory of Music and he Boston and Harvard Universities. He later went on earn a theology degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Edinburgh University in Scotland. </p><p> Upon their return to the United States in 1912, the Becks settled in Chicago where Frank spent over 25 years serving as a teacher, minister, and social worker. He served as a professor at the Garrett Biblical Institute of Northwestern University, minister of the Wabash Avenue Methodist Church in the infamous First Ward on the fringe of The Loop, the first survey director for the Chicago Welfare department, the executive secretary of the Chicago Inter-Church World Movement and worked with Jane Adams in Hull House and in the missions along <emph render="doublequote">Skid Row.</emph> Drawing from each of these experiences, in 1956 he published the book <title render="italic">Hobohemia.</title> </p><p> Retiring in 1934, Frank and Daisy returned to their alma mater where neither held official positions at the university, but rather served as unofficial counselors to the student body and the administration. In 1937, at the request of President Wells, Frank Beck began work to organize what would become the University Committee on Religion which consisted of representatives from various religious faiths and sought to ease prejudice with tolerance and understanding. The related Student Religious Cabinet formed shortly thereafter. As the programs grew, the Beck's began a nearly twenty year campaign to build a place of worship on campus for those of all faiths, and in 1957 thanks in large part to their own donation Beck Chapel was dedicated. The chapel houses the symbols of the Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and Muslim faiths. Until his death, Frank served as the chapel Curator, presiding over the weddings of numerous students. </p><p> While working with Indiana University's religious programs, Beck was also extensively involved with community concerns such as issues effecting the elderly and race relations. Beck founded the Borrowed Time Club for senior citizens in 1949 which sought to combat the widely accepted notion of the social uselessness of the elderly, and was the first chair of the State Commission on the Aged and the Aging. In 1965 Beck was recognized by the state of Indiana for his work on behalf of senior citizens. In 1959 following on the path of his previous work for social and racial equality in Chicago, Beck published <emph render="doublequote">Some Aspects of Race Relations at Indiana University.</emph> </p><p> Frank preceded his wife in death on August 17, 1968, at the age of 96, and she followed nearly four years later on April 24, 1972 at the age of 95.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Government Publications Department (GPD) at Indiana University, now known as Government Information and Kent Cooper Services, has always aimed to make government information and publications free and readily accessible to the public. Under its past and current titles, the GPD's responsibilities have been and still are to select, acquire and make available publications from city, county, state and federal governments. Additionally, the GPD has always maintained a selection of publications from foreign governments and international organizations. </p><p> At one point the GPD took part in the Documents Expediting Project (DOCEX), which was started by the Library of Congress in 1946. DOCEX was a unique program in that it provided a way to obtain documents that had previously been confidential or otherwise unattainable for the public, such as records relating to the U.S. involvement in World War II. While DOCEX was discontinued in 2004, the GPD continues to obtain government publications through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), as well as the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO).</p> </bioghist>

<p>First established in 1962, Indiana University's Undergraduate Library (UGL) was founded with the intention of providing undergraduate students with resources and programs more suitable to their needs than what was being offered by IU's Main Library. From 1962 to 1969, UGL contained between 33,000 and 65,000 books and periodicals, occupied three floors of space and was housed in what is today known as Joseph A. Franklin Hall. In 1969, UGL was moved to its present-day location in the west tower of the Herman B Wells Library.</p><p> Proud of its brightly-lit reading areas, reserve reading rooms and media materials, UGL also became known for its Media Center, its career reference and browsing collections, as well as the Resource Center for the Visually Impaired. Additionally, UGL played a key role in developing an innovative bibliographic instruction program for IU in the 1970s.</p><p> As a result of its merger with the Halls of Residence Libraries (HRL), the Undergraduate Library changed its official title in 1982, becoming the Undergraduate Library Services Department (UGLS). In more recent history, UGLS has been partnered with the Information Commons (IC), and is still committed to providing quality resources, support and information to undergraduate students at Indiana University.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Construction on John Watson Foster Quadrangle began in January, 1961 and was completed in July, 1963. However, the housing crisis was so severe that 400 male students moved into Shea and Martin Halls at the start of the 1962 Fall semester. They were joined the following January by nearly 500 female students when Harper Hall and Gresham Cafeteria were finally opened. It took another nine months for all of the lounges to be furnished and the heating system to be installed. Foster Quad was designed to house 1189 students in a six-building "mini-university," complete with dining hall, recreation areas, café/diner, classroom, laundry facilities, library, and its own branch of the IU Student Bookstore. Foster was dedicated on May 4, 1966, during the Founder's Day Ceremonies along with the newly completed Briscoe, McNutt, and Willkie Quadrangles.</p><p> Foster Quad Student Government was established directly following the opening of the quad and was immediately admitted to the Residence Halls Association. The Indiana University Student Government (now IUSA) was more reticent to allow FQSG a seat on the Student Senate, but the issue was resolved quickly, and Foster was admitted to IUSG on March 26, 1963.</p><p> The Board of Governors is the legislative arm of the Foster Quad Student Government and is comprised of twenty-three governors, each one representing a floor in one of the five residence halls and elected by the students living on that floor. The Executive Council reports to and is in attendance at the BOG meetings; however, Executive Council members do not have a vote. The Executive Vice-President presides over BOG meetings, while the Judicial Board Chairperson serves as parliamentarian.</p><p> The Executive Board is elected every spring semester by the entire Foster Quad Student Body and consists of seven voting members and six non-voting members. The voting members are: President; Executive Vice-President; Financial Vice-President; Communications Vice-President; Programming Vice-President; Administrative Vice-President; and Executive Secretary. The non-voting members are: Recreational Sports Coordinator; IUSA Senator; President of the Black Student Union; President of the Foster International Living/Learning Center (FILLC); Foster Against Driving Drunk (FADD) President; and Social Coordinator. Members of both the BOG and the EC serve on a multitude of committees, including the Steering Committee, Special Affairs Committee, Community Council, Foods Committee and the Center Store Board.</p><p> In February of 1965 Foster Quad established its own student run radio station, "Radio-Foster WFQR." Initially broadcasts only reached Harper Hall, but with the installation of an amplifier and completion of the FM tuner the station was soon broadcasting to the entire quad, 24 hours a day. For a time, Foster Quad also had its own newspaper, the <emph render="italic">Penetrator</emph>.</p><p> The 1970s saw the FQSG continue to grow. The creation of the Foster Project or Foster Seminar Program was the first attempt on campus to teach classes in the Residential Halls. Eventually the Foster Project became the campus-wide Residential Education Program, teaching classes on topics such as evolution and the use of drugs, Existentialism, and rock lyrics, among others. Foster Quadrangle also created the successful Community Council system which allows students and administrators to work together to make the decisions that affect life in Foster. Like the Residential Education Program, the Community Council system spread to encompass the entire Residence Halls Association.</p><p> Significant Foster Government accomplishments in the 1980s and 1990s include the chartering, building, and opening of Foster's weight room, the establishment of a successful aerobics program in 1986, and two years later the passing of a smoking ban for the Foster Center Store. During this time the FQSG continued to play an important role on campus, supporting annual activities like United Way's Miss-a-Meal, Red Cross blood drives, Little 500 events, and Miss Gay IU. Foster also supported such nationwide and campus groups as the Hip Hop Congress and OUT.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Indiana Club was first established at Indiana University on December 9, 1904. The club was reorganized September 29th, 1905 in an effort to resolve issues that had been problems during its first year. For example, the club had trouble obtaining regular membership and lacked a system to keep track of who was a member and who was not. The club was created to deal with political issues among student clubs, primarily due to the fact that fraternity and sorority members (the "Greeks"), had more clout in campus clubs than did those who were unaffiliated (the "barbs"), despite the fact that the latter made up the majority of the student population. It got to a point where the "barbs" had trouble getting involved with student organizations unless they could gain political support. The Indiana Club was first called the Barb Organization, but the name was changed at its first official meeting.</p><p> The aims of the club were primarily social and literary, although politics and athletics were part of it as well. Social events were held for members and friends, and literary programs highlighting original works such as plays were regularly held. Any IU student who was not a member of a fraternity or other organization that stood "as a unit socially and politically" (1905 Arbutus) were eligible for membership. The club is last mentioned in the Arbutus in 1929, and a letter to Alumni members dated June 1, 1929, states as follows:</p><p> "As for the Club itself, there is not much to tell. The members were very hopeful last fall, but with a debt of over five hundred dollars… hanging over them, they say they do not feel encouraged to get new people into the organization. … The debt, of course, will be cared for… but the Club will not go on unless the alumni express a desire to have it do so."</p><p> On November 20, 1915, the Alumni Association of the Indiana Club was organized. Regular updates on members, including marriage and birth announcements, were given. Records in this collection suggest that the Indiana Club alumni group was still in existence in 1978, but it is not known how long it existed after that.</p> </bioghist>

<p>George List was born George Harold Lisitsky in Tucson, Arizona in 1911. In 1933, he graduated from The Julliard School with a diploma in flute performance, and in 1941, earned a Bachelor's degree in music education from Columbia University. After completing a Master's in the same field at Columbia in 1945, he went onto earn a PhD in music theory with minors in composition and education from Indiana University in 1954. Throughout his life, List remained active as a musician, composer, and scholar of ethnomusicology and folklore.</p><p> Before entering academia, List had a career as a school music teacher in New York City. In 1934, he established and directed the Madison Square Boys Club, a music school for underprivileged children in Manhattan. From 1939-1943, List remained in New York, teaching and directing several orchestras and bands in public school systems, as well as conducting for the International Workers Order. During this time, he was also active as a performing flutist in New York and Denver, and also published several compositions for flute, piano, voice, orchestra, and band.</p><p> List began his academic career as an Instructor of Music at Colorado College from 1945-1946, then quickly became Assistant Professor (1946-1948) and Associate Professor (1948-1953) of music at Miami University in Ohio. He moved to Indiana University in 1954, where he remained until his retirement in 1976. During this time, he was prominent in the establishment of the Archives of Traditional Music and the Ethnomusicology program.</p><p> During his time at Indiana University, List taught courses in folk music, music, anthropology, and folklore, and served as Director of the Archives of Traditional Music from 1954-1976 and Director of the Inter-American Program in Ethnomusicology at Indiana University from 1966-1976. His primary research interests included folk music, the traditional music of the Hopi tribes of Northern Arizona, as well as the music of indigenous tribes in the Caribbean regions of Colombia and the Andes and Amazon regions of Ecuador. Some of his notable publications include Cantos Costeños, Folksongs of the Atlantic Coastal Region of Colombia (1973), Music and Poetry in a Colombian Village: A Tri-Cultural Heritage (1983), Singing About It: Folksong in Southern Indiana (1991), and Stability and Variation in Hopi Song (1993). He also founded and edited the periodical The Folklore and Folkmusic Archivist and created and narrated the television program Music in the Life of Man, produced by the Indiana University Department of Radio and Television.</p><p> List's most prominent contributions to Indiana University were his involvement in developing the ethnomusicology program and his tenure as Director of the Archives of Traditional Music. Since ethnomusicology was not yet an established field, List began his career as a lecturer in folk music, anthropology, and the recording and transcripting of traditional music. In 1964, he was appointed an associate professor in the Department of Folklore. In 1966, with the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, List established and taught in the Inter-American Program in Ethnomusicology within the Folklore Department. This program specialized in the traditional music of the Americas, Europe, and Africa, only the third program of this type in existence at the time.</p><p> Between 1954-1976, List also served as the Director of the Archives of Traditional Music. During this time, he formulated policies and procedures for the processing and use of the collections, making them accessible to researchers. His contributions were instrumental in turning the archives into an internationally known public research resource. Additionally, he was one of the first people to create practices for archiving and cataloging these types of materials, and some of his procedures served as models for similar music archives, such as those at UCLA.</p><p> List retired from Indiana University in 1977 due to the onset of blindness caused by glaucoma. Despite his retirement, he remained active in the field of ethnomusicology, writing books, obtaining research grants, giving lectures, staying active in professional organizations, and publishing articles up to the age of ninety-one. List passed away on September 28, 2008 at the age of 97.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The University Committee on Historic Preservation was established in 1968 by then-interim president Herman B Wells "to provide a means for discussion and recommendation of ways in which the University might take a leadership role in identifying the problems of historic preservation in the state of Indiana and in indicating how those problems could be met." He further suggested that the committee might investigate ways of developing historic buildings and museums and that it might sponsor conferences, tours, and the collection of data.</p><p> Donald F. Carmony was named the first chair of the committee, a position he held until 1971. University president John Ryan appointed a University Heritage Committee in 1976, chaired by University Chancellor Herman B Wells for the period from 1976-1987. The Heritage Committee included a Subcommittee on Historic Preservation (chaired by John B. Patton, 1977-1988), which was created to deal with preservation issues as they related to university buildings and properties. The University Committee on Historic Preservation was absorbed by the Subcommittee in 1986. In 1987, however, the subcommittee's parent, the University Heritage Committee, was dissolved, and the following year the Subcommittee was re-appointed at a university-wide level as the University Committee on Historic Preservation. Donald F. Carmony was named chairman, succeeding Patton. Carmony was succeeded by Philip Scarpino in 1989.</p><p> A notable subcommittee of the University Committee on Historic Preservation has been the Cornelius O'Brien Lecture Series Committee which was organized in 1972 to administer the lecture series on preservation begun with donations by the O'Brien family. The O'Brien Lecture Committee had independent status as a university-level committee from 1977-1988, but became a part of the Historic Preservation committee again at that point. The O'Brien Committee was chaired by Donald F. Carmony, 1972-1980, 1988-1989, and by John B. Patton, 1980-1988.</p><p> Another important activity of the University Committee on Historic Preservation has been to arrange an annual conference on historic preservation, which first occurred in 1969 has been held at various locations around the state.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Browning Society of Indiana University was established circa 1916 as a social and cultural club for students who had an interest in the poetry and other literary works of Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Students would meet to discuss Browning's works and the nineteenth century society that he created them in. Meetings were held regularly and would take place at various fraternity and sorority houses and other buildings on campus and would often feature special programs and talks by university faculty and students.</p><p> The Browning Society did not have a direct affiliation with the Indiana University English Department and membership was open to all students, male and female. Membership, though, was very limited. Students were granted membership by invitation only, and the club would vote before accepting any new members.</p><p> It is not precisely known when the club disbanded.

<p>The University of Islamabad project focused on establishing a residential postgraduate university with an emphasis on advanced teaching and research in science and technology located in Islamabad, Pakistan. This initiative included developing academic programs for Master's and Doctorate degrees, with the intent that graduates become scholars, teachers, and researchers at universities in Pakistan. At the time, most scientists and Ph.D. degree holders obtained their degrees at Western universities and stayed in those countries to teach and conduct research. The goal of the University of Islamabad was to create a university comparable to those in the West in order to reduce Pakistan's dependence on foreign countries for advanced scientific training. Part of the project plan was to bring Pakistani scientists back to their home country to teach and do research with the promise of a high-ranking university position, competitive salary, prestige, and a professional work environment.</p><p> This project was funded by the Ford Foundation and administered by the Office of Research and Advanced Studies at Indiana University, which was headed by Lynne L. Merritt during the span of the project. Chancellor Herman B Wells, who was President of the Indiana University Foundation at this time, also took a very active role in the planning and management of this project. Wells frequently traveled to Pakistan, both for preliminary research and to monitor the project's progress. He remained in frequent correspondence with Dr. Raziuddin Siddiqi, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Islamabad and director of the project in Pakistan, and served as the primary contact person between Indiana University and the Ford Foundation for this project.</p><p> The Ford Foundation grant began in 1966, and it is unclear when the Ford grant ran out or when Indiana University's association with the project ended. The latest record of IU's involvement comes from an order for a journal for the University of Islamabad's library dated 1974. There does not appear to be specific information about the termination date of the Ford grant or IU's departure from the project in this collection.</p><p> Indiana University's contributions to the project included the following: providing consultants for the organization and development of the University and planning of its campus, hiring visiting professors to teach short-term appointments at the University of Islamabad, recruiting Pakistani teachers residing abroad to the University, and purchasing library books, journals, and equipment. The grant also paid for visits to Western countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, for select Pakistani faculty and administrators to observe how several Western universities managed their institutions. Select students were also sent abroad to obtain PhDs, with the understanding that they return to Pakistan and join the faculty at the University of Islamabad.</p><p> Since Indiana University's role in the project revolved around managing the construction and staffing of the University of Islamabad, most of the work was conducted from the United States rather than Pakistan. Consultants and visiting faculty came from many universities worldwide, but largely from the United States, Canada, and several European countries. Indiana University was in charge of arranging these visits for all instructors, regardless of their country of origin. Visiting faculty and consultants from Indiana University included Vaclav Hlavaty from the Mathematics Department, Walter John (W.J.) Moore from the Chemistry Department, and F.B. Malik and Don Lichtenberg from the Physics Department. In 1968, Stanley Hagstrom from the Chemistry Department served as a consultant for the installation of computers purchased for the university and the training of staff.</p><p> This project worked to build the University of Islamabad from the ground up, including the construction of new campus buildings. In 1966, Indiana University entered into a contract agreement with the architect Edward Durell Stone to provide master drawing plans for the construction of the University of Islamabad campus. Stone was contracted to design the following buildings for the university: institutes of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences, social sciences, and Islamic studies; a library and administration building; an auditorium and community center; and student hostels and staff residences. Classes began in October 1966 in rented buildings containing the institutes of physics and mathematics. Future phases of the project included plans to create an institute of economics, followed by chemistry, biology, earth sciences, and social sciences institutes. The first new buildings designed by Stone opened in 1971. The collection does not contain much information about construction post-1971, but the project was eventually completed with brand new campus buildings and academic programs in all planned fields of study. In 1976, the university's name was change to Quaid-i-Azam University, the name by which it is currently known.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The University of Dacca Institute of Business Administration project in Dacca, East Pakistan was administered by the Indiana University School of Business from 1966-1970 through a grant from the Ford Foundation. Danilo Orescanin, Costic Roman, and Lee Nehrt each served terms as Chief of Party. Edgar G. Williams, Associate Dean of the Business School, served as the Indiana University Campus Coordinator. Initial short-term consultants were Joseph Waldman and Maurice Mandell, with other faculty members serving one or two year appointments throughout the course of the project.</p><p> The project was designed to establish a graduate level university program to provide training, research, and consulting services in modern management methods to students in East Pakistan. It was the only institution of its kind in East Pakistan at the time. Groundwork for the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) began in 1965, and the institute officially opened on November 1, 1966. The IBA offered an MBA degree, diploma programs, and short courses in the fields of management, research studies on business problems, and consulting services for the business community. Indiana University assisted by providing consulting services in administration and in curriculum development and by providing teaching and advisory assistance.</p><p> Overall, the Institute of Business Administration was regarded as a successful program. By 1969, there were 750 student applicants for 158 positions, 8 faculty members at the IBA campus, and 9 IBA faculty members enrolled in graduate degree programs at Indiana University. The increase in faculty allowed for a move to a larger building, an increase in the number of courses offered, a higher degree of specialization within fields of study, and a greater research output. Additionally, an internship program was developed, giving students the opportunity to gain practical work experience between their first and second years in the MBA program.</p><p> Indiana University applied to the Ford Foundation for an extension of the grant for the period from 1970-1972, but conflict in the region forced the project to end when East Pakistan seceded from Pakistan and became the independent state of Bangladesh in 1971.</p> </bioghist>

<p>During the 1930 summer session, Indiana University offered its first class for the preparation of school librarians. The class was taught through the School of Education and was offered only in the summer until 1938, when the class was expanded and offered throughout the entire school year. That same year, Margaret I. Rufsvold came to I.U. to help develop the Library Science curriculum.</p><p> In 1947, the Division of Library Science (DLS) was established within the School of Education, with Rufsvold as its director. DLS offered an undergraduate program consisting of eighteen semester hours of work and ten graduate semester hours that were only offered in the summer. At the time, the Division concentrated on training individuals for work in school and public libraries. Students focusing on school librarianship were granted a school librarian's provisional certificate in the library science area. The certificate was valid for five years and could be converted to a first-grade certificate if a Master's degree was acquired. In 1949, the curriculum was expanded to include a five year program that would lead to a Master of Arts with a major in Library Science.</p><p> In 1951, DLS moved to the new Education Building. The program grew further to include two new degrees. The first was a Master of Arts degree with a major in Library Science for persons interested in becoming school librarians. The second was offered jointly through the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Medicine, and was a Bachelor of Science degree in Medical Record Librarianship. That same year the American Library Association (ALA) adopted new standards for accreditation of library schools. In April 1953, after two years of preparation, the DLS was granted accreditation by the ALA.</p><p> In the early 1960's discussion of a new library building was introduced as the DLS program continued to expand, and by the end of 1964 the Program began to offer courses at the I.U. regional campuses. That same year discussions began to establish a doctoral program in library science, which eventually led to the creation of a Graduate Library School in 1966 and a split between Library Science and the School of Education. The result was The School of Library and Information Science (SLIS).</p><p> Rufsvold held the title of Dean for the newly created school for two months before relinquishing her administrative duties in order to teach full time. Charles H. McMullen served as acting dean from August 1966 through June 1967, when Bernard Fry was named to the post, a position he held until his retirement in 1980.</p><p> During Fry's tenure, the school was noted nationally and internationally as being in the top five schools in the field. Fry also initiated The Research Center for Library and Information Science, which produced major studies for the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Education.

<p>Menahem Pressler, an internationally acclaimed pianist, was born in Magdeburg, Germany on December 16, 1923. His family emigrated to Israel to escape Hitler and Nazi sentiments in 1939 when he was 15, and it was there that Pressler began his education in music. He was enrolled in the Tel Aviv Conservatory and studied with Eliah Rudiakow and Leo Kestenberg, before beginning to play smaller concerts and on Israeli local television. In 1946, Pressler entered the International Debussy Piano Competition as a contestant to be held in San Francisco, California, and flew there from Israel to compete for the $1,000 prize. His aptitude was recognized by the Competition's jury and he won the prestigious award, along with the chance to debut his talents on a North American concerto with the Buffalo Orchestra, as well as the Philadelphia Orchestra.</p><p> Pressler began his international career as a concert artist after this point, travelling throughout the United States, England, Belgium, Holland, the Scandinavian countries, and Israel to perform as a soloist, as well as with orchestras. Throughout this time, Pressler continued his studies with, first, Egon Petri, and then Edward Steuermann, before accepting a teaching position at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1955.</p><p> Concurrently to his teaching, Pressler co-founded, and was a continuing member of, the Beaux Arts Trio with fellow musicians Daniel Guilet, violinist, and Bernard Greenhouse, cellist. The group made their debut performance at the Berkshire Music Festival on July 13, 1955, now known as the Tanglewood Music Center (Massachusetts). The group set the standard for trios around the globe, and is considered one of the most enduring and widely acclaimed classical, chamber music ensembles. The Beaux Arts Trio has performed more than one hundred concerts and master classes in each year they played together, and made over fifty recordings. The Trio resided on the Indiana University, Bloomington campus each summer, teaching classes to students and performing in local, public shows. Over the fifty-three years the Trio performed together the members changed: the last configuration of the group included Daniel Hope, violin, and Antonio Meneses, cello. The Trio made their final performance on August 24, 2008 on the same stage at Tanglewood, before receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Edison Foundation on June 11, 2009.</p><p> As a soloist, Pressler has performed with some of the world's top ensembles, including the orchestras of New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Brussels, and Oslo. He has compiled more than thirty solo recordings, ranging from the works for Bach to Ben Haim.</p><p> Pressler has received much recognition related to his work as a musician and has won many awards including the Debussy Prize (1946), Germany President's Cross of Merit, First Class (2005), France's Order of the Arts and Letters (2005), Honorary Fellow of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance (2007), a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Edison Foundation (2009), and four Grammy nominations.</p><p> Menahem Pressler married Sara (of Petah Tikva, Israel) in the early 1950's.

<p>The Indiana University Libraries comprise one of the leading academic research library systems in North America, providing strong collections, quality service and instructional programs, and noted leadership in the application of information technologies. After Indiana College was officially renamed to Indiana University in 1838, the student body began to grow in large numbers. In 1841, when the University was only about two decades old, chemistry professor and librarian Theophilus A. Wylie created the first catalog of all of the books Indiana University retained in its holdings. In 1888, the library employed eight staff members, and although it was growing exponentially each year, it contained less than 30,000 volumes. From the 1940s through the 1970s, the University continued to broaden its objectives and serve the cultural, professional, and practical needs of the state. As the years went on and the University grew, library employees and university administrators were coming to the realization that the current location of the library in Franklin Hall, on the flagship campus of the University (Bloomington), was no longer capable of housing the entire collection and therefore no longer capable of meeting the needs of the students and faculty. A new facility would be required in the near future to meet these needs, and the process of acquiring funding for the project began in the 1960's. The construction of the Main Library was completed in spring of 1969, and it was formally dedicated in October 1970. By the mid-1990s the Main Library, build to hold 2,600,000 volumes, had exceeded its capacity by more than a million volumes. To address this problem, the Trustees of IU approved the construction of an off-site shelving facility and state-of-the-art preservation lab that would conserve and protect the Libraries' collections for an estimated 400 years. Designed to hold 2.7 million volumes and to allow for same-day delivery service, the Ruth Lilly Auxiliary Library Facility (ALF) and E. Lingle Craig Preservation Laboratory opened in 2002. Currently, the Bloomington campus is the home to 26 branch libraries and is ranked 27th among member libraries of the Association of Research Libraries. The IU Bloomington Libraries have holdings of over more than 7.8 million books in over 900 languages. Since the university's founding in the early 1800s, the Indiana University Libraries have grown from one room in the first College Building to a state-wide system with more than 10 million volumes.</p><p> Additional information may be available at: <extref xlink:href="http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gpd-web/iulibraryhistorysite/chron.php">http://bl-libg-doghill.ads.iu.edu/gpd-web/iulibraryhistorysite/chron.php</extref></p> </bioghist>

<p>Clarence Joseph Bulleit (later Bulliet) was born on March 16, 1883. During World War I he changed the spelling of his last name to Bulliet to avoid any connection to Germany. He grew up in Corydon, Indiana, and went on to study at Indiana University. While at the University, he was a writer for the Daily Student and became editor in chief in 1904. He often wrote poems that were published in the paper. After graduating in 1904, he pursued a career in journalism in Indianapolis, Indiana. Eventually he became a press agent for Robert Mantell, who was the Head of the Shakespearean Touring Theater Company. This job involved touring the United States and Canada, which he did for a period of nine years. One year was spent as a regional "advance man," or publicist, which involved traveling ahead of the company to promote the silent film, The Birth of a Nation, released in 1915. He briefly returned to his career in journalism in Louisville, Kentucky, until relocating shortly after to Chicago, Illinois, to work as an editor of the Magazine of the Art World, a weekly journal published by the Chicago Evening Post (later The Chicago Daily News in 1932). </p><p> Bulliet played a key role in popularizing modern art in the Midwestern United States and over the course of his career he published six books on the subject. Bulliet married his first wife, artist Katherine Adams, on October 22, 1905. They had one son named Leander Jackson. After Katherine's death in 1946, Bulliet remarried but died shortly thereafter, in 1952.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Born September 25, 1917 in Vienna, Austria, Alfred "Freddy" Diamant escaped religious persecution in 1940 and settled in the United States. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Diamant could not enlist, but was drafted by the United States military to fight for the cause of the Allies. After volunteering to speed up his service, he started basic training at Fort Knox, Kentucky and was later transferred to Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was selected for Officers Graduate School and served in Maryland. There, his commanders learned of his German speaking skills and he was trained as an interrogator of prisoners of war for three months. Before being sent to England in 1944, Diamant became an American citizen. </p><p> On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Diamant served as part of the 82nd Airborne Division. His team was dropped eighteen miles off course. He was fortunate to survive, but was captured and taken as a prisoner of war. After attempting to escape, Diamant was shot in the back by his pursuers and survived a potentially fatal shot. He and the other prisoners were rescued in the following days. His wound was enough to send him home where he enrolled at Indiana University and pursued his interest in political science. </p><p> He achieved two degrees in political science at Indiana University in 1947 and obtained his Ph.D. from Yale in 1957. He taught at the University of Florida (1950-1960), Haverford College (1960-1967), and finally, Indiana University, from which he retired in 1988. During his tenure at IU he served as the Chair of Political Science and the Chair of West European Studies. Over the course of his career, Diamant earned various prestigious awards, including the Guggenheim in 1973 and a Fulbright Senior Research Fellowship. He was described by his colleagues and students as a tenacious, courteous, and intellectual person who had a keen interest in both his students and colleagues. He married his wife Ann Redmon Diamant in 1943 and the couple had two children, Alice and Steve. He passed away on May 11, 2012.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Born in 1913 in Dana (Vermillion County), Indiana, Marvin Carmack attended the University of Illinois and received an A.B. degree in Chemistry with honors in 1937. After completing both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Organic Chemistry at the University of Michigan in 1940, where he studied carcinogenic hydrocarbons, Dr. Carmack became a research associate at the University of Illinois, working on the chemistry of Senicio and Crotolaria alkaloids. </p><p> Professor Carmack began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in 1941 as the Towne Instructor in Chemistry. He became Professor of Chemistry in 1951. During World War II, Dr. Carmack worked on contract with the National Defense Research Committee on high explosives and later on anti-malarial agents. Following the war, he began extensive studies in the field of organic sulfur chemistry. Awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1949, he spent the year in Zurich, Switzerland. He later held a Fulbright Fellowship at the Commonwealth and Industrial Research Office in Australia.</p><p> In 1953, Dr. Carmack accepted a position at Indiana University as Professor of Chemistry. The offer of professorship arose after Carmack attended the First International Conference on Organic Sulfur Chemistry hosted by Indiana University. Impressed by the University's administration and after meeting with then-Chemistry Department chairman, Harry G. Day, Carmack decided to move back to his home state. He formally retired from Indiana University in 1978, although he continued to work and conduct research for several more years. Indeed, Dr. Carmack remained involved with the Indiana Association of Science, undertaking a research project in the early 1990s on George Hale, an Indiana scientist who helped to develop the explosive known as RDX.

<p>The Grunwald Gallery of Art, formerly the School of Fine Arts (SoFA) Gallery presents contemporary works by both professional and student artists in a special exhibition format. The SoFA Gallery began in 1983 when the IU Art Museum moved to its new building and vacated over 5200 square feet of exhibit space. The first few years of the Gallery featured intermittent shows curated by faculty in studio and art history until 1987 when the University established a part-time gallery director position.</p><p> In 2011, the SoFA Gallery was renamed the Grunwald Gallery of Art in honor of John A. Grunwald, thanks to a significant endowed gift from his widow, Rita Grunwald. John A. Grunwald (1935-2006) was born in Budapest, Hungary, to Jewish parents. He survived the Holocaust in Europe, and came to New York in 1950. Grunwald graduated with a degree in Economics from Indiana University in 1956, and met his wife Rita during that time. Both Mr. and Mrs. Grunwald were deeply interested in art, and frequently attended SoFA Gallery openings, exhibitions, and discussions. Rita Grunwald worked in the Fine Arts building for about 25 years, both in the Bookshop, and also as a Friend of the Art member.</p><p> Today, the mission of the Grunwald Gallery is to present contemporary art by significant regional and nationally known artists, as well as by faculty and students within the school. Exhibits incorporate art from a variety of contemporary genres and approaches, and can be experimental or traditional. The Gallery is conceived as a visual arts laboratory with artists participating in the installation of their works and interaction with students and the public is encouraged. As the Grunwald Gallery frequently collaborates with artists, scientists and scholars, this results in the production of exhibits that interpret visual art in a broader scientific or humanities context. The temporary exhibit format provides the Gallery with flexibility to respond to opportunities and directions in the contemporary art world, allowing programming to evolve based on current trends and directions. The Gallery hosts over thirty exhibits annually of students from Indiana University's Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Arts, focusing on work by advanced undergraduate, BFA and MFA students.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The core collection of the original Chemistry Library was donated by Dr. Robert Edward Lyons around 1895. Most of those early works are still in the book collection with his book plates on them. From 1895-1931, the Chemistry Library was housed in a room in Wylie Hall. It was moved to the ground floor of the new Chemistry Building in the early 1930s. The library was extensively remodeled and enlarged around 1965, and the present quarters were occupied during the remodeling and expansion of the Chemistry Building in the early 1990s.</p><p> The Chemistry Library has long been an early adopter of new information technology. It was the first unit on campus to have a photocopy machine and the first to have a CD-ROM player. An innovative current awareness service based on the Chemical Abstracts tapes was offered for a number of years during the 1970s, initially through ARAC (the Aerospace Research Applications Center), then through the Chemical Information Center (CIC). Housed in the library, the CIC was the first unit on campus, and indeed in the entire state of Indiana, to offer online searching of remote databases through the Dialog and Orbit systems. Miriam Bonham, wife of Emeritus Professor Russell A. Bonham, was the expert searcher who initially provided the service. A complete microfilming unit was part of the CIC operations for many years, providing compact archival storage for laboratory notebooks and Molecular Structure Center reports.</p><p> In 1985, the Chemistry Library was one of the first in the world to offer the Chemical Abstracts Service Academic Program that permits low-cost searching of the CAS ONLINE files. For 10 years, this service was offered at no cost to the user. CAS ONLINE was replaced at IUB by SciFinder Scholar in the mid-1990s. Since July 2000, SciFinder Scholar has been available at all IU campuses 24 hours/day with full substructure searching. In combination with current subscriptions to all of the American Chemical Society journal Web editions and electronic versions of other chemistry journals (including backfiles of most of them), the SciFinder Scholar databases provide unparalleled access to the major primary and secondary sources in chemistry. Another resource that has been available to IU researchers at all campuses since its inception is the CrossFire system that includes both the Beilstein Handbook of Organic Chemistry and the Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry. The Cambridge Structural Database is also provided by the Chemistry Library.</p><p> The Chemistry Library remains open on Bloomington's campus and is located in the Chemistry Building.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Folklore as a discipline arrived at Indiana University with the hiring of Stith Thompson in 1921. Thompson served as director of the freshman English program and taught the first course in folklore at IU, The Ballad, The Folktale, and The Romance, in 1922. In 1942, Thompson established the Folklore Institute of America, a quadrennial gathering of American folklore students and scholars. Folklore was an interdepartmental program in 1949 and students could earn M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in folklore beginning in the 1949-1950 academic year. At this time, many folklore courses were taught under the auspices of the English Department and the program was housed in one room in the old main library. Richard M. Dorson was hired as a professor of history and folklore in 1957 and served as the Chairman of the Committee on Folklore. Under his leadership, the program expanded significantly in quality and quantity. The quadrennial Folklore Institutes continued through 1970, but in 1963, under the dynamic leadership of Richard Dorson, Indiana University formally established a permanent Folklore Institute as an academic unit within the College of Arts and Sciences. During the 1971-72 academic year, IU began offering a bachelor's degree in folklore.</p><p> Ethnomusicology was introduced to Indiana University in 1948 by George Herzog, who came to Bloomington from Columbia University. Herzog's first Ethnomusicology class was a two-semester Anthropology course, Folk and Primitive Music. In the 1950s when Herzog's health began to fail, George List, an Indiana PhD in Music (1954) took over many of his activities. List accepted a permanent appointment in Folklore in 1956. The Ethnomusicology Program was formally recognized as an interdepartmental program in the Folklore Department in 1980.</p><p> In 1978, the Folklore Department was established and Richard Dorson served as the first Chairman and Director. The Folklore Institute was established as a separate unit from the Folklore Department in 1978. The Institute promotes research and publication projects.</p><p> The Folklore Institute has a history of publishing prominent folklore journals. The Journal of the Folklore Institute (the Journal of Folklore Research as of 2002) includes articles of international scope and a prominent folklorist typically serves as editor. Indiana Folklore was a major regional journal from 1968-1980. Indiana Folklore and Oral History operated from 1980-1987 and was published in conjunction with the Oral History Research Center. The Special Projects unit of the Folklore Department was created in 1979 with the goal of obtaining external funding for publications, conferences, videos, research, and outreach activities. Between 1979 and 1992, Special Projects received $807,994 in external funding on 22 projects.</p><p> In January 2000, the Folklore Department merged with the Ethnomusicology Institute to become the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology. The Department carries out the teaching mission at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and the Special Projects unit promotes and organizes a variety of research and outreach activities.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Indiana University Honors Program in Foreign Languages for High School Students (IUHPFL) is a foreign language study abroad program for high school students from Indiana. The IUHPFL combines academic study of a foreign language with living abroad in order to emphasize both language learning and cross-cultural knowledge. Students admitted into the program spend five to six weeks during the summer living with a host family and engaging with the local culture. As of 2018, the IUHPFL featured study of five languages: Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish.</p><p> The program began operations in 1962, when David C. Munford, a former official of the Ford Foundation, approached Professor Merle Simmons of IU's Department of Spanish and Portuguese about establishing a study abroad program for high school students. Upon its foundation, the IUHPFL featured instruction in French, German, and Spanish, with sites in St. Brieuc, France; Trier, Germany; and Oaxaca, Mexico. In 2018, the St. Brieuc location was still active, with two more sites in France added in 1994 and 2010 in Brest and Saumur, respectively. The site in Mexico moved first to Monterrey, then to San Luis Potosí, and then in 2010 to Mérida on the Yucatan Peninsula. The site for the German program moved from Trier to Krefeld, Germany, in 1964, where it remained until 2014. In 2015, the German program moved to Graz, Austria.</p><p> In addition to the site in Mexico, the Spanish program also hosts sites in Spain. The first program site in Spain was established in the city of Valencia in 1996, with additional sites added in Ciudad Real, León, and Oviedo in 1999, 2005, and 2007, respectively. The site in Valencia was discontinued in 2013. In 2014, the program established its first site in South America, in the city of Viña del Mar, Chile. That same year, the IUHPFL also began a program in Chinese, setting up its first site in Asia, in the city of Hangzhou, China. In 2017, it began instruction in Japanese, with a location in Osaka, Japan. In summer of 2018, a program in Quebec City, Canada, will become operational, making it the fourth site in the French program. As of 2018, the IUHPFL operates twelve sites in eight countries.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Traditional springtime "May Day" celebrations were organized at Indiana University as early as 1897, when IU Musical Director C. Norman Hassler presented the May Music Festival, a grand concert and oratorio in the Men's Gymnasium. The "Indiana University May Festival" began in 1905 under the auspices of the Indiana University Lecture Association. Modeled on the 1897 event, the festival featured orchestral and choral performances by German, American, and local musicians in the Men's Gymnasium. </p><p> Starting in 1908, the Women's Athletic Association (WAA) and IU Department of Physical Education for Women co-organized the May Festival and highlighted exercises and dance programs at the Women's Gymnasium. By the 1920s, due to the growth and popularity of the event, the festival was moved to Dunn Meadow. The event included a "Dance Drama" program presented by singers and students from the Department of Physical Education's natural dancing classes. The Women's Student Government Association (WSGA) also sponsored the construction of a large May pole and the crowing of a May Queen.</p><p> The WAA and Department of Physical Education for Women continued to organize an annual May Festival through at least 1928, although other organizations such as women's residence hall groups organized their own festivities in following years.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Initially known as The Bloomington Gay Liberation Front in 1970, the BGLF formed alongside many other similar organizations across the nation in the wake of the Stonewall uprising in 1969 and was at first intended as a radical political organization and protest group. The group quickly became more of a social organization and changed its name to the Bloomington Gay Alliance in 1971. With this name change, many women left the organization to organize separately. Over the next several years, talks continued with the desire to make the organization more representative of women as well as men. To this end, the group underwent structural changes such as adding a co-chair position so that it would be headed by one man and one woman at all times, and in 1981, changed its name again, to become The Bloomington Gay and Lesbian Alliance. This organization sponsored many protests and an annual "Gay Awareness" conference, established a telephone "rap line," called regular meetings, and coordinated a wide variety of subgroups including a speaker's bureau, legal groups, and advice and support groups among others. The group was active until at least 1981.</p> </bioghist>

Lynn M. Jamieson (1946-) was born in Paterson, New Jersey. She spent her career working to promote and improve the work of park, recreation, and leisure. Jamieson particularly focused on youth and underserved population, as well as people with disabilities. The importance of this was personal to her, as she contracted polio at age 4 and had an active life as part of her rehabilitation. She had a significant family background in the field of sports and recreation. One of her grandfathers was a high school teacher. Her other grandfather, Walter Jamieson, was a park commissioner in Patterson and worked with his brother and Jamieson's great uncle, Charlie Jamieson, who played professional baseball, to establish a youth league baseball program.
Jamieson earned her bachelor's degree in health and physical Education from Muskingum University in the class of 1968. She then began her involvement with Indiana University, earning a master's degree in Physical Education in 1970.
</p>

<p>
In the years following her first master's degree, Jamieson worked a number of administrative roles in Parks and Recreations departments, in Corpus Christi, Texas; San Diego, California; and Johnson County, Kansas. During this time, she studied part time to earn a second master's degree in Recreation from Indiana University in 1976. She then went on to earn a Doctorated in Recreation from Indiana University in 1980, with a major in Recreation Administration and a minor in higher Education. Her doctoral dissertation was entitled "A Competency Analysis of Recreational Sports in Selected Institutional Settings." During her doctorate, Jamieson was an Associate Instructor in the Department of Recreation and Park Administration as well as working as an intern in the Indiana University Division of Recreational Sports.
</p><p>

Following her Re.D., Jamieson became a full-time member of the faculty of the Recreation Administration department at California Polytechnic State University, from 1980-1993. She primarily taught courses on commercial recreation and recreation administration. In 1985, she also became the Curriculum Coordinator of the Recreation Administration Program. Additionally, in 1986 Jamieson and her husband Stephen Wolter founded the consulting firm Leisure Visions, the name of which was changed to Visions in 1995. </p><p>
Jamieson joined the Indiana University Department of Recreation and Park Administration in 1993 as an Associate Professor. She taught undergraduate and graduate courses in research, sport management and administration. From 1994 until 1999, Jamieson served as the Assistant Chair for Academic Affairs within the department. In 2001 she was promoted to full professorship at Indiana University and became the Chair of the Department of Recreation, Park, and Tourism, serving as the first female chair in the history of the department. In her role as the chair, she also served as the Executive Director of the Bradford Woods, Hilltop Garden and Nature Center, as well as the National Center on Accessibility. She also oversaw the Eppley Institute for Parks and Public Lands. Her efforts within the department saw changes such as changing the name to Department of Recreation, Park and Toursim and nearly doubling the number of undergraduate students majoring in the department through marketing efforts. In 2008, Jamieson stepped down from her position as Chair but remained as a full Professor within the department. She served as the chair once again from 2015-2017, and retired with the title Professor Emeritus in 2018.
</p>
<p>
In addition to teaching, Jamieson conducted research on sport and violence, recreational sport competencies,, recreation management, and international sport and leisure policy. The certification program of the National Intermural-Recreational Sports Association was based on her research on competencies in recreational sports. As part of her lengthy research on sport policy, she was a visiting scholar in China, Australia, England, Scotland, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Turkey, Macau, South Africa, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Zanzibar as part of this research. She was a visiting faculty member at Beijing University of Physical Education in 1997 as well as at the University of Costa Rica in 2003.
</p>



<p>
Throughout her career, Jamieson was a member of a wide variety of professional organizations, published and presented prolifically, and was very involved in the Indiana University and Bloomington, IN communities. She contributed significantly to her field, and in 2020 was named a Legend within the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration, which she became a member of in 2005.
