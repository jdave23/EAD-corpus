    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>The Browning Society of Indiana University was established circa 1916 as a social and cultural club for students who had an interest in the poetry and other literary works of Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Students would meet to discuss Browning's works and the nineteenth century society that he created them in. Meetings were held regularly and would take place at various fraternity and sorority houses and other buildings on campus and would often feature special programs and talks by university faculty and students.</p><p> The Browning Society did not have a direct affiliation with the Indiana University English Department and membership was open to all students, male and female. Membership, though, was very limited. Students were granted membership by invitation only, and the club would vote before accepting any new members.</p><p> It is not precisely known when the club disbanded. The last date in the book of minutes is from November 1921.</p>  </bioghist>
