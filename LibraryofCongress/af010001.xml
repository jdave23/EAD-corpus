         <p>The collection consists of twelve rugs hooked with hand-dyed wool on
		  12-thread-count linen titled the <emph render="italic">Tell Me ‘Bout
		  Series</emph> created by Mary Sheppard Burton from Germantown, Maryland. The
		  rugs, which were created between 1993 and 2005, depict stories of rural life
		  and historical events experienced by different members of Burton’s family.
		  These stories, some of which have been passed down for generations, include
		  scenes of life on the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding areas in Maryland. Burton
		  retold this family history as bedtime stories for her four children. She
		  designed and made this series of hooked rugs which artistically retold the
		  stories. Color photographs of Mary Sheppard Burton with American Folklife
		  Center director Peggy A. Bulger were taken by David A. Taylor in 2006. Burton
		  was interviewed at her home by Theadocia Austen and Carl Lindahl, circa 2001.
		  During the interview Burton gave a tour of her house, describing the history of
		  the various rooms and the many pieces of art on display throughout her
		  house.</p>

         <head>Biographical History</head>
         <p>Mary Sheppard Burton was born in 1922 in Salisbury, Maryland. Burton,
		  who became a textile artist and teacher, was no stranger to the art as a child
		  since both her great grandmother and grandmother were rug hookers. From 1973 to
		  1988 Burton taught classes on designing, dyeing, color theory, hook art and
		  traditional hooking techniques at various schools and colleges throughout the
		  United States. Occasionally Burton also taught private classes at her home in
		  Maryland. Her students were diverse, from ninth-grade students to adults as
		  well as the mentally challenged. The individuals who studied under Burton were
		  not only based in the United States but also came from England and Israel.
		  During this period she lectured extensively and exhibited her pieces throughout
		  the United States, Canada, and Japan. Burton was instrumental in developing the
		  guidelines and standards for rug hooking and judging hooked rugs at local and
		  international competitions. </p>
         <p> In 1981, Burton’s dedication and love for the art led her to research
		  the hand dyeing of textiles and the color retention of dyes by experimenting
		  with vegetable dyes used by earlier generations. She experimented with the
		  different effects that light has upon yarn. Burton used dyeing techniques that
		  were not commonly used by textile artists. Burton studied the historical
		  origins of rug hooking, starting her research at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
		  in New York, continuing at the Textile Museum in Canada in 1996, and in Nova
		  Scotia in 1997. </p>
         <p>In 1994, Burton co-founded the International Guild of Hand-hooked Rug
		  Makers (TIGHER) and in 1996 was awarded an antique pewter loving cup for
		  outstanding devotion and service to the organization.</p>
         <p>For her outstanding accomplishments in the art, Mary Sheppard Burton
		  has received many awards. She was the first non-Canadian recipient of two of
		  the highest awards given by the Ontario Hooking Craft Guild: Best in Show for
		  Creativity and Craftsmanship and Best in Show for Artistic Presentation of Work
		  and Originality.</p>
         <p>In 2002, she co-authored a book on creativity in textile arts,
		  <emph render="italic">A Passion for the Creative Life: Textiles to Lift the
		  Spirit, </emph>with Mary Ellen Cooper. She died on July 1, 2010. </p>
