         <head>Biographical Note</head>
         <p>Joseph Brodsky was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Soviet
		  Union, on May 24, 1940. He left school in 1955, held a variety of jobs, and
		  began a program of self-education during which he taught himself Polish and
		  English. By the late 1950s, Brodsky had started writing poetry and producing
		  literary translations that were published in samizdat editions and in 1960 met
		  the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, who became Brodsky's mentor and advocate. In
		  1964, Brodsky was charged and convicted as a "social parasite" in a Soviet
		  court and sentenced to five years in a labor camp in Siberia. Following
		  protests by Akhmatova, Jean Paul-Sartre, and others, Brodsky's sentence was
		  reduced, and in 1972, he was forced into exile from the USSR.</p>
         <p>After his exile, Brodsky emigrated to the United States and in 1977
		  became an American citizen. In addition to teaching positions at Columbia
		  University, New York, N.Y., and Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Mass.,
		  where he taught for fifteen years, Brodsky also served as a visiting professor
		  at several other colleges and universities. In 1986 his collection of essays

                           <part>Less Than One</part>
                        </title> was awarded the National Book Critics Award
		for Criticism, and in 1987, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature. In
		1990, Brodsky married Maria Sozzani and was appointed Poet Laureate of the
		United States, 1991-1992. Brodsky died on January 28, 1996, New York, N.Y.</p>
         <p>Celebrated as one of the great Russian poets of his generation,
		  Brodsky authored nine volumes of poetry, and several collections of essays,
		  including

         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The correspondence of Joseph Brodsky (1940-1996) spans the years
		  1965-1972 and consists of twenty holograph, signed letters, cards, and
		  telegrams, some containing unpublished verses and drawings, from the former
		  poet laureate. This early correspondence is addressed to Kira Fedorovna
		  Samosiuk, an intimate friend of the poet, and while written largely in Russian,
		  also contains an early attempt at verse in English and an unpublished poem in
		  Polish. The letters reflect on a close and important relationship from the
		  poet's early years as well as document broader aspects of Soviet life.</p>
