<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>On September 12, 2001, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress sent a
notice to folklorists and ethnographers across the nation asking them to record on
audiotape the thoughts and feelings expressed by individuals and communities following
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The project was developed by Ann Hoog, who
collaborated with American Folklife Center Director Peggy Bulger in the original call
for participation. Materials were mailed to the Library of Congress beginning in
September 2001. The collection reflects the regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and
political diversity of Americans at the time of the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>The collection comprises 8980 items: 8100 manuscript materials; 386 sound recordings
(SR); 421 graphic and photographic materials (GR and PH); 20 moving images (MV); 15
electronic media (CF); and 38 artifacts (AR). There are twelve boxes of manuscript
materials divided into seven categories: Administrative Materials, Participant
Documentation, Unpublished Writings, Reports, Published Works, Internet Folklore,
Clippings and Online Articles. These include printout of e-mails, ephemera (from various
internet web sites), posters, newspaper articles, personal essays, narratives,
children's drawings, and other miscellaneous items that were left at the various
memorials.</p>
<p>The Participant Documentation series is arranged in sub-folders (a paper folder within
an archival folder) according to the participants' last names and the ID numbers of the
materials which pertain to the documentation. This arrangement ensures that the
interviewer and the interviewee, and the primary materials (sound recording,
photographic images, etc.) are readily identifiable. In some cases, there is no
documentation accompanying a specific sound recording, photograph, or other type of
medium. Therefore, in some sub-folders there is a "?" after the SR number. This
indicates that the documentation most likely goes with that SR number, but the name on
the form has not been linked definitively with that particular sound recording. There is
a folder entitled "Participant Documentation (Michigan)." Originally there were no tapes
accompanying the forms from Michigan State University (MSU). A few irradiated tapes were
found which were subsequently linked to Michigan State University (MSU), but could only
be identified and not played because of the extensive damage done to the tapes by the
irradiation process. The participant documentation is also divided into "originals" and
"photocopies" (as there was no way to verify which items had been irradiated, all the
documentation was photocopied). All photocopied materials can be served to readers.</p>
<p>There are twenty-two accounts of personal narratives and eleven poetic works within the
Unpublished Writings subseries, and they are arranged chronologically. These accounts
are the personal experiences of the writers on the day or days following September 11,
2001. Other accounts recall events in the authors' lives months after the attacks.</p>
<p>The Reports subseries consists of school projects that were submitted by several
institutions such as Hunter College, Colorado College, and California State University.
Each project was approached differently followed prescribed guidelines, which were to
capture the thoughts and feelings expressed by the American people in the aftermath of
September 11. For example, California State University presented its response in the
form of a research project which incorporated the use of posters, overheads, cartoons,
and newspaper clippings. The students at Colorado College, on the other hand, wrote term
papers based on the interviews they conducted.</p>
<p>The Published Works subseries consists of written articles and statements referring to
the events and reactions to the attacks of September 11. The works include excerpts from
the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Congressional Record</part>
</title>, press releases, photographs, flyers, brochures, and other ephemera.</p>
<p>The Internet Folklore section is a compilation of Internet sites that comment on the
events of September 11, through humor, images, memorials, legends, and Internet
warnings.</p>
<p>The Clippings and Online Articles subseries includes most of the California State
University at Chico reports, which contain a large number of newspaper clippings. These
clippings are included here and cross-referenced with the reports.</p>
<p>Note that the manuscript materials include database printouts that capture information
about sound recordings, graphic and photographic materials, moving images, electronic
media, and artifacts, all of which are available on hard copy and on a zip disk located
in Box 1, Folder 2.</p>
<p>The Sound Recordings series includes interviews with people who were in the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon during the attacks, and also people living in East Sullivan,
Maine; Des Moines, Iowa; Los Angeles, California, and many other towns and cities --
small and large -- across the country. Twenty-eight states are represented. The
collection includes interviews with teachers and students from elementary to graduate
school; police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers; secretaries,
executives, librarians, city officials, and people whose families have lived in the
United States for generations as well as those recently arrived.</p>
<p>There are approximately 200 interviews from New York City and Arlington, Virginia, but
the majority of the interviews in the collection was gathered from other parts of the
country. The content of the interviews include views on international relations,
politics, economics, patriotism, charity efforts, fears of flying, prejudices, and how
relationships were changed by the events of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>The total number of sound recordings given in the Concordance is accurate as of 2005.
Additional items may be added. All of the sound recordings have been duplicated. </p>
<p>The sound recordings database is available in the Folklife Reading Room organized by SR
number and alphabetically by the interviewer's last name. The recordings are arranged
alphabetically by state, institution of affiliation, interviewer's last name, and
interviewee's last name. Using the "find" option in Access, researchers should be able
to find a specific sound recording easily. A few sound recordings were added to the
collection after the numbering arrangement was completed so the last recording, SR386,
is not the final recording. The sound recordings were numbered consecutively regardless
of format. Hence, the compact discs are not in sequence. Although the collection of
audio recordings was the primary goal of this project, some people documented their
community's reactions in photographs. Therefore, this collection also includes
photographic documentation of some of the spontaneous memorial tributes created near the
Pentagon, and in other parts of the country. These memorials, sign boards, and
decorations all reflect the public discourse regarding the events. Candles and flowers,
written messages and drawings from children, flags and other items, collectively express
the grief and solidarity of individuals and businesses. The American Folklife Center
(AFC) staff took photographs of memorials at Arlington Cemetery and near the Pentagon.
The American Folklife Center (AFC) also received images from places such as Marietta,
Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Las Vegas, Nevada. The digital graphic images are
housed with the electronic media.</p>
<p>Moving Images are arranged alphabetically by state and institution of affiliation. The
Moving Image series includes interviews and patriotic songs pertaining to September 11,
2001.</p>
<p>Artifacts are organized by format and institution of affiliation. The artifact
collection consists of materials that were gathered from a temporary memorial site in
Knoxville, Tennessee or collected as part of a project. They include flags, posters,
copper signs, and a sample of the irradiated tapes.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The correspondence between Ken Lindsay and Woody Guthrie began in
1952, while Lindsay was responsible for the mail order record department at the
International Bookshop on Charing Cross Road in London, England. Lindsay first
wrote to Guthrie encouraging him to write and record material for the European
market. Although the recording projects and the European tours discussed in
their letters never materialized, this correspondence (1952-1953) captures the
development of a special relationship between two men who never met, but shared
a passion for music. The correspondence also provides a glimpse at the creative
flair and the personal challenges that shaped this period of Guthrie's
life.</p>
<p>In his letters to Lindsay, Guthrie discusses music, politics, and
family relationships and reveals his struggle with alcoholism and the disease
that claimed his life, Huntington's chorea. The letters also document
Guthrie's whereabouts during these years as he writes from Brooklyn, New
York; Jacksonville, Florida; and Topanga, California. Additionally, there is
correspondence from Guthrie's second and third wives, Marjorie Mazia Guthrie
and Anneke Van Kirk, who communicate details about Guthrie's personal health
and professional endeavors to Lindsay. Letters MS01, MS03, MS04, and MS24 are
even embellished with sketches made by Guthrie and Anneke Van Kirk.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Guthrie concluded many of his letters with the number
"30." This symbol is often found at the closing of a press release and is
believed to have descended from the practice of typing "XXX" at the
conclusion of telegraph transmissions during the Civil War.</p>
<p>There are fifteen letters written by Ken Lindsay, seven written by
Woody Guthrie, two written by Marjorie Guthrie (Guthrie's second wife), and
two written by Anneke Van Kirk (Guthrie's third wife). In addition to the
letters, there are four pages of song lyrics written by Woody Guthrie that he
sent to Ken Lindsay with his letters. Some of the letters and song lyrics are
embellished with drawings. The letters written by Ken Lindsay are carbon copies
that Lindsay kept of his original letters.</p>

<p>Italian-Americans in the West Project Collection contains the sound
recordings, photographs, video recordings, fieldnotes, publications, ephemera,
and accompanying manuscript materials associated with the American Folklife
Center's Italian-Americans in the West project. This project was part of the
Center's commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Christopher
Columbus, which was an element of a larger program on the Quincentenary
sponsored by the Library of Congress. The purpose of the three-year field
research project was to document aspects of traditional cultural expression of
Italian Americans in the western United States.</p>
<p>Field research conducted from 1989 through 1991 was directed by Center
folklife staff. During the course of the field research, teams of folklife
researchers explored the ways Italian Americans have defined their identity as
a cultural group in the past and present. Subject areas studied included public
and private aspects of expression, foodways, occupations, festivals, and
vernacular architecture. Multiple research sites afforded the opportunity to
map cultural intersections of ethnic and regional history. The sites were
chosen on the basis of cultural and economic definitions of the West, in
communities where Italian Americans have long been associated with the
distinctive economies of the regions. Fieldwork took place in the agricultural
community of Gilroy, California; the commercial fishing town of San Pedro,
California; the steel mill town of Pueblo, Colorado; several small mining and
ranching communities in eastern and central Nevada;several mining towns in
Carbon County, Utah; and the agricultural region of Walla Walla,
Washington.</p>
<p>The field research resulted in a large quantity of multi-format
documentation that constitutes the bulk of this collection. Other products from
the project include the book,
<title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>
<emph render="italic">Old Ties, New Attachments:
Italian-American Folklife in the West</emph>
</part>
</title>, edited by David A. Taylor
and John Alexander Williams (1992), and a traveling exhibition of the same
name. The exhibition curator was I. Sheldon Posen, who was assisted by Center
staff member Camila Bryce-Laporte and several contractors including Anne
Bowman, Victoria Brown, and Robin Fanslow. The exhibit opened at the De Saisset
Museum in Santa Clara, California, on October 12, 1992, and the traveled to:
The Nevada Museum of Art, Reno, Nevada; The Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum,
Los Angeles, California; The Museums at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York; and
the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>The manuscript materials provide supporting documentation for the
entire project. Included are archival administrative materials such as log
status reports that indicate the availability of reference copies, missing
original items, electronic versions of documents, and so forth. Documents
pertaining to the planning, administration, and promotion of the project are
found in this series. Also included are fieldnotes, graphic material logs,
sound recording logs, and video recording logs. This series also contains
reports on the project and information on the book of collected essays.
Finally, this series includes various publications such as books, articles, and
periodicals as well as ephemera (e.g., newspaper clippings and maps) that
provide background information on Italian-Americans in the western United

<p>The collection consists of twelve rugs hooked with hand-dyed wool on
12-thread-count linen titled the <emph render="italic">Tell Me ‘Bout
Series</emph> created by Mary Sheppard Burton from Germantown, Maryland. The
rugs, which were created between 1993 and 2005, depict stories of rural life
and historical events experienced by different members of Burton’s family.
These stories, some of which have been passed down for generations, include
scenes of life on the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding areas in Maryland. Burton
retold this family history as bedtime stories for her four children. She
designed and made this series of hooked rugs which artistically retold the
stories. Color photographs of Mary Sheppard Burton with American Folklife
Center director Peggy A. Bulger were taken by David A. Taylor in 2006. Burton
was interviewed at her home by Theadocia Austen and Carl Lindahl, circa 2001.
During the interview Burton gave a tour of her house, describing the history of
the various rooms and the many pieces of art on display throughout her
house.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The Discoteca Publica Municipal de São Paulo Collection consists of sound recordings,
film, photographs, and some manuscript material documenting the music and dance of
primarily Afro-Brazilians in northeast Brazil in the late 1930s. Accessioned in 1943 and
1950, it is the product of a four-year correspondence between Oneyda Alvarenga, Director
of the Discoteca, and Harold Spivacke, then Chief of the Music Division at the Library
of Congress, that resulted in an exchange of folklore materials. It represents one of
the first ethnographic compilations of music, dance, and ritual from this area,
presenting a view of the cultural life in those states before the modernizing influences
that followed World War II and the growth of tourism. The collection also provides an
example of the way fieldwork in Brazil was conducted at the time and includes visual
documentation of a fieldworker making sound recordings.</p>
<p>The music and dance in the collection includes work songs, songs without dance, dance
dramas, ritual ceremonies, solo dances, group dances, songs for children's games,
instrumentals, and songs and dances performed at Carnaval. They reflect the diversity of
cultural influences in the region: European (Portuguese), Afro-Brazilian, and native
Indians. For example, the bumba meu boi dance drama portrays the misfortunes of a prize
bull that a cattle rancher has obtained to improve his herd. It is of Portuguese origin
with added Brazilian elements. The caboclinho is a Carnaval group of Afro-Brazilians
that parade dressed as Amerindians, performing imitative dances to music provided by
Afro-Brazilian instruments.</p>
<p> The materials span the years 1938 to 1943, with the largest portion documented in 1938.
The collection is divided into four series by format: manuscripts, sound recordings,
graphic materials, and moving images. These materials offer access to the events by
providing visual and oral documentation.</p>
<p> An inventory provided by the Discoteca (in Portuguese) provides information about the
audio recordings and accompanying photographs. A concordance in Appendix A links the
audio recordings, photographs, and films for identified events. Besides documenting the
events, the photographic prints include images of artifacts, including musical instruments and
dance costumes, photographed after they were taken to the Discoteca. Books and notes
published by the Discoteca and cataloged by the Library of Congress may provide further
insight into the holdings.</p>

<p>The California Folk Music Project of the California Work Projects Administration (WPA)
was conceived and directed by Sidney Robertson Cowell and co-sponsored by the Music
Department of the University of California, Berkeley, and the Music Division, Library of
Congress from 1938 to 1940. Additional support was provided by the New Music Society of
California and the Society of California Pioneers. The resulting collection of sound
recordings, photographs, correspondence, field notes, and drawings documents the musical
culture, including religious music and folk song, of many ethnic and English-language
performers in northern California. The collection includes the documentation of the
music of Anglo Americans, Armenians, Assyrians, Basques, Croatians, English, Finns,
Hungarians, Icelanders, Italians, Norwegians, Russian Molokans, Scots, Portuguese,
Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Spaniards and Spanish Americans from 1938 to 1940. The sound
recordings were deposited in the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of
Congress in 1940. The collection also includes a few copies of instantaneous sound discs made by
Sidney Robertson Cowell in Missouri and Iowa for the Farm Security Administration in
1936-1937, and includes folk music research, writing, photographs, and technical
drawings and sketches of the musical instruments, generated by Cowell and by the WPA
staff who worked for her, plus related documents to 1991.</p>

white t-shirt, both with an image in black of Lena Spencer and her
Siamese cat, Sasha. These are accompanied by a letter from Dirk
Westervelt, explaining the history of the t-shirts (as a fundraiser to
keep Caffè Lena in business after Lena's death). The third t-shirt is
large, in black with a colorful design on the back depicting the Caffè
Lena building front and the motto "good folk since 1960." The front of
the t-shirt has a smaller design, in white with black letters: "Lunch at

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>Collection of field recordings, studio recordings, and dubs and production masters of
performances by blues guitarist Mississippi John Hurt, from the time of Hurt's initial
meeting with Tom Hoskins, at Hurt's home in Avalon, Mississippi in March 1963 through
various sessions and events from 1963-1965. The collection resulted from Tom Hoskins'
relationship with Mississippi John Hurt over the next few years and includes Hoskins'
interviews and photographs of John Hurt and his home; includes original letters from
John Hurt and Jessie Hurt, with Hoskins' collection of various published articles and
ephemera about Mississippi John Hurt, dated 1963-1999. John Hurt and his family moved to
Washington, D.C. and he became a popular performer in the blues revival, coffeehouse,
and folk music circuits. The collection includes an interview and performances by John
Hurt recorded in the Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C.
over several days in July, 1963. John Hurt and his family returned to Mississippi in
1966 and Hurt died soon after, on November 2, 1966. A selection from the March 1963
field recordings was issued in 2011 as the album Discovery: The Rebirth of John Hurt,
March 3, 1963. Spring Fed Records.</p>

<p>Woody Guthrie songs, performed by Guthrie with guitar and harmonica. Twenty-six new
songs were written by Guthrie on a one-month contract for the Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA) in May 1941, and were recorded during 1941 or later in Portland,
Oregon. These are likely the originals or near copies of the 1941 studio recordings
Guthrie made at the BPA Headquarters in Portland, Oregon. Some are first-generation
discs, others are second-generation or other copies; songs include alternate takes and
outtakes. Three of Guthrie's songs were included in the 1948 film "The Columbia."</p>

<p>The Maggie Holtzberg collection documents, through interviews and photographs, the
occupational folklife and craft of hot metal typesetters, compositors, and printers.
Holtzberg interviewed skilled craftsmen and women who experienced the disruptive
technology and transition in the printing industry from mechanical typesetting, "hot
metal," to computer-aided photocomposition or "cold type." She interviewed retired
printers residing at the Union Printers Home in Colorado Springs, Colorado and craft
printers at Heritage Printers in Charlotte, North Carolina, among others. Interviews
were conducted between 1983-1988. The collection includes the production files for
Holtzberg's book, <title>
<part>The Lost World of the Craft Printer</part>
</title> (University of
Illinois Press, 1992); correspondence with folklorists Archie Green and Judith McCulloh,
and notes from meetings with Holtzberg's dissertation advisors at the University of
Pennsylvania -- Henry Glassie, Ray Birdwhistle, and with Ken Goldstein, whom she
interviewed about his experience in the printing industry. The collection also includes
two journals written while Maggie Holtzberg was a student from 1972-1973 at the
Trailside Country School, based in Killington, Vermont. The Trailside Country School was
a traveling high school run by Michael Cohen and Diana Cohen that taught cultural
documentation. The notebooks include diary entries, song lyrics, music transcription,
and ephemera from locations throughout the United States where the students traveled.
Photographs include the 46 illustrations for Holtzberg's book, 31 slides, plus snapshots
from Holtzberg's fieldwork with printers and a few from the Trailside Country School.

Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri. In addition, 41 recordings were made of English spoken
by non-Americans from 23 different countries in Asia, Europe, and Australia, as well as in Mexico,
Panama, and Nigeria. The birth year of each speaker is documented and ranges from the 1890s to 1950s.
Samples generally consist of two parts: an impromtu monologue and a 44-sentence sequence highlighting
each English phoneme.</p>

<p>The collection is arranged alphabetically by state, and then by city, county, or region;
then alphabetically by non-U.S. countries. The identification codes were assigned by Joseph Mele: the first
two letters are state abbrevations; the following two letters are the race/ethnicity of the interviewee
(most often black or caucasian) and their gender; and the numbers are the year the interview was
conducted, followed by the birth year of the intervieweee in parentheses. Original order and numbering was maintained. Interviews were conducted by Joseph C. Mele, as well as other linguists
and recordists, described as agents. </p>

<p>Catherine Charron Labier tells folktales learned from her grandfather Charrod and
great-grandfather LaChapelle, who were born in Quebec. LaChapelle was a "boatman" (he had a fleet of Champlain Canal
boats and hauled produce from the Champlain Valley to New York City), as was his son. Catherine's mother grew up on a canal boat.
Lachapelle lived with Catherine's family in the French community of Whitehall, New York. Charron was a farmer in West Haven, Vermont,
which is just across the Lake Champlain Sarrows from Whitehall, New York. Until she went to school Catherine Charron (Labier)
spoke only French. These family tales have remained in oral tradition. Catherine is the first generation to tell them outside her family.</p>

<p>Documentation on the tape boxes was used to create the inventory for this
series. This information was partially transcribed and subsequently edited,
including abbreviations that were expanded and names that were normalized.
Logged recordings are included here, and the information from them used to
correct the inventory. Where possible, the title of the commercial
recordings has been documented. When recordings have been digitized, the
engineer's notes take precedence over those on the tape boxes; the archivist
has edited these notes for clarity. Further details about the recordings
appear on the tape boxes and accompanying manuscript materials. Dubbed
recordings have been noted as such. Unless otherwise indicated, interviews
were conducted by Pete Welding.</p>
<p>During the digitization process, SR215, SR740, and SR810 were found to be
blank.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The sound recordings are organized in approximate alphabetical order,
given the available information. Works by individual artists are
organized by surname and when there are multiple artists by the first
surname. If the sound recording is a compilation it is alphabetized by
album or project name. Events are alphabetized by the event name.</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: A compilation tape, taken from two different
sources, in two different formats. The first two cuts on the tape
are identical, aside from tape speed. (one is 15 ips, the other 7.5
ips in half track format). It is an instrumental, mostly
guitar-based and in stereo. It's not a polished studio production
which makes me think this was some kind of advanced demo. The other
four cuts on the tape are 7.5 ips and in quarter-track stereo format
(but the tracks are in mono.) I was able to identify the performer
as Ted Hawkins and are songs that appear on a 1986 LP on Rounder
Records (called <title>
<part>Watch Your Step</part>
</title> ). However, these are not the same mixes and one is a very
different mix to what was released. The recordings date back to the
early 1970s and were part of an album project that was completed but
never released due to legal issues. This may be a copy of some of
the songs close to when they were recorded. By the time this was
issued in 1986, they were remixed (or Pete had rough mixes never
intended for release). Track 1 and Track 2 are identical except for
speed. Track 1 is 15 ips and Track 2 is 7.5ips. They are also
half-track stereo. Cuts 3 through 6 are in quarter-track stereo
format and are from a Ted Hawkins LP project in the early 1970s but
not released until 1986. The mixes are different to what was issued
in 1986. They are also in mono sound.</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: The tape was reused for at least three projects,
going by documentation written on the box. The box is marked as a
1970 session tape for jazz-fusion band Contraband's Epic Records LP, <title>
<part>Time &amp; Space</part>
</title> (released in 1971); an unrelated recording by Pete Robinson
and Charles Orena from 1972; and an undated session with sax player
Warne Marsh. The audio appears to be Warne Marsh. No documentation
on the Warne Marsh recordings exists on the box, unlike the other
previous contents. The recording ends abruptly midsong. There is no
evidence this recording was ever mixed and released.</p>

<p>Logger's note: Pete Welding (PW) interview with the blues musician
George McCoy (GM), who often recorded with his sister Ethel, and
sometimes with his sister Ruby. McCoy and his sisters were related
to Memphis Minnie, whom he refers to here as his cousin. In addition
to McCoy and Welding, an unidentified man can be heard in the
background, occasionally helping McCoy with answers. An unidentified
woman can also be heard in the background (possibly McCoy's
mother).</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: The audio on this tape seems to have survived by
accident. It appears the tape was recorded in the half track format,

tracks,' resulting in very low-level, very hissy audio. Also, the
audio on the tape is split between tracks, with the first half of
the tape recorded at 3 3/4 ips on track one, and the second half

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>LC engineer's note: "These tapes contain an 'off the mixing board,'
full-stereo recording of a live KPPC broadcast from the legendary
Ash Grove club in Los Angeles of a Johnny Otis R &amp; B Revue that
should be noted and listened to. The sound quality is incredibly
good, as are the performances. There is no date for the show I could
find, but circumstantial evidence place this recording close to
KPPC's end as an "underground" rock, jazz, and pop station in 1971.
On a side technical note, Johnny keeps mentioning the broadcast is
being made in Quadraphonic (four-channel) sound, and while it was
technically possible and was being experimented with at the time by
numerous FM stations, the sound doesn't betray any evidence of SQ
encoding so it's doubtful this particular remote broadcast was truly
mixed and broadcast in the format."</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: This file contains audio from the left track
of the tape, which was in reverse (highly unusual). This was
corrected in both preservation and access files. This suggests
the tape was recorded in the half-track mono format and later
altered on a quarter-track stereo machine. The audio is almost
completely inaudible from 00:24:50 to the end of the file but
there is audio. It sounds like poor erasure.</p>

<p>Archivist's note: The recording is misidentified on the tape box as
"Joe Albany, #4."</p>
<p>LC engineer's note 1: Track 1 and track 2 are identical except for
speed. Track 1 is 15 ips and track 2 is 7 1/2 ips. They are also
half-track stereo. The performers and song title are unknown and
sound like an advanced experimental demo, not a finished product.
Cuts 3 through 6 are in quarter-track stereo format and are from a
Ted Hawkins LP project dating from the early 1970s but not released
until 1986. The mixes are different to what was issued in 1986. They
are also in mono sound.</p>
<p>LC engineer's note 2: Side 2, while not technically blank, contains
no audio information. It appears the tape was poorly bulk erased
before use, with only Side 1 subsequently recorded. Side 2 contains
nothing but loud hiss and a high frequency whine.</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: The tape appears to have been recorded on a
four-track (multitrack) machine due to the way the tracks are
organized. As a result all files from this tape were from one side
of the tape, as opposed to a true quarter-track tape, which would
need to be flipped to play back the other side. Both files contain
the same content; it is not a mistake in the transfer.</p>

<p>LC engineer's note: The tape was recorded in the half track stereo
format, but was also recorded on a four-track stereo recorder in
four-track mono format which results in a confusing number of tracks
for this tape, some of which have bleed through and bad crosstalk
from the mix of the two formats. However, aside from the main file
which is unique content, no other files were made from the remaining
contents because they are all incomplete snatches of commercial
recordings which hold no value even for research.</p>

<p>The Nevada Folklife Archive spans the years 1980 to 2017. The collection consists of
field work conducted by folklorists employed by the Nevada Arts Council Folklife
Program to document diverse communities and traditions across the state of
Nevada.</p>
<p>Tasked with documenting various aspects of life and culture in Nevada, folklorists
employed by the Nevada Arts Council Folklife Program collected the extensive sound
recordings, photographs, transcripts, and field notes retained in this collection.
The collection includes documentation of occupational folklife, including ranching,
mining, railroad work, nuclear plants, and the entertainment industry; expressive
traditions, including fiddling contests, cowboy poetry, leatherwork, glassblowing,
basketry, quilting, music, and dance; and examples of vernacular architecture on
ranches. Interviews and documentation highlight African American, Mormon, Paiute,
Shoshone, Basque, Latinx, Japanese American, Thai American, South Asian American,
Scottish American, and Italian American communities and traditions across Nevada. A
large portion of the collection also documents programs and events sponsored by the
Nevada Arts Council Folklife Program, including the Las Vegas Folklife Festival, the
Sierra Folklife Festival, and the Folk Arts Apprenticeship. In addition to field
work documentation, the collection includes correspondence relating to the
administration of the Folklife Program, publications from the Folklife Program, and
program files relating to the production of the Las Vegas Folklife Festival and the
Sierra Folklife Festival.</p>

<p>Juan B. Rael Collection comprises multi-format ethnographic field
documentation of religious and secular music of Spanish-speaking residents of
rural Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado. It contains correspondence,
administrative materials, recording logs, song transcriptions and translations,
and materials generated in the process of creating the online presentation.</p>
<p> In 1940, Juan Bautista Rael of Stanford University, a native of
Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico, used disc recording equipment supplied by the Archive
of American Folk Song (now the Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife
Center) to document <emph render="italic">alabados</emph> (hymns), folk drama,
wedding songs, and dance tunes in Alamosa, Manassa, and Antonito, Colorado, and
in Cerro and Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico. These efforts resulted in approximately
650 pages of print material including correspondence, recording logs, song text
transcriptions, excerpts from publications, and 8 hours of audio recordings on
36 12-inch acetate-on-aluminum recording discs. A later effort added one
graphic image: Rael interviewing Manuela "Mela" Martínez of Taos, New Mexico,
circa 1930, and a corresponding negative. In the process of digitizing the
collection for online presentation, materials including six computer diskettes
containing digitized LP liner notes, book excerpts, journal articles, as well
as digitized framing text, and one CD-ROM with digitized images were
generated.</p>

runs, samples of catalogs, and an obituary of C.S. Hammond.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p> Consists of 51 physical relief models called "terrasculptures." Created in
the late 1960s by Ernst Hofmann, a long-time head of cartographic design at
Hammond, the terrasculptures are thin aluminum sheets which have been
manually embossed to simulate the earth's surface in three-dimensional form.
By raising the surface of the aluminum sheets to depict elevated features,
or depressing the sheets to reflect such features as rivers and sea floor
depths, these models accurately represent relief and topography. Color can
be applied to the models to reflect the earth's natural vegetation.
Hofmann's relief models reveal the artistic skills that are traditionally a
major component of mapmaking. Once the relief sculptures were completed,
they were photographed to provide the base shaded relief found on the
Hammond maps, creating the impression that the relief actually rises from
the printed page. Using the same aluminum modeling technique, Hofmann also
created an 18-inch diameter globe, called the "terrasphere." </p>

<scopecontent>
<p> Within eight folders are samples of materials illustrate and document all
the basic elements of map compilation, design, construction and printing.
Map artwork contained in the collection includes works drafted using pen and
ink, stick-up lettering, and a scribing technique that creates the desired

computerize soundings, published in our 8x11 book w/ positives and
scale depths given. In order to use these profiles, these sheets had
to be glued together to make a continuous profile of the area across
which the ship went. The profiles also had to have spot depths with
peaks and valleys read off in uncorrected fathoms. These depths were
then plotted on a map along the track, then they could be compared
with other ship’s profiles which had also been plotted at a vertical
exaggeration of 100:1. Many published volumes of this project went
on to Colorado.”</p>

<p>The papers of
<persname>
<part>George Smith Patton (1885-1945)</part>
</persname> span the years
1807-1979, with the bulk of the papers concentrated from 1904 to 1945. The
collection documents Patton's military career, including his attendance at the
<corpname>
<part>United States Military Academy</part>
</corpname> at
<geogname>
<part>West Point,</part>
</geogname> 1904-1909; his service on the Mexican
border as a member of
<persname>
<part>John J. Pershing's</part>
</persname>
<corpname>
<part>Mexican Punitive Expedition, 1916-1917</part>
</corpname>; his
service as an aide-de-camp to Pershing and later as a tank commander in World
War I, 1917-1919; and his military career from 1938 to 1945. The majority of
the papers chronicle Patton's World War II service and his success as one of
<geogname>
<part>America's</part>
</geogname> most skillful combat commanders of
armored troops. The papers consist of eleven series:

<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany,</ref>
and
<ref target="oversz" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize.</ref>
Most of the series relate to Patton's personal and military activities and his
leadership in the development and tactical use of the tank as a combat weapon.
Additional papers concerning Patton's service in World War I are in the
<corpname>
<part>Chester Fritz Library</part>
</corpname> of the
<corpname>
<part>University of North Dakota</part>
</corpname> located near
<geogname>
<part>Grand Forks, North Dakota.</part>
</geogname>
</p>
<p>The
<ref target="diary" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Diaries,</ref>
1910-1945, illustrate Patton's activities during the
<corpname>
<part>Mexican Punitive Expedition,</part>
</corpname> World War I, and
World War II. The volumes, particularly from 1942 to 1945, document Patton's
daily activities and observations and reveal his candor about himself,
personally and professionally. They include information about American ground
combat operations in the campaign for
<geogname>
<part>North Africa,</part>
</geogname> the invasion of
<geogname>
<part>Sicily,</part>
</geogname> the liberation of
<geogname>
<part>France,</part>
</geogname> and the final assault on
<geogname>
<part>Germany.</part>
</geogname> Annotated volumes covering World War II
often contain additional detail expanding on the original volume entries. The
original diaries are dated through 24 March 1945, while annotated transcripts
continue to 3 December 1945. The Library did not receive the latter portion of
the original diaries. Additional topics include Patton's honeymoon trip to
<geogname>
<part>Europe</part>
</geogname> in 1910 and his fox hunting activities,
1932-1935.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="chron" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Chronological
File,</ref> 1901-1977, provides an overview of Patton's life, serving as a
combination diary-scrapbook consisting mainly of diary entries, correspondence,
memoranda, and reports. Approximately one half of the series is in transcript
form. The originals of these transcripts are located in other series. This
series also contains original items, primarily correspondence, that do not
appear in any other series.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family
Papers,</ref> 1857-1979, consist mainly of Patton's letters to his wife,
<persname>
<part>Beatrice Banning Ayer Patton,</part>
</persname> and his father,
<persname>
<part>George S. Patton (1856-1927).</part>
</persname> Early letters
chronicle Patton's struggle as a student at
<corpname>
<part>West Point.</part>
</corpname> His letters to his wife are detailed
and, like the diaries, contain frank assessments of commanders, subordinates,
and military operations. Patton shared not only his achievements with his wife
but also some of the negative incidents that affected his career, such as the
reaction in November 1943 when the press reported that he had slapped two
soldiers suffering battle fatigue in
<geogname>
<part>Sicily</part>
</geogname> and his remarks in a speech in
<geogname>
<part>Knutsford, England,</part>
</geogname> in April 1944 omitting
inclusions of
<geogname>
<part>Russia</part>
</geogname> as one of the countries likely to rule the
postwar world with the
<geogname>
<part>United States</part>
</geogname> and
<geogname>
<part>Great Britain.</part>
</geogname> Both incidents threatened his
career and almost resulted in his removal from the war. Also in the Family
Papers are correspondence of
<persname>
<part>Beatrice Patton</part>
</persname> and an autobiographical account of
Patton's memories of his father. There is a significant amount of printed
matter of
<persname>
<part>George H. Smith,</part>
</persname> Patton's step-grandfather,
concerning the Civil War battle of
<geogname>
<part>New Market, Virginia.</part>
</geogname>
</p>
<p>Papers in the
<ref target="corr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series, 1903-1945, include incoming
and outgoing correspondence between Patton and his staff, commanders,
government officials, friends, and the general public. Because many of Patton's
friends and colleagues were in the military, there is a significant amount of
material in the chronological correspondence that relates to military matters.
The official correspondence documents the planning of various combat
operations, particularly for the
<corpname>
<part>Allied</part>
</corpname> invasion of
<geogname>
<part>Sicily</part>
</geogname> and D-Day planning for
<geogname>
<part>France</part>
</geogname> and reflects Patton's varied duties as a
commander. The topical correspondence includes fan mail, inquiries on
casualties, furloughs and discharges, the slapping incidents in
<geogname>
<part>Sicily,</part>
</geogname> and Christmas and get-well letters sent to
Patton after his automobile accident in December 1945.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="milpap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Military
Papers,</ref> 1903-1976, consist of administrative files, Patton's personnel
file, and a subject file. The bulk of the series illustrates Patton's duties
while a combat commander from 1942 to 1945. The files include orders,
citations, memoranda, speeches, training instructions, policy and procedural
material, and reports concerning units Patton commanded. Speeches made by
Patton to his troops during World War II were originally filed in the Military
Papers, and this order has been retained. Duplicates of some of these speeches
are filed in the
<ref target="speech">Speeches and Writings File.</ref> Documents
relating to Patton's personnel file include both personal and official papers.
The official papers are included in a microfilm copy of Patton's file in the
records of the
<corpname>
<part>Department of the Army.</part>
</corpname> Prominent topics featured
in the subject file are the cavalry, casualty information, denazification of
<geogname>
<part>Germany,</part>
</geogname> displaced persons, and tanks. Much of the
material relating to tanks concerns the development of that vehicle and the
tactics of armored warfare. The series also contains material relating to
Patton's death and funeral.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="millib" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Military
Library</ref> series, 1907-1947, includes class publications from
<corpname>
<part>West Point,</part>
</corpname> intelligence and campaign reports, and
other material relating to military tactics. The majority of the series
consists of campaign reports pertaining to
<geogname>
<part>France</part>
</geogname> and
<geogname>
<part>Germany.</part>
</geogname>
</p>
<p>Items in the
<ref target="maps" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Maps</ref>
series, 1906-1945, reflect Patton's interest in cartography. Most of the items
are situation maps of the European theater and commemorative maps of the
<corpname>
<part>United States Third Army's</part>
</corpname> operations in
<geogname>
<part>Europe.</part>
</geogname> A map of
<geogname>
<part>Western Europe,</part>
</geogname> marked by Patton in March 1944
prior to the development of campaign plans, illustrates with remarkable
accuracy the projected route that the
<corpname>
<part>Third Army</part>
</corpname> would take in its advance across
<geogname>
<part>France</part>
</geogname> and
<geogname>
<part>Germany.</part>
</geogname>
</p>
<p>The
<ref target="photo" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Photographs</ref> series, 1864-1958, consist primarily of
items relating to Patton's military career, although there are a few family
photographs in the "Miscellaneous" folders. Locations featured in the World War
II pictures include
<geogname>
<part>North Africa,</part>
</geogname>
<geogname>
<part>Sicily,</part>
</geogname>
<geogname>
<part>England,</part>
</geogname>
<geogname>
<part>France,</part>
</geogname> and
<geogname>
<part>Germany.</part>
</geogname> Also well represented are Patton's years
at the military academy at
<geogname>
<part>West Point,</part>
</geogname> his tenure at
<geogname>
<part>Fort Meade, Maryland,</part>
</geogname> and his service with the
<corpname>
<part>Mexican Punitive Expedition.</part>
</corpname> World War II
"Miscellaneous" folders include photographs, some autographed, of Patton's
superiors and fellow officers.</p>
<p>Papers in the
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and
Writings File,</ref> 1900-1947, consist chiefly of articles, speeches, reports,
lectures, book reviews, memoranda, poetry, and memoirs. A few writings of
others interfiled in this series with Patton's texts are listed in a partial
index compiled by Patton. Prominent topics featured in Patton's writings
include the saber, the cavalry, mechanization, tanks, and tank tactics.
Patton's writings illustrate his early interest in armored warfare and indicate
his belief in the tank as an important combat weapon long before its success in
World War II. A 1937 paper entitled "Surprise" includes Patton's prediction of
an attack by
<geogname>
<part>Japan</part>
</geogname> on
<geogname>
<part>Pearl Harbor.</part>
</geogname>
</p>
<p>The
<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>
series, 1911-1966, includes biographical information, certificates and
citations, reports, and printed matter relating chiefly to Patton's
participation in the pentathlon in the
<corpname>
<part>1912 Olympics</part>
</corpname> in
<geogname>
<part>Stockholm,</part>
</geogname> his interests in fencing and
swordsmanship, and his attendance at the
<corpname>
<part>Mounted Service School,</part>
</corpname>
<geogname>
<part>Fort Riley, Kansas.</part>
</geogname> Also documented in the series
are the various medals and honors awarded Patton during his lifetime and
posthumously. The
<ref target="oversz" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize</ref>
series, 1807-1951, consists principally of maps, overlays, photograph albums,
and scrapbooks of newspaper clippings, correspondence, photographs, and other
printed matter.</p>

</geogname> Greene conducted correspondence spanning
1934-1983 with libraries and archives throughout the
<geogname>
<part>United States</part>
</geogname> inquiring about manuscript resources
on African Americans. An example of the wealth of material he uncovered through

<p>The
<ref target="res" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Research</ref>

African-American studies and multiculturalism into textbooks and curricula
nationwide. A project in 1964 to chart the representation of African Americans
in over 150 history and social science textbooks spanning 1941-1964 is
especially well documented.</p>
<p>Greene's commitment to the development of African-American history as
both a branch of the historical profession and as a means of black
consciousness-raising is reflected in the
<corpname>
<part>Association for the Study of Negro Life and History
(ASNLH)</part>
</corpname> file of the
<ref target="pro" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Professional

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Jefferson Patterson (1891-1977) span the years from 1824 to 1981, with the
bulk of the papers concentrated in the period from 1921 to 1977. The majority of the
items document Patterson's career in the foreign service on five continents, North
America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, from 1921 to 1952 and 1956 to 1958.
One of Patterson's most notable achievements as a diplomat was his instrumental role in
arranging a ceasefire between Israel and Egypt in January 1949 during the Palestine War.
The papers consist of eight series: <ref target="dia" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Diaries </ref>, <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers
</ref>, <ref target="cor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref>,

<p>Transcripts of Patterson's <ref target="dia" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> diaries
</ref>, 1928-1930, document his personal and professional activities during his last
three years as a junior embassy official in Ankara, Turkey. There are two copies of the
1928 diary.</p>
<p>The papers of Patterson's immediate family make up the bulk of the <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers </ref> series, 1824-1978. The
majority of this series consists of family letters to and from Jefferson Patterson, the
papers of his parents, Julia Shaw Patterson Carnell and Frank Jefferson Patterson, and
his sister, Mary Patterson Davidson. Patterson's letters to his mother comprise over
half of her papers and provide a detailed account of his life as a foreign service
officer from 1921 through 1950. Much of Jefferson Patterson's family correspondence
relates to his social activities and obligations as a diplomat. Letters to his mother
describing Berlin, Germany, during the outbreak of World War II and his duties as head
of the Prisoner of War Section at the American embassy are especially noteworthy. He was
responsible for ensuring that the prisoners of war of France, Belgium, and Britain were
properly treated according to the rules of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>The papers of Frank Patterson include personal correspondence and financial and legal
papers relating to the National Cash Register Company, which he owned with his brother,
John. Letters written by Mary Davidson concern family matters and news about her travels
and the various military posts where she and her husband, Major General Howard C.
Davidson, were stationed, including Montgomery, Alabama; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas;
Riverside, California; Washington, D.C.; Honolulu, Hawaii; and London, England. Also
included in the papers of Julia Carnell and Mary Davidson are letters of condolence
regarding the death of Patterson's younger brother Stuart who was killed in 1918 at
Dayton, Ohio, while testing an airplane. The airstrip was subsequently named
Wright-Patterson Field in honor of Stuart Patterson and the Wright brothers. </p>
<p>The <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers </ref> also
contain typescripts of letters written by Jefferson Patterson and his sister. The
typescripts were arranged previously in notebooks in chronological order. The original
order has been retained, and the typescripts are filed with Patterson and Davidson's
papers. The series also provides background on the family's early settlement in Dayton,
Ohio, and include letters of Patterson's grandfathers, George W. Shaw and Colonel
Jefferson Patterson. Noteworthy correspondence collected by the family, located in the
folder "Miscellaneous" (container 14), includes a letter of John C. Calhoun to a Major
Austin inviting him to assist in the evaluation of West Point cadets, 1824; a letter of
William H. Seward to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee regarding the
application of treaties to foreign countries and United States ports, 1864; and a letter
by William T. Sherman concerning the importance of doing one's duty in "any phase in
which fortune may find you," 1878. The general scrapbooks in the <ref target="mis" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany </ref> series also include family
papers.</p>
<p>The <ref target="cor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref> series,
1909-1966, consists of incoming and outgoing letters pertaining to Patterson's personal
and professional interests, including typed excerpts, 1921-1949, of Patterson's letters
pertaining chiefly to his foreign service activities while stationed at various
embassies. The excerpts, arranged chronologically, provide no indication to whom
Patterson was writing. Probably used by Patterson to write his books about his
diplomatic career, these excerpts approximate diary entries and describe his daily life
in the various locations where he was stationed, such as Peking, China; Bogota,
Columbia; Ankara, Turkey; Washington, D.C.; Breslau, Poland; Oslo, Norway; Berlin,
Germany; Lima, Peru; Brussels, Belgium; and Cairo, Egypt. Among the more prominent and
frequent correspondents in this series are William H. Beck, Katharine Kennedy Brown,
George H. Chaney, J. Rives Childs, James Aloysius Farley, Stanton Griffis, James Hugh
Keeley, Jr., John L. King, Harry L. Munger, Maxwell M. Rabb, S. Pinkney Tuck, and Edward
D. Vance. </p>
<p>The <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File, </ref>
1946-1978, consists primarily of correspondence, memoranda, invitations, and receipts
pertaining mainly to Patterson's life after his retirement. The series reflects his
interest in art and sports, his philanthropic contributions to various organizations and
causes, his active involvement with the Republican party, and the operation of his farm
in St. Leonard, Maryland, where he raised tobacco and Aberdeen/Angus cattle.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spe" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File,
</ref> 1923-1971, contains speeches, book drafts, notes and related material, and other
writings. The majority of the series is made up of drafts and notes of Patterson's books
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Diplomatic Duty and Diversion</part>
</title> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Diplomatic Terminus</part>
</title> and an unpublished work, "Flashbacks and Reflections."</p>
<p>The final series, <ref target="mis"> Miscellany, </ref> 1894-1977, contains
correspondence, financial and legal papers, notes and recollections, academic notebooks,
and scrapbooks. The academic file consists mainly of notebooks documenting Patterson's
business and law studies at Harvard University. The ambassador and diplomatic service
file, which overlaps with the <ref target="cor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Correspondence </ref> and <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Subject File </ref> series, includes a wide variety of material, such as clippings,
correspondence, and printed matter documenting Patterson's personal and professional
activities. Much of the material in the ambassador file relates to Patterson's service
as United States representative to the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans,
1950-1952. His notes and recollections provide a vivid account of the work of that
committee. Financial and legal papers document Patterson's personal business interests
and expenditures.</p>
<p>The <ref target="Add1">2018 Addition</ref> spans from 1909 to 1981 with the bulk of the
items concentrated from 1941 to 1977. Papers in the <ref target="Add1">2018
Addition</ref> complement the initial portion of the collection and consist mainly of
correspondence, family papers, and scrapbooks. The correspondence and scrapbooks pertain
chiefly to Patterson's personal and professional endeavors. The majority of the
correspondence, 1953-1955, relates to Patterson's career and his wish to be considered
for another diplomatic posting. The scrapbooks also include letters pertaining to the
books Patterson wrote about his diplomatic career. </p>

<p>The papers of <persname>
<part>Vincent Leonard Price, Jr., (1911-1993)</part>
</persname> span the years 1883-1992, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the
period 1932-1992. They document his life as an actor, art collector and critic, writer,
lecturer, and gourmet cook. The interconnectedness of his activities and interests is
evident in this collection. Price got his start as an actor on the <geogname>
<part>London</part>
</geogname> stage while he was studying art history at the <corpname>
<part>University of London.</part>
</corpname> Throughout his life, Price was a strong supporter of the arts and used his
celebrity as an actor as a tool to bring art into people's lives. He used the money
gained through acting to buy art. He lent works from his art collection and donated many
of them to galleries and museums. He served on arts councils and wrote on art and
cooking. He lectured on his life as an actor and on art. He narrated an academy award
winning film on <persname>
<part>Chagall.</part>
</persname> He appeared as an art expert on the television quiz show "The $64,000
Challenge" and hosted a cooking show. He exploited his fame as the star of horror films
to sell products ranging from credit cards to submarine sandwiches. Although Price
achieved fame by playing villains, early in his career he was considered a matinee
idol.</p>
<p>Price's papers are arranged into six series: <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers </ref>; <ref target="gen" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence </ref>; <ref target="sea" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Sears, Roebuck and Company Files </ref>; <ref target="spe" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings Files </ref>; <ref target="sta" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Stage, Screen and Studio Files

</p>
<p>The <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers </ref> series,
1883-1992, consists of correspondence and other material grouped under the names of

</corpname>, and his experiences in <geogname>

<p>While correspondence relating to specific activities is filed by topic in the relevant
series, the <ref target="gen" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence
</ref> series, 1938-1992, is arranged in chronological order and documents Price's

correspondence from the 1960s are copies of Price's handwritten responses or the
responses typed by his secretary, <persname>
<part>Wawona Hartwig.</part>
</persname> This correspondence includes letters spanning fifty years from friends such

</persname>
<persname>
<part>Mary Grant Price</part>

<part>Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art</part>
</corpname> which Price put together as original art for sale in <corpname>
<part>Sears</part>
</corpname> stores. Price saw this venture as a part of his efforts to bring art to
people in their daily lives. As part of this project he travelled throughout the world
buying original works of art. <persname>
<part>Mary Grant Price</part>
</persname> did the framing of the art work. Shows of selected pieces were sent to <corpname>
<part>Sears</part>
</corpname> stores throughout the country at prices ranging from as little as
twenty-five dollars to ten thousand dollars. Vincent Price made personal appearances at
many of the art shows. Other activities he undertook for <corpname>

1930s. Prohibition, military preparedness, "Cousin Franklin" <persname>
<part>(Franklin D. Roosevelt)</part>
</persname>, political campaigns, socialism, and veterans' benefits are among the topics
discussed. As a government official, military officer, and son of a former president,
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., received letters from ordinary citizens as well as prominent
individuals. These letters and Roosevelt's replies constitute a rich source of
information about the period.</p>
<p>Among the major facets of Roosevelt's career that are documented in the <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> are his activities
in organizing the <corpname>
<part>American Legion</part>
</corpname> in 1919; his role in the presidential election campaign of <persname>
<part>Leonard Wood</part>
</persname>, 1919-1920; his participation in the <corpname>
<part>Washington Conference on the Limitation of Armament</part>
</corpname>, 1921-1922; his race against <persname>
<part>Alfred Emanuel Smith</part>
</persname> for the governorship of New York, 1924; his expeditions to <geogname>
<part>Africa</part>
</geogname> and the <geogname>
<part>Far East</part>
</geogname>, 1924-1939; and his military participation in both world wars, which led to
numerous medals and decorations, including the Croix de Guerre and (posthumously) the
Congressional Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>Roosevelt was in much demand as a speaker and appeared before many veterans groups and
political gatherings. During the period between the world wars, he regularly campaigned
throughout the nation for Republican presidential nominees. The <ref target="spee" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speech, Article, and Book File</ref> contains the
texts of many such speeches, as well as speech requests and comments. It also contains
speeches and other material relating to his role as governor of <geogname>
<part>Puerto Rico</part>
</geogname>, 1929-1932, and governor general of the <geogname>
<part>Philippines</part>
</geogname>, 1932-1933. Roosevelt's many magazine articles of the 1920s and 1930s
usually concerned travel, the out-of-doors, or World War I and are preserved in
typescript form in the <ref target="spee" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speech,

<p>The papers of <persname>
<part>John J. Sirica (1904-1992)</part>
</persname> span the years 1932-1986 with the majority of the papers concentrated
between 1957 and 1986. The bulk of the papers documents Sirica's career as judge of the <corpname>
<part>United States District Court for the District of Columbia</part>
</corpname>, 1957-1986. The papers consist of six series: <ref target="cor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="usd" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> United States District Court File</ref>, <ref target="spe" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings File </ref>,

</p>
<p>The <ref target="cor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref> series,
1957-1986, includes incoming and outgoing correspondence relating mostly to Sirica's
personal interests and activities, although some of the letters also pertain to his
professional career. Also included are a few letters from Sirica to his son, <persname>
<part>John J. Sirica, Jr.</part>
</persname>
</p>
<p>Documenting Sirica's thirty years of service as a federal trial judge, papers in the
<ref target="usd" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> United States District Court
File </ref>, 1952-1986, comprise almost seventy-five percent of the collection. The
District Court File consists of five subseries: <ref target="per" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal Case Calendars </ref>, <ref target="uscor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="cas" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Case File </ref>, <ref target="ben" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Bench Books </ref>, and <ref target="off" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Office File. </ref> The <ref target="per" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal Case Calendars </ref>, 1967-1970, and
<ref target="uscor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref>,
1968-1985, document some of the administrative functions of the court and Sirica's
professional duties. The case calendars occasionally have notations about personal
appointments.</p>
<p>The <ref target="cas" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Case File </ref> subseries,
1952-1986, includes correspondence and memoranda, chiefly between Sirica and other
judges, lawyers, the court clerk, and staff, as well as extensive legal material such as
opinions, orders, motions, briefs, and transcripts. Papers in this subseries consist
mainly of photocopies rather than original items and are organized by category into
Watergate cases and other cases. Making up the bulk of the case files, the Watergate
files provide extensive documentation of the court proceedings relating to the 1972
break-in at the <corpname>
<part>Democratic National Committee</part>
</corpname> headquarters in the Watergate apartment complex <emph render="italic">(United States v. Liddy)</emph> and the cover-up of the burglary by high ranking
government officials, including the president of the United States <emph render="italic">(United States v. Mitchell).</emph> In addition, there are related cases involving
the subpoena of documents and tapes from <persname>
<part>President Richard M. Nixon</part>
</persname> and the transfer of grand jury reports to the <corpname>
<part>House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee</part>
</corpname>
<emph render="italic">(In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum to Nixon</emph> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>In re Report and Recommendation of June 5, 1972 Grand Jury Concerning
Transmission of Evidence to the House of Representatives).</part>
</title>
</p>
<p>The remaining case files indicate the variety of cases heard by Sirica on antitrust
matters, constitutional law, civil rights, government regulations, and other issues.
Many of these files are incomplete and often contain only one or two items, except for
two antitrust cases (electrical equipment cases and <emph render="italic">Riss &amp; Co.

<p>The papers of Harold Hitz Burton (1888-1964) span the years 1792 to 1965, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1935 to 1964. The collection includes diaries, correspondence, reports, legal case files, speeches and writings, newspaper clippings, and printed matter relating chiefly to Burton's service as associate justice of the Supreme Court and United States senator from Ohio.

</p>
<p>Burton's <ref target="diaries" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
diaries
</ref> begin in 1941 and continue through 1963 covering his service as senator and associate justice. They are a rich and comprehensive record of his personal activities, the work of the Supreme Court, and conversations with members of the Court and numerous other government figures.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
General Correspondence
</ref> briefly treats Burton's life and career in Cleveland, Ohio, prior to his election to the United States Senate. During this period he practiced law, was active in community activities, and served in various city government offices climaxing in his election as mayor. Notable topics in the correspondence are community affairs, family matters, Burton's association with local and statewide Republican party affairs, aspirations for a federal judgeship, and the Townsend Plan. Correspondents include Owen Brewster, John W. Bricker, Burton's personal secretary Earl E. Hart, William Hitz, and Robert A. Taft. This period of Burton's career is documented additionally by political speeches and radio broadcasts in the Speeches and Writings File.</p>
<p>The <ref target="senfile" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Senate File
</ref> represents Burton's one term in the United States Senate where he established himself as a moderate Republican. He served on several Senate committees, including the Special Committee Investigating the National Defense Program which brought him into close contact with its chairman, Harry S. Truman. Burton later would become President Truman's first appointee to the Supreme Court. The <ref target="sencom" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Committees
</ref> file documents his work on this committee and his extensive travels to Alaska, the West Coast, and the Middle East. Other committees represented in the file include Immigration, District of Columbia, Commerce, and Appropriations. The <ref target="sencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
correspondence
</ref> for the Senate years is grouped into four types: campaign, departments and agencies, general, and legislative. The campaign correspondence relates to party workers and organizations throughout Ohio during his Senate election in 1940. Correspondence with government departments and agencies includes appeals for constituents, especially for those in military service. Burton's legislative interests included hospital construction, foreign relations, and establishment of the United Nations. Noteworthy in the general correspondence are copies of Burton's semiannual constituent reports and accompanying responses. Correspondents include Styles Bridges, Harry Flood Byrd (1887-1966), Frank J. Lausche, Donald R. Richberg, Harry S. Truman, and Henry Agard Wallace.</p>
<p>The <ref target="supfile" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Supreme Court File
</ref> documents the judicial activities of Burton and his fellow justices from 1945 to 1958. Material covering this aspect of his career is organized by <ref target="supcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
correspondence,
</ref> a <ref target="supcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
case file,
</ref> and a <ref target="supmisc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
miscellany
</ref> file. Among the legal material and <ref target="supcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
correspondence
</ref> are letters, notes, and memoranda from the various members of the Court, most frequently Felix Frankfurter. Others justices represented, some in the correspondence file and others in notes and memoranda retained in the legal files, are chief justices Harlan F. Stone, Fred M. Vinson, and Earl Warren and associate justices William J. Brennan, Tom C. Clark, William O. Douglas, John M. Harlan, Robert H. Jackson, Sherman Minton, Frank Murphy, Stanley F. Reed, and Charles E. Whittaker. Other correspondents include Owen Brewster, John W. Bricker, J. Edgar Hoover, and Harry S. Truman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court <ref target="supcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
case file
</ref> contains conference lists, docket sheets with conference votes and brief notes on the justices' positions, bench and certiorari memoranda prepared by Burton's law clerks for study and recommendation, opinions, and studies on individual cases. Though not a prolific opinion writer, Burton saved most of the drafts of the various stages of his opinions along with comments in memoranda or actual annotations by his colleagues on the Court on their copies of opinions which they returned to him. Burton generally retained files on an average of ten to fifteen cases per term, usually the ones in which he wrote a majority, dissenting, or concurring opinion. His specific fields of interest, and the areas in which he was frequently assigned to write the majority opinions, were labor law and state claims versus federal claims. Included in his case files is material related to such landmark cases as <emph render="italic">Standard Oil v. Federal Trade Commission</emph> (October term 1949), for which he wrote the majority opinion, the steel company case <emph render="italic">Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Sawyer</emph> (October term 1952), for which he wrote a concurring opinion, and <emph render="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</emph> (October Term 1953), in which the Court's unanimous opinion was expressed by Chief Justice Earl Warren. A <ref target="supmisc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
miscellany
</ref> file in the Supreme Court File includes bound copies of Burton's opinions and official statements from the bench, miscellaneous notes and memoranda from other justices, handwritten notes on Supreme Court history and its previous decisions, Court budgets and statistics, material pertaining to rules for federal courts, hearing lists, case assignments, and moot court competitions.</p>
<p>Upon retiring from the Court in 1958, Burton frequently sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he was active until his health failed in 1962. The <ref target="appeals" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
United States Court of Appeals File
</ref> documents the cases in which he wrote opinions for this court as well as other cases in which he participated. The opinions are similar to those for the individual cases on the Supreme Court, although less in number and in detail.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and Writings File
</ref> covers all periods of Burton's career and contains handwritten and typed drafts and printed copies of his articles, speeches, and statements. A group of articles relates to the Supreme Court and its history, and political speeches document Burton's tenure as mayor of Cleveland. Although the subject file in the series contains speeches and articles as well as pertinent research material covering his years in Cleveland, the Senate, and the Court, a chronological file contains the most comprehensive compilation of Burton's speeches and writings. </p>
<p>The <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref> series is composed primarily of newspaper clippings and printed matter related to Burton's career and interests. A set of unbound scrapbooks of autographed material includes letters from Harry S. Truman and members of the Supreme Court.

<p>The papers of Robert Houghwout Jackson (1892-1954) span the years
1816-1983, with most of the material concentrated in the period 1934-1954. The

</p>
<p>Although the papers present a comprehensive record of Robert Jackson's
life dating from his school days, the
<ref target="legal" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Legal File
</ref>
series dominates the collection. The earliest of the papers relates to the
private law practice which he established in 1913 in Jamestown, New York, and
represents a period of twenty-one years of legal service in western New York.
The bulk of the law practice material pertains to cases in which Jackson was
involved as counsel to the Jamestown Telephone Company, the Jamestown Westfield
and Northwestern Railroad Company, Jamestown Worsted Mills, and the Niagara,
Lockport and Ontario Power Company. The papers also contain a few smaller files
on other cases, including <emph render="italic">Lyle P. Gates v. Prudential
Insurance Company,</emph> the typhoid carrier case which received extensive
coverage by the Jamestown press.</p>
<p>Jackson's appointment as assistant general counsel at the Bureau of
Internal Revenue in 1934 was the beginning of a seven-year career as a law
officer with the United States government. During his years at the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, he received national attention for his prosecution of a case
against Andrew Mellon. Copies of many of the documents and material assembled
for this litigation are included among these papers. The Bureau of Internal
Revenue files also contain studies on the concentration of wealth by
individuals and corporations in which wealth is related to the amount of income
taxes paid. Jackson's files also document his support of the Revenue Act of
1935. For a brief period during his service with the Bureau, Jackson was
detailed to the Securities and Exchange Commission to act as special counsel in
the trial of cases arising under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935. A small file relating to the Electric Bond and Share Company, chosen as a
test case, is among Jackson's legal papers.</p>
<p>From 1936 to 1941, Jackson served with the Justice Department as
assistant attorney general of the Tax and Antitrust divisions, solicitor
general, and attorney general. Although only a small number of papers remain in
the collection from his service with the Tax Division, they include a
significant file relating to several cases challenging the constitutionality of
the Social Security Act. The office files from Jackson's other Justice
Department appointments are more voluminous and reflect his working
relationship with Franklin D. Roosevelt in the implementation of New Deal
programs and in the preparation of contingency plans for the anticipated
effects of the outbreak of war in Europe. Among the prominent anti-monopoly
cases prosecuted by Justice Department offices under Jackson's aegis were those
concerning identical bids for steel products, automobile financing by
automobile manufacturers who financed automobile purchases through companies
which they controlled, the manipulation of oil prices, control of the aluminum
industry by the Aluminum Company of America, operations of fuel and utility
companies, and practices within the milk and motion picture industries.
Numerous files of the solicitor general and attorney general offices focus on
topics relating to the impact of World War II on the American economy, military
preparedness, and national defense. They encompass such issues as aircraft
production, gathering of intelligence information, immigration and
naturalization matters, investigations of subversive activities by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the House Committee on Un-American Activities,
operation of the selective service system, price stabilization and economic
controls, registration of aliens and treatment of alien property, regulation of
foreign cargo vessels in American ports, taxation of excess profits earned by
companies producing war materials, trade embargoes, and United States
neutrality.</p>
<p>In addition, Jackson's Justice Department files depict his role in
drafting the president's messages to Congress, particularly the anti-monopoly
message, Roosevelt's veto of the Walter-Logan Bill, the tax message of 1938,
and the state of the union message in 1940. They also reveal that Roosevelt
sought Jackson's advice on proposed legislation, such as the reorganization of
the federal judiciary in 1937, the enactment of a wages and hours bill, the
Lend-Lease Act, and the destroyer exchange issue. Evidence of a more personal
relationship between the two men can be found in memoranda and autobiographical
notes by Jackson describing his meetings with the president.</p>
<p>The retirement of Charles Evans Hughes and the subsequent appointment
of Harlan F. Stone as chief justice created a vacancy on the Supreme Court to
which Roosevelt nominated Jackson in 1941. Jackson's papers are complete for
his years on the court except for the 1945 term when he was United States Chief
of Counsel at the Nuremberg Trials. The files of cases are arranged
chronologically by October term and contain summaries of the issues prepared by
Jackson's law clerks, drafts of opinions, circulated opinions, final opinions,
correspondence and memoranda exchanged between the justices, correspondence
from the public, and printed matter. An alphabetical card file index to the
cases is included at the end of the papers. Except for 1946, Jackson did not
maintain separate docket books for the court terms; instead, pages from docket
books are generally incorporated in the case files.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court papers include some of Jackson's most famous
opinions, such as the Jehovah's Witness cases involving civil liberties (<emph render="italic">Board of Educ. v. Barnette</emph>, <emph render="italic">Douglas v. Jeannette</emph>, <emph render="italic">Martin v.
Struthers</emph>, <emph render="italic">Murdock v. Pennsylvania</emph>); cases
growing out of World War II concerning treason and the treatment of Japanese
(<emph render="italic">Korematsu v. United States</emph>, <emph render="italic">Cramer v. United States</emph>, <emph render="italic">Haupt v.
United States</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Terminiello v. Chicago</emph>);
those pertaining to the Communist Party (<emph render="italic">Dennis v. United
States</emph>, <emph render="italic">American Communications Ass'n v.
Douds</emph>); those involving taxing powers of states (<emph render="italic">State Tax Comm'n of Utah v. Aldrich</emph>,
<emph render="italic">Helvering v. Griffiths</emph>, <emph render="italic">District of Columbia v. Pace</emph>, <emph render="italic">Massachusetts v. United States</emph>, <emph render="italic">Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander</emph>); and cases concerning
use of public funds for support of parochial or private schools and segregation
of public school systems (<emph render="italic">Everson v. Board of
Educ.</emph>, <emph render="italic">Illinois ex rel. McCollom v. Board of
Educ.</emph>, <emph render="italic">Brown v. Board of Educ.</emph>). The
segregation cases heard by the Court in 1954 are treated as a group filed with
<emph render="italic">Oliver Brown v. Board of Education, Shawnee County,
Topeka, Kansas</emph>. Except for the case file on the Jewell Ridge Coal
Corporation case, all papers relating to the controversy over Jackson's
statement about Justice Hugo LaFayette Black's failure to recuse himself from
that case and cases involving his former law partner are found in the
<ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Subject
File
</ref> series and in the Supreme Court correspondence file in the office
files of the United States chief of counsel in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial
papers.</p>
<p>In 1945, following a speech by Jackson denouncing the criminal acts of
the Nazis, he was contacted by Samuel Rosenman on behalf of President Harry S.
Truman and asked to head the United States team for the prosecution of Axis war
criminals. The Nuremberg War Crimes Trial papers in the Jackson collection
consist of personal copies of many documents assembled for and during the
course of the trial and papers sent to Jackson after October 1946 when Telford
Taylor was United States Chief of Counsel. The subseries also includes
correspondence and selected printed matter written by staff members for several
years immediately following the trial. The official records of the trial are
housed in the National Archives.</p>
<p>Among the more interesting papers found in the Nuremberg materials is
the diary Jackson kept from the day of his appointment to the day preceding the
beginning of the trial. Jackson incorporated several of the original documents
mentioned in his entries among the pages of the diary. His papers also contain
original shorthand notes made by his secretary, Elsie Douglas, during the
London Conference of 1945, where the protocol for the trial was drafted and
agreed upon. The office files for the United States Chief of Counsel reveal the
planning and logistics of handling, assembling, and disseminating the vast
amount of material generated by the trial, the methods of resolving problems
caused by differences between American and European criminal procedure, and the
working relationship between the military and civilian trial staff members. An
extensive number of photographs concerning the trial is filed in the

programs and moot court competitions, and extensive writings on legal subjects.
Although Jackson never sought political office, his support of the Democratic
Party is demonstrated by numerous speeches, particularly in Jamestown and the
presidential campaigns of 1936 and 1940. The
<ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">

<p>The papers of Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. (1911-1992), span the years 1913-2008, with the
majority of the items concentrated between 1950 and 1984. The bulk of the papers
documents Rauh's career as a public interest lawyer who handled cases pertaining chiefly
to civil rights, civil liberties, and labor disputes. Also interfiled throughout the
collection are a few papers of his law partners, John Silard and Elliott C. Lichtman.
There are five parts and a <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="rest">
restricted </ref> portion.</p>
<p>Part I of the Rauh Papers consist of eight series: <ref target="percorr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal Correspondence, </ref>
<ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence, </ref>
<ref target="ada" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Americans for Democratic Action

<ref target="misc1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany. </ref>
</p>
<p>Papers in the <ref target="percorr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal
Correspondence </ref> series, 1938-1988, and <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence series, </ref> 1949-1980, consist of
incoming and outgoing correspondence pertaining to Rauh's legal cases and to social and
political issues that interested him, particularly civil rights, civil liberties, and
labor. The General Correspondence pertains mostly to Rauh's legal cases, while the
Personal Correspondence relates principally to his private interests. There is a great
deal of similar material in both series, however, since he supported several causes both
publicly and privately. Because the two series overlap, some of the same correspondents
and many of the same topics appear in both. Each series includes correspondence between
Rauh and his family, friends, acquaintances, and the general public, although family
correspondence is limited and appears mostly in the early years of the Personal
Correspondence series. Personal Correspondence files from 1946 to 1949 have indexes
appearing at the beginning of each folder which list correspondents and, at times,
topics. General Correspondence from 1973 to 1980 consists primarily of outgoing letters.
The correspondence is filed in the same arrangement in which it was transferred to the
Library.</p>
<p>The <ref target="ada" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Americans for Democratic
Action (ADA) File, </ref> 1949-1976, documents Rauh's activities as a member and
officeholder of this political advocacy group. The papers document Rauh's activities as
an organizer, public speaker, and fund-raiser. In addition, he testified about a wide
variety of issues on ADA's behalf before many congressional committees. The papers
further document Rauh's and the organization's position on civil rights, foreign and
domestic policy, government loyalty/security measures, communism, civil liberties,
national political campaigns, and other issues. Rauh and the ADA worked to defeat the
attempt by Henry Wallace and his Progressive Party to assume the leadership of American
liberalism in 1948. Rauh and the ADA were also active in moving civil rights to the
center of the liberal agenda and in inserting a civil rights plank into the platform of
the Democratic party. Rauh was also one of the first to object to the tactics used by
Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee. The ADA files
further reflect Rauh's efforts in behalf of civil rights and encouraging an anti-Vietnam
War position within the Democratic party in 1967. Additional ADA-related correspondence
appears in the Personal and General Correspondence files.</p>
<p>The <ref target="camp" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Hubert H. Humphrey Campaign
File, </ref> 1956-1963, pertains to Humphrey's unsuccessful 1960 presidential
campaign. Rauh, vice chairman of the Democratic Central Committee in the District of
Columbia in 1959-1960 and a close friend of Humphrey, campaigned actively on the
senator's behalf. The papers relate primarily to Rauh's fund-raising activities and
plans for campaign strategy.</p>
<p>Papers in the <ref target="subj1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File,
</ref> 1944-1988, document Rauh's activities and interests in affirmative action, civil
rights, civil liberties, labor issues, union democracy, politics, and other issues. The
papers show Rauh's active support in the Democratic party for civil rights and party
reform. In addition, they reflect his role in the formulation and enactment of civil
rights legislation. There are files containing correspondence and material that Rauh
used to oppose the Supreme Court nominations of Clement F. Haynsworth and G. Harrold
Carswell. Also included are files pertaining to Rauh's unsuccessful fight against
William H. Rehnquist's nomination to the Court and his subsequent elevation to chief
justice. These papers also document Rauh's participation in attempts, 1950-1975, to curb
the use of the filibuster in the Senate. Papers related to his support for home rule in
the District of Columbia are located in the District of Columbia, Democratic Central
Committee files.</p>
<p>The <ref target="legal1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Legal File, </ref>
1948-1986, constitutes the majority of the collection and consist chiefly of case files
of Rauh's clients. Many of these cases are public service ones in which Rauh defended
underrepresented groups and interests. Most of the cases pertain to civil rights, rights
of trade unions, such as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the United Auto
Workers, abuses of the federal loyalty/security programs, and other civil liberties
issues. Two of Rauh's notable clients were Lillian Hellman, whom he represented before
the House Un-American Activities Committee, and the members of the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party. For the latter he won a symbolic offer of two seats for the Freedom
Party at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, thereby ending the seating of
segregated delegations. A letter to Rauh from Arthur Miller in which Miller describes
his reaction to Marilyn Monroe's death is located in Jacobo Muchnik's file. A large
miscellany subseries is composed of briefs, writs, and congressional committee prints
concerning cases that Rauh handled.</p>
<p>The final two series include <ref target="appt" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Appointment Books, </ref> 1955-1986, and <ref target="misc1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany, </ref> 1913-1988. The Appointment Books series
consist of calendars recording Rauh's personal and business engagements. Papers in the
Miscellany series are chiefly speeches, writings, interviews, and Rauh's letters to
newspaper and magazine editors concerning his positions on various legal, political, and
social issues. </p>
<p>
<ref target="legal2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Part II, </ref> a 1989 addition
to the Rauh Papers, consists chiefly of correspondence and legal papers relating to
<emph render="italic">Orlikow v. United States</emph>, a case in which Rauh
represented Velma Orlikow and eight other defendants who were brainwashed without their
knowledge or consent at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, Canada. Experiments
were performed on the patients by psychiatrist Ewen Cameron, who was funded from 1958
until 1960 by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p>Part III, a 1994 addition complementing Rauh's papers received in previous installments,
includes <ref target="percorr3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> personal

The subject files document Rauh's activities and interests in civil rights, politics,
and the Supreme Court. Almost all of the legal files relate to <emph render="italic">Orlikow v. United States</emph>.</p>
<p>Part IV, a 1999 addition, also supplements previous installments of the Rauh Papers and
includes <ref target="percorr4" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> personal

death in 1992. The subject files relate primarily to Rauh's interest in civil rights and
the Supreme Court. Wage and hour legislation files from 1939 to 1942 chronicle Rauh's
service as counsel to the Department of Labor. Prominent correspondents in Part IV
include Benjamin N. Cardozo, Benjamin V. Cohen, and Felix Frankfurter.</p>
<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="partv"> Part V </ref>, a 2015 addition,
features some topics and time periods common to other parts of the Rauh Papers. It
includes correspondence, legal files, speeches and writings, family papers, oral history
interviews, press and magazine articles about Rauh, and files relating to his death. The
majority of the addition relates to correspondence and legal papers pertaining to Rauh's
client, William Walter Remington. Rauh defended Remington against charges of perjury
resulting from his denial under oath that he had participated in a Soviet espionage ring
and that he had been a member of the Communist Party. Remington was convicted of perjury
and murdered in prison. The correspondence also includes some letters to Rauh's wife,
Olie Westheimer Rauh. </p>
<p>Other prominent and frequent correspondents in the collection include Carl A. Auerbach,
William J. Brennan (1906-1997), Paul H. Douglas, Felix Frankfurter, Jack Greenberg,
Aaron Henry, Edward D. Hollander, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson, Edward M.
Kennedy, James I. Loeb, Eugene J. McCarthy, Walter Reuther, Eleanor Roosevelt, Arthur

<p>The papers of Herbert Arthur Philbrick (1915-1993) span the years 1849-1997, with the
bulk of the material dating from 1940 to 1993. They relate primarily to Philbrick's
interests and activities as a leading anticommunist spokesman from the 1950s through the
early 1970s whose concern with the threat of communism continued until his death.
Philbrick became a public figure in 1949 when he was a government witness in the trial
of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA)
indicted for violation of the Smith Act. During his testimony, Philbrick revealed that
for the previous nine years he had functioned as an undercover agent, serving as an
informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) while an active member of the
CPUSA. He subsequently wrote an autobiography, <title localtype="simple">
<part>I Led 3 Lives: Citizen, “Communist,” Counterspy</part>
</title>, which became the basis of a television series in the 1950s. In addition to
documenting Philbrick's life and activities, his papers are a source of information on
the anticommunist movement in general featuring prominent individuals and organizations
and containing correspondence, newsletters, and press clippings from throughout the
country. The collection is organized in ten series: <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="cpusa" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA)</ref>,
<ref target="iled" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">

<p>The <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> series consists primarily of letters received by Philbrick, with
copies of some of his outgoing correspondence. Although correspondence relating to
specific activities or individuals is filed by topic in other series, this series
contains correspondence from friends, colleagues, and the general public filed by date.
Frequent topics include communism, religion, reactions to Philbrick's lectures and
writings, and comments on specific events and individuals.</p>
<p>The <ref target="cpusa" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Communist Party of the United
States of America (CPUSA)</ref> series focuses on Philbrick's activities in the
party, particularly in the New England area. A section on the Federal Bureau of
Investigation contains reports to the agency in which Philbrick, often using the
pseudonym “George Lockwood,” described activities of organizations in Massachusetts that
were controlled by communists and provided accounts of the events, meetings, and
individuals he dealt with when he joined the Young Communist League, the Communist
Party, and the Education Commission of the Massachusetts Communist Party. Organizations
mentioned include the Cambridge Youth Council, American Youth for Democracy, the
Massachusetts Political Action Committee, and the Progressive Citizens of America.
Events described include the congressional campaign of Anthony M. Roche and the
presidential campaign of Henry Agard Wallace. </p>
<p>A party activities section in the series contains correspondence, pamphlets, fliers, and
other material collected or created by Philbrick. His assignments often involved using
his advertising experience and printing skills in his work for the party, and he would
collect and send the FBI copies of the materials he created and printed. A testimony
section relates to remarks Philbrick made to a number of investigating bodies from 1949
to 1967 regarding communists and their activities in the United States, including
testimony in United States District Court in the trial of <emph render="italic">United
States v. William Z. Foster</emph> and at hearings of the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee to
Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act and Other Security Laws, and
the Massachusetts Special Commission to Study and Investigate Communism and Subversive
Activities and Related Matters in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The series related to <ref target="iled" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
<emph render="italic">I Led 3 Lives</emph>
</ref> features Philbrick's autobiography and the various formats in which it appeared,
including a book, newspaper serialization, and a television series. The largest sections
relate to the book and the television series. The book section includes outlines,
summaries, and sets of drafts. Documents indicate that Philbrick worked closely with
Fendall Yerxa in the preparation of his autobiography. A serialized version of the book
appeared first in the <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Herald Tribune</part>
</title>. The television section contains material relating to the syndicated television
series produced from 1953 to 1956 by Ziv Television Programs, Inc. in which Richard
Carlson starred as Philbrick. Philbrick served as a technical consultant to the project,
and the files contain plot outlines and comments he prepared as well as scripts sent to
him for approval. Other material includes correspondence relating to personal
appearances Philbrick made in support of the program.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> is the
largest series in the collection and contains information on people, groups, and issues
of interest to Philbrick, especially communism and the Cold War. Many of the most
extensive files relate to his involvement with anticommunist, conservative, and
religious organizations, such as America's Future, Constructive Action, the Council
Against Communist Aggression, United States Anti-Communist Congress, U.S. Press
Association, and Young Americans for Freedom. A major aspect of Philbrick's work with
another such group, the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade and its leader, Frederick C.
Schwarz, was his participation in their anticommunism schools. Additional material
related to Philbrick's work with the schools is filed in a speaking engagements section
of the Speeches and Writings series. A Federal Bureau of Investigation file contains
correspondence and memoranda that Philbrick continued to send to the FBI in the years
following his undercover work with the CPUSA. Related to this file are the folders on
“Yankee,” a woman from Massachusetts who from 1952 to 1972 sent Philbrick information
and documents relating to organizations spanning the political spectrum, much of which
he sent on to the FBI. Significant correspondents in the Subject File include James D.
Bales, J. Edgar Hoover, William Loeb, Arthur G. McDowell, Reinhold Niebuhr, Ogden R.
Reid, Henry Agard Wallace, and Robert Henry Winborne Welch. </p>
<p>The <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings</ref>
series features Philbrick's writing projects and lectures. The largest sections relate
to his newspaper columns and speeches. Philbrick wrote a newspaper column titled “Red
Underground” for the <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Herald Tribune</part>
</title> from 1952 to 1958. A list of topics serves as an index to the columns. The
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Tribune</part>
</title> files include responses from readers, attorneys, and individuals and
organizations mentioned in the columns. The speeches section documents Philbrick's
activities as a lecturer for over thirty years. Contracts, itineraries, and lecture
requests indicate the types of groups that invited him to speak. The speaking
engagements section contains correspondence, programs, and press coverage of his
appearances. Titles of Philbrick's lectures include “Communism and Youth,” “The
Christian Answer,” “Cybernetic Warfare,” “Red, White, and Pink,” and “Zero Hour for
America.” </p>
<p>Another of Philbrick's writing projects was a series of newsletters sponsored by such
organizations as Dollar Federal Savings and Loan of Columbus, Ohio, and the Schick Razor
Company. Topics include Philbrick's concerns about the international communist
conspiracy, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the Vietnam War. Articles by
Philbrick were often reprinted in the various newsletters. Drafts and background
material for the newsletters are filed under <title localtype="simple">
<part>Dollar Hollar.</part>
</title> Also in the Speeches and Writings series are articles, book reviews, letters to
editors, childhood diaries, and unpublished and incomplete book projects on communism
and religion and the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>
<p>The <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series
contains personal and family material as well as files relating to appearances by
Philbrick on film, television, and radio. Press clippings in the biographical material
section describe activities and events in Philbrick's life and provide clues as to which
files throughout the collection have a direct connection to Philbrick. Included among
the film, television, and radio material are files on Philbrick's own television
projects, <title>
<part>Red Report</part>
</title> and <title>
<part>World War III</part>
</title>. Office files contain memoranda and draft correspondence that he prepared for
staff while he was away on lecture tours. Card files include information on various
people, many of whom Philbrick suspected of having communist connections. Legal files
contain material related to a lawsuit between Philbrick and his attorney, Moses Frankel,
who had worked as his agent in the 1950s and who negotiated his book and television
deals. Family material includes items relating to his father, Guy Philbrick, a railroad
trainman, and to Herbert Philbrick's second wife, Shirley.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">2001 Addition</ref> consists of
material received after the processing of the main portion of the Philbrick Papers was
completed. It supplements each of the series and its arrangement reflects the
organization of those series: general correspondence, Communist Party of the United
States of America (CPUSA), <title localtype="simple">
<part>I Led 3 Lives</part>
</title>, subject file, speeches and writings, and miscellany. Items that complement the
existing material include a scrapbook of press clippings relating to Philbrick's 1949
testimony in the Smith Act trials of communist leaders and files relating to his revised
edition of <title localtype="simple">
<part> I Led 3 Lives: Citizen, "Communist," Counterspy</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">2023 Addition</ref>
supplements the general correspondence series and the speeches and writings series from
both the original portion and the 2001 Addition. This addition also includes scripts and
research materials for thirty-five broadcasts of Philbrick's radio program, <title>
<part>Let Freedom Ring</part>
</title>. Additional material includes a small amount of biographical material, material
related to church acitivities, and photographs of Philbrick.</p>

</p>
<p>Parts I and II of the papers of Edward L. Bernays span the years 1890-1979, with the
bulk of the material within the period 1920 to 1975. The papers consist mainly of
correspondence, publicity material, and scrapbooks, supplemented by surveys, reports,
printed matter, memoranda, research notes, photographs, lists, speeches, articles,
drafts of books, and miscellaneous material. Series include <ref target="famcorr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="gencorr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>;
<ref target="client1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client, Institution, and

<p>Recording the work of more than half a century, the collection documents not only the
career of a pioneer in the public relations field, but also the origins, growth, and
development of public relations as a profession in the United States from its beginnings
before World War I to its present state of influence in American life. The collection
further reflects the changing mores of American society from the early 1900s through the
1960s.</p>
<p>A guide to much of the material in the collection can be found in Bernays's <title localtype="simple">
<part>Biography of an Idea: Memoirs of Public Relations Counsel Edward L.
Bernays</part>
</title>. This volume is derived for the most part from material found in the
collection. Especially helpful for subjects touched upon in the book are research notes
in the <ref target="book" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Book File</ref> series
prepared for use in Bernays's memoirs but not completely incorporated into the final
version. In most cases these notes present a capsule summary of Bernays's relationship
with the particular subject in question.</p>
<p>Bernays's professional career began during the World War I period and is extensively
documented in the <ref target="client1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client,
Institution, and Organization File</ref> of Part I; the <ref target="sclient" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client, Institution, and Organization File
subseries</ref> of the <ref target="scrap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part I:
Scrapbooks</ref> series; and the <ref target="ovsz1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize series of Part I</ref>. Some of the earliest material
covers Diaghileff's Ballets Russes, containing correspondence and oversized scrapbooks.
For the 1920s, there is material on the arts, clients such as Cartier and Seligmann
&amp; Company, and the French industrial exposition of 1925. Industrial subjects include
George W. Hill and the American Tobacco Company, the soap sculpture contests of Procter
&amp; Gamble, George H. Phelps and the automotive industry, Philco and Columbia
Broadcasting Company's activities in the burgeoning radio industry, William B. Ward and
the bread industry, the Light's Golden Jubilee recreating in 1929 the birth of the
electric light by Thomas A. Edison, and many others. </p>
<p>Material on the stock market crash records its effects on the American economy. The
Depression is reflected in files about President Herbert Hoover's Committee on
Employment, the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care, and the plight of the
construction industry, which are located in the <ref target="client1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part I: Client, Institution, and Organization File</ref>. The
corporate activities of such companies as Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation and
General Motors and the fight of Amadeo Peter Giannini and the Bank of America against
government control are also featured for this period. Files on the United Brewers
Industrial Foundation depict the brewing industry's adjustment to the post-prohibition
era.</p>
<p>World War II files in the <ref target="client1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client, Institution, and Organization File</ref> series of Part I often focus on
international problems. The America Self-Contained Committee, various war loan campaign
movements, government agencies, and papers relating to the United States Sugar Beet
Association present the public relations counsel's approach to the problems brought
about by the war years and the wartime economy.</p>
<p>In the postwar era, Bernays assisted organizations and companies such as the American
Nurses Association, the pharmaceutical industry, Mack Trucks, and the United Fruit
Company to adjust their activities to a more industrialized and centralized economy.
Files of the United Fruit Company, which cover a twenty-year period, document its fight
against communism in central American republics. Papers on the India Information Service
concern the efforts of Jawaharlal Nehru and India to regain American goodwill following
India's neutrality during the Korean conflict.</p>
<p>The papers also document Bernays's affiliation in the 1950s with the New York City
Anniversary Committee, the New York State Psychologists Association, and the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society. His interest in the mass communications media and his
efforts to promote public relations as a profession are reflected throughout Parts I and
II. He authored a number of works in the public relations field, wrote numerous articles
published in a wide range of publications, and gave speeches on a variety of
communications topics.</p>

Correspondence; Part I: Client, Institution, and Organization File, "National Committee
for an Adequate Overseas Information Program" folder; and Part II: Client, Institution,

Institution, and Organization File, William O'Dwyer folder), and Sigmund Freud,
Bernays's uncle (Family Correspondence series in Parts I and II).</p>
<p>A number of surveys in the collection reflect pioneering efforts in the field of public
relations research. Research on the downtown area of the city of New York, studies on
buying habits, studies done for government officials at the federal, state, and
municipal levels, and for the greeting card industry, Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott, the
Nash-Kelvinator Corporation, the New York theater industry, the American Nurses
Association, and the American Optometric Association indicate the approach taken by
Bernays in applying public relations principles to individual as well as corporate
needs.</p>

<emph render="bold">Part III</emph>
</p>
<p>Part III of the Edward L. Bernays Papers spans the years 1777-1994, with the majority of
the papers concentrated in the period 1923-1990. The papers supplement files in Parts I
and II and pertain primarily to Bernays's career in public relations. Part III is
organized largely according to the arrangement of Parts I and II and include seven
series: <ref target="fampap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref>;
<ref target="gencorr3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="client3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client, Institution, and Organization File</ref>; <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>; <ref target="speech3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref>; <ref target="misc3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>; and <ref target="ovsz3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="fampap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref>,
1831-1993, consist primarily of correspondence between Bernays and family members and
the papers of his wife, Doris Fleischman Bernays. The majority of the letters concern
family matters and local news. Correspondence between Bernays and his wife provides a
glimpse of their business activities as well as their personal relationship. Also
included are photocopies of letters from Bernays's uncle, Sigmund Freud, and
correspondence with Freud's children, Anna, Ernst, and Martin. Also notable in the
series are drafts of writings about Sigmund Freud by Freud's sister, Anna Freud Bernays,
and his niece, Lilly Freud-Marlé. The writings of Doris Bernays comprise the bulk of her
papers, including a draft of her book, <title localtype="simple">
<part> A Wife Is Many Women</part>
</title>. Edward Bernays played a prominent role in promoting that book. Doris Bernays's
correspondence with Eleanor Roosevelt concerns writing a chapter for Bernays's book,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Outline of Careers for Women</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>Papers in the <ref target="gencorr3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> series, 1905-1994, chronicle Bernays's varied interests. The
letters consist mainly of incoming correspondence relating to personal and professional
matters. The majority of the correspondence is concentrated from 1962 through 1994 after
Bernays's relocation from New York to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many of the items in
this series, the <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject
File</ref>, and in the <ref target="misc3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series were received by the Library in photograph albums with
adhesive pages. Most of these items were detached by Library staff; those that could not
be removed were photocopied. Notable correspondents in the series include Sam Black,
Daniel J. Boorstin, George Creel, Herbert Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson, Clare Booth Luce,
Henry Robinson Luce, Gypsy Rose Lee, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, Arthur B. Spingarn,
Lawrence E. Spivak, Robert F. Wagner, and Henry Agard Wallace.</p>
<p>Comprising almost one-fourth of Part III is the <ref target="client3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Client, Institution, and Organization File</ref>, 1913-1992. The
series supplements the voluminous client files of Parts I and II and includes
correspondence, reports, surveys, press releases, photographs, and background material.
Clients and topics prominently featured in this series are the Book Publishers Research
Institute, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the
United Fruit Company, the Light's Golden Jubilee, the Bernays Public Relations
Counseling Letter, and surveys conducted by Bernays. Two of the more substantive surveys
are "What the British Think of Us" and identifying the top ten newspapers in the United
States.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>, 1919-1994,
illustrates Bernays's diverse activities and interests. The series chronicles his
service and affiliation with various committees, foundations, and organizations such as
the Citizens' Emergency Committee to Save Memorial Drive, the Edward L. Bernays'
Foundation, and Boston University. Bernays used his public relations influence to assist
in the environmental campaign to save Memorial Drive in Cambridge from expansion that
could have lessened the park-like atmosphere of the area. The most prolific files in the
series relate to the sponsorship of the Anglo-American international relations contest
by the Bernays Foundation, a contest Bernays supported to dispel false images and myths
Americans and British had of each other. This series also documents Bernays's promotion
of the public relations field and his advocacy of licensing public relations
practitioners. Also reflected is his interest in social issues such as crime, cigarette
smoking, and aging.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings
File</ref>, 1912-1992, includes speeches, articles, books, book reviews, editorials,
and newsletters. The bulk of the writings relates to his memoirs, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Biography of an Idea</part>
</title>. A bound volume includes various articles, pamphlets, and speeches by
Bernays.</p>
<p>The <ref target="misc3" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series in
Part III, 1777-1993, consists chiefly of award certificates, financial and legal papers,
biographical information, printed matter, sketches, scrapbooks, and manuscripts and
pamphlets of others collected by Bernays. The scrapbooks contain both personal and
client material. The "Manuscript and Pamphlet Collection" folder includes a colonial
broadside of the state of Massachusetts regarding the Continental Army and a commission
signed by Adolph Hitler removing individuals from active military service.</p>

<p>The papers of Gerhard Alden Gesell (1910-1993) span the years 1913-2003, with the
majority of the papers concentrated from 1962-1992. Documenting primarily Gesell's
career as judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and his
career as a lawyer, the papers consist of eleven series: <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="chrono" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Chronological File</ref>, <ref target="case" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Case File</ref>, <ref target="bench" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Bench Books</ref>, <ref target="docket" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Dockets</ref>, <ref target="senten" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Sentencing File</ref>, <ref target="office" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Office File</ref>, <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="add18">2018 Addition</ref>, <ref target="class">Classified</ref>, and <ref target="over">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> series, 1968-1992, consisting chiefly of incoming letters from
the public, pertains primarily to Gesell's Watergate cases, <emph render="italic">United
States v. Ehrlichman</emph> and <emph render="italic">United States v. Chapin</emph>.
In addition, there is correspondence relating to other cases of national and
constitutional significance such as <emph render="italic">United States v. Washington
Post Company</emph> (Pentagon Papers case) and <emph render="italic">United States v.
Vuitch</emph> (legality of abortions in the District of Columbia). Also included are
a few letters from friends, lawyers, and judges relating to Gesell's professional
activities.</p>
<p>Because of its location in the nation's capital and its jurisdiction over cases
involving federal agencies, the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia is considered one of the most important venues in the country. Papers in the
<ref target="chrono" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Chronological File</ref>,
1968-1993, reflect the wide range of civil and criminal cases Gesell heard as a district
judge for this court: civil rights, constitutional law, antitrust matters, patent cases,
and government regulations. This series consists of correspondence and memoranda,
primarily between Gesell and judges, lawyers, prison officials, clerks, and staff, as
well as an array of extensive legal papers such as opinions, orders, stipulations, and
reports. Arranged by Gesell's staff, papers in the Chronological File relating to
individual cases are scattered throughout the series rather than assembled in specific
case files and provide some sense of the judge's day-to-day work. Although there is some
overlap between the <ref target="case" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Case
File</ref> series and this series, the Case File contains papers that are not
included in the Chronological File. Also included are a few personal letters and notes,
particularly concerning his farm near Arcola, Virginia. The docket sheets in the <ref target="docket" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Dockets</ref> series may assist
readers in locating specific documents of interest in the Chronological File, as they
contain dated entries by the judge's staff documenting many details of each case. In
order to use the docket sheets, a reader must know the document number for a case or
know the year the case first appeared on the docket and search the docket sheets to
locate it.</p>
<p>The <ref target="case" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Case File</ref>, 1956-1991,
consists of two subseries: <ref target="gencase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General</ref> and <ref target="spcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Special
Case</ref> files. This series, also arranged by Gesell's staff, chronicles his
rulings in some of his most significant and complex cases. The General subseries,
1956-1990, containing chiefly memoranda and orders, documents a wide range of civil,
criminal, and miscellaneous cases. Arrangement is alphabetical by type of case and
therein alphabetical by case title. This subseries includes papers pertaining to the
riots at local universities in 1969 (<emph render="italic">George Washington Univ. v.
Mann</emph> and <emph render="italic">Howard Univ. v. Abel</emph>), the riots in
Washington, D.C., in 1969 (criminal riot cases), and the application of broadcasters for
access to the Watergate tapes in order to air them for public broadcast (<emph render="italic">United States v. Mitchell</emph>). The General File is not as
complete as the Special Case File and should be used in conjunction with the <ref target="chrono" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Chronological File.</ref>
</p>
<p>The <ref target="spcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Special Case File</ref>,
1969-1991, contains individual cases which were maintained in case files rather than in
the Chronological File or General case file. Many of the cases pertain to issues of
national and constitutional significance, such as a variety of First Amendment cases
(<emph render="italic">Hentoff v. Ichord</emph> and <emph render="italic">United
States v. Washington Post Co.</emph>; the legality of abortions in the District of
Columbia prior to the Supreme Court decision of <emph render="italic">Roe v. Wade</emph>
(<emph render="italic">United States v. Vuitch</emph>); the firing of Watergate
special prosecutor Archibald Cox (<emph render="italic">Nader v. Bork</emph>); the
break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex
(<emph render="italic">United States v. Ehrlichman</emph>); and Oliver L. North's
role in the congressional investigation of the Iran-Contra Affair (<emph render="italic">United States v. North</emph>). The <emph render="italic">United States v.
North</emph> files comprise the bulk of the Special Case File and include
correspondence, memoranda, orders, transcripts, dockets, and press files. Two items
pertaining to the North case are worthy of mention: a diary in which Gesell recorded
notes at home at the close of the day and a letter from Gesell to Lawrence E. Walsh,
head of the Office of Independent Counsel that investigated the Iran-Contra Affair, of
20 September 1991 that complimented Walsh on the way he and his staff had conducted
themselves during the trial. Located in the folder "Correspondence: General, Feb.
1990-Oct. 1991," this letter is an attachment to a 24 September 1991 letter from Walsh
to Gesell.</p>
<p>The <ref target="bench" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Bench Books</ref> series,
1968-1993, contains Gesell's notes about the cases which came before his court.
Arrangement is chronological, except for three volumes that are alphabetical by topic or
case title. Dates written by Gesell's staff on the cover of the bench books are not
always accurate.</p>
<p>Papers in the <ref target="docket" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Dockets</ref>
series, 1959-1992, provide a record of the name and docket number of individual cases.
Also included are brief notes by the judge's staff recording many of the legal documents
issued and filed. Arrangement is alphabetical by type of case, civil or criminal, and
therein chronological by year. The Dockets series may assist readers in locating entries
to specific cases, particularly the chronological file and the bench books.</p>
<p>The <ref target="senten" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Sentencing File</ref>,
1968-1992, constituting almost half the collection, includes correspondence, memoranda,
presentence reports, orders and other papers relating to the sentencing process of
Gesell's criminal cases. A presentence report was prepared by a probation officer to
assist the judge in determining a defendant's sentence. It generally contains
information on the offense, the defendant's prior criminal record, family history,
marital status, education, employment, health, military service, and financial
condition, and an evaluation and recommendation by the probation officer. Serving as a
record of every person sentenced by Gesell, the file reflects the vast economic and
demographic changes in the District of Columbia over a twenty-year period and contains
valuable social data about families, crime, the judicial system, and race relations.
Papers in the presentencing file are arranged into three chronological sequences,
1968-1979, 1980-1989, and 1990-1992. The earlier sequences contain more extensive
background information, while the later files indicate the judgment and terms of the
sentence. Also included in this series are two card files arranged by defendant's name,
one recording the sentences and the other indicating the cases in which charges were
dropped or the defendant was found not guilty.</p>
<p>The <ref target="office" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Office File</ref> series,
1965-1993, relates to Gesell's administrative and professional duties as a district
judge. The majority of the papers chronicle his activities with various committees and
his sitting by designation with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit.</p>
<p>The final series, <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>, 1945-1993, includes speeches and writings by Gesell, reminiscences
written by his law clerks, photographs and political cartoons, and tributes to Gesell
after his death. One of the more important items in this series is a notebook containing
Gesell's memoirs, "My Jealous Mistress," and background memoranda about significant
cases and events.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add18">2018 Addition</ref>, 1913 to 2003, complements the initial
portion of the collection and includes material relating to Gesell's career as a lawyer
with the firm of Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C., his work with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, his tenure as a federal judge, his work with
government committees and presidential campaigns, and his management of his farm in
Loudon County, Va. Most of the correspondence relates to Gesell’s work as an attorney
for Covington &amp; Burling from 1941 to 1967. Correspondence after 1967 pertains mainly
to Gesell’s judicial career. The early correspondence also documents Gesell’s personal
activities and includes correspondence with family and friends with references to
current events and local issues relating to the District of Columbia. Other material
chronicling Gesell’s tenure as a lawyer in private practice is located in the Covington
&amp; Burling files.</p>
<p> Featured in the <ref target="add18">2018 Addition</ref> are files, chiefly newspaper
clippings, relating to his tenure with the Securities and Exchange Commission. While
with the Commission, he investigated the New York Stock Exchange arising out of the
Richard Whitney scandals and was responsible for investigations into the life insurance
industry as special counsel to the Temporary National Economic Committee. Also present
are files relating to Gesell’s judicial career, chiefly press articles and a trial
transcript summary pertaining to <emph render="italic">United States v. North</emph>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="add18">2018 Addition</ref> also contains a few files relating to
Gesell’s work for the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack
and the President’s Committee on Equal Opportunity in the Armed Services. A letter in
the Armed Services committee’s file indicated that Gesell had donated most of his files
about it to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.</p>
<p>Material of a more personal nature in the <ref target="add18">2018 Addition</ref> are
financial ledgers and papers documenting Gesell’s personal finances, farm ledgers and
other files pertaining to Gesell’s cattle farm, and political files documenting his work
for the Democratic Party in the presidential campaigns of 1956, 1960, and 1964. Also
featured are writings by Gesell containing other versions of his memoir, “My Jealous
Mistress ” and condolence letters to Gesell’s wife from judges, lawyers, government
officials, the public, and friends after Gesell's death in 1993. </p>
<p>Among the most significant and frequent of Gesell's correspondents are Dean Acheson,
Harding F. Bancroft, Howard C. Bratton, Warren E. Burger, Joseph M. Fitzpatrick, John M.
Harlan, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson, Irving R. Kaufman, J. Edward Lumbard,
John Lord O'Brian, Frank T. Remington, John J. Sirica, Potter Stewart, Lawrence E.
Walsh, Earl Warren, and Frank W. Wilson.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Luther Burbank (1849-1926) span the years 1830-1989, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1880-1926. Known to many of his generation as "the plant wizard," Burbank was popularly classed among the scientific heroes of the early twentieth century. His collection consists of the following series:
<ref target="family" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref>,
<ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>,
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref>,
<ref target="notes" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Notes and Sketches</ref>,
<ref target="bus" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Business Records</ref>,
<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>, an
<ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Addition</ref>, and a
<ref target="micro" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Microfilm</ref> series consisting of a small selection of items from the papers which were retained by the city of Santa Rosa, California, for display in the Luther Burbank Home.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="family" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref> series includes a variety of records predating Burbank's birth in Lancaster, Massachusetts, and continuing well after his death in the Northern California town of Santa Rosa. Especially valuable are letters Burbank exchanged with his mother and sister while a prospective emigrant to the West Coast in 1875. The earliest family correspondence, dated as early as 1850, is mostly in the form of typewritten transcripts by Burbank's second wife, Elizabeth Waters Burbank, or by one of his biographers. The transcripts reproduce letters from and between Burbank's brothers and father supplemented by legal, biographical, and other personal data. Also in the
<ref target="family" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref> is travel memorabilia which includes a brief diary by Burbank of a trip to his boyhood New England in 1888. Since Burbank's sister, two brothers, and mother had joined or preceded him in his move to California, his journeys outside the state account for practically all of his family correspondence after 1878.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref> series is extensive and, in addition to carbons or drafts of Burbank's replies, contains personal as well as professional letters. There are diverse and sometimes substantive inquiries from farmers interested in his projects, requests for seed catalogs from other nurserymen, fact-finding reports by foreign nationals intent on supplying Burbank with unusual seeds or seedlings, and a great deal of adulatory "fan" mail from friends both prominent and obscure. Burbank wrote and received letters from Harvey S. Firestone, Henry Ford, Charmian London, Joaquin Miller, John Muir, and Ella Wheeler Wilcox. The largest part of the correspondence concerns scientists and government officials who shared his training or helped in communicating the results of his research. Among the more significant of these individuals were David Starr Jordan, friend and patron at Stanford University, and Robert S. Woodward, head of the Carnegie Institution of Washington when Burbank was funded by that body to free him from the ordinary tasks of nursery administration.</p>
<p>Other scientists whose correspondence appears with some frequency include Liberty Hyde Bailey, David G. Fairchild, Jose D. Husbands, Vernon L. Kellogg, George H. Schull, H. E. Van Deman, and Hugo De Vries. The letters from De Vries are of particular interest, since it was the Dutch botanist's generous writings about Burbank's Santa Rosa experiments which broadcast their significance to the academic and scientific community. California booster organizations, then in their peak phase, also took an active part in the promotion of the plant breeder's achievements, and the evidence of their contact is best seen in the correspondence between Burbank and various officials of state and county chambers of commerce, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle of 1909, the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, and the California State Boards of Horticulture and Agriculture.</p>
<p>As a celebrated discoverer of new plant varieties, Burbank depended less on strict scientific methodology than on a prodigious ability to test and experiment on a practical, empirical basis. Although he made sporadic efforts to keep comprehensive records of his research, he often destroyed them once a product was finished. Those accounts which still exist have been organized in a
<ref target="notes" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Notes and Sketches</ref> series and complement typescripts in the
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref> containing narrative descriptions of genera and species which he cultivated at his Santa Rosa and Sebastopol nurseries between 1903 and 1911. Among the
<ref target="bus" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Business Records</ref> are account books, inventories, stock lists, and plan books related to Burbanks studies. This part of the collection, while focusing mainly on financial aspects of the Burbank operation, shows where and how he purchased seeds, the diligence of his propagation and selection, and the layout of his gardens. As is true of the
<ref target="notes" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Notes and Sketches</ref>, the
<ref target="bus" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Business Records</ref> are occasionally illustrated with Burbank's drawings of his techniques and products.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref> consists of Burbank's personal writings as well as the printed, near-print, and typescript comments of scientists, friends, and journalists. Prominent among the latter were some of his most devoted admirers, including De Vries, Wilbur Hall Jordan, Kellogg, and Edward J. Wickson. In addition, there is a transcript of a 1913 interview with Burbank by Burt C. Bean. The bulk of the Burbank manuscripts pertains to plant descriptions and what is supposed to be a complete series of his published seed catalogs, but there are also a few copies of statements he made on personal and social issues and a small folder of lectures given at Stanford University between 1904 and 1906. At the end of the collection is a
<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series of clippings and scrapbooks which include large quantities of ephemera and some important writings. </p>
<p>The
<ref target="micro" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Microfilm</ref> series consists of selected correspondence, family papers and genealogies, nursery plans and notes, financial records, scrapbooks, and miscellany. Prominent correspondents in the series include Thomas A. Edison, Helen Keller, Alfred C. Kinsey, Jack London, and Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>Correspondents in addition to those listed above include W. Atlee Burpee, Herbert G. Gleason, J. G. Lemmon, W. W. Morrow, Spiegel Samu, F. Harvey Vachell, and F. A. Waugh.</p>
<p>Burbank made extensive use of photography to record the course and results of his plant
breeding, and a large quantity of prints and negatives, including glass plates, has been
transferred to the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>The papers of Owen Lattimore (1900-1989) span the years 1907-1997, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period from 1950 to 1989. The collection relates to both private and professional matters and is arranged in seven series, the largest of which--constituting one-third of the collection--is
<ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
General Correspondence
</ref>. The
<ref target="war" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Wartime Activities
</ref> series includes records documenting Lattimore's service as a political advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, director of the Pacific Operations of the United States War Information Office, and a member of the United States Reparations Mission to Japan. Another large series,
<ref target="senate" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Senate Hearings
</ref>, contains correspondence and records documenting Lattimore's defense against Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy's charges that he participated in communist espionage during the 1940s. Also in the collection is a
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and Writings
</ref> series that includes articles, book reviews, and texts of Lattimore's speeches and lectures. Notable in the
<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref> series are Lattimore's handwritten journals on his pioneer trips to the inner-Asian borderlands during the 1920s and 1930s. The remaining series are titled:
<ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Subject File
</ref>,
<ref target="eleanor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Eleanor Holgate Lattimore File
</ref>,
<ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Addition
</ref>, and
<ref target="ovsz" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Oversize
</ref>.</p>
<p>Records in the collection chronicling Lattimore's field research and travels in Peiping (China), Mongolia, and Manchuria during the 1920s and 1930s are particularly comprehensive. In addition to the aforementioned journals, the
<ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Subject File
</ref> contains transcribed notes of Lattimore's ethnographic, historical, and cultural observations made during his travels, including information on the languages and dialects of the region. Lattimore's extensive travels in Asia provided the basis for many of his writings, which together with the related correspondence with publishers, form another strong element of the collection. Among these writings is an unpublished and incomplete autobiographical sketch, "Happiness Is Among Strangers."</p>
<p>Another integral component of the collection is Owen and Eleanor Lattimore's expansive
<ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
correspondence
</ref>, both incoming
and outgoing, with colleagues, family, and friends. Many Oriental and Asian scholars,
publishers, and professional colleagues are represented, including Isabel Casseres,
Lauchlin Bernard Currie, Diluv Khutagt, Ildikó Ecsedy, Else Glahn, Elvebeuck Grebenik,
Walther Heissig, Caroline Humphrey, Fujiko Isono, John Ulric Nef, Robert P. Newman,
Urgunge Onon, Edgar B. Snow, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Arnold Joseph Toynbee. There is
also considerable correspondence of many of Lattimore's personal friends and advisors,
including Joseph Barnes, Robert LeMoyne Barrett, Arnold Bernhard, Stanley H. Burton,
Rosemary Carruthers, G. Herbert Childs, John King Fairbank, Joseph Needham, Gerard Piel,
and Margaret L. Richards. There is lengthy correspondence with his son David and his
brother Richmond, as well as letters of his lawyers and accountants, especially William
Dill Rogers and Nancy K. Mintz, which document his investments, estate settlements,
establishment of the Lattimore Institute for Mongolian Studies, and litigious fallout
from his Senate investigations.</p>
<p>Material documenting Lattimore's appointment by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as an advisor to the Chinese Nationalist government in Chungking during
<ref target="war" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
World War II
</ref> is scant. Although there are summaries of conversations, biographical assessments, and advisory reports prepared for Chiang Kai-shek, these files are incomplete. Of particular importance, however, is the considerable correspondence between Lattimore and Lauchlin Bernard Currie of the State Department concerning the war against Japan and the problems of American assistance to the Chinese war effort. There is evidence that late in his life Lattimore, with the assistance of his lawyers and Robert P. Newman, sought to obtain through the Freedom of Information Act copies of government records documenting his tenure in Chungking, to supplement and complete his personal papers.</p>
<p>Files documenting the Senate's investigation of espionage and conspiracy charges against Lattimore are extensive. In 1950 Joseph R. McCarthy described Lattimore as the "chief architect" of a United States foreign policy that resulted in the Communist party's conquest of mainland China. McCarthy accused Lattimore of being the "top Soviet agent in the United States." Lattimore denied the charges, and a Senate committee initially vindicated him. Additional accusations were made a year later, however, and the Justice Department twice brought indictments against Lattimore on perjury charges stemming from his earlier testimony. The indictments were later dismissed in federal court. Preserved in the
<ref target="senate" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Senate Hearings
</ref> series is correspondence with Lattimore's legal advisors, academic colleagues, and the public concerning the testimony. Also available are an extensive file of newspaper clippings and magazine articles, reports, hearing transcripts, motions, memoranda, opinions, and other documents relating to the perjury charges and Congressional investigation.</p>

<p>The papers of Jack Roosevelt Robinson (1919-1972) span the years 1934-2001, with the
bulk of the material dating from his introduction as the first African American to play
major league baseball in the twentieth century in 1947 to the fortieth anniversary in
1987 of this event. The main body of the Robinson Papers was transferred by his widow,
Rachel, in 1985 to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, a nonprofit organization she founded
in 1973. Additional material from a variety of sources, including photocopies of
selected items from other collections of papers in the Library of Congress, was added to
the collection by the foundation prior to its donation to the Library. The papers
contain correspondence, memoranda, telegrams, subject files, baseball contracts, fan
mail, speeches and writings, financial and legal records, congressional testimony,
military records, and a variety of printed material relating to Robinson's career as a
baseball player and corporate executive and to his participation in political
activities, religious and civic organizations, the civil rights movement, and media
affairs. The collection also contains numerous items celebrating Robinson's legacy
represented in a series of posthumous commemorations and events. The papers are
organized in the following series: <ref target="basebl" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Baseball File</ref>, <ref target="civil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Civil Rights</ref>, <ref target="poli" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Political File</ref>, <ref target="bus" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Business and Corporate File</ref>, <ref target="relig" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Religious and Civic Activities</ref>, <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>, and <ref target="addition2023" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">2023 Addition</ref>.</p>
<p>When Jackie Robinson began his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he broke the
unwritten "color line" that had existed in major league baseball since the late
nineteenth century, and a major portion of the collection is devoted to his pioneering
efforts in this regard. The <ref target="basebl" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Baseball File</ref> contains correspondence with friends and associates, baseball
officials, and sportswriters affiliated with the sport, including Buzzie Bavasi, Roy
Campanella, Happy Chandler, Charles Dressen, Arthur Mann, Ralph Norton, Walter F.
O'Malley, Branch Rickey, and Joseph L. Reichler. The series includes originals and
photocopies of Robinson's baseball contracts with the Dodgers, as well as his unsigned
contract with the New York Giants following his trade in 1956. Fan mail from home and
abroad offered Robinson support and encouragement in his efforts both on and off the
field, while often providing a glimpse into the writers' own struggles with racial
intolerance. Although the subject of discrimination in baseball is a constant theme
throughout the entire collection, the Baseball File especially contains specific files
on the topic.</p>
<p>After the 1956 season, the Dodgers traded Robinson to their crosstown rivals, the New
York Giants. Robinson declined to accept the trade and announced his retirement from
baseball in 1957. The <ref target="basebl" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Baseball
File</ref> contains material relating to Robinson's trade and subsequent retirement,
including the public's response to both. In 1962, Robinson became the first African
American player to win election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in
Cooperstown, New York. The Baseball File contains congratulatory letters and tributes in
celebration of the event, including material documenting a testimonial dinner given in
his honor by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. A telegram from Martin Luther
King, Jr., who had a central role in sponsoring the dinner, regretting his absence due
to "an important turn of events in Albany, Georgia," symbolizes the link between
athletics and civil rights issues which defined Robinson for the remainder of his
life.</p>
<p>Robinson joined King in the civil rights action known as the Albany Movement, and a file
on the Mount Olive Baptist Church, Sasser, Georgia, in the <ref target="civil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Civil Rights</ref> series reveals the aftermath of
that protest. The series further highlights Robinson's commitment on behalf of civil
rights in his work with the Congress of Racial Equality, the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, the Student Emergency Fund, and the NAACP, which awarded him the
Spingarn Medal in 1956. Material concerning tensions that arose between Robinson and
other members of the civil rights community, including his criticism of Roy Wilkins's
leadership of the NAACP and his open conflict with Malcolm X, is also contained in this
series.</p>
<p>In addition to his support of racial equality at home, Robinson also developed an
interest in the African independence movement. As a trustee of the African American
Students Foundation, Robinson sponsored African students at American colleges and
universities, and as a member of the American Committee on Africa, he supported a
boycott of the 1968 Olympic Games in protest against the readmittance of the Union of
South Africa, which had been barred from the 1964 games. The <ref target="civil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Civil Rights</ref> series contains material
concerning Robinson's contributions in support of these and other African-related issues
and organizations.</p>
<p>Robinson signaled the start of his involvement in political affairs by endorsing Richard
M. Nixon in the 1960 presidential campaign. Although he identified with the Republican
party, Robinson declared that he voted not for the party but for the candidate, and his
eventual support of the Democratic administration of John F. Kennedy and for Democratic
party candidates in the 1964 and 1968 presidential elections illustrated this point. The
<ref target="poli" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Political File</ref> documents
Robinson's various political alliances, including his affiliations with the progressive
wing of the Republican party, primarily as a close adviser of New York governor Nelson
A. Rockfeller, for whom he served as special assistant for community affairs.</p>
<p>Though not fully engaged as a political activist until the 1960s, Robinson was no
stranger to political controversy as evidenced by his 1949 appearance before the United
States House Un-American Activities Committee, where he refuted Paul Robeson's alleged
statement that African Americans would not fight in a war against the Soviet Union.
Robinson's testimony in the <ref target="poli" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Political File</ref> recalls his support of American values and traditions and
explores the aftermath of this witness to his faith in America as well. A temporary
alliance in 1963 between Harlem congressman Adam Clayton Powell and Malcolm X was the
focal point for further controversy involving Robinson. Public reaction to an open
letter written by Robinson critical of Powell and published in the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Amsterdam News</part>
</title> is contained in the Political File. Other public officials represented in the
Political File, in addition to those noted above, include Chester Bowles, Barry
Goldwater, W. Averell Harriman, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson, Kenneth B.
Keating, and Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Following his retirement from baseball in 1957, Robinson accepted a position as vice
president for personnel with Chock Full O'Nuts, a coffee manufacturer and lunch counter
chain. As an advocate of "minority enterprise," Robinson also helped establish several
black-owned businesses, including the Freedom National Bank of New York, the Gibraltar
Life Insurance Company, and the Hamilton Life Insurance Company. The <ref target="bus" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Business and Corporate File</ref> contains
material relating to these business ventures as well as to other aspects of Robinson's
career as a businessman and entrepreneur and to his promotion of economic development in
the African American community at large.</p>
<p>The <ref target="relig" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Religious and Civic
Activities</ref> series highlights Robinson's work with church and interfaith
organizations, including the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the National
Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, and the United Church
Men of the United Church of Christ. Reflecting Robinson's commitment to community-based
affairs and active sense of social responsibility, the series also documents his many
civic activities, in particular his participation in youth guidance and counseling
programs. Material relating to Robinson's concern for urban renewal and housing for
disadvantaged populations, including a small file on the Jackie Robinson Construction
Company, is also located in this series.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> documents
Robinson's broadcasting and media activities as well as the many tributes in his honor
occasioned by his death in 1972. In addition to his role as a sportscaster, Robinson's
work on radio and television enabled him to publicize his personal views and beliefs
through political and social commentary. The Subject File contains contracts, program
proposals, and transcripts relating to Robinson's media appearances, while his legacy is
celebrated through numerous commemorations, posthumous tributes, and awards. The Subject
File also contains the records of the Jackie Robinson Foundation, a nonprofit
organization founded to promote leadership development and scholarship among
marginalized youth.</p>
<p>Robinson was a popular public speaker, and the <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings</ref> series displays the breadth of his
audiences and interests. In addition to speeches, the series also contains drafts,
contracts, notes, and outlines of the articles and books Robinson wrote with
collaborators, including <title localtype="simple">
<part>Baseball Has Done It</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Breakthrough to the Big League</part>
</title>, and <title localtype="simple">
<part>I Never Had It Made</part>
</title>. Extensive files relating to Carl Thomas Rowan's biography, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Wait Till Next Year</part>
</title>, are also located here, as is correspondence with associates and coauthors,
most notably, Alfred Duckett, Robinson's long-time ghostwriter. The series includes
items relating to the 1950 motion picture <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Jackie Robinson Story</part>
</title>, in which Robinson starred, and the script of the 1980 Broadway musical <title localtype="simple">
<part>The First</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>Robinson served as a commissioned second lieutenant in the United States Army from 1942
to1944. The <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>
series contains medical and personnel records from Robinson's military service,
including court-martial charges of insubordination resulting from his refusal to obey an
order to move to the back of a segregated military bus in Texas. A military jury
acquitted Robinson, and shortly thereafter, he received an honorable discharge. A small
group of family papers is also included in the Miscellany series, as are the many
condolences received following his death.</p>
<p>A <ref target="addition2023" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">2023 Addition</ref> to
the papers consists of a May 1958 letter from Robinson to President Dwight D. Eisenhower
responding to the president's urge for "patience" on the topic of civil rights, and

<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I of the papers of the Benjamin Brown French Family spans the years 1802-1924, with
the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1826-1870. Papers of Benjamin Brown
French (1800-1870) comprising Part I are organized in the following series: <ref target="journ1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Journals</ref>, <ref target="corr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref>, and a <ref target="misc1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> consisting of
poems and other occasional writings, printed matter, and a scrapbook of clippings.</p>
<p>Benjamin B. French came to Washington, D.C., in 1833 from his native New Hampshire. He
had already served briefly as clerk and representative in the New Hampshire state
legislature when friends in the state secured him an appointment in the Clerk's
Department of the United States House of Representatives. He kept this post twelve
years, was elected clerk of the house in 1845, and in 1847 joined Samuel F. B. Morse in
the operation of the Magnetic Telegraph Company. President Franklin Pierce appointed him
Commissioner of Public Buildings in 1853, an office French resigned in 1855 only to be
reappointed by President Lincoln in 1861. French made the acquaintance of twelve
presidents, from Andrew Jackson to Ulysses S. Grant, but it was Lincoln to whom he was
most devoted. One of his duties as Commissioner of Public Buildings was to attend
semiweekly White House receptions and introduce Mary Lincoln to visitors. When Willie
Lincoln died on February 20, 1862, French was called upon to take charge of the funeral
arrangements. At Gettysburg he was on the speaker's stand when Lincoln dedicated the
national cemetery in Pennsylvania on November 19, 1863, and in April 1865 he stood by
the dying president's bedside.</p>
<p>French's private <ref target="journ1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">journals</ref>,
which date from 1803 because of the enclosure of early family manuscripts, were begun by
French in August 1828 and continue intermittently until August 1870. In addition to
commentary on New Hampshire politics during the Jacksonian era, they contain extended
discussion of freemasonry, the Magnetic Telegraph Company, and the day-to-day life of a
man of affairs close to the central figures of his time. Cabinet officers, Congressmen,
military leaders, and people of the arts and society appear frequently and sometimes on
intimate terms throughout these pages. Included are comments on the presidency of
Franklin Pierce, with whom French had been politically identified prior to his bolting
to the Republican side in the late 1850s, and numerous passages illuminating French's
regard for Lincoln. A hymn by French was sung at the Gettysburg dedication ceremony, and
later he wrote a twelve-page retrospective of the event. His journals also portray other
turning points of the Civil War, including a graphic description of the reception in the
capital to news of the fall of Richmond. Lincoln's assassination is fully recorded, as
are the acrimonious days following the war. The journals, edited by Donald B. Cole and
John J. McDonough, were published in <title localtype="simple">
<part>Witness to the Young Republic: A Yankee's Journal, 1828-1870</part>
</title> (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1989).</p>
<p>Almost all of the items in the <ref target="corr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series in Part I consists of French's letters to and from his
half brother, Henry Flagg French, a judge in Exeter, New Hampshire. Much like the
journals, they contain accounts of the interior and exterior lives of nineteenth century
Americans who observed much and recorded what they saw. Benjamin's letters treat
religion, politics, art, and literature and are especially illuminating for their asides
about events on the floor of the House of Representatives or in the halls of Congress.
Observing fisticuffs between two congressmen which ended in cravats being pulled and
vest buttons popped, he attended quietly to his minutetaking, kept his composure, and in
a report to his brother noted that throughout the pandemonium he was "calm as a summer
morning."</p>
<p>The <ref target="misc1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> files
include a scrapbook of French's writings and holograph and printed poems.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II of the Benjamin B. French Family Papers spans the years 1778-1940, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1813 to 1893. Benjamin B. French, Francis Ormond French
(1837-1893), and Amos Tuck (1810-1879) are the principal figures represented. The
material is organized in the following series: <ref target="journ2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Journals</ref>, <ref target="corr2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="misc2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">2019 Addition</ref>, and <ref target="ovsz2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize</ref> material.</p>
<p>
<ref target="journ2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Journals</ref> of Francis O.
French, the older son of Benjamin B. French contain an account of a youth from a
prominent family growing up in the nation's capital in the mid-nineteenth century.
Beginning in 1850 when he was twelve years old, “Frank” French regularly kept his
journals through 1856, a period during which he attended Mr. Wight's Rittenhouse Academy
in Washington and Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire, and began his studies
at Harvard College. Entries range from jottings on typical, day-to-day neighborhood and
student activities to extended remarks on significant events, such as the deaths of
prominent American political figures and the fire in the United States Capitol which
destroyed the Library of Congress in 1851. Additionally the journals record the comings
and goings of numerous family members who visited the French family. The first volume of
these journals was edited by John J. McDonough and published as <title localtype="simple">
<part>Growing Up on Capitol Hill: A Young Washingtonian's Journal, 1850-1852 /Francis
O. French</part>
</title> (Washington, D.C.: Library of Congress, 1997). Also included are journals kept
by Francis French in 1864 and 1870-1871, in which he recorded a visit to his dying
father in Washington, and fragments of journals by Benjamin French and Amos Tuck.</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series
comprises chiefly the personal letters of Benjamin B. French, Francis O. French, and
Amos Tuck and is organized largely to reflect the original arrangement of the bound
volumes from which the material was removed. Complementing his papers in Part I, the
correspondence of Benjamin B. French with various family members includes news and
observations similar to those in his journal. In frequent letters to his son Francis, he
interlaces news from home and fatherly advice with observations and commentary on
political figures, government officials, and significant events. The letters reveal
French's growing anxiety as the nation drifted toward dissolution, tempered by his
determined faith that the Union would prevail. Even though an admirer of Abraham
Lincoln, French was still critical of Lincoln's “shilly shally” during the months
leading up to the war. French's letters to his son Francis in April 1865 provide an
important account of events surrounding Lincoln's death, including French's assertion
that John Wilkes Booth had created an unusual disturbance at Lincoln's second
inauguration. French's correspondence also includes a miscellaneous group of incoming
letters relating primarily to his Masonic activities. </p>
<p>The personal letters of Francis O. French also constitute a significant portion of the
<ref target="corr2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series.
Francis French trained as a lawyer at Harvard and after the Civil War established a
successful career in international finance. In 1870 he joined Jay Cooke &amp; Co.,
survived its collapse in 1873, and joined a group with controlling interest in the First
National Bank of New York. In 1880 he sold his interest in First National and, in
failing health, traveled extensively in his final years. His correspondence offers less
striking commentary than his father, but provides insight into the life of a prosperous
American family of the late nineteenth century and includes letters received from
prominent men in finance and government as well as family members. Correspondents
include Harris C. Fahnestock (banker), Daniel Chester French (a cousin), and secretaries
of the treasury Lot M. Morrill, Hugh McCulloch, William A. Richardson (a cousin), and
John Sherman.</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> also
contains family correspondence of Amos Tuck, whose daughter Ellen married Francis French
in 1861. An inhabitant of New Hampshire, Tuck studied law, served as a representative in
Congress from 1847 to 1853, and was involved in the founding of the Republican party in
1853-1854. His letters to family members include commentary on politics, his travels in
the Midwest in the 1851, and the devastation of the South after the Civil War. There are
also a few personal letters of William Merchant Richardson, father of Benjamin B.
French's first wife and a chief justice of the New Hampshire Superior Court. The
Correspondence series contains a small number of photocopies of original letters,
invitations, and related documents from prominent figures received by Benjamin B. and
Francis O. French but not included among these papers.</p>
<p>Among the speeches and writings in the <ref target="misc2">Miscellany</ref> series is
Benjamin B. French's memoir of his early years as a clerk in the House of
Representatives and a Fourth of July speech prepared by William Merchant Richardson in
1808 discussing Thomas Jefferson and the Embargo Act. Other items among the Miscellany
include biographical material, certificates, a commonplace book, memorials, memorabilia,
and scrapbooks.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add">2019 Addition</ref> series consists of a letter dated July 15,
1850, to Benjamin B. French from employees of the Magnetic Telegraph Company regarding
the failure of his re-election as president.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Henry Robinson Luce (1898-1967) span the years 1917-1967 with the bulk of
the material dated 1945-1967. The collection is organized in seven series: <ref target="spcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Special Correspondence </ref>,
<ref target="buscorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Business and Social
Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject
File </ref>, <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and
Writings File </ref>, <ref target="finan" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Financial Papers </ref>, <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany </ref>, and an <ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Addition </ref>. Although the papers primarily document Luce's work with
organizations, they also reflect his other professional and personal concerns as well.
As head of the Time-Life-Fortune publishing empire, Luce's concerns touched many aspects
of political, social, and cultural history in the United States during the mid-twentieth
century. Luce believed that America should serve as a democratic example in the world,
and his internationalist perspective is documented throughout the collection, most
particularly in files on China and international law. </p>
<p>With three exceptions – deeds from Mepkin plantation in South Carolina dated 1917, army
records from 1920, and speeches from 1928 onward – the earliest date of papers is 1933
by which time Luce was already a successful editor and publisher and was beginning to
devote more of his time to interests outside Time/Life. There is no material for the
earlier years when Luce was beginning his publishing endeavors. From 1933 to1967, there
are papers on Luce's households, finances, travels, and his advisory and philanthropic
activities, but the bulk of the collection dates after 1945 and relates to activities
ancillary to his publishing concerns. Papers relating to Time, inc., were retained by
the corporation.</p>
<p>The Henry Luce Papers were received at the Library in approximately twenty major
sections, with subdivisions corresponding closely with the administrative structure of
Luce's office. Although the integrity of this arrangement has been retained, the present
organization of the seven series is a simplification of the original order. A large
portion originally consisted of files from Luce's office assistants, or personal
assistants, in particular, Edward K. C. (“Kip”) Finch, Russell Bourne, and Emmeline
Nollen. There is evidence, too, that Allen Grover and C. D. Jackson, officials of
Time/Life, were entrusted with Luce's personal and financial affairs. From these people
come numerous memoranda for Luce's attention, drafts of correspondence, and responses to
his requests for research on a particular subject. Much of the Luce correspondence in
the collection was handled by one of his assistants. There is, however, correspondence
composed by Luce himself scattered throughout the collection. Notations in pencil on
memoranda or on incoming correspondence were Luce's method of suggesting syntactic
improvement or to relay the gist of his own thoughts on a subject.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Special Correspondence
</ref> series consists of social notes and generally brief correspondence with
enclosures from well-known figures of the century seeking favors or an exchange of
ideas. Some of these letters are social notes; others relate to organizations or briefly
discuss political issues. A note from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, for example,
states that he would like to discuss a specific matter with Luce, but there is no record
of the actual discussion. The series also includes substantive correspondence, both
personal and business, from individuals such as Raymond E. Baldwin, Baron Max Aitken
Beaverbrook, Chester Bowles, Brendan Bracken, Pearl S. Buck, William C. Bullitt, John
Foster Dulles, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Walter Judd, Henry Cabot Lodge
(1902- ), Henry Kissinger, Archibald MacLeish, Robert G. Menzies, Nelson Rockefeller,
David O. Selznick, Spyros P. Skouros, Herbert Bayard Swope, Arthur H. Vandenberg,
Thornton Wilder, and Wendell L. Willkie. Copies of Luce's replies are usually
absent.</p>
<p>The <ref target="buscorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Business and Social
Correspondence </ref> series includes invitations and requests to sponsor or serve on
committees; attend conferences, dinners, and luncheons; appear on radio and televison;
write letters of recommendation or articles; schedule appointments; and contribute
money. Articles, books, and other gifts sent to Luce are documented through his
thank-you notes.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File </ref> is the
largest series in the collection. Focusing on Luce's involvement with national and
international organizations as director, trustee, sponsor, patron, chairman, committee
member, donor, or contributor, it documents the degree to which Luce participated in the
life of a particular organization. By far the largest areas of interest for Luce relate
to Chinese cultural, social, and political history, Christianity and philanthropy in the
United States, and international law. Papers on the latter are confined to the <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File </ref>, with
cross-references to the <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and Writings </ref>. The papers pertaining to China are also primarily
located in the <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File
</ref>. These extensive files range from Luce's support for Christian missionary work
and educational institutions to war relief campaigns as the Chinese fought to expel
Japanese forces during World War II and later as Nationalist forces battled the
Communists for control of the country. Additional material located in the <ref target="buscorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Business and Social
Correspondence </ref> series is filed with miscellaneous correspondence in reference
to China. China is also the subject of many speeches in the <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings File </ref>. Files on
Christianity and philanthropy are found in the <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File </ref> under the names of organizations, such as
those related to Presbyterians.</p>

<p>The papers of Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) span the years 1726 to
1907, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1770-1789.
Consisting of correspondence, journals, records, articles, and other material,
the collection reflects Franklin's many interests and activities.</p>
<p>
<ref target="series1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Series I</ref>
relates chiefly to Franklin's mission to France to obtain diplomatic
recognition of the rebellious colonies as well as financial and military aid
and to participate in the peace negotiations in Paris and London preceding the
Treaty of Paris in 1783. The series contains seventeen interrelated volumes
chiefly pertaining to Franklin's years in France. Six are letterbooks of the
United States legation in Paris, 1779-1782. Other volumes include letters in
French to Franklin, 1777-1780; records of the peace commissioners, 1780-1783;
negotiations in London, 1775 (original and Franklin's corrected transcript);
and Franklin's correspondence with David Hartley, 1775-1781. Single volumes
include the Craven Street, London, letterbook, 1772-1773, one of the few
pre-Revolutionary Franklin letterbooks to survive; the signed Petition of the
First Continental Congress to the King, 16 October 1774; and Richard Oswald's
journal concerning the peace commission, 1782.</p>

<p>The papers of John Hay (1838-1905) span the years 1783 to 1999, with the bulk of the
material concentrated in the period 1897-1905. The collection focuses on his diplomatic
efforts as secretary of state but also contains material on his career before 1898 and
on his personal life. It is composed mainly of correspondence, <ref target="scrap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> scrapbooks</ref>, and newspaper clippings
supplemented by <ref target="diary" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> diaries</ref>,
<ref target="ltrbks" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> letterbooks</ref>, and <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> miscellaneous material </ref>.
There is also an <ref target="auto" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> autograph

<p>American diplomacy from 1898 to 1905 is the central theme of the <ref target="diary" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Diaries and Notebooks</ref> and various
correspondence series. As secretary of state during the period, Hay played a crucial
role in the formulation and execution of American foreign policy. The diaries reflect

with personal and social activities, also provide an occasional glimpse into his
official concerns.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Special

General Correspondence</ref> series provide information on all aspects of American
foreign affairs while Hay was secretary of state and are useful in portraying his
nondiplomatic activities as well. The letters from American diplomatic agents throughout
the world reveal the conditions in various countries that influenced official American
policy and the manner in which policy decisions were implemented. The largest number of
letters in this category are from Joseph Choate and William W. Rockhill in the <ref target="spcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Special Correspondence</ref>.
Hay's correspondence with Roosevelt and Alvey A. Adee, among others, provides an
intimate glimpse into the formation of policy. The <ref target="spcorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Special Correspondence</ref> and <ref target="gencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence</ref> series also help to

<p>The papers of Ira Clarence Eaker (1896-1987) span the years 1917-1989, with a large
portion concentrated in the World War II period, 1942-1945. The papers consist of two
parts processed at different times which document two distinct phases of Eaker's life.
Part I treats Eaker's military career in the United States Army Air Corps (1918-1947).
Part II relates to Eaker's activities after leaving the military, including those as an
aviation industry executive, spokesman for the air force and air power, and as a
syndicated newspaper columnist who wrote and lectured on national security issues. Eaker
maintained contact with military associates throughout his life, and the themes of air
power, aviation, and belief in a strong national defense are prominent throughout the
collection.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I of Eaker's papers documents nearly every aspect of his long career in the United
States Army Air Corps and is especially comprehensive for the World War II years, when
Eaker organized and commanded the Eighth Bomber Command in England and commanded the
Eighth Air Force, United States Army Air Forces, in the United Kingdom and the
Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF) in Italy. Eaker led the first American B-17
bomber strike against German occupation forces in France, bombing Rouen in 1942. He was
a key proponent of precision daylight bombing attacks on Germany's industrial war
production, and in 1944 while commanding the MAAF he led the first shuttle bombing raid
from Italy into Germany, landing in the Soviet Union after striking German targets.
Eaker's final positions in Washington, D.C., as chief of air staff and then as deputy
chief of army air forces involved demobilization of the air forces and planning for the
creation of the air force as a separate branch of the military service.</p>
<p>The <ref target="diary1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Diaries</ref> series
contains typescript accounts of Eaker's activities in the military for the period
1942-1947, including his military service in World War II and his work in Washington
until his retirement. The diaries include Eaker's daily schedule and record his flying
time. Details are more official than personal.</p>
<p>The <ref target="persfile1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Personal File</ref>
comprises Eaker's files relating to his military career prior to World War II. Personal
correspondence and official documents depict the growth and promotion of military
aviation. During the late 1920s and 1930s, Eaker was a pioneering aviator who made test
flights and successful and unsuccessful attempts at aerial records. The files for
March-May 1934 cover the period when the army air corps transported mail following the
cancellation of commercial airmail contracts by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eaker
commanded the operations of Air Mail Route 4, Western Zone.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorr1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> series contains correspondence of a personal and general nature
for the period 1942-1950. The correspondence for the war years complements the official
material in the World War II File.</p>
<p>Although material relating to World War II can be found in almost every series in Part
I, the <ref target="ww21" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">World War II File</ref>
contains Eaker's extensive working files relating to his establishment of the Eighth
Bomber Command in England in 1942 and his command of the Eighth Air Force in the United
Kingdom in 1943 and the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces in Italy in 1944 and early 1945.
Files for the Eighth Bomber Command and the Eighth Air Force document the American
program of daylight strategic bombing of Germany and Eaker's close working relationship
with the Royal Air Force. Topics covered in the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces files
include the invasion of southern France, the strategic bombing offensive against German
oil supplies, and shuttle bombing missions. Types of material include correspondence and
memoranda between officers and military units, correspondence with families of missing
aircrew men, bombing reports, and minutes of meetings.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> features
notable events in Eaker's career as a pioneering aviator in the army air corps,
including the Pan-American Goodwill Flight around South America (1926-1927), the
refueling-endurance flight of the "Question Mark" (1929), and the operation of an air
mail route in 1934 as well as flight records for his entire military career. Other
material pertains to Eaker's activities with a variety of organizations relating to
military and civil aviation.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings</ref>
series contains articles, books, speeches, and associated material relating to speaking
engagements. Principal themes are aviation, air power, and national security. In
addition to articles and speeches prepared and delivered by Eaker, other speeches and
articles seem to have been prepared by Eaker for such individuals as chiefs of the Army
Air Corps James E. Fechet and Oscar Westover. Book files include sections on <title localtype="simple">
<part>Army Flyer</part>
</title> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Winged Warfare</part>
</title>, which Eaker coauthored with Henry Harley Arnold.</p>
<p>Prominent correspondents in this portion of the collection include Henry Harley ("Hap")
Arnold, Joseph K. Cannon, Winston Churchill, Jacob L. Devers, James E. Fechet, Barney M.
Giles, W. Averell Harriman, Arthur Harris, Robert A. Lovett, John C. Slessor, Carl A.
Spaatz, and Nathan F. Twining.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>The second part of the Eaker Papers begins with <ref target="diary2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">diaries</ref> containing brief accounts of daily activities,
including meetings and events. The <ref target="sched2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Scheduling File</ref> and the appointments and phone messages in
the <ref target="subj2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> complement
this series by supplying similar information and lengthening the period of time
documented.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorr2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> documents Eaker's activities following the Second World War.
Correspondence from the late 1940s through the 1950s concerns his career with Hughes
Tool Company and Hughes Aircraft Company, first in Houston, Texas, and then in
California. Correspondence relates to social and philanthropic activities on behalf of
the Hughes organization, as well as to Eaker's contact with wartime colleagues. Eaker
also reviewed the script for the movie "Twelve O'Clock High," written by Bierne Lay and
Sy Bartlett, who had served in the Eighth Air Force in Britain during the war. Beginning
in 1957, Eaker was based in Washington, D.C., where he served as East Coast
representative of Douglas Aircraft and later on the advisory board of Hughes Aircraft,
using his access to Defense Department officials to learn about policy and future
expenditures. Correspondence after the early 1960s often contains comments on Eaker's
national security columns. Eaker maintained long-lasting correspondence with wartime
friends and coworkers and the letters record their periodic reunions. Well documented is
his close friendship with Carl A. (Tooey) Spaatz. Other prominent and frequent
correspondents in this portion of the collection include Donald Douglas, Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Hunter Harris, Houston Harte, Harris Hull, Glenn Jackson, Lyndon B. Johnson
(1950s), Bierne Lay, Curtis LeMay, James Parton, Virgil Pinkley, Elwood R. (Pete)
Quesada, Eddie Rickenbacker, Sir John C. Slessor, and John Hay (Jock) Whitney.</p>
<p>The <ref target="sched2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Scheduling File</ref>
records Eaker's activities in the period 1952-1982 in correspondence, agendas, and other
material relating to speaking engagements, ceremonial events, trips, conferences, and
board meetings. Frequent activities include attendance at Air Force Logistics Command
(AFLC) commanders' conferences, Air Force senior statesmen briefings at the Pentagon,
visits to the Air Force Academy, lectures to classes at the Air War College of the Air
University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, and speaking engagements for the Air
Force, civic organizations, and other groups. In the 1970s, Eaker and Arthur Metcalf of
the United States Strategic Institute made several trips to Europe, where Eaker visited
World War II acquaintances in Britain, including Sir Arthur Harris and Sir John C.
Slessor. He was briefed at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels,
and visited Albert Speer, Hitler's minister of armament production, in Germany. In 1976,
Eaker interviewed Speer about the air war in World War II and subsequently spoke and
wrote about these conversations. Copies of Eaker's speeches are contained in the <ref target="speech2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref>. </p>
<p>Also in the <ref target="speech2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and
Writings File</ref> are copies of Eaker's articles, book reviews, syndicated news
columns, and speeches. Major topics are aviation, air power, and national security.
Eaker's newspaper columns span two decades, 1962-1980. First syndicated by the Copley
News Service and then by the Los Angeles Times Syndicate of the General Features
Corporation, the columns cover such topics as defense budgets, assessments of
administrations from Kennedy through Reagan on national security issues, the Vietnam
War, the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union, the space program,
the Middle East, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). Eaker's speeches focus
primarily on aviation and national security. They also include recollections of military
leaders such as James H. Doolittle, James E. Fechet, Benjamin Foulois, Nathan F.
Twining, Oscar Westover, and businessmen such as Howard Hughes. Many of the books Eaker
reviewed related to World War II and prominent individuals he knew, such as Winston
Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> contains
correspondence, reports, minutes, clippings, and printed matter relating to Eaker's
involvement with the air force and the Air Force Academy and organizations such as the
Falcon Foundation, the Air Force Academy Foundation, and the Air Force Historical
Foundation. Other files concern the Hughes Aircraft Company and Donald W. Douglas
(1892-1981) and Donald W. Douglas (1917- ), of Douglas Aircraft, as well as Eaker's
dealings with Congress during the early 1960s. Similar subjects are covered in the <ref target="subj1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File of Part I</ref>, with
overlap between the first and second portions of the collection in the late 1940s and
early 1950s.</p>
<p>The <ref target="jpfile" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">James Parton File</ref>
consists of papers accumulated by Eaker's wartime aide and biographer covering the last
years of the general's life. Correspondence relates to the preparation of Parton's book,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>"Air Force Spoken Here": General Ira Eaker and the Command of the Air</part>
</title>. Since Eaker was in failing health during the preparation of the biography,
1984-1986, much of Parton's correspondence is addressed to Ruth Eaker. During these last
years of Eaker's life, Parton helped by answering correspondence and assisting with the
disposition of the general's medals, uniforms, and memorabilia.</p>

</ref> series includes documents relating to the state governments of Georgia, North

covering the statues and proclamations of the Confederate government, and blank official
forms.</p>
<p>Prior to the evacuation of Richmond, Virginia, by the Confederate government, Judah P.
Benjamin ordered the records packed in wooden cases for removal from the capital and
placed them in the custody of the chief clerk of the department, William J. Bromwell.
Bromwell hid the records of in a barn near Charlotte, North Carolina. Following a
quarrel with Benjamin, Bromwell disclosed the location of the records to John T.
Pickett, who had been a Confederate agent in Mexico and whose personal papers are also
in the Library of Congress. Pickett sold the records to the United States in 1872 for
$75,000. Among the nearly one hundred additions was the transfer in 1920 of a group of
Confederate treasury records from the United States Treasury Department. In 1921, much
material now in the <ref target="war" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> War Department
</ref> series was received from descendants of Confederate officers. The series entitled
<ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Additions </ref> consists of
several miscellaneous groups of records formerly organized under separate headings. The
material consists chiefly of Confederate financial bonds.</p>
<p>Correspondence of many of the leading officials of the Confederate States appears in the
records. In addition to the dominant figure, Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin, other
correspondents include Bolling Baker, G. T. Beauregard, Clement C. Clay, Lewis Conger,
Jefferson Davis, Edwin DeLeon, Anthony J. Guirot, Charles J. Helm, Lewis Heyliger, Henry
Hotze, L. Q. C. Lamar, A. Dudley Mann, James M. Mason, Christopher G. Memminger, John T.

<p>The collection describes in detail the professional and political
careers of Josiah Bartlett (1729-1795), signer of the Declaration of
Independence and governor of New Hampshire, and his sons, Levi Bartlett
(1763-1828) and Ezra Bartlett (1770-1848), both physicians and jurists, and
Josiah Bartlett (1768-1838), physician, member of Congress, and president of
the New Hampshire State Senate, as well as the papers of Ezra's son, Josiah
Bartlett, (1803-1853), also a physician, and other descendants.</p>
<p>The papers primarily reflect the professional affairs of rural
physicians and the daily activities and concerns of a large New England family
in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Specific topics in
the early correspondence include activities in Congress prior to the
declaration of war on Great Britain in 1812, sentiment in New Hampshire
favoring the war, and an account by an American combatant of the repelling of
the British attack on Fort McHenry and Baltimore in 1814.</p>
<p>Later correspondence concerns the Missouri Compromise, Republican and
Whig politics in New Hampshire, antislavery sentiment, the Seminole War, the
Panic of 1837, life in the United States Navy, activities in military hospitals
during the Civil War, and business developments in New England after the
war.</p>

<p>The papers of Henry Shapiro (1906-1991) span the years 1920-1992 with most of the
material concentrated between 1931 and 1973. The collection focuses principally on
Shapiro's long career as United Press International's chief Moscow correspondent and
bureau manager. Present during the regimes of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, and
Leonid Brezhnev, Shapiro reported on a range of issues pertaining to Soviet society as
well as many of the major events which shaped East/West relations during this period.
The papers include wire service reports, reference files, correspondence, articles,
lectures, a memoir, notes, and personal files organized in five series: <ref target="persfile" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal File </ref>, <ref target="upi" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> United Press International (UPI)
Moscow Bureau </ref>, <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and Writings File </ref>, <ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Additions </ref>, and <ref target="ovsz" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Oversize </ref>. The collection includes English and Russian
language material.</p>
<p>The <ref target="persfile" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal File </ref>
provides a biographical profile of Shapiro based on correspondence, scrapbooks,
clippings, photographs, and other material. Correspondence in the series is primarily
with friends and colleagues concerning visits and travel plans. Other letters pertain to
arrangements for lectures and issues related to publishing Shapiro's articles. The
scrapbooks include material pertaining to his entire career as well as numerous
felicitations on his retirement in 1973.</p>
<p>Shapiro's files from the <ref target="upi" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> United
Press International Moscow Bureau </ref> constitute the heart of the collection.
Shortly after arriving in Moscow in 1933 and briefly studying Soviet law, Shapiro became
a correspondent for Reuters of London and the <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Herald Tribune</part>
</title>. In 1937 he was hired by UPI and was appointed manager of its Moscow bureau in
1939. He retained that position until his retirement in 1973, concluding an unusually
long career in a world capital in which foreign correspondents typically had much
shorter periods of duty.</p>
<p>The <ref target="upiadmin" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Administrative File
</ref> of the Moscow Bureau series reflects the organizational and financial aspects of
the bureau documented in correspondence and memoranda regarding assignments,
arrangements for interviews, and communications with other UPI offices and personnel.
The file also includes financial records and contracts with Soviet personnel.</p>
<p>The <ref target="upiref" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Reference File </ref>
includes Russian language newspaper clippings, printed matter, notes, and wire service
reports pertaining to virtually every aspect of Soviet life and society. Because contact
with many typical news sources was not available to Western reporters, Soviet newspapers
and magazines were an important source of supplemental information and background
material. Whitman Bassow, a UPI Moscow correspondent in the 1950s, notes in his book
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Moscow Correspondents</part>
</title> that "the key to comprehensive reporting was always the clipping file from the
Soviet press and magazines and notes compiled by reporters." <ref target="bassow" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> * </ref> Notable and extensive material in the
<ref target="upiref" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Reference File </ref>
pertains to agriculture, trials during the 1930s, biographies, Jews and Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union, elections, espionage, and the regime of Nikita
Khrushchev. Foreign relations are documented by considerable material regarding Soviet
relations with the United States and China. Files pertaining to China contain many
reports on the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations during the early 1960s. </p>
<p id="bassow">* Bassow, Whitman, <emph render="italic">The Moscow Correspondents</emph>
(New York: W. Morrow, c.1988), 299.</p>
<p>The <ref target="upiwire" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Wire Service Reports
</ref> in the UPI series were filed by the Moscow Bureau from 1931 to 1971. Although
there are numerous gaps, the reports provide a comprehensive account of the Soviet Union
during that time. The reports were often rewritten and shortened by editors in the
United States, adding to the historical significance of the copies retained by Shapiro.
There are a few incoming cable and telegraph messages from UPI's New York office from
1946 to 1948, but the file is primarily composed of the Moscow bureau's outgoing
stories. Eugene Lyons, a predecessor of Shapiro's at UPI and an early Soviet sympathizer
who left the Soviet Union in disillusionment in 1934, wrote many of the reports from
1931 to 1933. Reports from the mid-1930s cover social and economic conditions, foreign
policy, political struggles, scientific advances, and aeronautical achievements. Events
leading up to Germany's invasion of Russia are chronicled from 1939 through the summer
of 1941. Reports are absent for 1942-1945, but resume in 1946 with many written by
Walter Cronkite, who served as a UPI correspondent from 1946 to 1948. Shapiro was one of
the few American reporters who remained in Moscow as the Cold War intensified during the
late 1940s and early 1950s. Reports during the 1950s and 1960s are fairly complete and
reflect the heightened tensions between the USSR and the United States. Prominent topics
during this period include the rise and fall of Nikita Khrushchev, internal Soviet
politics, the breakdown of relations with China, Fidel Castro and Cuba, the exploration
of outer space, economic and domestic policies, Leonid Brezhnev's ascent to power, and
the Viet Nam conflict.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings File
</ref> contains drafts and printed copies of Shapiro's articles and drafts and newspaper
serializations of his book, <title localtype="simple">
<part>L'U.R.S.S. après Staline</part>
</title>. Also included are interviews with Nikita Khrushchev (1957), Hungary's János
Kádár (1966), and Nicolae Ceausescu (1972). After retiring from UPI, Shapiro continued
to travel and lecture on the Soviet Union, and his files contain lecture notes and other
related material. Other files include notes on détente, politics, and ideology, and a
transcript of Shapiro's memoir recorded by the American Jewish Committee.</p>
<p>
<ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Addition I </ref> supplements the
collection with correspondence, reference files, wire service reports, and speeches and
writings files. The correspondence is composed chiefly of personal letters from
professional colleagues and friends, including journalist Nicholas Daniloff during the
early 1980s, and copies of some of Shapiro's letters. Reference files contain background
material pertaining to Russian leaders, civil rights, education, and international
incidents. The speeches and writings file includes draft articles, book projects,
interviews, and material related to Shapiro's lecture schedule. Wire service reports
relate primarily to relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during the
1960s. Noteooks in Addition II include handwritten notes from press conferences and
interviews with Soviet officials as well as observations on conditions in the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p>The papers of Clement F. Haynsworth (1912-1989), span the years 1886-1989, with the majority of the papers concentrated from 1957 through 1989 when Haynsworth was a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The papers consist of three series: <ref target="perscorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Personal Correspondence
</ref>, <ref target="appeals" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
United States Court of Appeals File
</ref>, and <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref>. There are no materials documenting Haynsworth's early life, his military service, or his career as a lawyer. Papers related to Haynsworth's unsuccessful nomination to the United States Supreme Court are in the possession of Furman University located near Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The <ref target="perscorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Personal Correspondence
</ref> series includes incoming and outgoing correspondence relating to Haynsworth's personal interests and activities. Because many of Haynsworth's friends were members of the legal profession, some of these letters also relate to his professional activities. Interfiled throughout this series are a few letters of his wife, Dorothy Barkley Haynsworth. There is little personal correspondence prior to 1976.</p>
<p>The <ref target="appeals" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
United States Court of Appeals File
</ref> constitutes almost all of the collection. This series documents Haynsworth's more than thirty years of service on the fourth circuit (Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina). The papers are divided into three subseries: <ref target="apgencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
General Correspondence
</ref>, <ref target="apcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Case File
</ref>, and <ref target="apoff" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Office File
</ref>. The <ref target="apgencorr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
General Correspondence
</ref> subseries contains incoming and outgoing correspondence mainly from members of the legal profession and prisoners. The letters pertain primarily to fourth circuit administrative matters and contain complaints and pleas for legal assistance from prisoners. The "Congratulatory Correspondence" folder includes many letters to prominent members of the legal profession and government officials; a few of these letters contain comments by Haynsworth about his unsuccessful nomination to the Supreme Court. Other than the congratulatory correspondence, there is no correspondence prior to 1978.</p>
<p>The <ref target="apcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Case File
</ref> subseries includes correspondence and memoranda, chiefly between judges, court clerks, and lawyers; opinions (drafts and printed copies); orders; briefs; writs; petitions; notes; background information; clippings; and printed matter. Many of the files also contain a sheet (photocopied from the outside of the original file folders during processing) that lists the judges on the panel, their votes (concurrences or dissents), and the concurrences or dissents of non-panel judges who reviewed the opinion. Cases are arranged chronologically by court term, October through June, and therein by case number. Opinions generated after June are filed in the previous October court term, e.g., an opinion written in August 1979 would be filed in the October 1978 term.</p>
<p>The majority of the case files pertain to civil cases and cases involving prisoner appeals and complaints. The files reflect the wide range of cases heard by the fourth circuit court on issues such as civil rights, constitutional law, labor relations, antitrust matters, maritime law, government regulations, and prisoners' rights. Many of the files for the terms from 1961 through 1967 contain only printed opinions; the Library did not receive any other material relating to these cases.</p>
<p>Also included in this subseries are cases documenting Haynsworth's occasional sittings on special three-judge district court cases (usually involving constitutional challenges to state statutes) and his service as a visiting judge for other circuits. These cases are filed at the end of the <ref target="apcase" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Case File
</ref> subseries.</p>
<p>The <ref target="apoff" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Office File
</ref> subseries relates to Haynsworth's administrative duties and professional activities during his tenure on the court of appeals. The files reflect his participation in judicial conferences and councils, admission ceremonies, legal organizations, and moot courts. Also documented are his interests in judicial conduct standards and in the creation of a national court of appeals that would reduce the Supreme Court's work load by hearing less important cases. An item worthy of note in this subseries is a thirty-six page document entitled "United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit," which provides a detailed description of the inner workings of the court (See the "General" file in container 166).</p>
<p>The final series in the papers, <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref> includes correspondence, memoranda, reports, speeches, writings, photographs, genealogical material, and printed matter. The bulk of the series dates from 1957 to 1989 and relates to Haynsworth activities as an alumnus and member of the Advisory Council of Furman University.</p>
<p>The most significant and frequent of Haynsworth's correspondents are Jacques Barzun, William J. Brennan, Warren E. Burger, Tom C. Clark, John Paul Frank, Ernest F. Hollings, Edward Moore Kennedy, J. Woodrow Lewis, Daniel John Meador, Arthur R. Miller, Richard M. Nixon, Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Strom Thurmond, Johnnie McKeiver Walters, Bernard J.

<p>The papers of Benjamin S. Loeb (1914- ) span the years 1945-1999, with the bulk of the material dating from 1961 to 1971. The papers concern Loeb's collaboration with Glenn Theodore Seaborg on several books concerning Seaborg's chairmanship of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971. The books, each of which focuses on a presidential administration, explore Seaborg's efforts to promote arms control and peaceful uses of nuclear power. The collection consists of research files containing excerpts from Seaborg's journal, correspondence, memoranda, cables, reports, minutes, interview transcripts, writings, speeches, newspaper clippings, and printed matter. The files are arranged alphabetically by subject or type of material.</p>
<p>A large portion of Loeb's research files consists of material culled from the Seaborg Papers located in this division. Loeb relied heavily on Seaborg's journal which contains diary-like entries supplemented by copies of correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes, and printed matter. Loeb's files provide topical access to the chronologically-arranged journal on issues such as arms control and test ban treaties, the environment, fast breeder reactors, multilateral force, peaceful nuclear explosions, plowshare programs, and uranium enrichment. Many of the photocopied documents contain Loeb's annotations.</p>
<p>Loeb augmented his use of Seaborg's papers with research at the John F. Kennedy Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, and the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C. Files relating to the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 include copies of State Department cables secured by Loeb through Freedom of Information Act requests. Also included in the collection are Loeb's correspondence and interviews with prominent former government officials including McGeorge Bundy, W. Averell Harriman, and Theodore C. Sorensen.</p>
<p>Featured in the collection is Loeb's investigation into allegations that Zalman Shapiro, president of the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation of Pennsylvania, provided Israeli associates with nuclear secrets and enriched uranium in the 1960s. Included are copies of Federal Bureau of Investigation memoranda and reports attained by Loeb through the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>The papers of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) span the years from about the 6th century BCE to
1998, with the bulk of material dating from 1871 to 1939. The collection documents
Freud's founding of psychoanalysis including the birth and maturation of psychoanalytic
theory, the refinement of its clinical technique, and the proliferation of its adherents
and critics. Many facets of Freud's life and work are featured including his early
medical and clinical training; his relationship with family, friends, colleagues,
students, and patients; his association with early psychoanalytic societies; his
perspectives on analytical training; and his numerous writings. The collection includes
family papers, correspondence, holograph and typewritten drafts of writings, patient
case files, legal documents, estate records, receipts, military and school records,
certificates, notebooks, a pocket watch, a Greek statue, genealogical data, interviews,
research files, exhibit material, bibliographies, lists, photographs and drawings,
newspaper and magazine clippings, and other printed matter. The papers are arranged in

They are, for the most part, in German, English,
and French.</p>
<p>The bulk of the collection consists of original documents, photocopies and other
facsimiles, transcripts, English translations, and published editions collected and
given to the Library of Congress by the Sigmund Freud Archives. The archives was founded
in 1951 by a group of New York analysts, including K. R. Eissler, Heinz Hartmann, Ernst
Kris, Bertram David Lewin, and Herman Nunberg, to collect Freud letters and writings
which were at risk of being lost or destroyed in the aftermath of World War II. Because
Freud did not retain copies of his outgoing correspondence, letters written by him were
geographically dispersed among his many correspondents. The archives succeeded in
obtaining original Freud material through gifts, most notably Anna Freud's bequest, and
through purchase. When unable to acquire original documents, it solicited copies,
transcripts, translations, and printed editions. </p>
<p>The <ref target="fampap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref> series
contains <ref target="corsf" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Freud's
correspondence</ref> with members of the Freud and Bernays families. Included are
exchanges with his mother Amalia Freud, his wife Martha Freud, and their children Ernst
L., Martin, Mathilde Freud Hollitscher, Oliver, Sophie Freud Halberstadt, and Anna, the
only one of Freud's children to become a psychoanalyst. Among Freud's correspondence
with his wife are a series of courtship letters or “brautbriefe” written on an almost
daily basis between 1882 and 1886. The letters detail Freud's activities, associations,
and aspirations during the period following his graduation from medical school to the
establishment of his private practice in Vienna. Extensive correspondence with his
sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and in-laws reveals the part played
by Freud as paternal head of a large and extended family. Among these letters is
correspondence between Freud and Minna Bernays, his sister-in-law and close confidante.
The series also contains correspondence between individual family members <ref target="corothers" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">other than Freud</ref> as well
as correspondence between family members and persons outside the family. Included are
letters by several prominent individuals including Princess Marie Bonaparte, Ruth Mack
Brunswick, C. G. Jung, and Otto Rank. A <ref target="famsub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">subject file</ref> containing legal documents, certificates,
estate records, school records, writings, and printed matter also relates to Freud's
family.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>
series features Freud's correspondence with friends, mentors, colleagues, students, and
patients spanning seven decades from his school days to his death in 1939. Nearly six
hundred correspondents are represented in the series. At times, their correspondence is
limited to a single letter to or from Freud. In other cases, the correspondence is
extensive, revealing Freud as a prolific correspondent who frequently chastised others
for a lack of similar diligence. The earliest of such correspondence consists of Freud's
adolescent letters to friends Eduard Silberstein and Emil Fluss while a student at the
Leopoldstädter gymansium and the University of Vienna. Freud's subsequent correspondence
includes letters from individuals who influenced his early work including Josef Breuer
and J. M. Charcot. </p>
<p>The formative years of Freud's psychoanalytic theories is detailed in his correspondence
with Berlin physician Wilhelm Fliess. Beginning in 1887 and continuing until just after
Freud's break with Fliess in 1902, these letters are among the more revealing in the
collection. The series also contains Freud's correspondence with many of his earliest
adherents, some of whom also later broke with him. The letters trace the development of
a psychoanalytic movement that coalesced around Freud in the years following his break
with Fliess. Included is correspondence with Karl Abraham, Alfred Adler, Franz
Alexander, A. A. Brill, M. Eitingon, Sándor Ferenczi, Eduard Hitschmann, Ernest Jones,
C. G. Jung, Oskar Pfister, Otto Rank, Theodor Reik, Hanns Sachs, Ernst Simmel, Wilhelm
Stekel, and Edoardo Weiss, among many others. The Abraham, Brill, Eitingon, Jones, Jung,
Pfister, and Reik correspondence includes original Freud letters. Prominent women in the
field represented in the series include Lou Andreas-Salmoné, Ruth Mack Brunswick, Emma
Eckstein, Jeanne Lampl-de Groot, and Joan Riviere. Princess Marie Bonaparte's
correspondence with Freud is located in her papers in the Manuscript Division. Notable
among Freud's patients with whom he corresponded is Sergius Pankejeff whom Freud
referred to as the “Wolf-Man.” Other prominent correspondents include Albert Einstein
with whom Freud corresponded on the nature of war, Carl Koller who shared Freud's
interest in the medical uses of cocaine, and novelist and essayist Thomas Mann.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> series
includes patient case files from the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna and the Bellevue
Sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland, largely during the 1880s. Copies of book
annotations and marginalia by Freud provide glimpses into the development of his
theories. His career is highlighted in a large file of newspaper and magazine clippings
as well as material concerning the Goethe Prize he received in 1930 and the Nobel Prize
which he coveted but never received. Calendars kept by Freud record his daily activities
from 1916 to 1918. Freud's early life is documented by biographical data, birth and
marriage certificates, and gymnasium, university, and military records. His departure
from Nazi-controlled Austria and immigration to London in 1938 is tracked through
American diplomatic cables and newspaper clippings. The series also contains letters and
telegrams written on his death just over a year after his arrival in England. </p>
<p>The <ref target="writ" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Writings</ref> series contains
holograph and typewritten drafts, galley proofs, offprints, and published copies of many
of Freud's writings. Because of the large format of many of these items, the material
has been filed in the Oversize series. The writings range chronologically from an 1877
article on his early research on eels to portions of his last major work, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion,</part>
</title> published shortly before his death. Included in the series are articles, case
histories, portions of books, published letters, lecture notes, prefaces, introductions,
a travel journal, chronologies, obituaries, bibliographic notes, and casual jottings.
The writings are arranged and described largely according to the bibliographic sequence
established by James Strachey in <title localtype="simple">
<part>Indexes and Bibliographies</part>
</title>, volume 24 of <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund
Freud</part>
</title> (London, 1974) and, for works published after 1974, by Ingeborg Meyer-Palmedo
and Gerhard Fichtner, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Freud-Bibliographie mit Werkkonkordanz</part>
</title> (Frankfurt am Main, 1989). </p>
<p>The <ref target="supp" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Supplemental File</ref> series
consists of material about Freud's life and work written or collected by Freud
associates and scholars. The bulk of the material dates after Freud's death. Apart from
articles and other writings, the series includes material related to observances in 1956
of the centenary of Freud's birth; Norman Kiel's compilation of contemporary and
posthumous reviews of Freud's published works; and a medical file comprising
correspondence, notes, and case histories by Hans Pichler and Max Schur relating to
Freud's illness with cancer. Lists and research guides include Gerhard Fichtner's
bibliographies, chronologies, lists, and inventories of Freud's correspondence and
writings. Also included are auction catalogs listing the sale of Freudiana and lists of
Freud's lectures and students at the University of Vienna. <ref target="supmisc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> at the end of the series consists
primarily of printed matter including a clipping file dated largely between 1954 and
1979 which traces scholarly and popular treatment of Freud in the decades following his
death.</p>
<p>The <ref target="inter" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Interviews and
Recollections</ref> series was compiled by K. R. Eissler, a founder and longtime
secretary of the Sigmund Freud Archives. Hundreds of Eissler's interviews with Freud's
associates, patients, and family are included in the series, most of them conducted in
the 1950s. The series contains transcripts, some with corrections by the interviewee,
and summaries of interviews, usually made when the subject requested that the interview
not be tape recorded. Audio recordings that were made have been transferred to the
Library's Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division. Among those
interviewed by Eissler are family members Anna Freud Bernays, Anna Freud, Ernestine
Drucker Freud, Harry Freud, Oliver Freud, Judith Bernays Heller, and prominent
associates such as Franz Alexander, Ludwig Binswanger, Felix Deutsch, Eduard Hitschmann,
Edith Banfield Jackson, Ludwig Jekels, Sergius Pankejeff, Oskar Pfister, Theodor Reik,
Joan Riviere, Philipp Sarasin, Hermann Swoboda, and Edoardo Weiss. Also included in the
series are recollections about Freud contained in letters, writings, and notes either
addressed to or collected by Eissler. </p>
<p>
<ref target="art" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Artifacts</ref> in the collection
consist of Freud's pocket watch which he gave to his personal physician Max Schur and a
small Greek statue which Freud kept on his desk and later gave to Angelika Frink. The
collection also includes an oil portrait of Freud.</p>
<p> An <ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Additions</ref> series consists
largely of supplemental material added to the collection in 2010. Included are
photographs, wall text, and captions from exhibits commemorating the centenary of
Freud's birth and an index to the standard edition of Freud's works. Files from the work
of Herman and Margarete Nunberg include a history of the "Rat man" case and English
translations by Margarete Nunberg of Freud's correspondence with Princess Marie
Bonaparte, René Laforgue, and others. Photocopies of Freud's correspondence with writer
Arnold Zweig, which were derestricted in 2010, are also present. The legibility of the
photocopies varies considerably. A 2019 addition includes a letter from Freud to Paul
Federn in 1913, in which he outlines his life history, and letters from Freud to Heinz
Hartmann, 1927-1939, copies of which are in the <ref target="gencor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref> series.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection of Spanish American documents of Hans Peter Kraus (1907-1988) spans the
years 1433 to 1966, with the bulk of the items dated from the sixteenth through the
eighteenth centuries. The collection relates to the history and culture of colonial
Spanish America, including the early history of territories now part of the United
States. Contained in the collection are colonial documents recording the exploration of
the New World, the government of New Spain (Mexico), the administration of the
Inquisition, taxation and economic conditions in the colonies, Spanish relationships
with Native Americans and the French, and the loss of parts of the Spanish empire to
American expansion. The collection includes material relating to explorers Amerigo
Vespucci (1451-1512), Giovanni da Verrazzano (1485-1528), Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca
(16th cent.), Pedro de Ursúa (d.1561), and Lope de Aguirre (d.1561). It also includes
letters and documents from the archives of Juan de Zumárraga (1468-1548), bishop of
Mexico, and his successors. The collection is in English, Spanish, French, and Italian
and is organized in a <ref target="spa" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Spanish
American Documents </ref> series and a <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany </ref> series consisting of notes and printed matter
providing descriptions and partial translations of the collection. The collection
contains letters, decrees, order books, reports, instructions, dispatches, printed
material, and miscellaneous legal documents arranged by number as listed in <title localtype="simple">
<part>Hans P. Kraus Collection of Hispanic American Manuscripts</part>
</title> prepared by J. Benedict Warren.</p>
<p>One of the earliest documents in the collection is a contemporary manuscript copy of
Vespucci's letter to Piero Soderini (1452-1522), 10 September 1504, in which he
discussed all four of his voyages (item 119). Verrazzano's explorations, including his
survey of the eastern seaboard of North America, are documented in letters, documents,
and transcripts relating to the explorer and his family (item 121). Contemporary
narratives and a copy of a royal dispatch trace the history of Ursúa's and Aguirre's
exploratory expedition down the Amazon River and the latter's subsequent mutiny (items
141-143). Three original documents highlight the family life of Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, a
pioneer in the conquest of Mexico and the exploration of Florida (item 122). Other
material concerning early attempts to colonize Florida and the territories north of
Mexico are included in an order book maintained by Viceroy Luis de Velasco (1500?-1564)
and his predecessor, Antonio de Mendoza (1492?-1552) (item 140); a volume of documents
regarding Pedro de Céspedes Vallejo Diaz, a soldier who served in Florida (item 148); a
letter of Diego Quiroga y Losada, governor of Florida (item 152); a treatise by Antonio
de Arredondo on Spanish claims to the colony of Georgia; and the letters and documents
of the Gourgues family, in particular a narrative manuscript of the expedition of
Dominique de Gourgues (1530?-1593) to Florida, 1567-1568 (item 144). Five variant
versions of Gourgues's narrative located in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, France
(Fonds Français 2145, 3884, 6124, 19899, and 20794) have been reproduced on two reels of
microfilm and are available in the Manuscript Division Reading Room. (Microfilm shelf no. 17,674)</p>
<p>A collection of decrees and letters, a majority of which resided in the archives of
Zumárraga, relates primarily, though not exclusively, to the Catholic church in New
Spain (items 1-116). In addition to ecclesiastical affairs, these items also document
the government and administration of Mexico including its social structure and culture,
public health, education, the arts, public works, and the living conditions of its
native population. The documents bear the signatures of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor
(1500-1558), and his wife, Isabel, Empress (1503-1539), and their son and daughter,
Philip II, King of Spain (1527-1598), and Juana de Austria, Princess of Portugal
(1535-1573), and their descendants, Philip III (1578-1621) and Philip IV (1605-1665),
kings of Spain. Another set of documents concerning the civil administration of New
Spain also illuminates the career of Zumárraga's colleague, Bartolomé de las Casas,
bishop of Chiapas (items 123-139). These items reflect the development and impact of the
New Laws of the Indies, 1542, and the colonists' reaction to them. Items pertaining to
the Inquisition in Mexico include documents of the trial of artist Simón Pereyns (fl.
1558-1588) (item 145); material relating to Antonio and Diego Calderón and family,
official printers to the Holy Office of the Inquisition (item 149); and a holograph and
printed volume of the rules and regulations governing the fraternity of Saint Peter
Martyr, a brotherhood consisting of members of the Inquisition (item 151).</p>
<p>Among the latest items in the collection are dispatches sent in 1819 from Mexico to
Spain by Juan Ruiz de Apodaca which contain information on the government, condition,
and defense of the Spanish territories that are now part of the United States, including
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, with references to American forces and
settlements in Louisiana and Florida (item 162).</p>

<p>The papers of Asa Philip Randolph (1889-1979) span the years 1909-1979, with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1941-1968. The collection comprises the
following series: <ref target="family" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family
Correspondence</ref> of Lucille Randolph with her husband and documents relating to
her death; <ref target="gencor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref>; a <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject
File</ref> which includes correspondence, memoranda, minutes of meetings, reports,
and other documents relating to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the Fair
Employment Practices Committee (FEPC), and the March on Washington Movement; a <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref>;
a <ref target="bio" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Biographical File</ref>; and <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> including address
books, appointment books, awards, press releases, printed matter, scrapbooks, travel
documents, and other material.</p>
<p>Although there is little material relating to Randolph's career before 1941, the
collection highlights his life's work of more than sixty years as an African American
union leader and civil rights advocate. The papers reflect Randolph's dedication to
securing political, social, and economic rights for African Americans and illustrate the
means he favored to accomplish these goals. The <ref target="gencor" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>, and <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref> document Randolph's strategy for
obtaining his goals. Numerous letters, speeches, and articles reveal his concept of mass
protests and passive resistance without violence emulating the tactics of Mohandas K.
Gandhi in the struggle for India's independence from Great Britain. Before implementing
his strategy of mass protests and passive resistance by means of picketing and the March
on Washington Movement, Randolph sought the advice of friends, African American leaders,
educators, and organizations concerning his strategy for obtaining political, social,
and economic freedom for African Americans. When some of the leadership, including that
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, withheld support,
Randolph became convinced that he needed to reach the masses.</p>
<p>Randolph was successful in implementing the tactics of a massive march. On June 25,
1941, Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 which provided for the first Fair
Employment Practices Committee (FEPC). Further pressure led Roosevelt to issue Executive
Order 9346 on May 27, 1943, establishing a new FEPC, whose jurisdiction included all
employment by government contractors and whose authority was expected to encompass
discrimination in labor union membership as well as discrimination in employment. The
papers document the FEPC until it expired in 1946. The papers also show the NAACP's
eventual support for Randolph by donating funds and, in later years, through other
methods of cooperation.</p>
<p>Documents relating to the aftermath of a White House meeting, March 22, 1948, between
President Harry S. Truman and Randolph and other African American leaders reveal that
Randolph and Grant Reynolds threatened civil disobedience if African Americans were
forced to register for a compulsory military draft, and on March 31, 1948, Randolph and
Reynolds initiated a civil disobedience campaign against military discrimination. Truman
issued Executive Orders 9980 and 9981 on July 26, 1948, creating a Fair Employment Board
to combat racial discrimination in Federal employment and a President's Committee on
Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services. The civil disobedience
threat was called off. During the Korean War, Truman issued Executive Order 10210
forbidding discrimination by government contractors and Executive Order 10308 creating
the President's Committee on Government Contract Compliance. Executive orders during the
administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower include the issuance on August 13, 1953, of
Executive Order 10479 reconstituting the Contract Compliance Agency and placing it under
the chairmanship of the vice president, and the issuance on January 18, 1955, of
Executive Order 10590 establishing the President's Committee on Government Policy to
enforce a nondiscrimination policy in federal employment.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> also
includes information on the African American labor movement. Financial and legal papers,
correspondence, and other material, 1925-1978, relate to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters founded by Randolph and others in 1925. The <title localtype="simple">
<part>Messenger</part>
</title>, a magazine founded and edited by Randolph and Chandler Owen in 1917, was
converted into the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Black Worker</part>
</title>, which became the official organ of the brotherhood. Also in the <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> are papers
documenting the Pullman Company's refusal to recognize the union as a bargaining agent
for the porters and maids of the railroad companies. Subsequently, Randolph, as
president of the union, petitioned the National Mediation Board, the Arbitration Board,
and the Interstate Commerce Commission and won recognition for the union. In 1935, he
succeeded in having the Pullman porters classified as railroad men, thereby entitling
them to all associated benefits, and on August 25, 1937, the Pullman Company signed its
first agreement with its porters, attendants, and maids.</p>
<p>The collection also relates to other topics that Randolph considered to be vital to
African Americans, such as the relationship of African Americans to Africa. In 1962, the
American Negro Leadership Conference on Africa was formed with Randolph and Martin
Luther King, Jr., as co-chairs. Its purpose was to coordinate relations between African
Americans and Africa. Other topics highlighted in this collection include the Prayer
Pilgrimage held in Washington, D.C., May 17, 1957; the Youth March for Integrated
Schools, October 25, 1958; the Negro American Labor Council, 1960-1968, founded by
Randolph; National Educational Committee for a New Party, 1946-1947; the White House
Conference "To Fulfill These Rights," 1965-1966; and the "Freedom Budget for All
Americans," 1966-1967, a ten-year program conceived by Randolph as a means of abolishing
poverty in the United States. Some documents indicate that Randolph in later life
believed that the time was over for mass marches and demonstrations such as the one he
had proposed in 1941 and the one he had organized and led in 1963 for freedom and jobs.
As a result of his successes with the labor unions and with presidents from Roosevelt to
Johnson, he was convinced that quiet negotiations and consultations should be
sufficient. </p>

estranged from her sister Susan, formerly her closest friend and housemate, and
had outlived most of her associates. As recorded in the legal file and in her
scrapbooks, she intiated several lawsuits between 1895 and 1901 as a result of
her confinement at the State Hospital for the Insane in Danville, Pennsylvania.
Other topics include the elections of 1872 and 1888, the Republican Party,

<p>The papers of Thomas Francis Bayard (1828-1898) consist of correspondence, <ref target="letter" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> letterbooks</ref>, financial
records, legal papers, notes, reports, memoranda, photographs, speeches, printed matter,
<ref target="scrap" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> scrapbooks</ref>, and related
material. The collection spans the years 1780-1899, with the bulk of the material dated
1860-1898.</p>
<p>The papers relate generally to Bayard's career as a senator, 1869-1885, secretary of
state during President Grover Cleveland's first administration, 1885-1889, and as
ambassador to Great Britain, 1893-1897, during Cleveland's second administration. The
collection contains files pertaining to real estate and financial matters, national
politics, the Fitz-John Porter case, Samoa, fisheries and sealing questions, the
Venezuelan boundary dispute, Anglo-American and German-American relations, presidential
campaigns, the silver question, the Tilden-Hayes election, tariff problems, Sir Lionel
S. Sackville-West, the conflict between China and Japan over the vassalage of Korea,
American annexation of Hawaii, and the Isthmian transit and canal problem.</p>

<p>The papers of Juanita Kidd Stout (1919-1998) span the years 1873-1998, with the bulk of
the material concentrated between 1948 and 1998. In October 1959, the governor of
Pennsylvania appointed Stout a judge of the municipal court in Philadelphia County while
she was a candidate for the post in the Philadelphia municipal elections. That November,
she won a ten-year term on the court, thus becoming the first African American woman
appointed or elected judge of a court of record or general jurisdiction in the United
States. In 1988, when she was appointed to the Pennsylvania supreme court, Stout became
the first African American female justice on a state supreme court. The papers are
organized in the following series: <ref target="pers" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal File </ref>, <ref target="gen" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General
Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="legal" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Legal

</ref>, <ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings
File </ref>, and <ref target="ov" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Oversize
</ref>.</p>
<p>The family papers of the <ref target="pers" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal
File </ref> include material on Stout's parents, Henry M. and Mary A. Kidd, who
emigrated from Missouri and Mississippi respectively to settle in Seminole County,
Oklahoma, when the state was still a territory. The family file also includes material
on the Kidd and Chandler families and on Charles O. Stout, a college professor and
Juanita Kidd Stout's husband.</p>
<p>Correspondents in the <ref target="gen" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General
Correspondence </ref> series include Lawrence L. Boger, David L. Boren, John W.
Hamilton, Gail Nelson, Henry Ponder, Richard S. Schweiker, and Arlen Specter.</p>
<p>Most of the <ref target="legal" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Legal File </ref>
documents Juanita Kidd Stout's service on the municipal court and the court of common
pleas, both for Philadelphia County, and as a justice of the Pennsylvania supreme court.
She developed an interest in juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and welfare while
serving as an assistant district attorney for Philadelphia County during the 1950s, and
once on the municipal court she was noted for her outspokenness on these issues in the
local and national media, for her tough sentencing of recalcitrant juvenile offenders,
and for her continuing contact with juvenile offenders she found to be redeemable.</p>
<p>The bulk of Stout's service was as a judge specializing in murder trials on the court of
common pleas. Most of the common pleas case files relate to trials or hearings where she
rendered a written opinion. These were usually either bench trials, where she sat
without a jury and ruled on both the facts and the law in a case, or <emph render="italic">en banc</emph> hearings, the first stage of the appellate process in
Pennsylvania, where she sat with other judges to hear post-trial motions. She also
retained files about cases in which there was a great deal of media interest, such as
the Ira Einhorn trial, or in which she had a special interest in the legal issues or the
defendants. Some cases not found in the municipal court or court of common pleas case
files are documented in newspaper clippings in the <ref target="pers" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal File </ref> series.</p>
<p>Stout's tenure on the Pennsylvania supreme court was brief, 1988-1989, because she was
close to the Commonwealth's mandatory retirement age when appointed. Much of the supreme
court case file is taken up with actions against corrupt or otherwise troubled
Pennsylvania judges. <emph render="italic">In rel. Stout</emph> relates to her
unsuccessful effort to remain on the supreme court despite the mandatory retirement
rule.</p>
<p>Other cases in which Stout was involved include <emph render="italic">Stout v.
Helm</emph>, part of the Pennsylvania judicial elections file related to challenges
of her nomination petitions when she ran unsuccessfully for a superior court judgeship
in 1966, and Stout v. W. W. Norton &amp; Co., in which she successfully sued journalist
Linn Washington and his publisher in 1995 for allegedly defaming her in his book on
African American judges, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Black Judges on Justice</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>The estates grouping of the <ref target="legal" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Legal File </ref> includes material related to Stout's service as executor of the
estate of her close friend, lawyer, and civic and civil rights activist Sadie T. M.
Alexander, one of the first African American women awarded a doctorate degree in the
United States and the first Black woman to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania
Law School and admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar.</p>
<p>Stout tracked colleagues and African American and female pioneers of bar and bench
through an extensive biographical file that is part of the <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File </ref>. Many lawyers and judges
whose careers she followed were also correspondents, including Raymond P. Alexander,

<p>The papers of Lucy Kroll (1909-1997) span the years 1908-1998, with
the bulk of the material dating from 1950 to 1990. The papers are organized in
the following series:

<p>The
<ref target="client" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Client
File
</ref> forms the largest part of the papers. The Lucy Kroll Agency managed
the careers of numerous clients in the fields of dance, journalism, literature,
motion pictures, music, poetry, psychology, science, sociology, television, and
theater. The amount of material for each client is uneven. It ranges from one
folder to eighty-two boxes depending on the client's success and longevity with
the agency. Therefore, not all types of material are found in every client's
file. Typical material includes contracts, referred to as representation
agreements, between the client and the Lucy Kroll Agency as well as work
contracts between the clients and their employers; incoming and outgoing
correspondence between the agency, the clients, and employers; and notes
written primarily by Lucy Kroll during negotiations on behalf of her clients.
Many files contain financial records such as royalty statements or box office
receipts. Also present is publicity material in the form of photographs,
playbills, and press clippings. Files of the theatrical clients often include
scripts of plays they were considering or in which they appeared. Files of
other clients might include various forms of their writings, such as
typescripts or printing proofs. Some clients' files contain material called
submissions, a process by which the agency submits an actor's name in response
to a general casting call by a producer.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="client" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Client
File
</ref> documents the association between Lucy Kroll and her clients. In
most cases it went beyond a business arrangement and developed into a deep
friendship and mentoring relationship. Kroll often handled the personal affairs
of her clients, including financial support and medical care. Notable clients
included E. R. (Edward Ricardo) Braithwaite, Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, Vincent
J. Donehue, Lillian Gish, Joanna M. Glass, Martha Graham, Uta Hagen, Helen
Hayes, Dorothy Fields (estate of), Horton Foote, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, James
Earl Jones, Daniel and Dorothea G. Petrie, Carl Sandburg, Kim Stanley, Howard
Teichmann, and Fritz Weaver.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref>
series contains family papers, material for Kroll's unfinished memoirs, and
scripts. The family papers include correspondence with family and personal
friends, drama school notes, and household papers. The memoirs section consists
entirely of tributes from friends and colleagues which Kroll intended to
incorporate into her memoirs. The scripts do not have an identifiable
association with any of her clients but may have been under consideration for
various projects.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="office" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Office

</ref> documents the operations of the Lucy Kroll Agency. Included are
daily appointment books, material relating to national and international
business trips, financial records, notes, and items relating to prospective
clients and projects. Incoming and outgoing correspondence records negotiations
with other literary and talent agencies, as well as with publishers, studios,
theaters, producers, and various professionals in the literary and
entertainment fields. The “deal memoranda file” served the office staff as a
quick reference source for the terms of each client's contracts. A Christmas
cards and gifts section documents the many “extras” that Kroll extended to
clients she considered especially important.</p>

<p>The papers of Montgomery Cunningham Meigs (1816-1892) span the years 1799-1971, with the
bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1849-1892. The collection consists of
diaries, journals and notebooks, family papers, correspondence, drawings, maps and
plans, photographs, scrapbooks, sketches and studies, and miscellaneous documents. The
papers are organized in seven series: <ref target="diaries" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Diaries, Journals, and Notebooks</ref>; <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref>; <ref target="corr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence, Military Orders, and Related

<ref target="diariesadd1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Addition I</ref>; <ref target="miscadd2" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Addition II</ref>; and <ref target="over" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>Meigs was a career army officer who graduated from the United States Military Academy in
1836. After a brief stint in an artillery unit, he was transferred to the Corps of
Engineers, where he directed engineering projects for the United States Army between
1852 and 1882. Among the building programs Meigs supervised were the Washington, D.C.,
aqueduct and its masonry arch at Cabin John, the wings and dome of the national Capitol,
an addition to the General Post Office building, a post-Civil War extension of the
aqueduct, and from 1882 to 1892 after his retirement from the army, the Pension Office
building. Lincoln put Meigs in charge of secret plans for the aid of Fort Pickens,
Florida, immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War and in June 1861 appointed him
quartermaster general of the army. Meigs supplied the Union forces throughout the war
and supervised the construction of at least four major federal buildings. In 1875 he
visited Europe to study the organization and command of continental armies.</p>
<p>The papers in this collection consist mostly of private entry books and personal
correspondence. Although some material relates to the fighting during the Civil War, the
bulk of the papers deals with the construction of federal buildings in Washington.
Meigs's journals contain detailed notes in mid-nineteenth century shorthand on the
planning for the aqueduct as well as the expansion of the Capitol and the erection of
the Pension Office building. Interspersed throughout the journals and sketchbooks are
clippings, photographs, and architectural drawings of major buildings under various
stages of construction. The combination of written and illustrative material provides a
rich source for the study of nineteenth-century Washington and its architecture.</p>
<p>The <ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family Papers</ref> contain
correspondence and printed items from Meigs's immediate relatives and descendants. The
major portion, however, comprises his letters to his father, Charles D. Meigs, his
brother, Emlen, and his wife, Louisa Rodgers Meigs. The letters to his father, a
Philadelphia surgeon and medical editor, are concentrated in the Civil War period; those
to his wife and other family members are focused on Meigs's trip to Europe in 1875.</p>
<p>Correspondents in the Meigs Papers include Spencer Fullerton Baird, James Buchanan,
Bernhard Ernst von Bülow, Adolf Cluss, Jefferson Davis, Charles P. Manning, Graf Helmuth
von Moltke, David D. Porter, Frederick William Seward, William T. Sherman, and Joseph
Gilbert Totten. The letterbook, much of which is illegible or undecipherable, contains
copies of outgoing letters to family members as well as friends and associates and also
includes numerous drawings. The volume for April 1861-February 1862 pertains exclusively
to the Civil War, while later volumes focus principally on architectural projects. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Addition I </emph>
</p>
<p>Addition I of the Meigs Papers parallels the earlier portion in scope, arrangement, and
content. There are unbound diary entries, a commonplace book from Meigs's first years in
the military, and an illustrated journal which he kept during a trip to Texas,
1869-1870. The <ref target="famadd1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family
Papers</ref>, the dominant feature of Addition I, include letters between his wife,
Louisa Rodgers Meigs, and Rodgers family members and correspondence between Montgomery
Meigs, his wife and family members, and other relatives. Especially notable in the
Family Papers is a sequence of personal and official communications regarding the
killing of Meigs's eldest son, John Rodgers Meigs, by Confederate guerrillas in 1864.
Meigs believed that his son was the victim of a cold-blooded murder, possibly because of
his status as the son of the Union quartermaster general. John Rodgers Meigs had been
heralded for his bravery during early battles of the Civil War, and his hand-drawn map
of the First Battle of Bull Run and other Civil War documents and correspondence amplify
other material in the collection from that period. Also prominent in Addition I are
letters, documents, sketches, drawings, and other designs relating to Montgomery Meigs's
work on construction of the Capitol, the Washington Aqueduct, and other Army Corps of
Engineers projects. Noteworthy as well are correspondence and career papers pertaining
specifically to the younger Montgomery Meigs (1847-1931), who followed in his father's
footsteps as a public works engineer.</p>
<p>Correspondents include family members Charles D. Meigs and Samuel Emlen Meigs (who often
used his middle rather than first name or first initial) and prominent individuals such
as Ambrose Everett Burnside, Simon Cameron, Jefferson Davis, John B. Floyd, Horace
Greeley, Joseph Henry, Joseph Holt, George Brinton McClellan, William Henry Seward, and
Edwin MacMasters Stanton.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Addition II</emph>

War; a handwritten letter of 1879 concerning personal matters; and photocopies of two
typewritten letters, dated 1891, to his daughter, Louisa Meigs Forbes. Also in Addition
II are photocopies and typed transcripts of a poem written by John Rodgers Meigs,
presumably while a cadet at the United States Military Academy between 1859 and 1863,
and six volumes of the translated text of Meigs's shorthand journals, 1853-1859, 1861,

<p>The papers of Philip Henry Sheridan (1831-1888) span the years 1853 to
1896, with the bulk of the material originating between 1862 and 1887. The
collection includes correspondence, reports, orders, memorabilia, scrapbooks,
commissions, financial records, and speeches organized in the following series:

<p>The papers relate chiefly to the Civil War, Reconstruction, Mexican
border disputes, Indian wars, and military administration. There is very little
material concerning Sheridan's family and personal life. Dominated by
correspondence and reports, the papers document Sheridan's service as an army
commander in the Civil War and his postwar commands up to and including that of
commanding general of the United States Army. The papers also include material
relating to George A. Forsyth's Europe-Asia observation tour; the Piegan
expedition; Gouverneur K. Warren's court of inquiry; Rebecca Wright, a Federal
spy at Winchester, Virginia; reconnaissance of Bighorn Mountain and the valleys
of the Bighorn and Yellowstone rivers; and Henry Page's letterbooks as
quartermaster for the Army of the Potomac. Correspondents include George A.
Forsyth (aide and secretary), James W. Forsyth, Ulysses S. Grant, Michael V.
Sheridan (his brother), and William T. Sherman. There are two letters from
Abraham Lincoln to Sheridan, September 20 and October 22, 1864.</p>
<p>Included also is a draft of Sheridan's published memoirs. Following
the destruction of some of Sheridan's papers in the Chicago fire of 1871, a
large number of transcripts were made from the records of the War Department by
his secretaries. These transcripts have been interfiled with the surviving
original papers.</p>

<p>The papers of Jedediah Hotchkiss (1828-1899) span the years 1835-1908,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1875 to 1898. The papers reflect his
varied activities as a student, geologist, lecturer, school teacher, engineer,
soldier, and historian. Hotchkiss's Civil War diaries, notebooks, and journals
describe troop movements and battles and reveal a topographer's keen eye for
the physical lay of the land. In addition to the original diaries, there are
handwritten and typewritten copies or extracts which either vary somewhat from
the originals or contain additional information.</p>
<p>Some of Hotchkiss's most informative letters are to his wife, Sara
Comfort Hotchkiss, and his brother, Nelson Hotchkiss, during his military duty,
1861-1865. These letters, with variant copies, are in the
<ref target="fam" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Family
Correspondence</ref> series. Other family correspondence includes Hotchkiss's
letters to his wife and children, 1872-1875, while he was touring England and
correspondence of Sara Hotchkiss, 1853-1903.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="gen" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General
Correspondence</ref> series, the largest in the collection, includes personal
and business correspondence, many of which relate to Hotchkiss's involvement
with various land and mining ventures in West Virginia, particularly with the
Gauley Coal Company, the Guyandot Coal Land Association, and the North Flat-Top
Land Association. Between 1875 and 1899, much of the correspondence is
concerned with details of Civil War engagements and the publication of
Hotchkiss's books. He corresponded frequently with former staff officers of
Stonewall Jackson, such as William Allan and Hunter McGuire. There is also
correspondence with Jubal Anderson Early, John Brown Gordon, and Fitzhugh Lee.
Other correspondents include James Gillespie Blaine, William E. Chandler,
Robert Lewis Dabney, John W. Daniel, Stephen B. Elkins, Stonewall Jackson,
Joseph LeConte, Robert E. Lee, William Mahone, S. S. McClure, Dwight Lyman
Moody, John Pelham, Jeb Stuart, Henry St. George Tucker, and Henry A. Wise.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>
reflects Hotchkiss's entrepreneurial and scholarly interests and includes
drafts and notes of his writings and newspaper clipping files on diverse
subjects. The Subject File also includes copies of William Barton Rogers's
notebooks concerning his geological survey of Virginia, 1835-1841. There is no
material in this collection associated with Hotchkiss's political activities as
an independent Congressional candidate in 1884.</p>

<p>The papers of George Lardner (1934-2019) span the years 1923-2005 with the bulk of the
material dating from 1965 to 2001. The collection focuses on Lardner's career as an
investigative reporter with the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph> and
extensively documents his research into a wide variety of national news stories. The
papers are arranged into two parts described below.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I of the Lardner papers span the years 1923-1997, with the bulk of the material
dating from 1965 to 1995 and documents his career as a reporter and as a commentator in
other journals and magazines. Lardner maintained topical files that are organized as an
alphabetical <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref>
series comprising the majority of the papers. A small <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series completes the collection. </p>
<p>The <ref target="sub" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> reflects the
manner in which Lardner acquired, received, and pursued information and then developed
his research into news stories. It includes Lardner's articles, correspondence,
interviews, notes, and the research material he collected as documentary evidence.
Research material includes newspaper and related clippings, reports, legal documents and
trial records, government documents, some of which were obtained through Freedom of
Information Act requests, congressional hearing records, photographs, and printed
matter. Although Lardner's subject terms have been largely retained, personal names have
been modified where necessary to conform to name authority standards of the Library of
Congress.</p>
<p>Lardner's long tenure with the <title>
<part>Washington Post</part>
</title> allowed him to follow topics for many years, reporting from various angles as
fresh information became available. Subjects branch into subcategories for ongoing
stories of several years' duration, such as the court cases of the Iran-Contra Affair.
In other instances, succeeding stories arise out of new lines of inquiry. Lardner's
files on the Central Intelligence Agency, for example, contain material from twenty
years of news gathering and reporting. Lardner's focus was on reform efforts and
congressional oversight of intelligence activities, beginning with his coverage of
investigations by the “Church Committee,” the United States Senate Select Committee to
Study Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities led by Senator Frank
Church. Other intelligence-related subjects in the collection include spy cases,
terrorism, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which
cover, in particular, the COINTELPRO domestic intelligence program, wiretapping,
electronic surveillance, use of lie detectors, and reform efforts. </p>
<p>Lardner's political investigations often concern corruption, wrongdoing, and conflicts
of interest. His records of the Watergate Affair involve the trials, campaign funding
scandals, especially the Milk Fund investigation, impeachment issues, and government and
media access to Richard M. Nixon's recordings of conversations in the Oval Office.
During the administration of Jimmy Carter, Lardner investigated William A. “Billy”
Carter and Hamilton Jordan and reported on the “Floodgate” scandal centering on
representative Daniel J. Flood of Pennsylvania and allegations of influence peddling,
bribes, and Mafia connections. Abscam and Brilab files cover federal law enforcement
“sting” operations. </p>
<p>During the Ronald Reagan administration, Lardner's files concern a number of
investigations, usually led by special prosecutors. Extensive files are available for
the investigations of Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan. Material concerning the Wedtech
investigation relates to improper influence to gain military contracts and is filed
under the company name, Wedtech, with related material filed under Franklyn C. “Lyn”
Nofzinger, Edwin Meese, and E. Robert Wallach. Files on Oliver North and the Iran-Contra
Affair concern the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for hostages and the diversion of
money from that sale to the Contras in Nicaragua. Iran-Contra investigations continued
into the George Bush administration.</p>
<p>Political assassinations are a prominent feature of Lardner's files, especially the
assassination of John F. Kennedy. The Kennedy file includes material on Jim Garrison's
prosecution in 1967 of various figures in New Orleans. Lardner later obtained documents
from the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other
government agencies through the Freedom of Information Act and reported on developments
in many conspiracy theories. He also covered the investigation of Kennedy's
assassination by the United States House of Representatives Select Committee on
Assassinations and, to a lesser extent, the committee's investigation of the
assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>Political election campaigns are a minor subject in the collection. Presidential
campaign files include coverage for some of the primaries in 1972 and 1976. Files on
campaign spending concern the 1984 presidential race. Lardner's files include profiles
he wrote of presidential candidates Frank Church, Phil Gramm, Gary Hart, Dan Quayle,
Edward Moore Kennedy, Richard Lugar, and George C. Wallace.</p>
<p>Lardner wrote a series of articles on the Freedom of Information Act and followed the
subject for some time, developing related stories concerning presidential papers
administered by the National Archives and Records Administration. Other significant
files include those for Ruby Ridge and Oklahoma City that concern confrontations of
private citizens with federal law enforcement agencies. Ruby Ridge files cover a federal
siege and shoot-out at the Randy Weaver home near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. The Oklahoma City
files concern the bombing of a federal building in the city, with related material filed
under militias. Files on the Mafia are mostly related to alleged political ties and
corruption of unions.</p>
<p>Material in the <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>
series on the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild and Lardner's employment by the
Washington Post Company document aspects of the working life of journalists.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II of the Lardner papers span the years 1956-2005, with the majority concentrated
in the period between 1990 and 2001. In part, these papers supplement files in Part I
and pertain to some of Lardner’s earlier assignments in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s as a
reporter covering national news for the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph>.
The majority of Part II reflects later portions of Lardner’s career at the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph> not represented in Part I and documents his
assignments from the 1990s and early 2000s. The arrangement of the papers in Part II
mirror that of Part I and are organized into the following series: <ref target="SubjectFilePartII" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> and
<ref target="PartIIMiscellany">Miscellany</ref>. </p>
<p>Similar to the <ref target="sub">Subject File in Part I</ref>, the <ref target="SubjectFilePartII" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Subject File in Part
II</ref> reflects the manner in which Lardner acquired, received, and pursued
information and then developed his research into news stories. The series includes
Lardner's articles, correspondence, interviews, notes, and the research material he
collected as documentary evidence. Research material includes newspaper clippings,
reports, legal documents and trial records, government documents, some of which were
obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, congressional hearing records,
photographs, and printed matter. Lardner's subject terms and headings have been largely
retained and represent the way he thought about and categorized his research. The
organization of these papers reflect the high degree of interconnectedness often
apparent in current events and news stories, with people, locations, and subjects
appearing in various places across the collection.</p>
<p>Many of the earlier files in Part II complement those in Part I and provide continuation
of Lardner’s many investigations into intelligence agencies and policies, political
corruption, and political assassinations. Prominent investigations continued in Part II
include the Iran-Contra Affair, Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, improper influence to
gain military contracts by Wedtech, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, among other
topics. Political election campaigns in 1968, 1970, 1972, 1976, and 1984 also complement
Part I, especially the campaigns of George C. Wallace.</p>
<p>The majority of the Subject File reflects the stories Lardner followed in the later
portion of his career at the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph> in the 1990s
and early 2000s. These stories focus in large part on political figures and
controversies and extensively chronicle the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush
administrations. Lardner’s investigations into the Clinton administration are varied and
include allegations of Chinese influence and illegal fund raising tactics in the 1996
presidential election and improper access to personnel security-clearance documents in a
controversy referred to as “Filegate.” Many of the records pertaining to George W. Bush
reflect research into his life and activities before being elected president in 2000. A
significant portion of files chronicle Lardner’s research into the assassination of John
F. Kennedy for a thirtieth anniversary special television documentary titled <emph render="italic">Who Killed JFK: The Final Chapter?</emph>
</p>
<p>Documents related to domestic violence, stalking laws, and the murder of Lardner’s
daughter, Kristin, in 1992 are represented to a lesser extent, but mark an important
aspect of Part II of these papers. Notes, speech transcripts, and correspondence with
readers document Lardner’s work to expose the shortcomings of the criminal justice
system to protect victims of stalking and domestic violence and to advocate for passage
of the Violence Against Women Act. Research files include interview notes, statistics,
and printed matter.</p>
<p>The <ref target="PartIIMiscellany" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref>
series chronicles Lardner’s life apart from his investigative work and includes
correspondence with his wife, Rosemary, and children, correspondence related to his
involvement with the Fund for Investigative Journalism, and some writing projects.
General correspondence with colleagues from the <emph render="italic">Washington
Post</emph> and reader responses to some of Lardner's articles are contained in this
series, as is <title>

<p>The Joshua Coit Correspondence span the years 1792-1798 and consist of letters from Coit to his wife, Nancy, his oldest son, Robert, and to Charles Bulkeley. Almost all of the letters were written during the period of Coit's service in the United States House of Representatives, 1793-1798, as a Federalist representative from Connecticut. The letters are most numerous for the years 1794 and 1798. Many of the letters are accompanied by typed transcripts, and two exist in transcript only.</p>
<p>All but two of the letters are to Coit's wife and son. Letters to his wife describe his feelings on family, religion, and politics and the burdens caused by his absence. Included in his correspondence from 1794 are details of a dinner with President George Washington and levees for Martha Washington and Coit's views on the prospect of war with Great Britain. In 1798 he remarked on an altercation between fellow representatives Roger Griswold and Matthew Lyon. Following the XYZ Affair and as a result of his efforts to prevent war with France, Coit wrote in June 1798 that he felt he would not be reelected to Congress. Coit died of yellow fever a few months later. His letters to his son include fatherly instruction and advice and focus on the importance of good behavior and helping with household chores, schooling, and proper letter writing.</p>

<p>Transcripts of the records of the Archivo Nacional de Cuba span the
years 1770-1911, with the bulk of the material dating from 1770 to 1805. The
records are in Spanish and English and concern the Spanish colonial
administration of Louisiana and Florida. With the exception of a handwritten
“Index of correspondence,” the items are blueprint copies made sometime
before 1913 of typewritten transcripts of documents in the Cuban archive. The
transcripts may have resulted from the work of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. Its Department of Historical Research was dedicated to finding
documentary sources for the study of American history in foreign archives and
publishing a series of guides. The
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Guide to the Materials for American History in Cuban
Archives</part>
</title> by Luis Marino Perez was published in 1907. Records in the
present collection are described in the Perez book as document numbers 347,
375, and appendix A. A copy of this guide is in the Manuscript Division Reading
Room. </p>
<p>The
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Cédulas y órdenes</part>
</title> is a collection of Spanish government
orders and documents concerning trade and the administration of Louisiana and
Florida. The index of correspondence of the <emph render="italic">Capitanes-Generales </emph>of Cuba was copied in 1911 before
the records were sent from Cuba to Spain. It indexes
<title localtype="simple">
<part>legajos</part>
</title> 1-958, “correspondientes al Ramo de Guerra,”
and includes a brief description for each entry. </p>
<p>The file “Letters of Bernardo de Gálvez,” written by the Spanish
governor of Louisiana, consists of transcripts of his copybooks of
correspondence to the secretary of the Indies, José de Gálvez, and to the
<emph render="italic">capitanes-generales</emph> at Havana, the Marqués de la
Torre and Diego Josef Navarro. Some letters are abstracted while others appear
to be full transcripts. Many of the letters relate to military matters,
including the assistance given by the Spaniards to the American colonists in
revolt, the plans of the Americans to capture Pensacola (1777), and the
anticipated attack on New Orleans by the British (1778). </p>
<p>William Panton of Pensacola, founder of the firm of Panton, Leslie and
Company, was a Scottish trader who held the exclusive charter from Spain for
trade with Indians in West Florida. His file contains transcripts of various
items documenting the history of the concession, relations with the Indians,
and correspondence, primarily in English, of Panton and his agents. Panton and
other traders traveled among the Indian tribes of West Florida, and their
letters include personal observations and details related to their travels.

<p>The papers of William A. Benney (1885-1965) span the years 1909-1966,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1920 to 1931, and consist of notes,
correspondence, drawings, lists, payroll records, newspaper clippings, personal
papers, printed matter, and photographs documenting his employment by Thomas A.
Edison as a research superintendent. Scrapbooks, containing approximately four
hundred notes written between Benney, Thomas A. Edison, Charles A. Edison, as
well as others, document day-to-day laboratory activities especially during the
search for a natural rubber substitute carried out at Edison’s winter home in
Fort Myers, Florida. Included also in the scrapbooks are correspondence and
drawings of machinery and tools. The payroll records, signed by Benney,
document work conducted by carpenters and laborers on the Edison property in
Fort Myers. There are also equipment lists. Newspaper clippings largely pertain
to Thomas A. Edison, but also cover Benney’s personal life. Other items of a
personal nature include correspondence, invitations, Benney’s death
certificate, and a rental agreement for a store in Morris Township, New Jersey.
The printed matter consists mostly of memorabilia pertaining to Thomas A.
Edison. Photographs include portraits inscribed to Benney by Thomas A. Edison
and Charles A. Edison. The three photograph albums document the Edison estate
and laboratory in Fort Myers and the Benney family.</p>

<p>The papers of the Denby family span the years 1850-1911 and consist primarily of
correspondence and related matter exchanged among family members. The bulk of the
letters are between Charles Denby (1830-1904), a lawyer and minister to China, his wife
Martha Fitch Denby (“Mattie”), and their children Graham, Charles, Harriet (“Hattie” and
“Ethel”), Wythe, Edwin (“Ned”), and Thomas Garvin (“Garvin”). Charles Denby (1861-1938)
was also a diplomat in China, and Edwin Denby served as a member of the United States
Congress and as secretary of the navy. There are also letters from Martha’s mother,
Harriet Satterlee Fitch (“Moo”) and her father Graham Newell Fitch, a doctor who served
as United States senator from Indiana.</p>
<p> The major portion of the correspondence from the 1850s is between Charles Denby and
Martha Fitch during their two-year engagement. The letters document their long-distance
courtship. Charles was a young lawyer in Evansville, Indiana, struggling to make enough
money to marry Martha. She was from Logansport, Indiana, and spent part of the time in
Washington, D.C., while her father served in Congress.</p>
<p> During the Civil War Charles Denby wrote letters from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama
while serving as lieutenant colonel in the Forty-Second Indiana Volunteers. Those from
October 1862 describe the battle of Perryville, Kentucky, in which Denby was slightly
injured and his horse killed. In late 1862, Denby was appointed colonel of the Eightieth
Indiana Volunteers headquartered in Columbia, Kentucky. In addition to describing camp
life and home life during this period, correspondence between Charles and Martha Denby
indicates that she traveled to visit him while he was in camp in Huntsville, Alabama, as
well as at Columbia. An undated account relates to Martha’s stay in the deserted mansion
of Clement C. Clay in Huntsville, Alabama.</p>
<p> Correspondence from the mid 1860s through the 1870s records births, deaths, illnesses,
and other activities of the growing Denby family, local and national events, and Charles
Denby’s work as a lawyer. There are numerous letters from the Denbys’ son Charles
(1861-1938) describing his life at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University)
and from their daughter Harriet, who attended Hellmuth Ladies’ College in London,
Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p> The Denby family resided in China from 1885 until 1905, starting when the elder Charles
Denby was appointed minister to China. He held this post for thirteen years during which
time some of the children returned to the United States. Martha Denby made the long trip
between the United States and China several times to tend to family members. Son Charles
(1861-1938) spent the longest time in China, working in diplomatic service and in
business. Edwin Denby served in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service for seven years and
wrote letters from Macao, where he was stationed for part of this period. Letters from
China describe the official, social, and domestic lives of the diplomatic community in
Peking. The Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion are discussed in the
correspondence. Lengthy letters between family members separated by great distances
document efforts to the keep each other informed of events in their lives and indicate
the emotional and financial problems caused by the slowness and unreliability of the
mail.</p>
<p> The Spanish-American War is also treated in the correspondence. Son Edwin and
son-in-law Gilbert Wilkes served aboard the <emph render="italic">Yosemite</emph>
(auxiliary cruiser) in 1898. Charles Denby, Sr., spent time in Washington, D. C., as a
member of a commission appointed by the president to investigate the conduct of the War
Department during the war with Spain. In 1899 he traveled to the Philippines as a member
of the United States Philippine Commission. Martha Denby and son Thomas Garvin
accompanied him on that trip. A letter from Martha Denby contains a journal describing
their activities and the people she met.</p>
<p> Correspondence beginning in the 1890s documents the adult lives of the Denby children.
Wythe Denby became a mining engineer in Utah, Arizona, and Alaska. In letters to his
mother in 1904 and 1905, Edwin Denby gave accounts of his election to Congress and his
early days in Washington. Charles Denby (1861-1938) wrote in 1905 and 1906 describing
his work in the State Department. The last letters were written by Edwin Denby to his
sister during his honeymoon trip in Europe. The bulk of the correspondence ends with the
death of the parents, and subsequent periods of the careers of Edwin Denby and the
younger Charles Denby are not documented. </p>

<p>The records of the Frontier Nursing Service, Washington Committee,
span the years 1976 to 1994, with the bulk of the material dating from 1981 to
1994. Correspondence, minutes, membership rosters, invitations, and other
printed matter document the fund-raising activities of the Washington Committee
of the Frontier Nursing Service. Founded in 1925 by Mary Breckinridge as the
Kentucky Committee for Mothers and Babies, three years later the organization
became the Frontier Nursing Service. The mission of the organization is to

<p> The papers of the Porter family document the careers of naval
officers David Porter (1780-1843) and his son, David Dixon Porter (1813-1891).
The collection spans the years 1811-1881 and consists primarily of
correspondence and letterbooks. The material is organized as the papers of each
man and arranged alphabetically thereunder by type of material or name of
person. </p>
<p>Letters from David Porter to his friend Samuel Hambleton in 1811-1812
describe his command of the frigate <emph render="italic">Essex</emph> charged
with protecting Atlantic coast merchantmen. In a letter dated October 19, 1812,
Porter related to Hambleton that “In two or three days I sail on a long, a
<emph render="underline">very long</emph> cruize [sic], our destinations and
intended movements I am not at liberty to divulge, perhaps a more important
cruize was never undertaken by the vessels of any nation and I have the vanity
to believe that my plans for the ‘first campaign’ produced it.” Soon
thereafter in early 1813, Porter took the <emph render="italic">Essex</emph>
around Cape Horn to safeguard American whalers and in so doing commanded the
first United States naval vessel to sail into the Pacific Ocean. Letters to his
wife Evelina Anderson Porter relate details of his service as commander in
chief of the Mexican Navy in 1826-1829 and of domestic affairs while living in
Port Mahón on the Mediterranean island of Minorca in1830. Other recipients of
letters in the file include James P. McCorkle and George W. Walker. Also
included is a draft of Porter’s resignation as commander in chief of the
Mexican Navy and his will dictated in San Stefano, Turkey. </p>
<p>Official letterbooks of David Dixon Porter from the periods 1867-1869
and 1878-1881 comprise the bulk of the collection and contain copies of letters
to three secretaries of the navy, Richard W. Thompson, Nathan Goff, and William
H. Hunt. A letter from Porter while in New Orleans in 1862 to his wife George
Ann Porter recounted the bitterness of their southern relatives under Union
occupation of that city. Other items include printed naval general orders and
circulars.</p>

They include correspondence, particularly with Edward Howard House, poetry written by
Stedman and other poets, and miscellaneous items, including Stedman’s bookplate. The
correspondence pertains to Stedman’s family and personal matters, as well as poetry.
There is also limited correspondence with his wife, Laura Hyde Woolworth, and
granddaughter, Laura Stedman, dated after Stedman’s death.</p>

<p>The papers of William Bebb (1802-1873) span the years 1705-1849, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1812 to 1849. The papers consist of pages from a dismantled
autograph album containing approximately 140 letters and clipped signatures. Portions of
an appraisal containing a partial description of the album is available in the
Manuscript Reading Room. The album appears to have been started for Bebb by his father,
Edward Bebb, and Samuel Roberts (1800-1885), Welsh political reformer and founder of a
Welsh settlement in Tennessee. The first part of the collection contains letters and
signatures of British politicians, military figures, authors, and missionaries in India,
China, and Africa. Included are letters from John Bright (1811-1889), Thomas Babington
Macaulay, Francis Palgrave, Robert Peel (1788-1850), and Henry Richard (1812-1898). </p>
<p>The second part of the collection consists largely of letters from prominent Americans
addressed to or collected by William Bebb. Included among the collected items is a
letter from Thomas Jefferson in 1807 concerning the use of volunteer forces against
Native American attacks west of the Mississippi, a letter from Andrew Jackson concerning
a Creek uprising on the southern frontier in 1813, and a letter from William Henry
Harrison regarding his victory against combined British and Native American forces on
the banks of the Thames River in southeastern Ontario in 1813. Bebb also acquired
letters written by John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, Alexander J. Dallas, Charles
Hammond (1779-1840), William Hull (1753-1825), James Winchester (1752-1826), and Thomas
Worthington (1773-1827), among others. Bebb's own correspondence includes letters from
John Brough, Thomas Corwin, Thomas Ewing (1789-1871), Seabury Ford, Horace Greeley, John
McLean, Samuel Finley Vinton, James Whitcomb, and John C. Wright (1783-1861). Whig and
Ohio politics are discussed in many of these letters. </p>

<p>The papers of Thomas Tingey Craven (1873-1950), naval officer, span
the years 1842-1969, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period
1917-1945. Craven is noted as the director of naval aviation who ordered the
conversion of the coal-carrying ship <emph render="italic">Jupiter</emph> into
the <emph render="italic">Langley</emph>, the United States Navy's first
aircraft carrier. The collection is organized into family papers, general
correspondence, subject files, and writings. The family papers include
biographical and genealogical material, clippings, and correspondence. Of
special interest are a letter of 1842 written by Craven's grandfather and
namesake Thomas T. Craven, and a letter from Craven to his wife Antoinette
relating his experiences and impressions during the 1908 visit of the
battleship <emph render="italic">South Carolina</emph> to Japan.</p>
<p> Well represented in the Subject File are documents related to
Craven's World War I convoy duty in Atlantic and Mediterranean waters while
captain of the gunboat Sacramento from 1917 to 1918, his command of the United
States Naval Aviation Forces in Europe in 1918, and his command of a gunboat
flotilla on the Yangtze River in China from 1929 to 1931. Documents relating to
Craven's World War I service include convoy sailing orders, reports about naval
accidents and incidents, and correspondence and memoranda relating to United
States Naval Aviation Forces in Europe. Correspondents from the latter period
include Hutchinson I. Cone and Ralph Earle. As commander of the Yangtze Patrol
(1929-1931), Craven corresponded with diplomats, missionaries, military
colleagues, and Chinese officials. Correspondents from this period include
Morris Llewellyn Cooke, H. G. C. Hallock, Lieu Ven Tae (or Liu Wen-tau), M.
Yonai, Marshal Liu Hsiang, and Allen N. Cameron. Other topics include Craven's
service as defense counsel in the court-martial of Edward H. Watson, commander
of a destroyer squadron that shipwrecked at Point Pedernales (or Point Honda)
on the California coast in 1923, resulting in the loss of twenty-three men and
seven ships; and Craven's efforts in behalf of a protégé, Husband E. Kimmel,
who was under investigation after the 1942 Japanese attack on his Pacific Fleet
command at Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p> The General Correspondence includes letters discussing Craven's
service as chief coordinator of the Federal Coordinating Service during the
Herbert Hoover administration, curriculum reform at the United States Naval
Academy, the New York State Maritime Academy, the Merchant Marine, Alaska
fisheries, aircraft carriers, radio communications policy, corrupt practices in
naval shipyards, and other topics. Correspondents not already cited include
Richard E. Byrd, Josephus Daniels, Stanford C. Hooper, Herbert Hoover, Dudley
W. Knox, Frank Knox, David Sarnoff, and William S. Sims.</p>

<p>The papers of Richard Dale (1756-1826) span the years 1778 to 1918
with the bulk of the material dating from the 1770s to the 1820s. The papers
consist of correspondence, commissions, a mathematics notebook kept while Dale
was in Mill Prison, Plymouth, England, a journal/log of a voyage aboard a
merchant ship to Canton, China, and New Guinea, 1787-1789 (available on
microfilm), and a license and an appointment paper of two of Dale's
descendants. </p>
<p>Dale was born in 1756 near Norfolk, Virginia. He served with the
British Navy, 1776-1777, but joined the colonial cause in 1777. He served as
John Paul Jones's first lieutenant on the <emph render="italic">BonHomme
Richard</emph> in the battle with HMS <emph render="italic">Serapis</emph>. In
1801, Dale was sent to the Mediterranean to blockade Tripoli with a five-ship
fleet at the outbreak of the Tripolitan War. He died in Philadelphia in 1826.
One of the letterbooks contains copies of Dale's outgoing letters while in
command of the United States frigate <emph render="italic">President</emph> in
Tripoli, 1801-1802. Some of his correspondence during the Tripolitan War are in
the other letterbook (letters numbered 19, 24, 25, 33, 40, 42). This letterbook
includes letters written to Dale, many letters to Rear Admiral George Campbell
Read (1787-1862), Dale's son-in-law, and letters to several others. The letters
were placed in alphabetical order by name of correspondent, placed in a bound
volume with a number assigned to each letter. The letters are from various
naval officers and secretaries of the navy, including William Bainbridge, John
Paul Jones, and Secretaries of the Navy John P. Kennedy, Robert Smith, and
Benjamin Stoddert. Commissions and appointment papers are signed by John Adams,
Millard Fillmore, John Hancock, George Washington, and Daniel Webster.</p>

<p>The Field-Osgood Family Papers span the years 1702-1938, with the bulk of the material
dating from about 1780 to 1930. The papers pertain to three ancestral families of the
donor and are arranged in three sections: the Bradhurst family, the Field family, and
the Osgood family, with the Field and Osgood papers forming the bulk of the collection.
Many of the items were removed from deteriorating scrapbooks. With the exception of
occasional items of a general nature concerning the family, the material is arranged
alphabetically by individual family member. The papers include correspondence, financial
material, legal documents, genealogical material, speeches and writings, printed matter,
photographs, lithographs, and engravings.</p>
<p> Because so many individuals are represented in this collection, the topics touched upon
are disparate and numerous. Of major importance are the papers of Samuel Osgood
(1748-1813), member of the Continental Congress, one of the three members of the United
States Board of Treasury (1785-1789), first postmaster general, and naval officer of the
port of New York. A small amount of correspondence, writings, and Board of Treasury and
port of New York documents are in the collection. Most of the Samuel Osgood material,
however, relates to household financial matters. Additional household financial matter
is found under his wife's name, Maria Bowne Franklin Osgood, including items concerning
her financial obligations to Chloe Field, an African American woman. Also in the
collection are four sermons of David Osgood (1747-1822), three printed and one
holograph. One printed sermon of Joseph Lathrop (1731-1820) can be found in the folder
for Thaddeus Osgood. </p>
<p>Samuel Osgood's daughter, Susan Kittridge Osgood Field, maintained a lively
correspondence with her sisters, Martha Brandon Osgood, married and living near Troy,
New York, and Juliana Osgood, married and living in or near Andover, Massachusetts. She
also corresponded with Mary (a cousin?) living in Charleston, South Carolina. Nearly all
of the letters date from 1814 to 1821, the year she married Moses Field. The letters
from her sisters are full of descriptions and details of the everyday life of these
young women. Susan Osgood Field's correspondence is filed with the Field family
material. </p>
<p>Three items in the Field family papers merit notice: two eighteenth century manumission
documents from New York state and a letter of 1845 from Robert Browning to Hickson
Woolman Field. Also in the Field family papers are a collection of materials from the
United States Signal Corps on aerial photography dating from 1917 to 1918 and a group of
intelligence reports (circa 1918-1919) from the Military Intelligence Division of the
War Department. Both groups of papers relate to William B. Osgood Field. </p>

<p>The papers of the George Montfort Gilchrist family span the years
1854-1921 and consist of correspondence, school records, literary and
commencement programs, poetry, and genealogical records. Much of the
correspondence is between Gilchrist, a captain in the Third Indiana Cavalry,
and his wife, Mollie Gilpin Gilchrist. Gilchrist's wartime letters describe
routine camp life, troop movements, and skirmishes with Confederate forces in
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Other Civil War letters are between
Mollie and Samuel J. V. B. Gilpin of the First Indiana Cavalry and Ebenezer N.
Gilpin of the Third Iowa Cavalry. In addition, there is considerable
correspondence with other members of the Gilchrist and Gilpin families. The
school records, literary programs, and commencement programs pertain to Hanover
College, Hanover, Indiana. The genealogical records are of the Gilpin family of
Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana.</p>

<p>The papers of Samuel Holten (1738-1816) span the years 1630-1843, with
the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1744-1843. The collection
consists of correspondence, account books, and bills and receipts. The
correspondence relates chiefly to Holten's service in the Massachusetts
Provincial General Court, Massachusetts Governor's Council, Continental
Congress, and United States House of Representatives. Other papers relate to
his medical practice and to his life and work in Danvers, Massachusetts.
Correspondents include Samuel Adams, James Bowdoin, William Cushing, Nathan
Dane, Elbridge Gerry, William Gordon, Nathaniel Gorham, John Hancock, Israel
Hutchinson, John Lowell, George Partridge, James Sullivan, and Thomas
Wallcut.</p>
<p> The addition to the papers of Samuel Holten spans the years 1783-1785

<p>The papers of Robert Patterson Hughes (1839-1909) span the years
1876-1994, with the bulk of the material dating from 1898 to 1909. The
collection consists of diaries, correspondence, photographs, writings, a
printed memorial, and biographical material documenting aspects of Hughes's
military career from his enlistment as a private in the 12th Pennsylvania
Infantry in 1861 to his retirement as major general in 1903. </p>
<p>The bulk of the papers pertains to Hughes's service in the Philippines
between 1898 and 1901. A series of six diaries kept between July 1898 and
December 1899 chronicles Hughes's activities as inspector general of the
Expeditionary Force from May 17 to August 1898, inspector general and provost
marshal general of Manila from August 1898 to May 1899, and as commander of the
Department of the Visayas after May 1899. A typed transcript is available for
the first two volumes covering the period July to October 1898. </p>
<p>The papers also include a detailed account, accompanied by a
hand-drawn map, of the Battle of Little Bighorn, written by Hughes to his wife
on 30 June 1876. Hughes, then aide-de-camp to Alfred Howe Terry, arrived at the
site of the battle on June 27th. His correspondence includes an 1893 letter

<p>The papers of the Simons family, an African-American family centered
in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., span the years 1887-1982, with the bulk
of the material concentrated in the period 1918-1945. Roughly half the
collection consists of the papers of
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="will">William H.
Simons</ref>. His career included service as international secretary with the
Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) International Committee in East
Africa, India, and Burma and as a Baptist missionary teacher serving in
Nigeria. The rest of the papers constitute a series titled
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="other">Other Family
Members</ref> and consist mainly of correspondence by members of the related
Simons, Garrett, and Nicholson families. </p>
<p>William H. Simons's service with the Young Men's Christian Association
in German East Africa (Tanganyika) and British East Africa (Kenya) during World
War I and his continued service with the YMCA after the war in India and Burma
are documented in diaries, notes, and correspondence. In a 1918 diary, Simons
describes his wartime voyage to East Africa with fellow YMCA officials, a Red
Cross unit, missionaries, soldiers, refugees, and miners. He had the
opportunity to experience and observe racial and social conditions in South
Africa when the ship docked for a month at Durban. Friendships and
correspondence with A. Neely, director of the Seaman's Institute and Rest
(Durban), and Benjamin Skeets, American merchant seaman, radio operator, and
passionate atheist, resulted from this South African sojourn. </p>
<p>According to the 1918 diary, when Simons reached Dar es Salaam, German
East Africa, he was assigned to Railroad Institute schools near Dar es Salaam
and Nairobi, British East Africa (Kenya). The Railroad Institute, a wartime
training organization financed by the African Railroad and administered by the
YMCA, trained Africans in railroading skills, such as telegraphy, to further
the British campaign against the Germans in East Africa. One of the students
with whom Simons carried on a correspondence over many years was Seth Nakiafu,
who became a prominent educator in his native Uganda. </p>
<p>Simons's papers include a photocopy of a 1919 diary, loose diary pages
covering January 1920, and a bound journal for 1922, periods when he was
working as a YMCA international secretary at British and Indian army facilities
in India and Burma. These diaries emphasize his travels and his impressions of
Hindu and Buddhist religious practices, and they document his YMCA work.
Correspondents from this period and from his stint as headmaster of the
American Baptist Mission School in Myingyam, Burma, 1922-1924, include Mary
Hall Cowdrey, Ruth Cowdrey, W. B. Hilton, H. E. Hinton, George R. Hovey, B. S.
Mani, and Julia Rattanchand. </p>
<p>The bulk of the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="will">William H. Simons
</ref>series consists of correspondence with colleagues, family members, and
friends from his travels and his student days at Benedict College in Columbia,
South Carolina, Virginia Union College in Richmond, Virginia, and Gordon
College in Wenham, Massachusetts. Simons and the Nigerian Baptist clergyman
Nathaniel D. Oyerinde were students together at Virginia Union College before
World War I and colleagues during the 1930s at the Baptist College and
Seminary, Ogbomosho, Nigeria, where Simons was a teacher and librarian and
Oyerinde served as principal. Simons also conducted a lengthy correspondence
with Kate E. Gale, a member of the Virginia Union faculty. </p>
<p>Gordon College classmates with whom Simons corresponded include Simeon
Bankole-Wright and Esther R. Beer. Correspondence generated during his years at
the Baptist College and Seminary at Ogbomosho, Nigeria, include letters from
student A. B. Batubo and from Elizabeth R. Frost, a Baptist missionary in the
Belgian Congo. </p>
<p>Most of Simon's letters in these papers were written to family
members, including his parents, Isom W. and Minnie Simons, brother Alfred E.
Simons, sister Ethel Simons Meeds, and his niece Anna Josephine Simons Wade.
</p>
<p>Simons's correspondence with Herbert W. Bryant, A. F. Ford, L. R.
Lines, and R. Baille Young and other material specifically related to his
service with the YMCA is in the Young Men's Christian Association file. A file
on the Young Women's Christian Association is mostly printed matter on YWCA
activities in India compiled by Ruth Cowdrey. </p>
<p>The Simons and Garrett families of Columbia, South Carolina, were
united in the 1917 marriage of Alfred E. Simons, younger brother of William H.
Simons, and Mattie Phyllis Garrett, daughter of educator and journalist Caspar
G. Garrett. One of the eight children resulting from this marriage was Ruth
Simons Nicholson, a historian and archivist at the Library of Congress. Most of
the Other Family Members series consists of the family correspondence among
members of the Simons and Garrett families. </p>
<p>Much of the family correspondence in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="other">Other Family
Members</ref> series focuses on the military service of sons of Alfred and
Minnie Simons during and immediately after World War II. Correspondents include
Alfred E. Simons, Jr., who organized the swing/jazz band of the 357th Engineers
Regiment and led it overseas in North Africa and Italy. He later became a
prominent educational psychologist. William H. Simons (born 1924), wrote many
letters home during his army service in the northern European theater. A file
in the Miscellany of the Other Family Members series relates to his activities
as an organizer and president of the Washington, D.C., Teachers Union. </p>
<p>Also of interest are letters of photographer Joseph O. Curtis (not a
family member), who served as a junior officer in a quartermaster unit in
England, France, and Belgium during World War II. The correspondence of Alfred
E. Simons, Jr., William H. Simons, Joseph O. Curtis, and others documents the
response of African-American soldiers to a segregated army. </p>
<p>Naomi Mills Garrett maintained a voluminous correspondence with her
mother, Anna Mariah Garrett, wife of journalist Caspar G. Garrett; her sister,
Mattie Garrett Simons; and her nieces, Ruth Simons Nicholson and Anna Josephine
Simons Wade. She wrote about her experiences as a teacher in rural South
Carolina during a period spanning World War I through the 1930s, in Haiti
during World War II, and as a professor of romance languages at West Virginia
State College, Institute, West Virginia, from the 1940s through the 1960s. </p>
<p>Though Alfred and Mattie Simons moved to Washington, D.C., shortly
after their marriage in 1917, they maintained ties with their native state
through correspondence and participation in the South Carolina Club. Files
comprising the correspondence and minutes of the club can be found in the
Miscellany of the Other Family Members series.</p>

</title>, a Whig newspaper in South
Bend, Indiana; his involvement in Whig and Republican party politics; and his
tenure as United States representative from Indiana and vice president under
Ulysses S. Grant (1822-1885). </p>
<p>The correspondence file dates from 1837 to 1882 and includes letters
to and from Colfax. A large part of the correspondence consists of letters
written by Colfax to Alfred Wheeler who assumed editorship of the
<title localtype="simple">
<part>St. Joseph Valley Register</part>
</title> when Colfax was elected to
Congress in 1855. Colfax’s letters discuss the running of his newspaper,
events in Washington, D.C., and national and state politics. Other
correspondents include Henry B. Anthony, Jay Cooke (1821-1905), Roscoe Conkling
(1829-1888), and Henry L. Dawes. The correspondence is arranged
chronologically. </p>
<p>The speech file contains drafts of speeches and lectures given by
Colfax, largely from 1873 to 1882, when he had retired from politics and was
touring the country giving public lectures. The speeches and lectures are
arranged alphabetically by title or topic. Several folders contain compilations
of partial drafts, reflecting Colfax’s practice of reusing portions of
earlier speeches. A facsimile letter from Colfax to John Sherman (1823-1900)
concerning Sherman’s brother William T. Sherman was added as an addition to
the collection in 1982.</p>

naval aide during the early part of World War II, span the years 1898-1984,
with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1914-1966. The
collection is organized into general correspondence, speeches and writings, and
subject files. The general correspondence is arranged chronologically and spans
most of McCrea's naval career (1914-1953), a second career as an insurance
executive (1953-1966), and his postretirement through 1984. McCrea served from
1915 to 1919 aboard the battleship <emph render="italic">New York</emph>,
flagship of Adm. Hugh Rodman's Division Nine, a force of United States warships
cooperating with the British Grand Fleet in European waters during World War I.
Correspondence from this period relates to relations between the United States
and the British navies and to the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet in
1918. McCrea also served under Rodman as an aide (1919-1921) during the
admiral's command of the United States fleet in the Pacific. McCrea and Rodman
maintained a correspondence well into the 1930s. From 1929 to 1931, McCrea was
aide and flag secretary to E. H. Campbell and Arthur St. Clair Smith,
successive commanders of a special service squadron operating in Central
American waters. Correspondence from this period is a rich source on military,
political, and social conditions in Nicaragua and Panama.</p>
<p> McCrea's service with the Naval Government of Guam (1936-1937), as
executive officer of the naval station on the island and as aide for civil
administration, generated correspondence with governor B. V. McCandlish and
others about social, military, and political conditions on Guam. During the
period 1941-1943, McCrea served as aide to chief of naval operations Harold R.
Stark, as naval secretary at the first meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff,
and as naval aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. From 13 December 1940 to
31 January 1941, while working for Stark, McCrea traveled to the Philippines to
appraise the battle readiness of the United States Asiatic Fleet and the
fitness of its commander, Thomas C. Hart. Included in the correspondence for
the period 1941-1943 are memoranda from Roosevelt and correspondence with
several White House staffers, especially William D. Hassett, personal secretary
to Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman.</p>
<p> Prominent in the general correspondence are many letters from
McCrea's duty aboard a variety of naval vessels, including billets as navigator
of the cruiser <emph render="italic">Astoria</emph> (1934-1936), executive
officer of the fuel oil tanker <emph render="italic">Ramapo</emph> (1922) and
the battleship<emph render="italic"> Pennsylvania</emph> (1938-1940), and
commander of the mine sweeper <emph render="italic">Bittern</emph> (1924-1926)
and the battleship <emph render="italic">Iowa</emph> (1943-1944). McCrea
maintained correspondence with former shipmates, commissioned and enlisted,
over long periods of time. Prominent in this group were Allan E. Smith and
Lynne C. Quiggle. Other areas of McCrea's naval career well documented in the
general correspondence include his command of Cruiser Division One against
Japanese installations in the Aleutian and Kurile islands during 1944-1945 and
his postwar service as deputy chief of naval operations, deputy commander of
the United States Pacific Fleet, director of staff for the Personnel Policy
Board, and commander of the First Naval District. Prominent correspondents not
previously cited include Russell S. Berkey, William H. P. Blandy, Richard L.
Conolly, Louis E. Denfeld, Robert L. Dennison, W. M. Fechteler, Thomas C. Hart,
Walter A. Hicks, Jonas H. Ingram, Chester W. Nimitz, Earle T. Oakes, Herbert
Lamont Pugh, and Kemp Tolley.</p>
<p> The subject file contains topical files that dovetail with subjects
covered in the general correspondence, such as Nicaragua and Guam. Of interest
are files related to McCrea's service as a presidential naval aide, the
battleship <emph render="italic">Iowa</emph>, and Anna M. Rosenberg, who was
assistant secretary of defense for manpower during the Korean War. Of interest
in the speeches and writings file is McCrea's account of his midshipman days,
which included a memorable 1914 summer cruise to the Mediterranean aboard the
battleship <emph render="italic">Idaho</emph>. This experience afforded McCrea
the opportunity to witness the French mobilization for World War I. Also
included are a diary covering McCrea's stint as naval aide to Franklin D.
Roosevelt, an account of the establishment of the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Maryland, and McCrea's history of the<emph render="italic">
Iowa</emph>.</p>

<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
Correspondence
</ref> consists of letters to and from Edwin
Markham, Florence Hamilton, and others. A majority of the letters, however, are
written by Markham to Hamilton and concern his lecture tours, stays with
Charles R. Walgreen, his health, the poetry of others, and his thanks to
Hamilton for her assistance. The correspondence reveals a relationship between
the two with some of Markham's letters to Hamilton addressed as "Dear Child"
and simply signed as either "A" or "Aprile."</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="poet">
Poetry
</ref>
series contains poems by Markham and includes his most famous work, "The Man
with the Hoe," as well as "Lincoln, the Man of the People," "Ode to Lincoln,"
"Ballad of the Gallows Bird," and "Our Israfel." His notebooks of poems span
the length of his career. Of interest also is the guestbook in which Markham
wrote poems when staying at Hamilton's home in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts,
a place he referred to as "The House with the Smiling Face." </p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="spee">
Speeches and
Writings
</ref> file includes articles, speeches, a radio script, and a motion
picture script. Many of Markham's works cover social and religious issues as
well as poetry. Markham also wrote about individuals including the American
realist author and literary critic William Dean Howells.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="bio">
Unpublished
Biography
</ref> series consists largely of Hamilton's typescript of " The Man
with the Hoe, the Poem, the Poet, and the Problem: The Intellectual Biography
of Edwin Markham" that was to have been published in 1936. Included also are
biographical sketches of Markham, letters authorizing Hamilton to write his
biography, drafts of the work, and a photograph of Markham and Hamilton.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">
Scrapbooks
</ref>
series includes clippings, photographs, programs, correspondence, and poems
covering the personal lives and writings of Markham and Hamilton. Volumes 3 and
10 pertain mostly to Hamilton and document her poetry, her relationship to
Markham, and her life as a poet in New York. Volume 8 contains a copy of
Markham's will, while Volume 7 is filled with his obituary notices from 1940.
Many of Markham's poems in the scrapbooks have been inscribed to Hamilton.</p>
<p>Other photographs are located in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="photo">

horoscopes written for him.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">
Miscellany
</ref>
is largely comprised of books inscribed by Markham to Hamilton or annotated by
him. Eleven volumes were authored by Markham's friend, Thomas Lake Harris, and
others were written or edited by Markham. Of interest among Markham's personal
documents is a copyright certificate from the Library of Congress dated 1900
for the poem "Lincoln, the Great Commoner." The printed matter consists of
annotated articles, clippings, programs, and prose and poems about and by
Markham, many of which seemed to have been collected by Hamilton for her
biography of him.</p>

<p>The papers of Arnold Moss (1910-1989) span the years 1935-1987 with
the bulk of the material covering the period 1953-1987. Although Moss's acting
career included roles in film and on radio and television, with related work as
a narrator and an announcer, the main focus of his work was on the stage.
Likewise, the main focus of the Moss Papers is on his roles in the theater as
an actor, director, producer, and educator. Moss gained particular acclaim for
his performances in the plays of William Shakespeare. This collection of his
papers consists of three series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">General
Correspondence</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Thea">Theater
File</ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject
File</ref>.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">General
Correspondence</ref> series, 1954-1987, documents Moss's interests and
activities primarily as they relate to his career. The major portion consists
of letters received from friends and professional colleagues, although copies
of letters sent are also included. Topics include efforts to gain employment as
an actor, his work at colleges and universities, and his affiliation with
professional organizations. Prominent correspondents include Philip Burton,
Bernard Malamud, Arthur Miller, and Harold Prince.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Thea">Theater
File</ref>, 1953-1987, comprises the largest portion of the papers and reflects
the range of Moss's stage work. There are lengthy files on George Bernard
Shaw's play,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Back to Methuselah</part>
</title>, which Moss adapted into a shorter
version and coproduced with the Theatre Guild for a tour and Broadway run in
1957-1958. Moss also acted in the production, playing Shaw. The following year
Moss founded and starred in a touring repertory company called the Shakespeare
Festival Players. Records relating to the company include contracts, an
itinerary, financial files, and press clippings. Also documented in the file is
Moss's position as an American specialist in theater for the United States
Department of State. He toured countries in Central and South America and later
in Africa and the Far East giving performances and lectures. Files on concert
readings relate to the one-man programs of dramatic readings such as "A Goodly
Heritage," "The Seven Ages of Man," and "Windows on America" that Moss
performed at colleges and universities and at civic and cultural organizations
from the 1950s into the 1980s. For twenty years, Moss performed annually at the
Library of Congress as part of the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Poetry and
Literature Series, and the related files contain correspondence, scripts,
programs, and production notes. Most scripts are filed in a separate scripts
section because Moss used the scripts for more than one production. The scripts
are annotated, and many contain lighting and sound cues and stage diagrams.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject
File</ref>, 1935-1987, contains material relating to Moss's other activities,
his organizational affiliations, and his academic studies. Files on film, sound
recordings, and television containing information in these areas are limited,
and these aspects of his career are not well documented in the collection.</p>
<p> In addition to his work in the performing arts, Moss created
crossword puzzles appearing in the
<title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Times Magazine</part>
</title> and other publications. The
crossword puzzle files contain correspondence with the
<title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Times </part>
</title>puzzle editors and drafts of the puzzles.
Speeches and writings files contain drafts of published and unpublished
articles and speeches primarily relating to the theater. The file on New York
University contains material on the doctoral degree which Moss started in the
1930s and completed in the 1970s with a dissertation on professional actors as
guest artists in college and university theatrical productions.</p>

<p> The Oral History Collection spans the years 1959 to 1979 and consists of nineteen
volumes containing transcripts of approximately eighty interviews conducted by the
Bancroft Library Regional Oral History Office at the University of California at
Berkeley. The transcripts are accompanied by introductions, tables of content, indexes,
and supplementary material including photographs and copies of correspondence, reports,
and clippings. The interviews are arranged alphabetically by name of the oral history
project.</p>
<p> The bulk of the interviews relate to California state government and politics. They
include twenty-seven interviews from the Earl Warren Oral History Project concerning
health insurance, labor, forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during
World War II, Warren's early years in Bakersfield, and his relations as governor with
the public, press, and state legislature. An extensive interview with Merrell Farnham
Small, administrative secretary in the governor's office from 1945 to 1953, is also
included. Other oral history projects pertaining to California are the Governmental
History Documentation Project which is represented in this collection by an interview
with Roger Kent, vice chairman and chairman of the California Democratic State Central
Committee from 1954 to 1965, and an oral history project documenting the career of
Walter Gordon, lawyer, civil rights leader, governor of the Virgin Islands, and chairman
of the California Adult Authority, a state agency responsible for setting terms and
granting paroles for adult prison inmates. </p>
<p>The collection also contains thirteen interviews from the Suffragists Oral History
Project. Included are interviews with Helen Valeska Bary, Sara Bard Field, Burnita
Shelton Matthews, Alice Paul, Jeannette Rankin, Rebecca Hourwich Reyher, and Mabel
Vernon, among others. The interviews explore their subject's early formative years and
their subsequent efforts on behalf of woman's suffrage, welfare and labor reform, world
peace, and passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. An interview with Caroline Service,
wife of diplomat John S. Service, forms part of the China Series. Her interview covers
her years in China from 1933 to 1940 as the wife of a foreign service officer and her
husband's arrest in 1945 for allegedly passing secret documents to <title localtype="simple">
<part>Amerasia</part>
</title> magazine, his testimony before the Loyalty Review Board in 1951, and his
subsequent firing by the State Department. </p>

<p>The papers of Donald Theodore Giles (1898-1983) span the years
1926-1982, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the years 1941-1945.
Correspondence, notebooks, photographs, and printed matter chiefly reflect the
years Giles spent as a prisoner of war during World War II. Giles, then a
commander in the United States Navy, arrived on Guam on 7 May 1941 to become
the vice governor of the island and the executive officer of the naval station.
When Guam fell to the Japanese on 10 December 1941, Giles, along with other
military personnel and some civilians, was taken prisoner. In January 1942, the
Japanese transported Giles and the others to the prisoner-of-war camp at
Zentsuji on the island of Shikoku and incarcerated them along with British,
Australian, and Dutch military personnel. The Americans were moved in 1945 to a
prison camp at Roku Roshi on the island of Honshu, where Giles was liberated in
September.</p>
<p> The notebooks contain the names, addresses, and autobiographies of
United States and Allied military personnel and civilians who were imprisoned
at the camp at Zentsuji, as well as a roster of personnel on Guam. Giles used
one of the notebooks to record the letters he received from his mother, and his
wife Virginia Basil Giles. Other correspondence from his wife and son, Donald
T. Giles, Jr., during this period appears in the correspondence file as well.
Photographs show the prisoners at the Zentsuji camp, United States Marine Corps
troops in combat on Guam, and Guam after World War II. Other items of note are
the magazines bound by Giles while in the camp, photocopies made of sketches
depicting life in Japanese prison camps, and a letter in the general
correspondence dated 18 September 1945 concerning George Scharff, a German
national who reportedly raised a swastika over his house on Guam when the
Japanese invaded the island.</p>
<p> After returning to the United States, Giles resumed his military
career and became concerned with legislation dealing with prisoners of war. The
legislation file includes excerpts from the testimonies of prisoners of war
about their mental and physical health two years after their release from
Japanese prison camps and Giles's testimony for the War Crimes Office in 1946.
He retired from the military in 1953. Sometime later Giles produced a
manuscript about his experiences at the camp at Zentsuji entitled "The
Reluctant Guest." In 1994, Donald T. Giles, Jr., edited his father's manuscript
and published it under the title

<p>The papers of the Hulsizer family span the years 1915-1941, with the
bulk of the items concentrated in the period between 1917 and 1919. The
collection consists primarily of letters from Edith Hulsizer Copher and her
sister, Sophy Hulsizer Powell, to family members during World War I. Copher
described her work at the Harvard U.S. Army Base Hospital No. 5, British
Expeditionary Force, near Paris, France, and commented on local social life and
customs. Powell's letters were written chiefly in 1919 when she lived in
London, England, as the wife of American commercial attaché, Fred Wilbur
Powell, and reflect the social life of the expatriate community in London. The
collection also includes newspaper clippings pertaining to the Hulsizer
family.</p>

the commission was charged to report on the care, maintenance, sanitation,
operation, and governance of the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone, including
matters relating to the Panama Railroad and Panama Railroad Steamship Company.

<p>The papers of Hanson Weightman Baldwin (1903-1991) date from 1920 to
1978 and most prominently document his student years at the United States Naval
Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, along with his subsequent tour of active duty in
the navy, his early years as a general assignment newspaper reporter, and his
participation as an active member of both the United States Naval Academy
Alumni Association and the Naval War College, Washington, D.C. The papers are

</ref> while the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="MISC">

<p> Following his graduation from the Naval Academy, Baldwin served as an
officer aboard the battleship <emph render="italic">Texas</emph> and the
destroyer <emph render="italic">Breck</emph>. In 1928 he began his career as a
newspaper reporter after having resigned from active naval duty the previous
year. Baldwin's letters to his parents in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="CORR">
Correspondence

</ref>series provide information on his life as a young naval officer and also
on his early years as a general assignment reporter, first with the Baltimore
<emph render="italic">
<emph render="italic">Sun</emph>
</emph> in 1928 and a year later with the New York
<emph render="italic">
<emph render="italic">Times</emph>
</emph>, the paper with which he would be
associated for the remainder of his career. Although the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="CORR">

</ref>also contains letters to and from friends and former shipmates which
further document this period of Baldwin's life, there are few letters in the
series which illuminate his newspaper career after his appointment in 1937 by
the <emph render="italic">
<emph render="italic">Times</emph>
</emph> as the first full-time military
correspondent, and later military editor, on an American newspaper.</p>
<p> Baldwin's service as a commissioned officer in the navy, both on
active duty and in the Naval Reserve, is also documented in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="SUBJ">
Subject
File.
</ref> Records in this file concerning his resignation in 1933 give
evidence to the conflict which arose between Baldwin's position as a Naval
Academy graduate and naval officer, whose code required conduct loyal to the
service, and his role as a newspaper reporter, whose commitment to objective
and unprejudiced reporting demanded freedom of expression, when an article
written by Baldwin contained information that was deemed sensitive by naval
authorities. Explaining his position in a memorandum to the Chief of the Bureau
of Navigation dated 1 March 1933, Baldwin wrote, "Loyalty cannot be interpreted
from my viewpoint as preventing me the free and unabridged statement of fact or
expression of opinion."</p>
<p> The

<p> The papers of Anna Maria Roberts Evans (circa 1828-circa 1905) span the
years 1835-1914, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period between
1855 and 1895. The collection consists principally of correspondence relating
to the Society of Friends (Quakers). Anna Maria Evans, the primary individual
in the collection and an active member of the Society of Friends, lived near
Rochester, New Hampshire, where she and her husband, Thomas H. Evans, owned an
apple orchard. Most of the letters were written by her female relatives and
friends living in New England. The letters discuss details of everyday life,
faith and religious activities, and to some extent touch upon Quaker
involvement in the abolition of slavery, women's rights, religious tolerance,
and temperance during the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p> The letters of Roanna Fox Bean, a close friend of Evans, span a
fifty-year period from their student days in the 1850s at the Friends' Boarding
School in Providence, Rhode Island, to Bean's death in 1905. Bean and her
husband James, an Indian agent and real estate developer, lived at various
times in Iowa, Minnesota, and California. Her letters include accounts of life
in these locales. Other letters were from women who were Quaker missionaries or
wives of Quaker officials both in the United States and overseas, including
Gertrude W. Cartland, M. H. Morrell, and Susan T. Thompson. Education figures
prominently throughout the collection, especially in the letters of Elizabeth
V. Roberts, an early graduate of the State Normal School in Moorhead,
Minnesota. The subject of mental illness is mentioned periodically in letters
from various members of the family.</p>
<p> The death of the Evanses' young son Winslow in 1881 while at boarding
school is recorded in a file under his name. Their daughter Flora Anna, who
worked in and around Boston, was active in the revival movement of the late
nineteenth century and wrote frequently of her involvement in religious
organizations and attendance at revivals, particularly those of Dwight L. Moody
and Sam Jones. </p>
<p>The Civil War is also an important subject in the collection. Although
pacifists, thousands of Quaker men of draft age were conscripted during the
war. Most served despite their moral opposition, though some chose flight to
Canada. Letters in the collection recount such decisions, along with reports of
suffering and loss of life caused by the war and the prayers of those at home
for the safe return of their loved ones. Other letters chronicle war relief
efforts, especially among African American refugees fleeing the South, and
contain favorable references to President Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p> The pursuit of arable land in conjunction with the nation's westward
expansion is documented in numerous letters. In addition to offering religious
instruction, many of these Quaker settlements promoted advancements in
education, farming methods, and social reform for the benefit of believer and
non-believer alike. A miscellany file contains a Roberts family genealogy and
material relating to Evans's education. There is also a file of printed matter
consisting of advertisements, handbills, inserts, programs, receipts, and
religious tracts. Among the oversize items are religious printed matter and
broadsides advertising dry goods and furniture.</p>

<p> The papers of Dan Golenpaul (1901-1974) span the years 1934-1981,
with the bulk of material dated 1934-1977. The collection includes
correspondence, writings, scripts, contracts, clippings, and guest lists
relating particularly to the "Information Please" program produced by Golenpaul
on radio and television and to his subsequent publication,

as Hubert H. Humphrey, Edward M. Kennedy, and Edmund S. Muskie. Golenpaul
solicited essays for the almanac from international political figures and
social commentators, including Léon Blum, Gunnar Myrdal, and George Bernard
Shaw, along with Americans such as Bernard Baruch, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Earl

<p>The papers of William Vans Murray (1760-1803) span the period from
1784 to 1805 with the majority of the materials falling between the years 1797
and 1801. Diaries, official documents, and correspondence, principally of an
official nature, comprise the collection. </p>
<p>Murray had a short but relatively distinguished career as a diplomat.
In 1797, after serving three terms representing Maryland in the United States
House of Representatives, he was appointed by George Washington as minister to
the new Republic of Batavia (Netherlands). In 1800, John Adams temporarily
assigned him to a special diplomatic team including Oliver Ellsworth and
William Richardson Davie to settle the undeclared war between the French
Republic and the United States. The negotiations took place in Paris between
June and September 1800 and produced a convention which was largely a result of
Murray's diplomatic skills. Included in the collection are Murray's notes on
the progress of these negotiations and an official copy of the convention
signed on September 30, 1800. </p>
<p>The four volumes of Murray's
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diar">
diaries
</ref>
include his notes during the period of his diplomatic assignment from 1797 to
1801 and notations made in the latter part of 1801 after his return to the
United States and throughout 1802. Besides the comments on the 1800
negotiations noted above, Murray describes a fete given by Joseph Bonaparte at
his chateau, Môrtefontaine, to celebrate the successful conclusion of the
talks. The majority of the notations deal with aspects of Murray's diplomatic
activity at The Hague and Paris. </p>
<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
Correspondence
</ref> also deals with matters of an official
nature and includes letters with individuals such as Timothy Pickering, Oliver
Ellsworth, Fulwar Shipwith, Francis Lewis Taney, Rufus King, and Charles
Cotesworth Pinckney. For use in confidential official correspondence, Murray
devised an encode sheet, a fragment of which is included in the collection.
There is a sizeable number of letters using this code. Other correspondence
includes letters from Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, Marquis de
Lafayette, and Joseph Bonaparte. </p>
<p>

<p>The papers of William G. Niederland (1904-1993) span the years
1810-1982, with the bulk of the material dating from 1952 to 1982. The
collection documents Niederland's work in the field of psychoanalysis as an
author, educator, and clinician. The papers consist of correspondence, patient
files, drafts of writings and lectures, research files, and material from
professional organizations. They are organized in five series:

</p>
<p>Niederland, a native of Germany, practiced medicine in Europe for ten
years before immigrating to the United States in 1940. He was born in 1904 in
Schippenbeil, East Prussia, the son of an orthodox rabbi. After receiving a
medical degree from the University of Würzburg in 1929, Niederland worked for
several years in Berlin, Düsseldorf, and Gailingen. In 1934, he fled Nazi
Germany and established a private psychiatric practice in Milan. With the
signing of the Italian-German military alliance in 1939, Niederland once again
fled fascism. After a brief stay in a refugee camp in England, he secured a
position as a doctor and surgeon on a British merchant ship. In December 1940,
American officials permitted him to enter the United States.</p>
<p> Between 1947 and 1953, Niederland underwent formal psychoanalytic
training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. For over thirty years, he
maintained private practices in New York and New Jersey and held professional
positions at Mount Sinai Hospital, Altro Health and Rehabilitation Services,
and Haversack General Hospital. He taught for twenty years at the Downstate
Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. Niederland served as coeditor of
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Psychoanalytic Quarterly</part>
</title> from 1958 to 1980 and president
of the Psychoanalytic Association of New York from 1971 to 1973. </p>
<p>Niederland researched and wrote on numerous topics. In 1951, he
published his first work on Daniel Paul Schreber, a case made famous by Sigmund
Freud's analysis of Schreber's memoirs in 1911. Niederland's analysis focused
particularly on Schreber's childhood and his relationship with his father, Dr.
Daniel Gottlieb Moritz Schreber. Niederland wrote numerous papers on the
subject and in 1974 published
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Schreber Case: Psychoanalytic Profile of a Paranoid
Personality</part>
</title>. Beginning in the early 1960s, Niederland developed the
concept of the "survivor syndrome" in working with survivors of the Nazi
Holocaust. He found that survivors experience unresolved feelings of guilt and
grief that lead to depression, anxiety, insomnia, personality change, and
hyperamnesia.</p>
<p> Niederland also applied psychoanalytic research methods to the study
of creativity and the creative process. He noted the frequency of perplexing
and often tragic experiences, such as illness or physical disabilities,
encountered by creative people during childhood. He found that such experiences
enhanced their emotional reactivity and responsiveness to internal and external
stimuli. Niederland also coined the term "psychogeography," a field of study
that examines underlying psychological forces operative in geographical
pursuits such as exploration and analyzes the anthropomorphic nature of
explorers' views of the earth.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
Correspondence
</ref> series consists largely of letters sent and
received from colleagues in the United States and Europe. The correspondence is
primarily personal and largely concerns Niederland's research and writings.
Prominent correspondents include Jacob A. Arlow, Lotte Köhler, Bertram D.
Lewin, Ella Lingens, Wolfgang Loch, and Jacques M. Quen.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pat">
Patient File
</ref>
includes notes from therapy sessions conducted largely in the 1960s. The case
of Arline Blackman is particularly well documented and was used by Niederland
to study the psychological effect of facial disfigurement.</p>
<p> The largest group of papers in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj">
Subject
File
</ref> concerns the Kris study group established by Ernst Kris at the New
York Psychoanalytic Institute. These files consist of minutes, case
presentations, and memoranda dating just prior to Kris' death in February 1957
and continuing into the 1970s. Niederland's work in Europe is documented
through correspondence while he was in Milan and a series of reference letters
written for him between 1930 and 1940. The series also contains research
material on such topics as creativity and psychogeography. The Subject File
also includes Niederland's research on Heinrich Schliemann, the "father" of
modern archeology. Included are photocopies of original Schliemann
correspondence given to Niederland by a member of Schliemann's family.</p>
<p> The

Niederland or sent to him by colleagues.</p>
<p> The

exclusively to Reginald N. Willcox and family, rector of Saint Luke's Church,
Jamestown, N. Y., a parish in Brent's diocese of Western New York. The issues
mentioned chiefly concern parish financial problems and Willcox's family.
Speeches and writings are predominantly addresses before the conventions of the
diocese of Western New York, 1922-1925, and the articles by Brent concern
religious matters.</p>

<p> The records of the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association (FDMHA) span
the years 1900-1990, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1950-1980.
The collection is arranged in six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">Correspondence</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corp">Corporate Records</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">Miscellany</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pm">Printed Matter</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="clip">Clippings</ref>; and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="add">Additions</ref>. </p>
<p>Based in Washington, D.C., the FDMHA was first envisioned in the will of Helen Pitts
Douglass, Frederick Douglass's second wife, who bequeathed their home in Southeast
Washington (Anacostia) to the American people as a memorial to her husband. It became
the main function of the association to preserve the Frederick Douglass Memorial Home at
Cedar Hill and to reunite surrounding lands once part of the estate into the whole of
the memorial. The FDMHA also undertook to disseminate knowledge concerning Afro-American
history in Washington and throughout America.</p>
<p> The collection includes minutes of meetings, reports, and related material not only of
the FDMHA but also of the Frederick Douglass Housing Corporation, Inc. (FDHC), an
organization closely allied to the association. Interaction between the two
organizations, occasionally via the National Park Service, is documented throughout the
records.</p>
<p> Much material reflects the personal interests of FDMHA's past president Mary E. C.
Gregory, whose papers were intermingled among the association's records she gave to the
Library. Other organizations represented among her files include the Museum of African
Art (located first in a Douglass home on Capitol Hill and later a part of the
Smithsonian Institution), the Douglass Glenn Gardens apartment complex, National
Association of Colored Women, National Council of Negro Women, National Urban League,
Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and the Phyllis Wheatley Young Women's Christian
Association in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p> The Goddard Papers reflect the drive and enthusiasm of a man whose
aspiration in life was the technological advancement of airborne photographic
reconnaissance. Goddard's lifelong ambition began in 1919 with an assignment to
McCook Field as officer-in-charge of aerial photographic research. Although he
had joined the army with the sole intent of flying airplanes, Goddard quickly
developed an intense interest in aerial photography. He spent the next
thirty-four years advancing its technology and demonstrating its reconnaissance
abilities to a rather skeptical army.</p>
<p> As the unofficial spokesman for airborne photographic reconnaissance,
Goddard wrote articles for popular magazines, gave numerous slide lectures to
professional and military groups, and obtained press coverage to promote the
use of aerial photography in reconnaissance operations. These efforts, coupled
with his belief that "a full-time push by one man in a given direction greatly
exceeds in efficiency part-time opposition by many men," led to increased
funding for Goddard's research and development laboratory at Wright Field,
improved technology and new inventions, and ultimately, the military's
recognition of the remarkable effectiveness of aerial photographic
reconnaissance. The technology now standard in reconnaissance today--night and
long-range photography, color emulsion, and other methods that enable
reconnaissance to be accomplished by high-speed aircraft at all operational
altitudes--is due to Goddard's ingenuity and determination. </p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chro">Chronological
File</ref>, originally arranged by Goddard for use in his autobiographical
writings, documents his personal, professional, and military experiences as a
pioneer in the field of aerial photographic reconnaissance. The series contains
correspondence, memoranda, reports, and other materials pertaining to Goddard's
military assignments in the United States, Philippines, and Europe, the
operations of aerial photographic sections under his command, promotions and
awards, and activities after retirement. The Cuban Missile Crisis, in which
Goddard played an important role, is represented by only a few newspaper
articles. Correspondence, notes, printed materials, newspaper clippings, and
articles provide a wealth of biographical information on Goddard and disclose
the high regard in which he was held by military officials and civilians
involved in aerial photographic reconnaissance.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writ">Writings
File</ref> contains articles, transcripts, correspondence, and working papers
relating to Goddard's books, papers, lectures, speeches, and other writing
projects. This file also contains book reviews, correspondence, and notes
pertaining to his autobiography,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Overview: A Life-long Adventure in Aerial Photography</part>
</title>, and
correspondence concerning Goddard's suspicions that the Itek Corporation, the
United States Air Force, and Doubleday Publishing Company conspired to halt
sales of the book due to its unflattering portrayal of Gen. Henry "Hap" Arnold.
Another notable item is an article published by
<title localtype="simple">
<part>National Geographic Magazine</part>
</title> in 1930 entitled, "The
Unexplored Philippines from the Air." Illustrated with photographs taken by
Goddard, the article describes his experiences in 1928 as commanding officer of
the Sixth Photographic Section, charged with making a photographic mosaic map
of the unexplored northeast corner of Luzon Island.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="inve">Inventions File
</ref> consists primarily of patent grants, reports, and diagrams relating to
Goddard's patented inventions. Also included in this series are correspondence,
notes, and printed materials pertaining to the stereoscopic strip camera. This
camera, which was never patented, was developed by Goddard and his colleagues
in 1942 at Wright Field and was used to make stereo strips of Cuban missile
sites in 1962.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="oral">Oral History
Transcripts File</ref> contains transcripts of oral history interviews
conducted by Goddard for use in his autobiographical writings. The interviewees
were military officers and civilians interested or active in the science of
aerial photographic reconnaissance during the years of Goddard's military
service, including Benjamin Foulois, Elliott Roosevelt, and Dwight D.
Eisenhower. Also included are several interviews with Goddard conducted by
others. Original tapes of most of the interviews have been transferred to the
Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library. </p>
<p>The final series in the collection,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">Miscellany</ref>,
consists primarily of printed materials collected by Goddard. The file contains
books, journals, and informational reports, mostly regarding the use of aerial
photographic reconnaissance in World War II. Photographs of Goddard and of his
family and friends, several stereograph cards, and a 3-D photograph with
stereoscopic glasses are also included.</p>

<p>The papers of the physicist Louis Nicot Ridenour (1911-1959) span the
years 1917-1960, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the postwar
period, 1945-1959. The collection includes correspondence, draft and published
writings, photographs, journals, reports, scientific papers, and printed matter
arranged alphabetically by type of material.</p>
<p> Ridenour led the team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Radiation Laboratory that in the early 1940s developed the SCR 584, a radar
device that was key to the first effective gun laying antiaircraft system.
During 1944-1945 while chief of the Advisory Specialist Group of the United
States Strategic Air Forces in Europe commanded by Carl Spaatz, Ridenour
adapted the SCR 584 to the close control of Allied fighter bombers in foul
weather. He pioneered the development of airborne radar and radar controlled
bomb sights. Journals from the World War II service file in the collection are
a daily record of Ridenour's activities in the European and North African
theaters of air operations.</p>
<p> In the postwar period Ridenour endeavored to familiarize the general
public with the science and policy issues related to the new technology of
atomic weapons and digital computers by writing for publications such as
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Atlantic Monthly,</part>
</title>
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Fortune,</part>
</title>
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Saturday Review of Literature, </part>
</title>
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Scientific American,</part>
</title>
and in preparing numerous
encyclopedia articles. He also sought to reach other scientists and
technologists, especially engineers, through articles in specialist
publications and by editing and cowriting books such as
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Modern Physics for the Engineer </part>
</title>
and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Radar Systems Engineering.</part>
</title>
</p>
<p> These papers mainly document the writing and editing phase of
Ridenour's career. Some of Ridenour's early fiction from his high school and
college days and his correspondence as the editor of the University of
Chicago's Daily Maroon is included in the early education file. Ridenour's
long-term writing projects and consultant relationship with publishers
generated a substantial correspondence with editors, coauthors, sources, and
readers. Notable correspondents represented in the speeches and writing file
include Lyman Bryson, Norman Cousins, Peter H. Davison, Dennis Flanagan, Hiram
Haydn, Byron K. Ledgerwood, Larry Lessing, Lawrence M. Levin, Herrymon Maurer,
Charles W. Morton, A. J. Muste, Oliver A. Nelson, Isabel Paterson, Gerard Piel,
Herbert Solow, and Edward Weeks.</p>
<p> Ridenour's writing and editorial activities also occasioned many
letters in the general correspondence. Editors, publishers, and writers not
previously listed include Joseph Alsop, Cary F. Baker, Curtis G. Benjamin, Hugh
H. Handsfield, Carl G. Nagel, James M. Reid, Leon Svirsky, Orin Tovrov,
Thornton Wilder, and Philip Wylie. Scientist with whom Ridenour corresponded
include Ralph D. Bennett, Edward L. Bowles, B. Vivian Bowden, and Kenʼichi
Shinohara. </p>

<p>The John Aldrich Stephenson Collection, consisting of the papers of
several generations of Stephenson's ancestors, spans the years 1745-1966. The
central figures are Joseph Winborn Hand (1792-1844); his wife, the former
Catharine Worthington Fowler (1801-1865); their children, principally Elizabeth
Worthington Hand Fiske (1835-1919); Elizabeth's husband, Asa Severance Fiske
(1833-1925); the Fiskes' daughter, Zoë Worthington Fiske Aldrich (1864-1942);
and Zoë's husband, Morton Arnold Aldrich (1874-1956). The collection is

<p>The earliest papers are chiefly those of relatives of Catharine
Worthington Fowler Hand, especially persons with the surname Chauncy (later
spelled Chauncey), including her grandfather, Elnathan Chauncy (1724-1796), a
minister in Connecticut. Chauncy was possibly the author of a group of unsigned
sermons, 1759-1798, more than half of which were written for congregations of
Indians. In another handwriting are unsigned sermons dated 1799-1804. There are
also a few early papers of Joseph Winborn Hand's ancestors, including his
grandfather Return Jonathan Meigs (1740-1823), Continental army colonel and
agent of the United States Office of Indian Affairs for the Cherokee Indians,
and his uncle Return Jonathan Meigs (1764-1824), United States senator from
Ohio, governor of the same state, and postmaster general.</p>
<p> Catharine Worthington Fowler Hand's brother, William Chauncey Fowler
(1793-1881), an author and professor successively at Middlebury College and
Amherst College, married Noah Webster's daughter Harriet. Fowler edited one
edition of Webster's dictionary and wrote a widely used textbook on English
grammar. He is represented by occasional letters dated 1811-1875 and by
numerous letters from Catharine to him. The letters, 1821-1846, of Elisa Ann
Fowler (d. 1849), sister of Catharine and William, are from East Guilford
(renamed Madison in 1826), Connecticut, where she sometimes cared for
Catharine's children, and from Durham, Connecticut, where she kept house for
her parents. There are a few personal letters, 1802-1840, from her mother,
Catharine Chauncy Fowler (1765-1841), as well as letters, 1824-1826, from her
father, Reuben Rose Fowler (1763-1844), who managed farm lands for his
son-in-law, Joseph Winborn Hand.</p>
<p>The principal correspondents before the Civil War are Joseph Winborn
Hand and his wife Catharine Worthington Fowler Hand. Joseph is represented by
almost three hundred letters, 1816-1844, complemented by four diaries,
1814-1817; Catharine by more than four hundred letters, 1820-1860. Most of
Joseph's letters are addressed to Catharine from Washington, D.C., where he
rose from clerical assistant to solicitor in the Post Office Department.
Beginning in 1835, he served as chief clerk in the Patent Office until he died
in 1844. In his letters he offered advice about rearing the children, passed
along news of friends and neighbors in Washington, and commented upon political
leaders and events.</p>
<p> For the years 1844-1860, the correspondence consists largely of
letters exchanged among Catharine and four of the five Hand children who
survived infancy. Chauncey Meigs Hand (d. 1865), the oldest child, wrote
chiefly from Yale College, where he graduated; from Oxford, Maryland, and
Alexandria, Virginia, where he taught school; and from the city of New York,
where he struggled unsuccessfully to establish himself as a lawyer. Catharine
Chauncey Hand, who died in 1854, wrote from schools she attended in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts, and the city of New York; her letters are complemented by
drawings, verses, school essays, and a small diary, 1846. Elizabeth Worthington
Hand Fiske's letters are chiefly from schools she attended with her sister
Catharine, from places in Virginia and South Carolina where she taught, and
from Madison, to which she often returned for short periods. Charles Fowler
Hand (1837-1874) wrote to his family from several preparatory schools and from
Williams College and Andover Theological Seminary.</p>
<p> There is also prewar correspondence of the Fiske (sometimes spelled
Fisk) family, principally of Samuel Wheelock Fiske (1828-1864) as he prepared
for the ministry and then as he served as pastor of the Congregational church
in Madison, 1848-1860; his brother Asa Severance Fiske as he studied for the
ministry, met and married Elizabeth Worthington Hand, and became pastor of
Plymouth Congregational Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, 1858-1860; and Laura
Severance Fisk[e] (1795-1870), who wrote from Shelburne, Massachusetts, to her
sons Samuel and Asa, 1850-1860. A bound volume contains letters, 1837-1856,
between Richard Dennis Mowry and Lucy Morton Albee Mowry, chiefly before their
marriage, while she lived and taught school in Oxford, Massachusetts, and he
lived in Uxbridge. Their grandson, Morton Arnold Aldrich, later married Zoë
Worthington Fiske, daughter of Asa Severance and Elizabeth Worthington Hand
Fiske.</p>
<p> The most important wartime letters are from Samuel Wheelock Fiske,
who commanded a company in the Fourteenth Connecticut Infantry and died from
wounds received in the battle of the Wilderness, and Asa Severance Fiske, who
wrote diaries as well as letters, 1862-1865, while serving as chaplain for the
Fourth Minnesota Infantry and later as assistant superintendent of contrabands
for the Department of West Tennessee. He built Camp Fiske at Memphis to house
several thousand freedmen, toured northern cities to raise money for food,
clothes, and medical supplies, and lobbied for the establishment of the Bureau
of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in the War Department. There are
also letters from Charles Fowler Hand, who was wounded at Beverly Ford (Brandy
Station, Virginia) while serving as an enlisted man in the Second United States
Cavalry and then had a relatively uneventful year as a captain in the
Sixty-third United States Colored Infantry, and Chauncey Meigs Hand, who
enlisted in the Second New York Cavalry and was twice wounded in battle.
Neither Charles nor Chauncey recovered from their wartime experiences. Chauncey
died in Madison in 1865 and Charles in St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington,
D.C., in 1874. Letters from Elizabeth Worthington Hand Fiske were written from
Memphis when she was with her husband and from boarding houses and relatives'
homes when she could not be with him.</p>
<p> After the Civil War, Asa Severance Fiske held pastorates successively
in Rockville, Connecticut; Rochester, New York; San Francisco, California; and
Ithaca, New York. He held pastorates until he was eighty-four, retiring at last
in New Orleans. The collection includes his letters from various locations, a
report he wrote in 1871 for the United States Bureau of Education on the
relation between education and crime in New England, and numerous manuscripts
of sermons and articles, along with books, pamphlets, and clipped articles.
Elizabeth Worthington Hand Fiske is represented by manuscript poems, essays,
and stories, as well as a scrapbook of clippings of her poems as published in
periodicals. There are also postwar letters from David Fisk, Jane (Jeannie)
Isabel Fiske Hawkes (Mrs. David B. Hawkes), Rebecca Wheelock Fiske Hart (Mrs.
Burdett Hart), Morton Arnold Aldrich, Zoë Worthington Fiske Aldrich, and Morton
Arnold Aldrich's parents, Charles Arnold Aldrich and Helen Francelia Mowry
Aldrich. Helen Aldrich's cousin, William T. G. Morton, the dentist who
discovered the anesthetic use of ether in surgery, is represented by letters of
20 September 1862 and 20 September 1866.</p>
<p> The Aldriches are further represented by account books and financial
papers of Charles Arnold Aldrich's dry goods business in Boston; diaries kept
by Morton Arnold Aldrich in 1887 and 1888 while traveling with his parents in
the Azores, Portugal, France, Switzerland, Italy, Holland, and England; letters
written by Morton and his mother on a trip around the world, 1895-1897; and
letters from Morton while he camped in the mountains of North Carolina during
several summers in the 1920s. Genealogical charts showing selected family
members are available with the paper finding aid in the Reading Room of the
Manuscript Division</p>

death in 1849 concerns the settlement of his estate by his daughters, Ann C.
Carroll and Maria Carroll Fitzhugh. </p>
<p>Principal correspondents from Daniel Carroll's lifetime include his
uncle, Daniel Carroll of Rock Creek, one of the early commissioners of the
District of Columbia; Charles Carroll (d. 1820) of Belle Vue; and Charles

<p>The papers of Johann Carl Philipp von Krafft (1752-1804) span the
years 1750-1926, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period between
1776 and 1790. The collection focuses on Krafft's career as a military officer,
surveyor, and draughtsman in Prussia and the British American colonies during
the Revolutionary War. The papers include correspondence, a journal, military
records, travel notes, and writings. The bulk of the material is written in
German with English and French appearing as well. A small number of writings
are in Latin, Russian, and Dutch. </p>
<p>The papers contain correspondence between Krafft and various family
members, friends, and military figures dealing with subjects ranging from
affairs of the heart to promotion of his career. The most significant part of
the collection, however, is Krafft's journal which covers the years 1770-1791,
with the largest portion chronicling Krafft's years as a mercenary soldier from
1776 to 1784. Entries for seven of these years are preceded by a table of
service, which presents month-by-month Krafft's rank, regiment, company, and
names of commanding officers. There is also an abstract of the journal which
provides additional information regarding Krafft's military service for the
British during the American Revolutionary War. A photocopy of an English
translation of the journal, published by the New-York Historical Society, is
included in the papers. </p>
<p>Krafft's career as a soldier of fortune is further revealed by his
military records, including pay accounts, orders, broadsides concerning
billeting and public drunkenness, and commissions, two of which were signed by
Frederick the Great. Krafft's wanderings in Russia, the Netherlands, and Quebec
in pursuit of a satisfactory military commission between 1776 and 1777 are
recorded in his travel notes of this period. He evidently received an excellent
education and was fluent in German, French, and English, writing both prose and
verse in all three languages as well as poems in Latin. His intellectual
interests ranged from literature to astronomy and proverbs to riddles. As a
trained surveyor, his knowledge of geometry, mathematics, and astronomy
contributed to his creation of a perpetual calendar. His interest in philosophy
is revealed in his 1779 treatise in Socratic dialogue on the nature of reality.

<p>An Oversize section is composed of military records as well as

<p>The papers of Thomas Hinckley Robbins (1900-1972) span the years
1918-1971, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1920-1962. The
collection reflects a career devoted to naval aviation from the 1920s to the
1960s. Featured in the papers are official and personal correspondence, orders
for duty, naval aviation log books, biographical information, speeches, and
material relating to Robbins's service aboard the minesweeper
<emph render="italic">Sandpiper</emph>. </p>
<p>Robbins's official correspondence contains routine information on
examinations, appointments, naval personnel, and naval aviation. Of note in the
correspondence are memoranda to naval intelligence on the inspections of
airplanes by foreign dignitaries, foreign aviation activities, espionage,
foreign ships and armaments, and meetings with individuals such as Rachid
Montan Pacha, a Syrian leader visiting New York in 1925 to sell jewels. A
majority of the personal correspondence is written to and from naval personnel
relating to naval aviation, aircraft, aircraft companies, and European
politics. </p>
<p>Material relating to the <emph render="italic">Sandpiper</emph> covers
the period 1933-1935 when the ship sailed in Alaskan waters and participated in

<p>The papers of Cornelia Bryce Pinchot (1881-1960) span the years 1899-1960 with the bulk
of the material dating from 1918 to 1947. The papers reflect Pinchot's activities in the
suffrage movement, union organizing for women workers, lobbying for legislative
protection for working women and children, involvement in the League of Women Voters and
the Women's Trade Union League, as wife of the governor of Pennsylvania, and her two
campaigns for a Congressional seat. Her papers also contain personal papers, including
financial records, correspondence with her husband Gifford Pinchot, medical records such
as material documenting her treatments for repeated miscarriages, and papers regarding
the Pinchot's home and gardens at "Grey Towers" in Milford, Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>The Pinchot Papers are organized in three parts. <ref target="part1" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part I, 1918-1947</ref>, by far the largest, came to the library

<p>The papers of Nathaniel Sisson (1845-1932) span the years 1838-1932,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1862 to 1920. The collection includes
correspondence, financial records, medals, printed matter, and writings and is
arranged alphabetically by type of material or topic followed by miscellany and
oversize.</p>
<p> The earliest correspondence, 1862-1865, contains letters between
Sisson and his family describing his Civil War experiences and their domestic
activities. The post-Civil War correspondence is composed chiefly of letters
received by Sisson from his family in Ohio and Iowa. Subjects include the
medical profession, teaching, and farming. Sisson’s business ventures and
private life are occasionally mentioned.</p>
<p> After his war service, Sisson moved to Maryville, Missouri, where he
experimented with several professions such as bridge building, cabinet making,
surveying, and teaching before settling on the real estate business. A subject
file contains primarily printed matter documenting Sisson’s involvement in
these areas. The file also includes material relating to Sisson’s participation
in genealogical research, military reunions, national politics, and the
Freemasons. </p>
<p>A writings file contains Sisson’s reminiscences of his Civil War
experiences. It also includes essays, poetry, and speeches by Sisson and
others. A miscellany file comprises military and political badges, road and
bridge surveys, and newspaper clippings.</p>

<p>The papers of the Nicholas King family span the years 1792-1987, with
the bulk of material dating from 1792 to 1861. The journals, correspondence,
notes, genealogies, visas, photographs, and drawings comprising the collection
consist primarily of the papers of three members of the King family: Nicholas
King (1771-1812), English-born engineer and surveyor of the city of Washington,
D.C.; his son-in-law William Wade (1789-1875), United States Army ordnance
officer and part owner of a series of steam engine and cannon foundries in
Pittsburgh; and his grandson Nicholas King Wade (1823-1899), engineer and
foundry owner. The papers are arranged alphabetically by name of family member.
A small group of miscellany contains genealogies, photographs, and drawings.
Oversize material is housed separately.</p>
<p>The papers of Nicholas King consist largely of a series of journals
containing diary entries (some in shorthand), drawings, and treatises on a
variety of subjects. The earliest volume, written in 1793 while traveling
through Suffolk, East Anglia, and Yorkshire prior to his immigration to the
United States, records his observations on agriculture, architecture, oak
timber, tithing, and the poor. The second journal, begun in August 1794 when
King was a resident of Philadelphia, contains an account of a trip from
Philadelphia to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; advice for immigrant settlers and
American land speculators; and passing comments on American agriculture, racial
attitudes, and Pennsylvania penal reform. A third journal records his work as a
surveyor in Washington, D.C, from 1796 to 1799. A board of commissioners
responsible for overseeing the construction of federal buildings and the sale
of city lots hired King as a surveyor in 1796. Also included are transcribed
excerpts from several journals which have since been lost. One of these
recounts King's transatlantic crossing in 1793 and his earliest impressions of
America. The transcripts include copies of letters from King and his father,
Robert King, who was also an engineer and surveyor. The collection contains a
small portrait of King, a sketch of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington,
D.C, and several photographs of family portraits. </p>
<p>The papers of William Wade relate primarily to his participation in an
inspection tour of European cannon factories sponsored by the War Department in
1840. Included is a letter from Wade to his son Nicholas before his departure,
two visas, and a transcribed memorandum by Wade concerning the trip. In a
letter dated 1861, Mark A. Cooper of Georgia expressed interest in acquiring a
machine used to test the strength of iron. The letter, written eight days after
the attack on Fort Sumter, is annotated with Wade's refusal to assist him. </p>
<p>The papers of Nicholas King Wade consist of a series of letters to his
sister, Elizabeth Stone Wade, describing his journey from Berlin, Germany, to
St. Petersburg, where he had a contract with the Russian government to
manufacture military ordnance. </p>

<p>The correspondence of Samuel Freeman Miller (1816-1890) spans the
years 1854-1887 and contains Miller's holograph letters to his brother-in-law
William Pitt Ballinger, an attorney in Galveston, Texas. Miller comments on a
broad range of political and judicial issues, including Abraham Lincoln's
election in 1860, Reconstruction and relations between North and South, various
judicial appointments, the nomination of John Marshall Harlan to the Supreme
Court, Republican Party politics, and Miller's service on the electoral
commission appointed by Congress to decide the disputed 1876 presidential
election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden. The collection also
includes three reels of microfilm reproducing typewritten transcripts of
Ballinger's diaries in the Texas Archives at the University of Texas
Library.</p>
<p> Miller, who served on the Supreme Court from 1862 until his death in
1890, relates news of the court and the status of various cases pending before
it. In a confidential letter to Ballinger in 1866, he reports the Court's five
to four ruling in the test oath cases striking down loyalty oaths after the
Civil War. Miller briefly describes the reasoning in his dissenting opinion in
the cases, yet quickly adds, in deference to Ballinger's circumstance as a
former Confederate official, that he is "... not sorry that the result is
adverse to my opinion, on your account and generally because I think the
requirement unnecessarily harsh at present." The letters also contain news of
family members.</p>

contain typed monographs and notes as well as prints and photographs. Formerly known as
Winifred Shaughnessy Hudnut, Rambova married Rudolph Valentino in 1922. The unpublished
monographs in these papers reflect Rambova's research in Egyptology and cosmology which
was sponsored largely by the Bollingen Foundation. Rambova contributed to a series of
publications by the foundation entitled Egyptian Religious Texts and Representations.

<p>The papers of Sol Myron Linowitz (1913-2005) span the years 1778-1999, with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1946-1995. The collection covers virtually every
phase of Linowitz's career as an attorney, executive for Xerox Corporation, ambassador
to the Organization of American States, co-negotiator of the Panama Canal treaties, and
presidential representative to Middle East peace negotiations. The papers are organized
in ten series: <ref target="diar1">Diaries</ref>, <ref target="corr11">Correspondence File</ref>, <ref target="gove96">Government Service</ref>, <ref target="gene136">General Office File</ref>, <ref target="halo538">Haloid Xerox, Inc.</ref>, <ref target="spee568">Speeches and Writings File</ref>, <ref target="misc628">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="addition">Addition</ref>, <ref target="class">Classified</ref>, and <ref target="over">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="diar1">Diaries</ref> are a key component of the papers and provide an account of Linowitz's
activities as an attorney, executive for Xerox Corporation, ambassador to the
Organization of American States, and consultant and international negotiator in the
administration of Jimmy Carter. The most detailed entries recount the period 1974-1981
and reveal Linowitz's increasing influence in national and international politics. After
a long career with Xerox Corporation and service as ambassador to the Organization of
American States, he joined in 1969 the Washington office of the international law firm
Coudert Brothers working closely with public service organizations, corporate leaders,
statesmen, and politicians. Recognized for his range of interests and negotiating
insight, he moved into Washington's inner circles of national and international
politics. The diaries recollect in detail formal and informal talks with leading
statesmen and businessmen and include observations on politics, politicians, government,
presidential elections and appointments, international relations, and national and
international events. Most notable are entries regarding his work as co-negotiator for
the Panama Canal treaties and his service as President Jimmy Carter's representative in
Middle East peace talks. As a significant member of Carter's administration, his diaries
are replete with meetings and discussions with the president, administration officials,
State Department personnel, members of Congress, and members of the diplomatic
community.</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr11" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence File</ref> contains
letters received and copies of letters sent and primarily documents Linowitz's public
service career after leaving the Xerox Corporation. The letters are generally personal
and include correspondents from government, public service, business and industry, and
foreign service. Topics include Linowitz's service in the Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson
administrations, Latin America, the Middle East, and presidential elections. Linowitz's
activities regarding Jewish concerns are revealed in correspondence with religious
leaders and other members of the community. His personal recapitulations of formal and
informal discussions with Alexander Meigs Haig, Henry Kissinger, Robert S. Strauss, and
other prominent individuals are scattered throughout the file and are generally filed
under the person's name. In 1975 Linowitz recounted a candid talk with Nelson A.
Rockefeller regarding his role as Gerald R. Ford's vice president and other members of
that administration. The file also contains letters exchanged with these individuals.
Other correspondents include Menachem Begin, Peter G. Bourne, Ellsworth Bunker, Joseph
Epstein (1937- ), Henry A. Grunwald, Lee Hamilton, Edward Moore Kennedy, David E.
Lilienthal, Peter G. Peterson, George Shultz, and Earl Warren.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gove96" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Government Service</ref> series
documents Linowitz's accomplishments as ambassador to the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="orga96">Organization of American States</ref>
(OAS), co-negotiator of the treaties transferring control of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pana113">Panama Canal</ref> to Panama, and Jimmy
Carter's special representative for <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="midd123">Middle East peace negotiations</ref>. Linowitz honed his international relations
skills guiding the Xerox Corporation into global markets and promoting international
development through private and government public service institutions. These activities
and others moved President Johnson to name Linowitz ambassador to the OAS and
representative to the Alliance for Progress in 1966. Correspondence and State Department
memoranda depict his participation with Johnson in the first ever gathering of American
hemisphere presidents at Punta del Este, Uruguay, for a Latin American summit conference
in 1967. Notable also are Linowitz's letters to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey
(1911-1978) proffering political advice and tactics regarding Humphrey's presidential
candidacy in 1968. Other correspondents include Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson,
Galo Plaza, Dean Rusk, and various Latin American government officials.</p>
<p>In 1977-1978, Linowitz and co-negotiator Ellsworth Bunker secured the politically
sensitive <ref target="pana113" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Panama Canal
treaties</ref> that set in motion the eventual transfer of control of the canal to
Panama. Related material in the <ref target="gove96" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Government Service</ref> series describes the negotiation process from Linowitz's
appointment as co-negotiator to Senate ratification of the treaties. Correspondence and
memoranda exchanged with President Carter, administration and State Department
officials, members of Congress, and opponents of the treaties outline the issues and
negotiation tactics. In the wake of the Camp David agreements, Carter appointed Linowitz
in 1979 as his special representative in the Middle East regarding talks on Palestinian
autonomy. Correspondence, memoranda, and reports treat this phase of Linowitz's
diplomatic career and provide insight into the actions of Carter and White House staff,
State Department officials, and representatives of Middle Eastern countries. Especially
interesting are Linowitz's reports to Carter regarding the progress of negotiations and
memoranda in the general correspondence file depicting the evolving strategies of the
negotiators. Memoranda recounting meetings with Menachem Begin and Henry Kissinger are
key items in the general correspondence. Transcripts of press conferences and
interviews, copies of diaries and personal reflections, articles, and speeches are also
significant documents concerning Linowitz's mission.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gene136" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Office File</ref> contains
correspondence, speeches, articles, reports, organizational records, and related
material and is organized in two parts. <ref target="part136" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part A</ref> represents Linowitz's early career in Rochester, New York, as an
attorney and executive with Xerox Corporation. Importantly, though, the file
demonstrates his commitment to public service through organizations and institutions
devoted to local community service, education, and international development. As a
successful and grateful beneficiary of the private enterprise system, Linowitz advocated
corporate responsibility and counseled businessmen on their obligation to repay their
good fortune through public service and community activities. Material related to the
International Executive Service Corps, which he cofounded with David Rockefeller as an
international service organization for retired executives patterned on the Peace Corps,
constitutes a prime expression of this vision. His contributions to international aid
through government agencies are documented in material related to the State Department's
Advisory Committee on International Organizations and the President's General Advisory
Committee on Foreign Assistance Programs. The Rank Xerox file reflects Linowitz's
activities as an executive for Xerox and his part in its expansion into the global
marketplace through agreements with the Rank Organisation in London. Overseas trips for
Xerox during this period are documented in travel files that include notes and
observations on journeys to Europe, Israel, and Japan. Linowitz's law practice as well
as his numerous local community activities are represented including client files and
records of service organizations, educational institutions, clubs, and Jewish
associations. His nascent interest in international issues is reflected in material
related to memberships in local and national groups affiliated with the United Nations
and in the topics addressed on his public affairs television show <title localtype="simple">
<part>Court of Public
Opinion</part>
</title>. A personal file contains correspondence with Xerox president Joseph
C. Wilson (1909-1971), material related to a contemplated candidacy for governor of New
York, biographical material, and clippings.</p>
<p>
<ref target="part291" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part B</ref> of the <ref target="gene136" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">General Office File</ref> chiefly
relates to Linowitz's career after he left Xerox in 1966 and documents his expanded
activities in public service and as consultant to government, politicians, and
corporations. Material related to his membership on the boards of various organizations
and corporations demonstrates Linowitz's public service in their behalf. Prominent are
records of the Inter-American Dialogue, where he served as founding chairman; Cornell
University; Council on Foreign Relations; National Urban Coalition; and Federal City
Council in Washington, D.C. Government commissions he headed or assisted include the
Commission on United States-Latin American Relations, Presidential Commission on World
Hunger, and Special Committee on Campus Tensions. Records of the board of directors of
the Pan American Airways Corporation document its acquisition of National Airlines as a
domestic carrier and cover the period of the deregulation of the airline industry. Other
corporation boards represented include Marine Midland Banks and Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New York. Political files reveal Linowitz's advisory role in the presidential
campaigns of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Edmund S. Muskie. Travel files include his
notes and observations on journeys to Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. A set
of files primarily from the 1980s relates to his work with the Coudert Brothers
international law firm, where he worked as partner and counsel from 1969 to 1994.</p>
<p>The <ref target="halo538" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Haloid Xerox, Inc.</ref> series
includes correspondence, contracts, agreements, and related material pertaining to
Linowitz's work for Haloid Xerox, later renamed the Xerox Corporation, as an attorney
for patents and licensing and in executive management. In the late 1940s, Linowitz
advised Haloid, a photographic paper supplier, in negotiations to acquire the patent and
licensing rights to a new electronic reproduction process devised by Chester Floyd
Carlson and later marketed as xerography. The executive management file relates the
patent acquisitions from Carlson and his sponsor, Battelle Memorial Institute, and
includes correspondence with Carlson and Haloid officials Joseph C. Wilson (1909-1971)
and John H. Dessauer. The series also contains a general office file, material relating
Linowitz's part in the expansion of Xerox products into foreign markets, and patent and
licensing agreements with government and private industry.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spee568" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Writings File</ref>
includes various drafts and printed copies of articles, speeches, statements,
interviews, reviews, book proposals, and book files grouped in two parts. <ref target="part568" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part A</ref> contains material
generated prior to his resignation from Xerox Corporation in 1966. The articles and
speeches are filed by topic including antitrust issues, civil rights, education,
government, Israel, law, the United Nations, and Xerox. <ref target="part578" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part B</ref> covers the period after
his resignation from Xerox and includes a chronological arrangement of articles,
interviews, and speeches. Topics include corporate responsibility, education, Latin
America, the Middle East, law, the Panama Canal, and urban issues. <ref target="part578" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Part B</ref> also includes drafts and
other production files associated with the publication in 1985 of Linowitz's memoir,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Making of a
Public Man</part>
</title>, and an oral history from 1982-1983.</p>
<p>The <ref target="misc628" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">Miscellany</ref> series includes
biographical material, clippings, legal files, notes, photographs, and scrapbooks. Files
pertaining to Linowitz's legal practice in the early 1940s with Sutherland and
Sutherland in Rochester, New York, and his work for the Office of Price Administration
in Washington, D.C., during World War II form the largest part of the series. Opinions,
briefs, memoranda, transcripts of oral arguments, notes, and background material
pertaining to rent control and other issues are included. Photographs relate primarily
to his activities in the Johnson and Carter administrations. Scrapbooks with clippings
and photographs span most stages of his career including the Organization of American
States, the Panama Canal treaties, and Latin America.</p>
<p>An <ref target="addition">Addition</ref> contains material assembled after Linowitz’s
death and covers many facets of his career. The bulk consists of speeches and writings
by Linowitz, most of which are organized in a series of binders. The earliest binders
contain topically organized speeches and articles from 1946 to 1966. Later binders cover
the period 1966-1987 in a chronological arrangement. Loose speeches and articles,
1940-1999, are filed at the end. Another significant feature of the addition are files
relating to Linowitz’s Washington connections in the mid-1960s. Included are letters
from prominent public officials filed in general correspondence; a subject file on the
Lyndon B. Johnson administration including copies of letters from the president and his
staff; and a separate file on Washington, D.C., containing notes, meeting schedules, and
appointments. Other phases of Linowitz’s career are also documented in the series
including his oversight of rent control cases for the Office of Price Administration
during World War II and his exploration into a possible run for governor in New York in
1966. Also present are memoranda describing meetings and travel (1955-1957, 1966,
1975-1981), notes from a tour of the Middle East hosted by Time, Inc., in 1975, and
descriptions of Anwar Sadat’s funeral in 1981. A small personal file contains
biographical material, college and high school ephemera, news clippings, photographs,
and a eulogy delivered on his mother’s death. </p>

<p>The papers of Arthur Huntington Gleason (1878-1923) span the years
1863-1931, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1900-1923.
Consisting of
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorr">family

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">general
correspondence</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writings">writings

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subject">subject

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">miscellany</ref>
including clippings and printed matter, the papers chart Gleason's career from
his graduation from Yale University to his death from spinal meningitis in
1923. Letters and related material document his early years as an editor with
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Cosmopolitan</part>
</title>,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Survey</part>
</title>, and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Collier's Weekly</part>
</title>, but the major part of the collection
relates to his years in Europe, 1914-1920. Gleason and his wife Helen Hayes
were among a group of youthful American writers who volunteered to perform
humanitarian service on behalf of the Allies during the first years of World
War I, and it is this phase and the subsequent years of reconstruction and
political turmoil that are treated most prominently in the collection. By the
time Gleason returned to the United States in 1920, he had become a student of
the British labor movement as well as a veteran observer of combat, and his
growing socialist convictions led him to a career in research and public
relations work for various labor organizations. </p>
<p>The papers in this collection focus chiefly on World War I. As a
journalist and ambulance worker for the Red Cross in Belgium, Gleason became a
proponent of the Allied cause. In addition to reporting on Allied soldiers and
Belgium's defeated populace, he relayed stories of German atrocities back to
the United States and served as an intermediary for English writers seeking to
influence public opinion in this country in favor of the English position.
Manuscripts of two of these writers, G. K. Chesterton and James Bryce, are
among the articles and interview transcripts which Gleason sent to the United
States from England for publication, and he retained them in his papers. Also
in the collection are exchanges with Geoffrey B. Butler, J. J. Jusserand, the
French ambassador to Washington, and Baron Eustace Percy of Newcastle on issues
such as the Irish question, American isolationism, and the political and social
ramifications of immigration to the United States. The impact of ethnicity on
the American character, a frequent postwar theme of Gleason's, was a topic
which he addressed in a series of articles on the status of Jews in America
published by
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Hearst's International</part>
</title>. Pertinent to this series are
letters he received in 1922-1923 from Felix Frankfurter, Ludwig Lewisohn,
Walter Lippmann, Julian W. Mack, and Stephen Samuel Wise.</p>
<p>Following his return to the United States in 1920, Gleason worked on
behalf of the Bureau of Industrial Research and John Brophy of the United Mine
Workers. Papers relevant to this aspect of his life are contained in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">Correspondence</ref> series, in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subject">Subject
File</ref> under Bureau of Industrial Research, and the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writings">Writings
File</ref>. Among the individuals who appear either as correspondents or in
biographical sketches are John Blankenhorn, Bruce Bliven, John Brophy, Robert
W. Bruère, Herbert David Croly, Andrew Furuseth, Frank Hodges, Vida Dutton
Scudder, Robert Smillie, and Norman Thomas. After 1922 Gleason turned to
writing about the new civilization he believed was emerging in the Southwest
and to the varieties of religious experience he saw in California. He also
underwent a personal crisis as a writer which is documented in private
reflections he titled "The Darker Side." These and similar holograph notes are
contained in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writings">Writings
File</ref>, as are transcripts of interviews he conducted with Percy Stickney
Grant, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Ili︠a︡ L'vovich Tolstoĭ, Charles Richard
Van Hise, and others.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorr">family
correspondence</ref>, although a relatively small part of the collection, is a
source of biographical data. Letters Gleason sent his mother in 1906 include
critical comments on Jane Addams's personality, and a file for 1915 contains
descriptions of Gleason in action as a medic and reporter on the Western Front.
Also in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorr">family
correspondence</ref> are letters sent and received by Helen Hayes Gleason
during the war and a few exchanges which Gleason sent or wrote during boyhood.
Letters of condolence to Helen Hayes Gleason after her husband's death are
located in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">general
correspondence</ref> as are papers generated during her compilation of
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Book of Arthur Gleason</part>
</title> (1929). The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorr">family

Beecher's Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn to Gleason's maternal
grandmother requesting that she accept an offer to fill Beecher's pulpit

<p>The papers of the Francis Lewis Cardozo Family, a prominent
African-American family in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., span the years
1864-1968, with the bulk of the material dated between 1868 and 1932. The
papers include correspondence, genealogical material, certificates,
commissions, degrees, notes, and a typescript of a novel. Francis Lewis Cardozo
(1836-1903) was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and served as secretary of
state and state treasurer. Cardozo received a law degree from the University of
South Carolina in 1876 and was admitted to practice law before the state
supreme court in the same year.</p>
<p>The papers include correspondence of Francis Lewis Cardozo, Jr., W.
Warrick Cardozo, William Cardozo, and Margaret Cardozo Holmes. Much of the
correspondence relates to the ancestry of the African-American and Jewish
family. Of particular interest is a typed manuscript of a novel entitled
"Folks' Ways," written by Francis Lewis Cardozo, Jr., under the pseudonym F.
Elsee, which is based on his father's life. Also in the papers are commissions,
degrees, and certificates related to Francis Lewis Cardozo and genealogical
material relating to the Cardozo family.</p>

<p>The London Newsletters Collection spans the years 1665-1685 and
consists of volumes of letters written from the offices of the English ministry
at Whitehall Palace chiefly to Sir William Scott, 5th Laird of Harden (died
1707). The letters, many with the signature “These,” are from several different
hands, including one at the beginning of the first volume that was written by
Thomas St. Serf.</p>
<p>The authors of the letters discussed such matters as royal travel and
itinerary, military operations, diplomatic meetings, religious movements,
shipping and commercial agreements and restrictions, and social events
occurring in London. One volume contains several handbills relating to
Parliamentary acts and chronicles actions in Parliament. Another aspect of the
letters concerns sources of information and communication in London in the
seventeenth century, and the authors frequently noted from whom particular
rumors originated.</p>

<p>The records of the American Psychological Association (APA) span the years 1917-1986,
with the bulk of the records concentrated in the period 1940-1980. The records consist
of correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes of meetings, agenda, ballots, financial
records, drafts of books, articles, and lectures, testimonies, printed and near printed
matter, and miscellaneous material. The collection is organized into eight series
representing the structure and function of the organization, including <ref target="cou1"> Council of Representatives </ref>, <ref target="boa10"> Board of
Directors </ref>, <ref target="adm29"> Administration </ref>, <ref target="boa292">
Boards and Committees </ref>, <ref target="div550"> Divisions </ref>, <ref target="jou621"> Journals and Publications </ref>, and <ref target="aff688">
Affiliated Organizations </ref>, as well as a <ref target="mis719"> Miscellany </ref>
file. The records are replete with gaps. A lack of consistency in the retirement of APA
records may have contributed to the absence of material regarding certain periods or
subjects. Many divisions and committees did not retire their records to the Library of
Congress, preferring the Akron University Psychological Archives in Akron, Ohio. The
records of the APA held by that institution should be consulted where gaps exist
here.</p>
<p>The governing bodies of the APA – the <ref target="cou1"> Council of Representatives
</ref> and <ref target="boa10"> Board of Directors </ref> – are represented in these
records by separate series dating between the end of World War II and the beginning of
the 1980s. Consisting largely of correspondence, memoranda, reports, and meeting data,
these series treat business and organizational issues and relate to the professional
direction of the association.</p>
<p>More extensive in scope and chronology is the <ref target="adm29"> Administration </ref>
file. Until 1955, much of the material in the records of the APA was maintained in the
office files of the executive secretary of the association. Dating primarily from the
1930s, the <ref target="exe29"> Executive Officers File </ref> in the <ref target="adm29"> Administration </ref> series reflects the managerial decisions of the
organization's chief officers and documents its main activities. Featured in the
personal records of various executives – from Donald Gildersleeve Paterson and Willard
Clifford Olson in the 1930s and 1940s to Arthur H. Brayfield and Kenneth B. Little in
the 1960s and 1970s – are the concerns and issues that defined their tenure as leaders.
Themes of significance include APA-government relations, psychological testing, forensic
information, loyalty investigations, the behavioral sciences, scientific exchanges,
science and education, and the Peace Corps. Other important issues include legislation
on aging, television projects, legal testimony, White House conferences, international
cooperation, and ongoing publication efforts.</p>
<p>Also in the <ref target="adm29"> Administration </ref> series are <ref target="dep132">
Departmental Offices Files </ref> relating to the principal subdivisions in the
association, including the Educational Affairs Office, Professional Affairs Office,
Programs and Planning Office, Scientific Affairs Office, and Women's Program. In subject
matter, they document the thrust of the APA's post-1950s operations from the minutia of
daily activities to the practical applications of its programs and policies. As an
example, within the files of the Professional Affairs Office are studies concerning
abortion, contraception, population issues, and social attitudes, all under the term
"family planning."</p>
<p>The <ref target="boa292"> Boards and Committees </ref> series offers further
documentation of APA's outreach in developing and promoting psychology as a profession
and field of study. Principal groups represented are boards relating to professional
affairs, scientific affairs, social and ethical responsibility, education and training,
and publication. Featured as well are the files of temporary bodies or continuing
committees such as boards on ethical standards in psychological research, on psychology
in governmental and public affairs, on revision of test standards, and on the APA's
association with the guilds of related disciplines.</p>
<p>Topics highlighted in the <ref target="boa292"> Boards and Committees </ref> series
reflect the core concerns of the organization, especially after 1960. Prominent are
women's issues, equal opportunity for minorities, drug use, attitudes concerning sexual
orientation, Vietnam War veterans, post-doctoral education, sex-role stereotyping, and
social justice. Particularly extensive are files relating to the ethical treatment of
human subjects during research. Also significant are testing and training questions and
problems. Health issues are prominent throughout the collection, from licensing
considerations and insurance matters to community health centers and the relationship
between psychology and psychiatry.</p>
<p>The remaining files of the APA consist of a large <ref target="div550"> Divisions </ref>
series, followed by <ref target="jou621"> Journals and Publications </ref>, <ref target="aff688"> Affiliated Organizations </ref>, and a small <ref target="mis719">
Miscellany </ref>. Eclectic and incomplete, the Divisions series is organized by
number of division, but the numbering is inconsistent and not all divisions are
represented in the records. The files for Divisions 12, 14, and 17 ("Clinical,"
"Industrial" and "Counseling Psychology") are the most complete.</p>
<p> The records in the <ref target="jou621"> Journals and Publications </ref> series are
also fragmentary, with the stronger portion beginning in the 1970s. Included are
editorial and administrative matter related to books, abstracts, monographs, and
journals published by the organization.</p>
<p> The <ref target="aff688"> Affiliated Organizations </ref> series consists of files
relating to the American Association for Applied Psychology, the Conference of State
Psychological Associations, and the Virginia Psychological Association, which beginning
in the 1940s affiliated with the APA.</p>
<p>Among the prominent or frequent correspondents in the collection are George Albee,
Arthur H. Brayfield, Arthur Centor, Isador Chein, Kenneth Bancroft Clark, Dorothy
Clendenen, John Gordon Darley, Nicholas Hobbs, Erasmus Leonard Hoch, John McVee Hunt,

<p>The papers of Abram Peter Turner Elder (circa 1890-circa 1930) span the years 1890-1916,
with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1903-1916, and include
correspondence, illustrated material, photographs, biographical files, and miscellaneous
matter. The collection is divided into three series: <ref target="corr1">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="bio3">Biographical Case Files</ref>, and <ref target="mis11">Miscellany</ref>.</p>
<p>Little is known of Elder's life or career outside the professional associations and
productions illuminated by his papers, other than that he was involved in creating and
marketing specialty publications. In 1896 Elder and a relative published a compendium of
religious art, apparently marketed by private subscriptions and published by a family
corporation in Chicago. In 1899 they reissued the book through a worldwide publishing
firm. There is no information, however, in the Elder Papers concerning these ventures.
In 1902 Charles H. Grosvenor began compiling <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Book of the Presidents, with Biographical Sketches</part>

National Biographical Society, a commercial firm of which Elder was an official, became
involved in Grosvenor's work, eventually assuming control of most or all aspects of its
publication, which is noted in correspondence in the Elder Papers and is graphically
represented in four-color engravings of title sheets, sample page proofs, and other
publishing matter.</p>
<p>Between approximately 1903 and 1912, Elder assisted in the preparation of another
customized biographical directory, marketed via subscription and published under the
auspices of his firm, entitled <title localtype="simple">
<part>The National Memorial of the United States</part>
</title>. <ref target="corr1">Correspondence</ref> and related records in Elder's papers
provide an in-depth view of the efforts to publish the <title localtype="simple">
<part>National Memorial</part>
</title>, with extensive detail concerning contracts, quality of work which printing
firms promised or submitted, internal personnel matters, efforts to identify a
subscriber audience and increase sales, and outreach, including an award-winning exhibit
in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915-1916 in San Francisco. Most of
the correspondence regarding the <title localtype="simple">
<part>National Memorial</part>
</title> was generated by several officials of the National Biographical Society,
including Elder, but was not signed and is impossible or difficult to identify by
author. Prominent among the correspondents are society officials Charles H. Grosvenor,
Robert E. Doan, Lucy S. Bahnsen, R. E. Montague, and Richard R. McMahon.</p>
<p>The <ref target="bio3">Biographical Case Files</ref> contain correspondence, background
information, clippings, and other printed matter, as well as photographs and
biographical entries regarding the individuals profiled in the <title localtype="simple">

politicians, capitalists, and philanthropists, including Charles F. Chickering, W. W.

<p>A small number of records document the organization, function, and mission of the
National Biographical Society, including statements of intent, bylaws, articles of

correspondence concerns the maintenance of Elmhyrst, the Elder family summer estate in
Middletown, Rhode Island, and is virtually the only reference in this collection to
Elder's nonprofessional life.</p>

portrays the range of Niebuhr's work and his influence in twentieth-century theology,
politics, and society. Included are <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr1"> correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speech"> articles, sermons, reviews, lectures, typescripts of books </ref>,

literary figures, and diverse community leaders and organizations comprises a
substantial portion of the original collection and <ref target="addi1"> Additions I

interests and work, much of the material relates his efforts to apply religion and
ethical standards to social and political problems. Two such examples, represented in

last years of his life, the material consists chiefly of Ursula Niebuhr's correspondence
with academic colleagues, researchers, and family friends. Also of interest are letters
from her friends and colleagues in England describing conditions there during World War
II. Subject files contain research material collected by the Niebuhrs, biographical
clippings, information on colleagues, and material related to researchers studying
Niebuhr, including a group of letters exchanged with Richard Fox and others relating to

political and social activities. Highlights in the correspondence include Niebuhr's
descriptions of activities relating to his Gifford lectures at the University of
Edinburgh (1939), his travels to Germany with the U.S. Commission on Cultural Affairs in
Occupied Territories (1946), and other trips to Europe during the late 1940s. Also
included are letters Niebuhr received from his brother, H. Richard Niebuhr, during the
1930s. In 1991, Ursula Niebuhr edited and published much of this correspondence in

<p>The papers of Wilhelm Fliess (1858-1928) span the years 1894-1929 and
include correspondence, writings, a reminiscence, and clippings, all of which
are in German. A large portion of the papers concerns a plagiarism controversy
surrounding the publication of Otto Weininger’s
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Geschlect und Charakter</part>
</title> in 1903. Weininger’s book
contained theories on bisexuality similar to those developed by Fliess. Fliess
alleged that Sigmund Freud had discussed his theories with Hermann Swoboda who
then related them to Weininger. Included is a draft and published text of
Fliess’s pamphlet on the subject,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>In Eigener Sache</part>
</title>. Accompanying the pamphlet are letters to
and from Fliess and a clipping file concerning Fliess’s allegations. </p>
<p>Also featured in the papers are letters dated 1894-1898 from Joseph
Breuer, a letter from Oscar Rie dated 1895, an undated draft of a writing by
Fliess entitled “Die Entdeckung der Dauernden Doppelgeschlechtigkeit: Eine

1913 as a rodman and later chief of the party which surveyed the Panama Canal.
He also oversaw construction of roads and bridges for the Panama Railroad in
1914 and for the Panama Canal in 1915. The papers consist chiefly of
correspondence to his wife, Lula Ross Henderson, that detail his work with the
construction of the Panama Canal and personal family matters. The
correspondence is augmented with photographs of the canal construction as well
as records outlining Henderson's employment history. Included in the papers are
letters of recommendation from C. A. McIlvain of the Panama Canal and George W.
Goethals of the Isthmian Canal Commission and a biographical outline compiled
by Henderson's daughter, Frances Henderson Carter. After his tenure with the
construction of the Panama Canal, Henderson was employed as a surveyor and
civil engineer for several oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

<p> The papers of William H. Conkling (1858-1939) span the years
1864-1976, with the bulk of the papers dated 1927-1939. Conkling, longtime
postal official in Springfield, Illinois, was an early airmail enthusiast who
established his city as a stop on one of the first cross-country contract
airmail routes. The route was flown by Charles A. Lindbergh until 1927, when he
quit to prepare for his historic New York-to-Paris flight. During this flight,
Lindbergh carried aboard his aircraft, the <emph render="italic">Spirit of St.
Louis</emph>, a philatelic cover which he mailed to Conkling from Paris. In
addition to this cover, Conkling’s papers contain correspondence with
Lindbergh; publications, speeches, and writings concerning Lindbergh’s Paris
flight and airmail service to Springfield; and photographs of Lindbergh loading
his plane with mail at Springfield’s aerodrome and as its special guest of

<p>The papers of Henry Ware Lawton (1843-1899) span the years 1849-1930,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1886 to 1902. The collection includes
correspondence, military papers, a map, photographs, a copy of a journal of
Esther Voorhees Hasson, 1899, a copy of a diary of Leonard Wood, 1886, printed
matter, and miscellaneous material.</p>
<p>The correspondence relates primarily to Lawton’s army career and
contains many letters from Lawton to his wife, Mary Lawton, describing his
campaign against the Chiricahua band of Apache that resulted in the capture of
Geronimo and Naiche (also known as Natchez) in 1886. Other topics include
Lawton's life in the field in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, and the
campaign on Luzon in the Philippines that led to his death. There is little
correspondence reflecting his Civil War service or his many Indian campaigns
before 1886. Included is a group of letters written to his wife after 1900 by
Dean C. Worcester describing the Philippine Commission’s struggle and
adjustment in governing the Philippine Islands. Also of interest is a copy of
Esther Voorhees Hasson's journal from 1899 describing her experiences aboard
the United States Army Hospital Ship <emph render="italic">Relief</emph>. The
diary of Leonard Wood, who was selected by General Nelson A. Miles to be the
medical officer on Captain Lawton’s command, describes the expedition against
the Apaches in the Southwest.</p>

<p>The papers of Ruth Mack Brunswick (1897-1946) span the years
1921-1943, with the bulk of material dating from 1926 to 1938. The collection,
written in English and German, documents Brunswick’s contributions to
psychoanalytic theory expanding the work of her mentor, Sigmund Freud. Featured
in the papers are Brunswick’s notes and writings related to her analysis of
Sergius Pankejeff, a former analysand of Sigmund Freud and the subject of
Freud’s “Wolf Man” case study. In addition to Brunswick’s own notes are
notes and writings by Pankejeff including an extensive file of notes recording
his dreams. Writings by Brunswick contained in the collection include “A
Supplement to ‘History of an Infantile Neurosis,’” which explores her
analysis of Pankejeff between 1926 and 1927, and numerous drafts of her 1940
article “The Preoedipal Phase of the Libido Development.” Brunswick first
outlined her theories of a developmental phase preceding the Oedipal complex in
an untitled work written in 1930. The collection includes a typescript of this
early work annotated by Freud.</p>
<p> Correspondence includes letters from members of the Freud family
including Sigmund Freud’s wife and daughter, Martha Freud and Anna Freud,
letters from psychiatrist Ives Hendrick commenting on Brunswick’s pre-Oedipal
article, and two letters from Sergius Pankejeff. </p>

<p>The papers of Marie Paneth (1895-1986) span the years 1938-1968 and
include correspondence, a diary, reports, notes, writings, and children’s
artwork. The collection documents Paneth’s therapeutic use of art in working
with children who suffered traumatic experiences. Featured in the collection
are writings based on her work with children during the bombardment of London
in 1941-1942 and her postwar work with children who survived German
concentration camps. Material in the collection is written in English and
German. </p>
<p>The bulk of the collection consists of Paneth’s nonfiction and
fiction writing. Included are fragments of drafts and reviews of her book,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Branch Street</part>
</title>. The book recounts her experiences as an art
instructor in an air raid shelter in a poor section of London and explores the
emotional lives of her pupils through their artwork. Paneth’s original
reports outlining her work in the shelter are located in the subject file. Also
included in the collection is an unpublished book-length manuscript entitled
“Rock the Cradle” based on her subsequent work with children who survived
internment in German concentration camps. The children arrived in England in
1945 and were housed in a former war workers’ hostel on Lake Windermere. Most
of the children were over the age of fifteen. The largest number were born in
Poland; others were from Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Hungary. Paneth’s
manuscript relates stories told by the children about their experiences in
concentration camps, their adjustment to life in the British reception camp,
and the ways artwork provided a nonverbal outlet for their emotional trauma. A
few examples of the children’s artwork is found in the subject file. </p>
<p>Other writings in the collection concern Paneth’s theories on the
link between visual impressions expressed through drawing and the sensation and
memory of eye movement. Also included are several works of fiction including
short stories drawn from Paneth’s experiences as a doctor’s wife living in
Java and Sumatra during the interwar years. An autobiographical novel entitled
“Falschung,” written in English and German, recounts her childhood in
Vienna, Austria, her art studies with Franz Čižek, and her early married life
in the Dutch East Indies. </p>
<p>Paneth’s correspondence largely concerns her writing projects, most
notably
<title localtype="simple">

<p>The papers of John Spencer Bassett (1867-1928) span the years 1770-1978, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1894 to 1928. The collection documents Bassett's teaching
careers at Trinity College (later Duke University) in North Carolina and at Smith
College in Massachusetts; his research and writings, including his seminal biography of
Andrew Jackson and sometimes controversial writings on race relations; and his
secretaryship of the American Historical Association. The papers are arranged in eight
series: <ref target="diaj1">Diaries and Journals</ref>, <ref target="famc2">Family
Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="genc15">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="colm30">Collected Historical Manuscripts</ref>, <ref target="subf33">Subject
File</ref>, <ref target="lecs43">Lectures and Speeches</ref>, <ref target="resw47">Research and Writings</ref>, and <ref target="overs">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diaj1">Diaries and journals</ref> kept
by Bassett date between 1905 and 1927. Bassett was an inconsistent diarist who
frequently picked up and dropped the practice of recording his daily activities. For
many years, he maintained what he called a "literary record" in which he charted the
daily progress of his research and writing. During other periods, he kept a more
traditional diary in which he described conversations, interviews, meetings, colleagues,
and national events, often at great length. He began the diary in the wake of what
became known as the "Bassett Affair." In 1903, Bassett published "Stirring Up the Fires
of Race Antipathy" in the <title localtype="simple">
<part>South Atlantic Quarterly</part>
</title>, a journal he founded while teaching at Trinity College. The article and its
contention that Booker T. Washington was the greatest southerner apart from Robert E.
Lee born in the past hundred years touched off a storm of controversy led chiefly by
Josephus Daniels, editor of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Raleigh News and Observer</part>
</title>. One of the first entries in Bassett's 1905 diary records his decision to
resign as editor of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>South Atlantic Quarterly</part>
</title>. A later entry provides a detailed account of his meeting with Theodore
Roosevelt, who agreed to speak on behalf of academic freedom at a stop in Durham, North
Carolina, during his southern tour in 1905.</p>
<p>The <ref target="famc2">Family Correspondence</ref> series contains lengthy
correspondence between Bassett and his wife, Jessie Lewellin Bassett, written on an
almost daily basis during academic breaks when Bassett taught summer school, researched,
and attended American Historical Association meetings, and during Jessie Bassett's
European travels. Apart from discussing family matters, Bassett's letters relate events
and developments connected with his research, writing, and teaching. The series also
includes correspondence between the Bassetts and their children, Richard H. Bassett and
Margaret Byrd Bassett. Much of the correspondence between Richard Bassett and his
parents occurred while he was a student at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts,
1914-1915, and while he studied art in Europe. </p>
<p>The <ref target="genc15">General Correspondence</ref> spans the length of Bassett's
professional career. His early correspondence, dating from 1894 to 1906, consists
largely of incoming correspondence. Much of it concerns Bassett's early research on
North Carolina topics, such as the Regulator movement, slavery, and the antislavery
movement, and includes letters from Hinton Rowan Helper and Daniel R. Goodloe. Letters
from historian Herbert Baxter Adams reveal his ongoing mentorship after Bassett
completed his doctoral work at Johns Hopkins University. A significant portion of
Bassett's early correspondence concerns Trinity College. Bassett, who had been
considered for Trinity's presidency in 1894, promoted scholarship at Trinity through his
founding of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>South Atlantic Quarterly</part>
</title> in 1901 and his efforts to develop the library's book and manuscript holdings.
The "Bassett Affair" is discussed in some of these letters.</p>
<p>Bassett's correspondence reveals his interest in southern race relations, politics, and
educational reform. Correspondence with southern colleagues continued following
Bassett's departure from the South in 1906. Over time, however, Bassett's focus on
southern issues lessened and a greater percentage of his later correspondence concerns
his subsequent research and writing, in particular his work on Andrew Jackson, and his
administrative responsibilities with the American Historical Association and Smith
College, his interest and involvement in national politics, and his support of the
League of Nations. Prominent correspondents in the General Correspondence series include
Charles McLean Andrews, Kemp P. Battle, William Kenneth Boyd, George Washington Cable,
John Franklin Crowell, Josephus Daniels, William Edward Dodd, Robert L. Flowers, Albert
Bushnell Hart, J. Franklin Jameson, John C. Kilgo, Edwin Mims, Walter Hines Page, Ulrich
Bonnell Phillips, William Peterfield Trent, and Woodrow Wilson. </p>
<p>The papers also include a <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="colm30">collection of historical manuscripts</ref> either purchased by Bassett or given to
him by students and friends. While some of these were collected largely for their
autographs, many have greater informational value. Among the more significant
collections of papers is an exchange of letters between governors Benjamin Williams of
North Carolina, Archibald Roane of Tennessee, and William Charles Coles Claiborne of the
Mississippi Territory in 1802. These concern the extradition of Stockley Donelson and
William Tyrrell, both implicated in western land frauds. The series also contains papers
of artist Ralph E. W. Earl, who married Jane Caffery, a niece of Andrew Jackson, in
1818. Earl, who became known as "portrait painter to the king," enjoyed a close
relationship with Jackson. He resided at the White House during Jackson's presidency and
died at the Hermitage in Tennessee in 1837. Bassett also acquired papers of Henry
Watson, a lawyer, banker, and planter who left his native Connecticut in the 1830s and
settled in Alabama. Watson's diary, written between 1830 and 1831, and his
correspondence, spanning the years 1830-1871, contain numerous references to southern
life, economic conditions, politics, and sectionalism. The Watson family papers also
include correspondence from Watson's grandfather to his father while the latter was
trying to establish himself as a merchant in New York City between 1817 and 1820.
Bassett collected various literary collections such as the papers of Sidney Woollett,
Layton W. Crippen, and the publishing firm of Stone and Kimball. An alphabetical list of
prominent correspondents in this portion of the papers is appended to the register.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subf33">Subject File</ref> documents Bassett's professional
associations, political activities, and, to a lesser extent, his teaching career. The
major portion of the series pertains to Bassett's duties as secretary of the American
Historical Association from 1919 to 1928. Files relating to the organization include
correspondence, committee and executive council minutes and reports, and financial
statements. Another sizeable group of material concerns Bassett's chairmanship of a
Democratic National Committee advisory group during the 1920 presidential campaign. The
group, charged with devising general strategy for the James M. Cox-Franklin D. Roosevelt
campaign, focused most of its efforts on increasing public support for the League of
Nations. Bassett sought to influence public opinion by soliciting and publishing
articles written by prominent individuals in support of the League. The Subject File
also includes newspaper clippings pertaining to Bassett's activities at Trinity College
and correspondence, minutes, and reports relating to his teaching and administrative
duties at Smith College. Miscellaneous material includes condolence letters on Bassett's
death, notebooks, and publishing contracts.</p>
<p>Bassett's <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="lecs43">lecture files</ref>
include complete drafts of lectures, outlines, and notes. More than half of these are
identified as having been delivered at Smith College. Unidentified lectures include what
appear to be Bassett's earliest lectures, some of which are written on Trinity College
stationery. Bassett's speeches are grouped by topic since few are dated or have formal
titles. Both his speeches and his lectures are useful in tracing Bassett's views on race
relations, southern history and culture, and developments in the historical
profession.</p>
<p>The <ref target="resw47">Research and Writings</ref> series reflects Bassett's
contributions to historical research through his exploration of slavery and the
antislavery movement, plantation management, and nineteenth-century American
historiography, as well as through his biography of Andrew Jackson and editorship of
Jackson's letters. Bassett's research files include notes from his research in
manuscript repositories, conversations and interviews, and access to privately held
manuscripts. Correspondence in the research files pertains to his research on slavery in
North Carolina and the search for letters of Andrew Jackson. The writings file contains
drafts of many of Bassett's books as well as a large group of unidentified and
miscellaneous writings and a collection of literary and poetical manuscripts, many of
which pertain to southern themes.</p>

<p>The papers of the Titus Coan family span the period 1806-1923, with
the bulk from 1832 to 1882. Consisting mainly of correspondence between members
of the families of Titus Coan and his wife, Fidelia Church Coan, these letters
document the Coans' lives in Hilo, Hawaii, from 1834 to 1882 and reflect the
missionary spirit of that period. The collection organized in five series:
<ref target="diaj1">
Diaries and Journals
</ref>,
<ref target="famc2">
Family Correspondence
</ref>,
<ref target="genc14">
General Correspondence
</ref>,
<ref target="misc17">
Miscellany
</ref>, and
<ref target="prim19">
Printed Matter
</ref>.</p>
<p>Titus Coan's journals tell of his travels to distant lands in
missionary endeavors. In 1833-1834 he recorded a trip to Patagonia to explore
the possibility of mission fields in that region. Much of this journal was
published in his book <title localtype="simple">
<part>Adventures in Patagonia</part>
</title>. Journals of two trips to the Marquesas Islands made in 1860 and 1867
describe the land and its inhabitants as well as the progress of missions
there, while other journals tell of his journey and early years of residence in
Hawaii, where he served for over forty-five years. These experiences were
further amplified in his autobiography, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Life in Hawaii</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>The Coans' correspondence is primarily with family members, including
their daughter, Harriet Fidelia Coan, a teacher at Punahou, Hawaii, and their
son, Samuel Latimer Coan, who was living in San Francisco in the late 1860s and
the 1870s, and describes the day-to-day events of their lives. Other
correspondence relating to missionary work is that with Fidelia Coan's sister,
Maria Church Robinson, who served with her husband as missionary to Siam from
1834 to 1847, at the same time that the Coans were beginning their service in
Hawaii.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="genc14">
General Correspondence
</ref> series also reflects
the religious feeling and missionary endeavors of the period. The Coans
corresponded with other missionaries in the Hawaiian Islands and with friends
at home, many of whom were active in societies that supported such work.
Correspondents include Sophie Madeleine Du Pont (wife of Admiral Samuel Francis
Du Pont), Chester Smith Lyman, Mary Oliphant, and Sara Oliphant.</p>
<p>An extensive collection of printed matter is preserved with the
collection. Much of this constitutes, in effect, an article file for Titus Coan
consisting of journals to which he contributed. He was particularly interested
in volcanoes and wrote many observations on the eruptions of Kilauea, the
volcano on the slope of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii. These he contributed
to the <title localtype="simple">
<part>American Journal of Science and Arts</part>
</title>. He also contributed extensively to missionary journals such as <title localtype="simple">

<p>The papers of Otto Fleischmann (1896-1963) span the years 1910-1985,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1936 to 1960. The papers are in
English, German, Hungarian, Russian, and Swedish and are organized
alphabetically by subject matter and type of material. </p>
<p>Fleischmann had a long friendly relationship with Anna Freud, and the
papers include many letters from her as well as writings, both published and
unpublished. She also is represented in a file of photographs. Many photographs
are from conferences, but one folder contains informal snapshots of
Fleischmann, Freud, and August Aichhorn while in Lausanne, Switzerland, in
1948.</p>
<p>Also of special interest are the papers from Fleischmann's time in
Budapest, Hungary, during World War II. Included are documents provided by
Raoul Wallenberg at the Swedish Foreign Ministry to Fleischmann that protected
him from German Nazi authorities in 1944, including a photostatic copy of his
"Schutz-Pass." There are photographs of Fleischmann and Wallenberg and
documents and lists from Fleischmann's work with Wallenberg. Also in the papers
are documents written by Fleischmann to Soviet and Hungarian authorities after
the disappearance of Wallenberg in January of 1945. Other documents refer to
Pál Szalai, the high-ranking member of the Budapest police force who helped
Wallenberg in his efforts to save the Jews of Budapest.</p>
<p>The papers include a multivolume handwritten manuscript by the German
philosopher Moritz Schlick (1882-1936). The title varies from volume to volume,
but the first volume's title is "Natur, Kultur, Kunst." Schlick was one of the
first to make the work of physicist Albert Einstein popularly understood.</p>
<p>Material relating to Sigmund Freud consists primarily of funeral
orations, a medical case history, newspaper clippings, and miscellaneous
material. However, there is one folder of photostatic copies of documents
written by Freud.</p>
<p>Material from Fleischmann's time spent in the United States concerns
his book and journal collections and a 1959 American Psychoanalytic Association
panel on male homosexuality.</p>

<p>The papers of Charles Julius Allen (1840-1915) and Grace Elizabeth
Allen (1886-1976), father and daughter, span the years 1865-1976 and consist of
correspondence, diaries, family histories, personal reminiscences, notes,
clippings, and printed matter.</p>
<p>Charles Allen, a brigadier general on his retirement, spent much of
his life in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. His papers contain
correspondence and other items from his Civil War service, plus later material
that he retained and collected as part of an unpublished Allen family history.
Included are personal reminiscences of Allen’s life in the military,
especially as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, as an engineer in
the army corps of engineers, and during the Civil War at Mobile Bay, Alabama,
August 1864, and in the Mobile Campaign, March-April 1865.</p>
<p>The papers of Grace Allen consist mainly of diaries started by her
parents in her infancy and kept throughout her life. They include references to
her service with the American Red Cross, to Washington, D.C., and New York
social life, including observations about Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson, to her world travels, and to various world, national, and local
affairs. Also included are letters from George S. Patton (1885-1945), with whom
the Allen family had a long association, written during World War II.</p>

<p>The papers of Lewis Muhlenberg Haupt (1844-1937) span the years,
1849-1923, with the bulk of the items dating from 1892 to 1903. A majority of
the collection concerns Haupt’s work for the Nicaraguan Canal Commission and
the Isthmian Canal Commission and his attempts to secure the Nicaraguan Canal.
The papers are in English and are organized into the following series:

<p> The

Haupt was an advocate of the Nicaraguan route rather than the Panamanian, and
lobbied for the former. Correspondence about his lobbying efforts are found in
his letters to Senator John Tyler Morgan, the Senate advocate of the Nicaraguan
route, and Theodore C. Search, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers. The letters are arranged chronologically with an indexed
letterbook for 1900 at the end of the correspondence. </p>

conjectural papers written for the commission by its members on the cost of
building the canal, projected income and profits, and expected usage. The
drawings and charts contain Haupt’s projection of the Nicaraguan route and a
map of the route printed in a contemporary journal.</p>

<p>The papers of George Eugene Belknap (1832-1903) span the years
1857-1903, and consist of correspondence, speeches, articles, and miscellaneous
material. The papers reflect Belknap’s naval career including duty in the
barrier forts at Canton, China, in the 1850s, combat duty in the Civil War, a
tour of duty in Hawaii, and his command of the Asiatic Fleet. His interest in
hydrographical and oceanographical matters as well as contemporary social,
political, and economic questions is demonstrated by correspondence with his
colleagues. Principal among these are Daniel Ammen, John M. Brooke, Caspar F.
Goodrich, Samuel W. Lowell, George Collier Remey, John A. Riddle, and Francis
Asbury Roe. There is also a grouping of notes and memoranda apparently intended
for use in an autobiography, some research in Belknap family genealogy, a small
amount of family correspondence, and recollections and writings about the

<p>The Miscellaneous Papers in the Sigmund Freud Collection span the
years 1866-1983, with the bulk of material dating from 1908 to 1957. The papers
are in German, English, and French and contain writings, organizational

psychoanalytic theory, the history of psychoanalysis, and the work of
individual psychoanalysts. Among the psychoanalytic organizations represented
are the Association des Psychanalystes de Belgique, the Deutsche
Psychoanalytische Gesellschaft, and the Psychological Center, a psychoanalytic
training institute founded by Otto Rank in Paris in 1934. Articles on
psychoanalytic theory are by Otto Gross, René Laforgue, and Oskar Pfister. The
work of Josine Müller and Lili E. Peller, among others, is explored in
memorials and biographical material.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="micro">

series features reproductions of Josef Breuer’s correspondence with family and
colleagues, correspondence and drafts of writings by Paul Federn, letters
received by Eduard Hitschmann from Sigmund Freud, and Emil Oberholzer’s
correspondence with fellow psychoanalysts. The Freud family is represented in
correspondence with Alexander and Harry Freud, Sigmund Freud’s brother and
nephew. Other microfilmed material includes minutes from meetings of the Wiener
Psychoanalytische Vereinigung, Josef Gicklhorn’s research on Sigmund Freud, and
a scrapbook assembled on Freud by Isador H. Coriat. The Sigmund Freud Archives
subsequently donated originals or facsimiles of the same material to other
collections of papers within the Sigmund Freud Collection. Exceptions are Emil
Oberholzer’s correspondence and Isador H. Coriat’s scrapbook which exist at the

<p>The microfilm of the papers of David Homer Bates (1843-1926) spans the
years 1837-1926 and consists of reproductions of collected items as well as the
personal papers of Bates that comprise part of the Alfred Whital Stern
Collection of Lincolniana in the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of
the Library. Included are a diary, correspondence, facsimiles, photographs,
newspaper clippings, printed matter, and drafts and annotated proof sheets of

<p>Notable among the collected items are eleven Abraham Lincoln
manuscripts and single letters of such Civil War commanders as Robert E. Lee,
James Lawson Kemper, Edmund Kirby-Smith, Richard Stoddert Ewell, and Jefferson
Columbus Davis.</p>
<p>Among the personal papers is a diary and daily journal kept by Bates
for the period November 1863 to June 1865, while he served as manager of the
War Department telegraph office in Washington, D.C. This volume is of
importance as a record of military intelligence activities in the Civil War and
is of further interest because of the manner in which the day-to-day narrative
reveals the significance of telegraphic communication in the area of military
science. Also included in the personal papers are letters of Andrew Carnegie,
Thomas Thompson Eckert, and Robert Todd Lincoln. There are also some retained
copies of letters written by Bates.</p>

<p>The papers of the Howard-von Recum family span the years 1869-1972,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1881 to 1955. The papers document the
lives of a British diplomat and his family from the late nineteenth century,
through two world wars, and into the 1950s. The papers are in English, German,
and French and are organized into the following series:

were kept by Sir Henry Howard (1843-1921) and his daughter Baroness Marie
Ernestine Howard von Recum (1868-1954), with a few diary pages kept during 1914
by Lizzie Walker, a household maid. The diaries of Sir Henry Howard cover his
diplomatic career from 1881 until his death. Some of the diaries sustained
damage while others were lost completely during a warehouse fire in 1919. His
diaries, also containing reminiscences, clippings, postcards, and ephemera, are
complete for the two peace conferences he attended at Hague, Netherlands, his
Peking, China, appointment from 1887-1890, and his posting to the Vatican
during World War I. Events before 1881 are covered in letters to his parents
especially since his father had also been a diplomat.</p>
<p>The diaries of Baroness Marie Ernestine Howard von Recum cover her
years as a teenager posted with her family to various countries, her marriage
to the German aristocrat Baron Rudolf von Recum, and the beginning of World War
I. Her diaries, interleaved with photographs, clippings, and ephemera, document
her family life and social and world events. The diaries may cease in 1914
because the baroness was held in protective custody by the German government
during World War I.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
Correspondence
</ref> documents the diplomatic life of both Sir
Henry Howard and his family, the separation of family members on different
sides during the world wars, and provides a glimpse into the lives of
interrelated British, German, and French aristocrats. Correspondents include
Sir Henry Howard, his wife Lady Cecilia Riggs Howard (1844-1907), and their
children Alice Lawrason Howard (1876-1942), George Howard (1869-1919), Henry
Mowbray Howard (1873-1953) known as "Pompey," Janet Madeleine Cecilia Howard
(1871-1960) known as "Jessie," and Baroness Marie Ernestine Howard von Recum
known as "Da." Other family members with correspondence in the papers include
Franz von Recum (1906-1974), Alice L. Riggs (1840-1927), Jane Agnes Riggs
(1854-1930), and other members of the Riggs family. The correspondence is
arranged as it was received in three-ring binders. Although the binders are
labeled as to the person and dates of correspondence enclosed, the labels do
not always reflect all the persons or dates contained in a binder. At the end
of the correspondence is a volume on Howard genealogy.</p>

<p>The papers of William Short (1759-1849) span the years 1778-1853. They
include a large amount of material dated between 1785 and 1795, the years of
Short’s diplomatic service in western Europe, as well as extensive
documentation of his business activities after 1810. His papers consist chiefly
of letters received, but there are also some copies of letters sent, 1785-1798,
as well as various financial papers, including statements, receipts,
checkbooks, and ledgers. Much of his correspondence while he was in Europe is
with American diplomatic and political figures. There are also letters during
this period from various European officials, chiefly in French or Spanish. The
collection is organized in

<p> In 1790 Alexander Hamilton entrusted Short with the negotiation and
management of European loans to fund the public debt of the United States, and
the two men conducted an extensive correspondence on the subject. Other topics
in Short’s correspondence during his European years are conditions in
Virginia under the Articles of Confederation, the events of the French
Revolution, and incidents pertaining to American diplomatic relations with
France and Spain. Short’s correspondence reveals the obstacles to the conduct
of foreign relations resulting from the vagaries of trans-Atlantic
communication in that era. While residing in Paris following his diplomatic
service, and again following his abortive mission to Russia (the Senate refused
to confirm the nomination of any minister to Saint Petersburg), Short
established a wide circle of foreign friends, with whom he conducted a
correspondence for many years thereafter, chiefly in French.</p>
<p> After his return to the United States in 1810, Short successfully
pursued a career in investments that resulted eventually in a personal fortune
of over one million dollars. He speculated in land in Ohio, Kentucky, and
western New York and Virginia; he bought stock in canals, railroads, and banks;
he held mortgages and loaned large sums at interest. His Dutch bankers
speculated in American bonds on his account. These varied business activities
required an extensive correspondence with his land agents (including his
nephew, John Cleves Short), bankers, stockbrokers, and debtors. In addition to
these letters, his business papers also include bills, accounts, financial
statements, checkbooks, and ledgers. Short’s business papers provide
considerable insight into the business practices and problems of an investor in
the first half of the nineteenth century. They also include some information on
Short’s moral and financial support of the program of the American
Colonization Society. </p>
<p>A significant number of Short’s papers consist of his correspondence
with Thomas Jefferson, who was, variously, his employer, adviser, and friend.
Other correspondents of note include John Adams, James Madison, James Monroe (a
classmate at William and Mary), Alexander Hamilton, Albert Gallatin, Don Diego
de Gardoqui, Manuel de Godoy, the marquis de Lafayette, Alexis de Tocqueville,
Michel-Guillaume St. Jean de Crévecoeur, Thomas Paine, William Carmichael,
William Grayson, Fulwar Skipwith (his nephew), Gouverneur Morris, John
Rutledge, Bushrod Washington, Nicholas Trist, Robert Fulton, Edmund Randolph,
Thomas Pinckney, Issac Hull, and two Virginia friends, William Nelson and Merit
Robinson. There are also a few letters from his nephew, Charles W. Short, a
prominent botanist, and other members of his family. </p>

<p>The papers of Charles Bowdoin Fillebrown (1842-1917) span the years
1879-1928 with the bulk of the material dating between 1897 and 1917. The
correspondence relates chiefly to Fillebrown's promotion of the single tax
concept. Correspondents include Thomas Nixon Carver, John Bates Clark, John R.
Commons, Richard T. Ely, Frank A. Fetter, Max Hirsch, Alvin Saunders Johnson,
J. Shield Nicholson, Carl C. Plehn, Edwin R. A. Seligman, F. W. Taussig,
Carroll Davidson Wright, and Allyn Abbott Young. As part of his effort to build
support for the single tax among mainstream academia, Fillebrown sent out a
questionnaire on the subject to three hundred professors of political economy.
The collection contains 165 responses. Also included are papers relating to the
Massachusetts Single Tax League of which Fillebrown was president for many
years. They consist chiefly of correspondence, speeches, and printed matter.

<p>Charles Chaillé-Long (1842-1907) was perhaps best known as a soldier, explorer, and
first person from the United States to visit and document Lake Ibrahim in the Nile
Valley in 1874, and his papers document his African experiences as well as some of his
activities as writer, lecturer, practitioner of international law, and diplomat. The
majority of the papers are related to the period in the 1870s and 1880s when
Chaillé-Long was in Egypt, although the collection as a whole covers the period from
1863 to 1918, with the exception of two letters from Winfield Scott (1786-1866) to A.
Porter in 1809-1910. The Scott letters may have come from the Chaillé-Long family or may
have been used by Chaillé-Long in his historical studies.</p>
<p> The collection consists of <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfil">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speecwrit">Speeches and Writings</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscell">Miscellany</ref> series, but the papers are
limited in both scope and amplitude. Although Chaillé-Long family history is documented
in applications to the Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and in
biographical articles, there are no other references to Chaillé-Long's childhood or
family. There are only a few documents from his service in the Civil War, from his
practice in international law, and from his tour as consul general in Korea. Many of the
papers relate to his attempt to secure an appointment in the United States Foreign
Service, to obtain remuneration from the Egyptian government, or to qualify for an army
pension in 1907. Consequently, his activities as an officer in the army of Ismail,
Khédive of Egypt (1870-1877) and as temporary United States consul during the
bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 by the British are well documented. His writings about
his experiences in Africa and in the Far East are incomplete but are well represented in
the collection, both in manuscript and printed form.</p>
<p> The collection provides source material for studies in the late nineteenth-century
history of the Nile Valley, including personal studies of Charles George Gordon and of
the Khédive, as well as comments on Egyptian society and the explorations and explorers
of the time. Some source material is also included on China in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Most of the material reflects Chaillé-Long's personal view of
the times, his comments on the diplomatic service, foreign affairs, and the peoples of
alien lands from the point of view of one who was outside the State Department's scope
of activities.</p>
<p> Papers in the collection are primarily in English, but many are in French, and a few
are in Italian, Arabic, Turkish, and Japanese. Turkish documents include Chaillé-Long's
military promotion in the Khédive's army and his decorations by Abdul Mejid, Sultan of
Turkey. Included also is a Japanese biography of Chaillé-Long that was written at the
time of his diplomatic service in Korea.</p>
<p> Scattered throughout the collection are documents relating to awards and memberships,
to the French Legion of Honor, presidential appointments from Grover Cleveland,
appearances before various geographical and historical societies, the masonic order, law
degrees, and qualification and appointment papers. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres">General
Correspondence</ref> series treats social as well as professional issues and affairs,
with many letters of testimonial concerning Chaillé-Long's activities in Egypt in the
1880s. A few copies of Chaillé-Long's own letters are included in this series, as well
as in other series. Among the significant correspondents in the collection are D. F.
Ardouin, Oreste Baratieri, Baron Charles William de la Poer Beresford, Montgomery Blair,
Sue Virginia Field, J. C. Aristide Gavillot, Paul Giraud, J. J. Jusserand, Ismail,
Khédive of Egypt, Charles Marie le Myre de Vilers, Paul H. Orillat, Edward Dean Proctor,
Paul Taillet, and Henry Vignaud.</p>
<p> The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfil">Subject File</ref> includes
correspondence of a routine nature concerning the organizations with which Chaillé-Long
was affiliated, certificates of memberships, awards or honors, member activities, and
military records. Also in the file is biographical, bibliographical, and genealogical
material. </p>
<p>Files in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speecwrit">Speeches and

government, history, art, social conditions, and ethnology in Japan made while Murray
was superintending the educational reform of the country. It also contains addresses and
scholarly papers based on the notes; letters written from Japan by David or his wife,
Martha A. Nielson Murray, to relatives in the United States; and addresses and papers on

<p>The papers of the Shippen family span the years 1671-1936. They consist of
correspondence, diaries, account books, memorandum books, legal and business papers,
indentures, and miscellaneous papers. Family members primarily represented include
William Shippen Jr. (1736-1808); his wife Alice Lee Shippen (1736-1817); their children
Anne ("Nancy") Home (or Hume) Shippen Livingston (1763-1841) and Thomas Lee Shippen
(1765-1798); and William's father, William Shippen Sr. (1712-1801) Papers of the
Nicholson family (1671-1860) are also included. The collection is organized in six
series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diarandjourn">Diaries and
Journals</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fampap">Family

</p>
<p>The papers chiefly document the family of William Shippen Jr. They reflect the family’s
experiences during the Revolutionary War, their participation in the Philadelphia social
circle that surrounded George Washington during his presidency, and the family’s
engagement with national politics. They cover William Shippen Jr.’s medical practice,
the family’s dealings in Philadelphia real estate, the administration of family estates,
and the private lives of family members. The papers are notable for their documentation
of the lives of the women of the family, in diaries, letters, and such ephemera as
embroidery patterns. Correspondence with and material from members of the Carter, Lee,
Nicholson, Roberdeau, other families, some of whom are related, is included.</p>
<p>Correspondents of note include Thomas Jefferson, Francis Scott Key (to Rebecca
Nicholson), James Madison (1749-1812), Richard Rush (who appears to have administered
the estates of William Shippen Jr. and his son, Thomas Lee Shippen), William Short, and
George Washington (two letters to William Shippen Jr, May 3, 1777, and May 7, 1789).</p>
<p>Ann ("Nancy") Home Shippen Livingston’s life is documented by diaries, correspondence,
and letterbooks. These document her romance with French diplomat Louis-Guillaume Otto,
comte de Mosloy, her unhappy marriage to Henry Beekman Livingston, her separation from
Livingston and loss of custody of her child, Margaret "Peggy" Beekman Livingston, her
observations on women’s position in society, her life in and around Philadelphia,
travels to New York to see her daughter, and more. Her correspondence is with her
parents, husband, daughter, uncles Arthur Lee and Richard Henry Lee, and members of the
Livingston family.</p>
<p>The diaries and correspondence of Thomas Lee Shippen document his travels in Europe
during the 1780s, and subsequent family life until his death in 1798. Correspondence of
his wife, Elizabeth Carter (Farley) Bannister Shippen, is also included. (A young widow
at the time of their marriage, Elizabeth Shippen married George Izard after Thomas Lee
Shippen's death.) Thomas Lee Shippen’s correspondence includes letters from Thomas
Jefferson advising him on his European travels, including a detailed itinerary, dated
June 19, 1788. There is substantial correspondence on political and family topics
between members of the family and Alice Lee Shippen’s brothers, particularly diplomat
Arthur Lee and Revolutionary War figure and United States Senator Richard Henry Lee.
Alice Lee Shippen’s correspondence is largely to her children and to her niece, Lucy
Carter.</p>
<p>Also included is a substantial group of papers of Joseph Hopper Nicholson (1770-1817), a
Maryland congressman (1799-1806) and subsequently a judge; his wife, Rebecca Lloyd
Nicholson; father, Joseph Nicholson Jr., and other members of their family. Joseph
Hopper Nicholson’s correspondence includes letters from congressional colleagues,
including Nathaniel Macon, John Randolph, and C. A. Rodney. There are also letters from
Frances Few, niece of Hannah Nicholson Gallatin and Albert Gallatin.</p>
<p>Two oversized account books, 1763-1776 and 1776-1793, maintained by William Shippen Jr.,
contain, among his routine household accounts, records of his medical practice,
including purchases of drugs and payments from patients with brief notes on their
conditions. Shippen’s correspondence includes letters concerning his hospital post
during the Revolutionary War, and exchanges with his children, Edward Shippen, and
others.</p>

<p>The papers of Lewis Tappan (1788-1873) span the years 1809-1903, with the bulk dating
from 1809 to 1872. The collection consists of correspondence, letterbooks, journals,
notebooks, clippings, photocopies, notes, and miscellaneous other items. The journals
and notebooks, which date from 1841 to 1869, are replete with information concerning
Tappan’s activities in the antislavery movement and contribute as well to an
understanding of his private life, particularly his religious views. The collection is
organized in the following series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="journandnot">Journals and Notebooks,</ref>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">Correspondence,</ref>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscell">Miscellany,</ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="add">Additions</ref>.</p>
<p> The bulk of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">
correspondence</ref> in the Lewis Tappan papers is made up of copies of his outgoing
letters, ranging in date from 1812 to 1870. Legibility of many of these copies is poor,
and there are a number of gaps in the chronology. Nine of the volumes include indexes to
correspondents. Incoming correspondence, although limited in quantity, covers the period
1809-1871. Subject matter throughout Tappan’s correspondence strongly reflects his
interest in antislavery activities and his participation in organizations that promoted
abolition. </p>
<p>Tappan’s exposure to Calvinist and Unitarian theology is reflected in his <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">journals</ref> by comments on
ministers and the themes of their sermons. Also evident in the journals, which contain
numerous newspaper clippings, and in his correspondence, is Tappan’s involvement in
promoting his ideas through Bible, tract, peace, abolition, and missionary societies,
and through Sunday schools, free churches, charitable organizations, political parties,
and newspapers. Prominent among the organizations represented are the American and
Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, the American Bible Society, the American Colonization
Society, the American Missionary Association, the Union Missionary Society, and the
Liberty Party. The <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Journal of Commerce</part>
</title>, the <title localtype="simple">
<part>National Era</part>
</title>, and the <title localtype="simple">
<part>American Missionary</part>
</title> are among the publications with which Tappan was involved. Slavery,
colonization, education of African Americans, and the role of the Christian in the
abolition movement dominate the writings dating from 1836. Some of the leading issues
discussed are the annexation of Texas and the moves taken for the release from custody
of the African captives who had mutinied aboard the Spanish schooner <emph render="italic">Amistad</emph>. Of special interest is Tappan’s journal of the
General Anti-slavery Convention of 1843 in London, England. </p>
<p>A small portion of the collection deals with Tappan’s business ventures, particularly
his Mercantile Agency, the first commercial credit-rating agency in the United States.
Throughout the papers there is documentation of routine family activities of the various
members of the Tappan family, as well as of their interaction on matters of mutual
concern, particularly where business, religion, and abolition were involved.</p>
<p> Prominent correspondents include John Quincy Adams, James Gillespie Birney, Frederick
Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Seth Merrill Gates, Samuel D. Hastings, William Jay,
Joshua Leavitt, Amos A. Phelps, Theodore Sedgwick, Joseph Sturge, and John Greenleaf
Whittier. Lewis Tappan’s brothers, Benjamin and Arthur, are well represented in the
collection as well as other members of the Tappan and Aspinwall families.</p>
<p> In addition to original manuscripts, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="photo">photocopies</ref> of Tappan items in other repositories—notably from
papers in the Oberlin College Library—are present in the collection. Most of these
copies fall between 1831 and 1841, and consist of letters of Arthur and Lewis Tappan to
John J. Shipherd, Charles G. Finney, and Samuel D. Hastings. They deal mainly with the
Tappan brothers’ involvement in, and financial support of, religious movements in New
York City and at Oberlin College.</p>
<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscell">Miscellaneous</ref> items
include John Quincy Adams’s holograph draft of a legal brief pleading for release of the
<emph render="italic">Amistad</emph> captives, autobiographical notes, genealogical
material on the Tappan and Aspinwall families, and a lecture by Theodore Weld. Writings,
notes, and other miscellaneous items relating to slavery include a list of articles on
emancipation by Lewis Tappan, a list of antislavery hymns, a copy of a deed of
manumission, an article by Ansel Bascom, and materials on the expurgation of references
to slavery in published works.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="add">Additions</ref> consist of a
letter of 1857 by Tappan to Henry A. Miles reflecting on his religious beliefs, and a
letter of 1847 by Tappan expressing condolonces to Eliza Scott on the death of her
husband, Orange Scott.</p>

<p>The records of the Center for a Woman’s Own Name span the years 1956-2008, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1972 to 1985. The collection is comprised primarily of
correspondence but also includes administrative files, clippings, legal files,
promotional materials, and publications. The papers are in English and are organized
into the following four series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state">State
File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="CCP">Consumer Credit
Project</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">Miscellany</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">Correspondence</ref> series
documents both public and private reactions to Tepper’s name change petition and her
initial efforts to gather information and resources to form the Center. The Tepper's
correspondence with her family includes letters between Tepper and her mother-in-law,
Idelle Weiner, along with Tepper’s personal narrative detailing the impact Tepper’s name
change had on their relationship. The correspondence between Priscilla Ruth MacDougall
and Tepper reflects the development of the Center’s mission and strategy as well as
MacDougall’s analysis of legal cases and opinions. The series contains both incoming and
outgoing correspondence, primarily between MacDougall and Tepper. Notable correspondents
in this series include Brenda Feigen, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elissa Krauss, and Kathleen
Willert Peratis who represent organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union
Women’s Rights Project, the Lucy Stone League, National Organization for Women, and
Women’s Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state">State File</ref> comprises
the bulk of the collection and consists primarily of correspondence. The series contains
a master file of attorney general opinions and state legislative councils; therein, the
series is organized alphabetically by state. The material in this series was used by
Tepper to track each state’s recent legal opinions and legislation. The volunteers
correspondence contains letters from individuals and organizations that act as contacts
in each state. Their duties included providing the Center with updates on state
legislation and lawsuits and distributing the Center's fact sheets and informational
pamphlets. The material in this series complements the general correspondence from the
Correspondence series as many of these individuals and organizations initially contacted
Tepper to request information on name change law.</p>
<p>Notable correspondents include Joan F. Kessler, Jean L. King, Ann Landers, Kathryn
Scates Levedahl, Pat Montandon, the Olympia Brown League, The Playboy Foundation, Sylvia
Roberts, Bernice Sandler, Sheila Cabral Sousa, Una Stannard, Abigail Van Buren, Amy
Vanderbilt, and Sarah Ragle Weddington. The series also includes correspondence from
name change petitioners Kathleen R. Harney, Judith Natale Montage, and Anne H. Takemoto
as well as those who used common law to establish their legal names such as Kathy Ann
Sheley.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state">State File</ref> demonstrates
the wide reaching network of individuals and organizations supporting a woman’s right to
determine her own name as well as the disagreements among supporters regarding the best
method and strategy to ensure this right. The series is especially rich in personal
narratives, women expressing the connection between their names and their sense of
identity and autonomy. These narratives illustrate the way state laws, institutional
policies, bureaucratic barriers, and personal bias impacted women on a practical level,
affecting their ability to file tax returns and obtain identification and credit. The
realization that many women lost their credit history after they took their husband’s
name and were often unable to obtain credit under their own name after marriage led
Tepper to create the Consumer Credit Project.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="CCP">Consumer Credit Project</ref>
series contains administrative files, clippings, correspondence, credit discrimination
complaints, credit surveys, legal files, promotional materials, publications, and other
writings. The series documents the Project’s efforts to educate women about their credit
rights and to help those who had faced discriminatory credit practices.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">Miscellany</ref> series
includes administrative files, announcements, clippings, legal files, promotional
material, publications, and a scrapbook. The historical file includes an essay by Tepper
chronicling her decision to file the name change petition and the creation of the
Center. The legal file consists chiefly of material from Lawrence Jay Weiner, an
attorney and Tepper’s husband, who represented Tepper and several other women in their
name change petitions. This series also contains MacDougall’s published writings on
women and name change law.</p>

<p>The papers of Kathleen Scofield (“Katie”) Louchheim (1903-1991) span the years
1906-1991, with the bulk of material dating from 1942 to 1968. The collection documents
Louchheim's prominence in Democratic Party politics, including her tenure as vice
chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960, and her Department of
State appointments as deputy assistant secretary for public affairs, 1962-1963,
community advisory services, 1963-1966, and educational and cultural affairs, 1966-1968.
The collection includes family papers, general correspondence, journals, social
calendars, subject files, interviews, speeches and writings, photographs, memorabilia,
and scrapbooks arranged in eleven series: <ref target="famp1">Family Papers</ref>, <ref target="genc3">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="subf8">Subject File</ref>,
<ref target="spef40">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="scra56">Scrapbooks</ref>, <ref target="addi56">1978 Addition</ref>, <ref target="addi61">1986 Addition</ref>, <ref target="addi76">1997 Addition</ref>, <ref target="addi81">2010 Addition</ref>, <ref target="class1">Classified</ref>, and <ref target="over1">Oversize</ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="famp1">Family Papers</ref> consist largely of letters to and from
family members and include some of the collection's earliest letters from Louchheim,
largely to her husband, Walter C. Louchheim, and mother, Adele Joseph Scofield, between
1926 and 1961. The series also contains letters from Walter Louchheim while attending
the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. The papers of Adele Joseph Scofield reflect her
numerous charitable activities and interest in politics. </p>
<p>The <ref target="genc3">General Correspondence</ref> series documents Louchheim's
involvement in Democratic Party activities, her State Department tenure, and the social
life of Washington, D.C. Correspondents include Barry Bingham, Mary Caperton Bingham,
Hale Boggs, Lindy Boggs, Bennett Cerf, Albert Gore (1907-1998), Pauline La Fon Gore,
Florence Jaffray Hurst Harriman, Hubert H. Humphery, Lady Bird Johnson, Abigail Q.
McCarthy, Eugene J. McCarthy, Stephen A. Mitchell, Sam Rayburn, Edwin O. Reischauer,
Haru Matsukata Reischauer, Bess Wallace Truman, and Charles E. Wyzanski. There are also
personal notes from presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson
and from Adlai E. Stevenson (1900-1965).</p>
<p>The <ref target="subf8">Subject File</ref> concerns positions held by Louchheim with the
Democratic National Committee and the State Department as well as her association with
various committees and organizations. The largest segment pertains to her years at the
State Department from 1961 to 1968 and details her involvement with special welfare
projects abroad, her endeavors to enlist the interest and support of women and women's
organizations in international cultural affairs, her efforts to increase contact between
the department and the American public, and her oversight of community relations with
foreign visitors, exchange programs, foreign student affairs, and foreign service
specialist programs. </p>
<p>Material in the <ref target="subf8">Subject File</ref> relating to the Democratic
National Committee provides insight into grassroots and national politics, especially
women's activities. The series also concerns Louchheim's postwar work with displaced
persons and refugees with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration
(UNRRA) and her membership on Lady Bird Johnson's Committee for a More Beautiful Capital
during the 1960s. Other information on the UNRRA can be found in the Speeches and
Writings and the <ref target="famp1">Family Papers</ref> series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="spef40">Speech and Writings</ref> series includes drafts and publicity
copies of speeches, correspondence, travel arrangements, press releases, and clippings.
Included are speeches delivered by Louchheim for the Democratic National Committee and
for Democratic candidates throughout the country. Her speeches on behalf of the State
Department explore aspects of official policies, women's activities, volunteer programs,
beautification projects, foreign affairs, educational and cultural programs, and the
department's activities at home and abroad. In foreign countries, Louchheim was called
upon most frequently to speak about the status, employment, and rights of American
women. </p>
<p>Many of Louchheim's published and unpublished writings relate to social and political
life of the nation's capital. "Protocol in Washington," an unpublished book-length
manuscript, includes interview material with prominent Washington hostesses of the late
1940s. Her political memoirs were published as <title localtype="simple">
<part>By the Political Sea</part>
</title>. Several short stories and plays further explore the interplay between
Washington's social and political life. The series also includes Louchheim's poetry,
most notably a collection published under the title, <title localtype="simple">
<part>With or Without Roses.</part>
</title> Correspondence from publishers, editors, fans, critics, and friends in the
publishing field is also included. </p>
<p>The <ref target="addi56">1978</ref> and <ref target="addi61">1986</ref> Additions
contain family papers, general correspondence, subject files, and speeches and writings.
Many of the same correspondents listed in the General Correspondence and Subject File
series, including Walter H. Annenberg, Evangeline Bruce, Angier Biddle Duke, Robin
Chandler Lynn Duke, India Edwards, and Henry Ehrlich, can be found in these series as
well. Also included are files on Louchheim's work in the State Department, Unesco, and
UNRRA, as well as some of her speeches and writings. The <ref target="addi61">1986
Addition</ref> contains photographs and additional scrapbooks. </p>
<p>The <ref target="addi76">1997 Addition</ref> includes journals kept by Louchheim from
1942 to 1981 describing life in wartime Washington, Democratic Party campaigns and
conventions during the 1950s and 1960s, and Louchheim's State Department positions. Her
descriptions of Washington's social and political life constitute the largest part of
the journals. The volumes, many of which include partial indexes, contain accounts of
political figures, many of whom were Louchheim's close friends. Frequently mentioned and
quoted are Paul M. Butler, Liz Carpenter, William O. Douglas, Albert Gore (1907-1998),
Florence Jaffray Hurst Harriman, Hubert H. Humphrey, Lyndon B. Johnson, Lady Bird
Johnson, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Eugene J. McCarthy, James Reston, Dean
Rusk, Theodore Sorensen, Adlai E. Stevenson, and Harry S. Truman. Interviews conducted
by Louchheim in 1985 and 1986 for a book on prominent women include Kitty Carlisle,
Betty Furness, and Constance Baker Motley. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addi81">2010 Addition</ref> consists of political campaign buttons and other
memorabilia. </p>

<p>The papers of Samuel Dash (1925-2004) span the years 1748-2004, with
the bulk of the material dating from 1965 to 2002. The papers are in English
and are organized into the following series:
<ref target="conc1">
Consultations and Cases
</ref>,
<ref target="govi58">
Government Investigations
</ref>,
<ref target="orgc105">

</ref>,
<ref target="tops1">
Top Secret
</ref>, and
<ref target="seni1">
Sensitive Compartmented Information
</ref>.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="conc1">
Consultations and Cases
</ref> file contains
material related to legal matters where Dash acted as an expert witness,
mediator, lawyer, or as an ethics consultant to various legal firms, individual
lawyers, and governments. Of note is his work regarding asbestos and tobacco
litigation cases, United States House and Senate investigative committees, the
Independent Counsel Act, the attorney general and government of Puerto Rico,
Pete Rose in <emph render="italic">Rose v. Giamatti</emph>, and James J.
Curran, Jr., in <emph render="italic">United States v. Curran</emph>.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="govi58">
Government Investigations
</ref> series includes
material related to Richard M. Nixon and the Watergate Affair, murder incidents
at Cerro Maravilla in Puerto Rico, the impeachment inquiry of Governor Bill
Sheffield of Alaska, and the Whitewater Inquiry into Bill and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. From 1973 to 1974, Dash served as the chief counsel and staff director
of the United States Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign
Activities investigating President Richard M. Nixon and his closest advisors in
what became known as the Watergate Affair. Dash's files consist of legal
documents, reports, newspaper clippings, photographs, and interviews. A large
body of correspondence mostly from the public also contains letters from
committee members and attorneys. In 1984, Dash became the special counsel to
the president of the senate of Puerto Rico during a reinvestigation of the 1978
Cerro Maravilla incident where two Puerto Rican independence advocates were
murdered. His files include correspondence, memoranda, interviews, as well as
material related to the Freedom of Information Act request that grew into the
case <emph render="italic">Senate of Puerto Rico ex rel. Judiciary Committee v.
United States Department of Justice</emph>. In 1985, Dash served as the chief
counsel to the Alaska state senate during its impeachment inquiry of Governor
Sheffield regarding a multi-million dollar lease agreement with one of
Sheffield's friends. Dash's files include correspondence, grand jury material,
interviews, statements, and transcripts. From 1994 until 1998, Dash was the
ethics advisor to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr during the Whitewater
Inquiry involving the real estate dealings of President Bill Clinton, his wife
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their former associates in Arkansas. Dash and Starr
also dealt with the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the
independent counsel's recommendation that the president be impeached. His files
include legal material, correspondence, letters from the public, press
releases, and reports. Of note is the correspondence and newspaper clippings
relating to Dash's resignation and criticism of Kenneth Starr in 1998.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="orgc105">
Organizations and Committees
</ref> series
reflects Dash's participation in a myriad of associations. Over his long
membership in the American Bar Association, Dash served in the Sections of
Criminal Law and Criminal Justice as well as on various standing committees.
Reflected under the records of this organization is Dash's work on the issues
of standards in criminal justice, criminal law, drugs, ethics, professional
responsibility, model rules of professional conduct, advertising by lawyers,
crime prevention, juvenile delinquency, and electronic surveillance. As
director of the Institute of Criminal Law and Procedure at Georgetown
University Law Center, he oversaw the Appellate Litigation Clinic and other
projects encompassing criminal prosecution, drug addiction, forensic science,
eyewitness identification, pretrial release, plea bargaining, offender
rehabilitation, the role of prison industries, and defendant pre-arraignment.
Dash's participation in the Judicial Conference of the District of Columbia
Circuit and in the Legal Aid Agency for the District of Columbia led to his
involvement with projects studying the law and its relationship to community
health services, mental disorders, and juvenile processes. </p>
<p>The
<ref target="wrif239">
Writings File
</ref> is largely comprised of
articles and the research material and drafts for two of Dash's works,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Justice Denied: A Challenge to Lord Widgery's Report on “Bloody
Sunday”</part>
</title> and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Intruders: Unreasonable Searches and Seizures from King John
to John Ashcroft.</part>
</title>
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Justice Denied</part>
</title> explores the inquiry by the Widgery
tribunal into the shooting of twenty-seven civil rights protestors, thirteen of
whom died at the scene, in Derry, Northern Ireland, by soldiers of the British
First Parachute Regiment on 30 January 1972. Dash's report challenges the
findings of the Widgery tribunal which largely exonerated the soldiers of any
wrongdoing. Further material related to this incident and Northern Ireland is
located in the
<ref target="orgc105">
Organizations and Committees
</ref> series under the
International League for Human Rights.
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Intruders</part>
</title>, Dash's last book, concerns search and
seizure law and the erosion of the protections of the Fourth Amendment and the
exclusionary rule supported by articles, book excerpts, and current and
historical case law. Dash's 1985 article about his interview with an
incarcerated Nelson Mandela is supplemented by material in the General Office
File showing Dash's continuing relationship with Mandela and South Africa.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="teaf180">
Teaching File
</ref> contains syllabi, lecture
notes, course outlines, and class lists for courses taught by Dash at
Georgetown University Law Center including Criminal Justice, Criminal Law,
Criminal Procedure, Legislative Investigations, and Professional
Responsibility. Further information on Dash's involvement with Georgetown
University and its law school is found in the
<ref target="genf207">

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Bess Furman (1895-1969) span the period 1728-1967, with the bulk of the
material from 1900 to 1966. The collection focuses on the social and political events of
the presidential administrations of Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S.
Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Furman's coverage of the activities of prominent
women, especially first ladies, is well documented in the papers. The collection is
organized in seven series: <ref target="diar1">Diaries</ref>, <ref target="famp6">Family
Papers</ref>, <ref target="genc23">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="subf36">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="spef64">Speeches and Writings File</ref>, <ref target="misc118">Miscellany</ref>, and <ref target="overs">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="diar1">diaries</ref>, 1924-1962, chronicle Furman's work as a writer
for the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Omaha Bee-News</part>
</title>, Associated Press, and the <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Times</part>
</title>. Her assignments took her from local events and personalities to the national
and international scene. The earlier diaries contain personal comments on professional
and family life; however, most of the diaries from 1944 to 1961 are comprised of
clippings of precis of her articles. The last diary, 1961-1962, is a chronology of her
activities at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</p>
<p>A glimpse of Furman's personal life and Nebraska heritage can be seen in the <ref target="famp6">Family Papers</ref> series, which spans the period circa 1728-1967.
Material relating to her early forebears, the Winslow family of New Hampshire, includes
correspondence, bills and receipts, bonds, deeds for property, and other items,
particularly for Bartholomew Winslow and his wife, Hannah. Furman's connections with
family are evident in copies of letters home that regularly appeared in the <title localtype="simple">
<part>South Side Sentinel</part>
</title> of Danbury, Nebraska, published by her father. In these letters Bess recounts
her latest adventures "celebrity-chasing," as she called it. Also included in her family
correspondence are "not for publication" personal opinions. Additional family material
consists of the papers of her husband, journalist Robert Burns Armstrong (1903-1955),
reporter for the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Los Angeles Times</part>
</title>, the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Washington Post</part>
</title>, and the <title localtype="simple">
<part>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</part>
</title>, and their children, Ruth Eleanor Armstrong and Robert Furman Armstrong,
Jr.</p>
<p>Lucile N. Furman, Bess Furman's sister, came to live with the Armstrong family and
together with Bess started a press and radio consultant and writing service called
Furman Features that was used especially by national women's organizations. Material for
this venture is available in the <ref target="famp6">Family Papers</ref>, <ref target="subf36">Subject File</ref>, and <ref target="spef64">Speeches and Writings
File</ref>. The Furman sisters wrote for such organizations as the Children's Bureau,
the American Association of University Women, the League of Women Voters, and the
Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee. They also wrote handbooks and
campaign fliers for the Democratic National Committee.</p>
<p>The <ref target="genc23">General Correspondence</ref> series, 1918-1965, is composed of
incoming letters of both a personal and professional nature. They are from longtime
family friends, journalists, first ladies, and professional contacts. Prominent
correspondents include Bess Streeter Aldrich, Ella F. Auerbach, the Bobbs-Merrill Co.,
Elizabeth Randolph Shirley Enochs, Edith Benham Helm, Genevieve Forbes Herrick, Frances
Parkinson Keys, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., Dorothy McAllister, Mary Margaret McBride, Iantha
McCloskey, Myrtle Mason, Anthony Netboy, Ruth Bryan Owen, Rohde, Herbert H. Rogers, Mae
Rogers, Eleanor Roosevelt, Malvina Thompson, and Bess Wallace Truman.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subf36">Subject File</ref> and <ref target="spef64">Speeches and
Writings File</ref> include research material, drafts of articles, and related
correspondence, with emphasis on Furman's specialization in the areas of education,
health, Washington social and political history, the White House, and women in public
service.</p>
<p>In the <ref target="spef64">Speeches and Writings File</ref> are extensive production
materials for Furman's books: <title localtype="simple">
<part>Washington By-Line</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">
<part>White House Profile</part>
</title>, and <title localtype="simple">
<part>A Profile of the United States Public Health Service, 1798-1948</part>
</title>. There are also her reporter's notebooks and printed copies of newspaper
articles from 1919 to 1960.</p>
<p>In the <ref target="misc118">Miscellany</ref> series is a variety of material such as
appointment books, clippings, financial papers, and invitations. Of particular interest
are scrapbooks compiled by Furman and her family containing correspondence and clippings
about her as well as articles written under the pseudonym, Bobbie O'Dare. Also in the
series are scrapbooks of articles by Winifred Mallon, a predecessor on the staff of the
<title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Times</part>
</title>, dating from 1903 to 1945. Other writings include manuscripts for books and
articles sent to Bess and Lucile N. Furman for editing. Authors represented include
Cecil Dickson, Elisabeth Randolph Shirley Enochs, Edith Nourse Rogers, and Fanny Jessop
Sherman.</p>

<p>The papers of James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) span the years 1835-1948, with the bulk
of the material from 1896 to 1948. The collection consists of correspondence, diaries,
speeches, lectures, articles, notes, financial papers, biographical and genealogical
material, family papers, clippings, printed matter, and miscellaneous material. The
papers are organized in two parts. Part I is organized in nine series: <ref target="jour1">Journals</ref>; <ref target="genc1">General Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="famc1">Family Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="subf1">Subject File</ref>;
<ref target="spef1">Speech, Article, and Book File</ref>; <ref target="phot1">Photographs</ref>; <ref target="misc1">Miscellany</ref>; <ref target="prim1">Printed
Matter</ref>; and <ref target="cert1">Certificates, Diplomas, Charts, Graphs, and
Tables (Oversize)</ref>. Part II contains five series that complement the first
portion: <ref target="famc2">Family Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="genc2">General
Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="subf2">Subject File</ref>; <ref target="spef2">Speech, Article, and Book File</ref>; and <ref target="misc2">Miscellany</ref>.</p>
<p>The Cattell Papers relate primarily to Cattell's professional affiliations as an
educator, university professor, psychologist, and editor and founder of scientific
publications and periodicals. Prominent topics include organizations such as the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, Psychological Corporation, American
Association of University Professors, Century Club, and Columbia University; and his
writings and editorial work for <title localtype="simple">
<part>Science</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">

<part>School and Society</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">
<part>American Naturalist</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">
<part>American Men of Science</part>
</title>, and Science Press. An extensive file treats his dismissal from Columbia
University in 1917 because of his opposition to conscription in World War I.</p>
<p>The collection is rich in prominent correspondents in the scientific, political, and
academic fields. A sampling of significant correspondents includes James Rowland Angell,
Charles E. Bessey, Franz Boas, Edwin Garrigues Boring, Nicholas Murray Butler, Otis W.
Caldwell, John Dewey, Asaph Hall, W. J. Humphreys, Ellsworth Huntington, William James,

<p>The papers of Edmond Charles Genet (1763-1834) span the years
1734-1895, with the largest concentration of material between 1789 and
1793.</p>
<p> Edmond Genet's brief career as the French Republic's first minister
to the United States, and his earlier diplomatic assignments in London and
Saint Petersburg, are documented in the first two series of the collection.
Genet's early career and education are described in a series of letters from
Genet's father, Edme Jacques Genet, and other members of his family, together
with draft replies by Genet, dated between 1776 and 1781. Of special interest
are several letters of Ralph Izard addressed to Genet, dated 1778-1779, while
the latter was chief of the interpreter's bureau at Versailles. Genet's St.
Petersburg mission is represented by material in this collection that is not
available in the archives at Leningrad. The correspondence series also includes
many letters and drafts from officials of the various French ministries,
letters relating to the Clinton and Osgood families, and commissions and
diplomas, some of which are signed by the kings of France.</p>
<p> Aside from the series of news abstracts prepared by Genet as part of
his official duties, a good portion of the remaining notes, drafts, and essays
reflect Genet's interest in political theory and scientific research. There
also are newspaper clippings, accounts of legation and secret expenses, memoirs
by Genet's son, Charles, and miscellaneous papers.</p>
<p> In addition to the above mentioned letters of Edme Jacques Genet and
Ralph Izard, the following are prominent correspondents in the collection:
George Rogers Clark, DeWitt Clinton, George Clinton, Francis Dana, André
Michaux, James Monroe, Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, Antoine Raymond
Gabriel de Sartine, Jean-Louis- Paul Francois, duc de Noailles, and Alexandre
Marie Léonor de Saint-Mauris, Prince de Montbarey.</p>

<p> The papers of Harold Foote Gosnell (1896-1997) span the years
1931-1962, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1937-1959.
The collection consists of files Gosnell compiled as a political scientist and
government consultant. </p>
<p>The Gosnell Papers treat four principal topics. The earliest material
is devoted mainly to a study Gosnell headed at the National Resources Committee
(NRC), later to become the National Resources Planning Board, in which a survey
was made of the future of state and regional planning. Contained in the NRC
files are reports, questionnaires, research data, and internal memoranda
reflecting the agency’s operation. The material represents Gosnell’s own
work as well as the research of students, colleagues, and other officials.
Correspondence of NRC's executive officer, Charles W. Eliot (1899-1993), the
director of the reorganized National Resources Planning Board from 1939 to
1943, appears throughout the files. </p>
<p>A government study of United States information services during World
War II, begun by Gosnell about 1943 when he worked for the War Records Section
of the Bureau of the Budget, was continued by him at the State Department. At
the budget office, the scope of Gosnell’s research was government-wide with a
focus on the activities of the Office of War Information (OWI). At the State
Department, where he worked from 1946 to the end of the decade, his project was
limited specifically to information services in the department itself. Titled
“War Information Services,” research files from both projects are topically
arranged in one section. Included are memoranda, reports, budget statements,
and other documents from government agencies, as well as administrative
correspondence relating to planning the research. Subjects treated include the
Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, the Office of Price Administration,
press and media branches of the OWI, State Department and War Department morale
programs, and the Experimental Division for the Study of War Time
Communications. Correspondents include Joseph Barnes and Milton Eisenhower,
former OWI officers who commented on the research while it was in progress.
</p>
<p>Other files contain background data and articles Gosnell wrote on the
organization of the State Department and source material he compiled while a
foreign elections analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency after 1950. His
fact-finding missions best documented in the CIA file are trips to the
Philippines (1953, 1955), Indonesia (1955), and Sudan (1958). The file contains
correspondence, election ephemera, maps (especially from Sudan), summaries of
conversations with political leaders and Americans abroad, and related
matter.</p>

<p>The papers of Herbert Benjamin (1900-1983) span the years 1915-2004,
with the bulk of the material dating from 1923 to 1982. They are arranged as
general correspondence, subject files, writings, and oversize. A large portion
of the collection relates to Benjamin’s activities as a member of the
Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) from 1921 to 1944,
particularly his work as a leader of the organized unemployed movement during
the 1930s. </p>
<p>The most detailed information about Herbert Benjamin’s life as a
communist in the 1920s and 1930s is in his unfinished autobiography, “Memoirs
of an Indelible Red,” filed in the writings section. Benjamin devoted the
last decade of his life to writing and rewriting his autobiography. In his
drafts, Benjamin described the experiences that led him to join the Industrial
Workers of the World and then the Communist Party. He recounts his attendance
at the 1922 Communist Party convention in Bridgman, Michigan; his work in
Buffalo, Cleveland, and New York, and in Philadelphia, Reading, and
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; his leadership of the first and second National
Hunger marches on Washington, D.C., in 1931 and 1932; the work to organize the
unemployed during the Depression; and the circumstances which led him to end
his public association with the CPUSA. The writings also contain Benjamin’s
statements of his political beliefs and personal reassessments over four
decades.</p>
<p>Subject files contain records of the organizations in which Benjamin
worked on behalf of the unemployed in the 1930s, including the National
Unemployment Council, the Unemployed Councils, and the Workers Alliance of
America. Files of the CPUSA relate to Benjamin’s nationwide speaking tour in
1940 for the purpose of “party building.” Subject files compiled in later
years on people, issues, and current events often include Benjamin’s thoughts
on the topics. Files on “Historians” document Benjamin’s contact with
historians in the 1970s and his reaction to historical assessments of the
organized unemployed movement in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The papers of the Cornelius Chase Family span the years 1745-1974 with
the bulk of the material between 1822 and 1870. The collection consists of
family papers, correspondence, a journal, financial material, reports, speeches
and writings, genealogical material, drawings, printed matter, and
miscellany.</p>
<p>The family papers chiefly reflect the lives of Cornelius Chase
(1780-1868) and his son Cornelius Thurston Chase (1819-1870), both of whom were
ministers and educators. The collection also features Cornelius Thurston
Chase's career as superintendent of public instruction for the state of
Florida. Included with the family papers are correspondence and writings of
other family members, financial material, and genealogical items.</p>
<p>Also included are records relating to the slave trading activities of
E. H. Stokes, Betts and Gregory Company, Browning and Moore Company, Dickerson,
Hill, and Company, and Moore and Dawson Company. Material relating to the

<p>The papers of George Gamow (1904-1968) and Barbara Gamow (1905-1976)
cover the period 1915 to 1975, but the bulk of the collection originates after
1950. George Gamow's papers, which constitute about two-thirds of the total,
are concentrated in the years 1960-1968 and are chiefly scientific and
professional. Barbara Gamow's papers consist primarily of personal and literary
correspondence from 1928 to 1975. The collection is organized in
<ref target="famc1">Family Correspondence</ref>,
<ref target="genc1">General Correspondence</ref>,
<ref target="perc9">Personal Correspondence of Barbara Gamow</ref>,
<ref target="spef15">Speeches and Writings</ref>,
<ref target="misc28">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="add1">Addition</ref>, and
<ref target="overs1">Oversize</ref> series. </p>
<p>Broad in scope, the papers provide source material for biographical
studies and for the scientific and intellectual history of the period. Topics
treated include theoretical physics, astrophysics, big bang theory, nuclear
energy, nuclei, quasistellar objects, genetic coding, RNA coding, and number
theory.</p>
<p>Well known in academic fields as a physicist and astronomer, George
Gamow was perhaps more widely known to the world at large for his work as a
popularizer of scientific literature. In the
<ref target="spef15">Speeches and Writings File</ref> are examples of
both aspects of Gamow's work. There is various material about Mr. Tompkins, the
fictitious bank clerk with a scientific curiosity whom Gamow used in his books
for lay readers. There are also first drafts of several of his other books,
numerous published and unpublished articles, and various original drawings and
illustrations for texts. Other drawings for books and for Gamow's personal use
are in the
<ref target="misc28">Miscellany</ref> series.</p>
<p>George Gamow's professional and scientific correspondence as well as
the Gamows' social correspondence is in the
<ref target="genc1">General Correspondence</ref> series. Of especial
interest for the scientist or scientific historian is Gamow's correspondence
with Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman on the big bang theory, with Charles
Critchfield on nuclear energy and nuclei, with Paul Dirac on gravity, with
Martynas Yčas on the origination of the genetic code (with specific reference
to RNA coding), and also posthumous letters to Gamow from all over the world.
There is, however, virtually no correspondence prior to 1950; all discussion of
scientific theory is related to developments after that date. This limitation
in chronology, as reported by Barbara Gamow in 1964 correspondence with the
Library of Congress, is due to George Gamow's tendency to destroy incoming
letters once he had answered them and to keep no copies of outgoing
correspondence. Many of George Gamow's original letters, as well as photocopies
of originals, do exist in the collection, but not in great bulk. Among his
significant correspondents are Sir John Cockcroft, Pascal Civici, Albert
Einstein, William F. Friedeman and Elizabeth Friedman, J. Allen Hynek, Ronald
Mansbridge, Sir Nevill Mott, Ronald Searle, Albert Szent-Györgyi, and Edward
Teller.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="perc9">Personal Correspondence</ref> series consists of
letters to and from Barbara Gamow. Married to J. R. de la Torre Bueno, a
scholar and editor, from 1938 to 1943, and to George Gamow from 1958 until his
death in 1968, she spent most of her career in the publishing business and was
acquainted with writers, illustrators, editors, and others in the world of
publishing. From 1958 to 1970, much of Barbara Gamow's time was spent editing
and translating for her husband and carrying on some of his professional
correspondence. Although she herself did not publish any books, she wrote verse
for some of George Gamow's books, including
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Faust; Eine Historie</part>
</title>, and she was a prolific letter
writer. Copies of her letters are not well represented in the papers, but
references in letters received indicate the scope of her writing.</p>
<p>During the early 1930s Barbara Gamow moved in circles that included
the poet E. E. Cummings and his wife Marion Morehouse, scholars Edward Niles
Hooker and Albert Guerard, filmmakers Stan Brakhage and John Larson,
psychologists Evelyn Caldwell Hooker and Bernard Friedlander, and writers
Raymong Peckham Holden, James Broughton, Charles Norman, Eda Lord, Sybille
Bedford, Frances and Garner James, and Morgan Shepard. Letters from these and
others provide source material for biographical studies of the correspondents
and their acquaintances. Detailed letters over many years cover periods of
youth, careers, and retirement. For the later years, there is material relating
to old age, some aspects of the psychology of women, and discussions on
parapsychology.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add1">Addition</ref> consists of George Gamow's correspondence with Martynas Yčas about the biological code and with Robert Herman about cosmology, arithmetic, and the big bang theory. Also included are letters by Gamow related to the works of Immanuel Velikovsky and other letters from Peter Brosche.</p>

Included are literary manuscripts, genealogical material, an autograph
collection, and miscellaneous items such as printed matter, scrapbooks,
presidential appointments, certificates, a chart, and memorial. </p>
<p>The collection focuses on Keene’s long career as a consular officer
at Florence, Italy, Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland, and as consul general at
Rome. The papers reflect Keene’s deep concern and conscientiousness in
performing the duties of a consular officer. His mastery of French, German, and
Italian was especially helpful during World War I, when many Americans were
stranded in Europe and required the services of an experienced consular
officer, particularly in Switzerland.</p>
<p> Keene’s papers relating to personal and family affairs also form a
portion of the collection. His letters to his father, David Keene, while he
attended Racine College in Wisconsin and Harvard University, reveal a close
relationship between father and son. The letters later written to his wife and
two daughters allow a brief insight into his immediate family
relationships.</p>
<p> A few of the papers reflect on his contribution to the field of golf,
for which he was known as “Laureate of the Links” in Europe as well as in
America.</p>
<p> Keene’s principal correspondents include Robert Bacon, Poultney
Bigelow, Henry Breckinridge, Wilbur J. Carr, Eugene S. Elliott, Curtis Guild,

<p>The papers of Eugenio María de Hostos (1839-1903) and Eugenio Carlos
de Hostos (1879-1959) span the years 1865-1990, with the bulk of the material
dating from 1870 to 1959. The papers are primarily in Spanish, but also in
English and French, and are organized in two series, one dedicated to the
father,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="eugmardehostos">Eugenio
María de Hostos</ref>, and the other for the papers of the son,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="eugcardehostos">Eugenio
Carlos de Hostos</ref>.</p>
<p> Eugenio María de Hostos was a Puerto Rican nationalist, writer,
educator, and reformer. Born in Puerto Rico and educated in Spain, he also
lived at times in the Dominican Republic, Chile, and New York City, moving
frequently throughout his life depending on changing political circumstances.
He was dedicated to the goal of an independent Puerto Rico, first from Spain
and later from the United States, and the formation of a union of Antillean
states to include Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. His papers contain
correspondence with Caribbean nationalists such as Ramón Emeterio Betances and
Gregorio Luperón as well as with various political organizations. Also
included are family correspondence, microfilm of a diary, photographs,
writings, and other papers. The news clippings, primarily published after his
death, celebrate de Hostos’s legacy.</p>
<p> Eugenio Carlos de Hostos was the son of Eugenio María de Hostos.
After a military education in Chile, the younger de Hostos became an officer in
the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry. This regiment had begun under Spanish rule
and was incorporated into the U.S. Army after the Spanish-American War of 1898.
In 1920 the name of the regiment became the 65th Regiment, U.S. Infantry.
During World War I, the regiment was assigned to Panama to guard the canal
against possible German attack. Material in the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry
file contains items relating to the military service of de Hostos and to his
regiment in general, including correspondence, orders, news clippings, and
photographs. De Hostos’s military career included work for the Army
Intelligence Service traveling undercover in Colombia, Guatelama, and Panama to
identify German activities in those countries during the war. His confidential
reports are in this file, along with correspondence with Luis Muñoz Rivera,
Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In 1935, Eugenio Carlos de Hostos and his wife Mignon purchased an old
castle and the surrounding estate in Sotomayor, Pontevedra, in the northwest
corner of Spain, which would be their home for the remainder of their lives.
The Sotomayor file documents management of the castle and in particular the
restoration work the de Hostoses undertook. Also included are items concerning
civilian life during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>A large part of the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="eugcardehostos">Eugenio
Carlos de Hostos</ref> series is composed of family papers. The file contains
primarily correspondence, but also includes photographs, news clippings, and
miscellanous papers. Both de Hostos and his wife corresponded regularly with
their far-flung families living in the Dominican Republic, England, New York
City, Puerto Rico, and Spain.</p>
<p>The rest of the series includes files on Eugenio Carlos de Hostos’
writings and editorial projects, mostly concerning the life and writings of his
father, a file from his work as a representative of the Curtiss-Wright Export
Corp in Spain in the mid-1930s, biographical material, photographs, and general
correspondence. Notable correspondents include Juan Bosch and Federico
Henríquez i Carvajal.</p>
<p>Additional material in the Eugenio Carlos de Hostos series includes correspondence, lists of catalogued books, family papers, financial records, legal papers, photographs, postcards, and Spanish ration books dating from 1943. Family papers consist of correspondence among de Hostos, MacCormick, and Noble family members, Sara de Hostos' school excercise books, and several diaries of Josefa "Mignon" de Hostos MacCormick.

<p>The papers of Alfred Edward Housman (1859-1936) span the years
1906-1940 and consist largely of drafts of poems, containing numerous
corrections and alterations, most of which appeared in
<title localtype="simple">
<part>A Shropshire Lad </part>
</title>(1896),
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Last Poems</part>
</title> (1922), and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>More Poems</part>
</title> (1936). The bulk of the collection is contained
in seven volumes or notebooks and consists of rough drafts, later drafts, fair
copies, and fragments of the poet’s writings. An introductory volume contains
a foreword and indexes to the other notebooks.</p>
<p>An addition to the collection contains photocopies of the published
works noted above. The originals of the published volumes, part of a Housman
collection at the Lilly Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, were
annotated by John W. Carter in 1939 with readings from the original manuscripts
as transcribed from the notebooks. A considerable number of these readings are
no longer visible in the manuscripts themselves, and as such, the photocopies
represent an important supplement to the notebooks.</p>
<p>Also in the addition is a photocopy of an analysis of the poems in the
notebooks, prepared by Carter and accompanied by a photocopy of an index to the
original arrangement of the notebooks. Other material in the addition includes
a small number of correspondence and miscellaneous items.</p>

<p>The papers of Bertram David Lewin (1896-1971) span the years 1883-1974, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1927 to 1970. The collection documents Lewin's contributions to
psychoanalysis in the United States through his writings, teaching, and involvement in
various psychoanalytic organizations. The papers consist of correspondence, diaries,
biographical data, reports, surveys, speeches and writings, school papers, certificates,
legal documents, and photographs. The collection is organized into five series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fam"> Family and School Papers </ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencor"> General Correspondence
</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj"> Subject File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writ"> Writings File </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ov"> Oversize </ref>. </p>
<p>Lewin was born in 1896 in Victoria, Texas, the son of Samuel Lewin, a German immigrant,
and Justine Levy, a Texas native. Following his 1916 graduation from the University of
Texas in Austin, Lewin enrolled in Johns Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore,
Maryland, where he studied with psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. Lewin received his medical
degree in 1920 and, after completing his residency in Baltimore, worked for several
years with Charles B. Dunlap at the New York Psychiatric Institute on Ward's Island.
Like many early students of psychoanalysis, Lewin spent several years in Europe
attending classes, working on supervised cases, and undergoing analysis. During his time
in Europe between 1926 and 1927, Lewin worked first with Paul Schuster in the Friedrich
Wilhelm Krankenhaus and later attended the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. In 1927
Lewin returned to New York where he established a practice in psychiatry and
psychoanalysis. </p>
<p>Upon his return to the United States, Lewin became active in several psychoanalytic
institutions. In 1931 Lewin became one of the founders of the New York Psychoanalytic
Institute, whose curriculum was closely modeled on that of the Berlin Psychoanalytic
Institute. A year later, he established the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Psychoanalytic Quarterly</part>
</title> with Gregory Zilboorg, Franwood E. Williams, and Dorian Feigenbaum. Lewin
remained on the periodical's editorial board until his death in 1971. Lewin served as
president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society from 1936 to 1937 and of the American
Psychoanalytic Association from 1946 to 1947. </p>
<p>Many of Lewin's writings became standard psychoanalytic texts. His early works focus on
compulsive character, the body as phallus, claustrophobia, and hypomania. Later writings
deal particularly with the psychology of dreams and elation. Fluent in German and
Spanish, Lewin also translated works by Franz Alexander, Karl Abraham, Otto Fenichel,
and Angel Garma. In 1955 he accepted the directorship of the American Psychoanalytic
Association's survey of psychoanalytic education. Lewin and Helen Ross, the project's
associate director, published their findings in <title localtype="simple">
<part>Psychoanalytic Education in the United States</part>
</title> in 1960. Mixed reaction to the way in which the survey was conducted and to its
final report led to Lewin and Ross's resignations in 1961. For the next ten years, until
his death in 1971, Lewin taught psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of
Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fam"> Family and School Papers
</ref> include family correspondence, legal documents, and genealogical information.
Among the earliest material is an autograph book kept by Lewin's mother, Justine Levy,
between 1883 and 1888, and a set of diaries and photographs recording a trip taken by
Lewin and his parents to Europe in 1910. The series also contains student papers,
including class notes and other material, from Lewin's undergraduate work at the
University of Texas and medical studies at Johns Hopkins University. This latter
material includes notes from Adolf Meyer's psychology class. Although little material
exists in this series from Lewin's years in Berlin, a letter written in 1926 to Lewin's
mother-in-law, Irma Benjamin, contains an account of a visit paid by Lewin and his wife
to the Freud family.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencor"> General Correspondence
</ref> series traces developments in psychoanalytic theory and practice from the
mid-1920s to 1970. Correspondence contains lively exchanges with colleagues, including
August Aichhorn, Catherine Bacon, K. R. Eissler, Otto Fenichel, Anna Freud, Maxwell
Gitelson, Ives Hendrick, Ernest Jones, Edith Jacobson, Marion E. Kenworthy, Karl A.
Menninger, Adolf Meyer, Herman Nunberg, Hanns Sachs, Max Schur, James Strachey, Robert
Waelder, and Fritz Wittels, among others. Lewin's correspondence also includes letters
from Felix Frankfurter concerning efforts to aid European psychoanalysts in Axis
countries during the 1930s, a letter from novelist Thornton Wilder discussing <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Ides of March</part>
</title>, and correspondence with Texas politician Maury Maverick. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj"> Subject File </ref> largely
concerns Lewin's involvement in various psychoanalytic organizations. Lewin's
directorship of and eventual resignation from the American Psychoanalytic Association
survey of psychoanalytic education project is documented by correspondence, minutes,
recommendations, and reports. The series also contains files from Lewin's association
with the University of Pittsburgh Medical School during the last decade of his life.
Other activities covered in the Subject File include efforts to secure Edith Jacobson's
release after her arrest by the Gestapo in 1936, Lewin's psychological evaluation of
German prisoners of war in 1945, and his chairmanship of the American Psychoanalytic
Association's Freud centenary celebrations in 1956. Posthumous files contain writings by
Jacob A. Arlow, Lawrence S. Kubie, and Jerry O'Mara on Lewin's life and contributions to
psychoanalysis. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writ"> Writings File </ref> includes
manuscripts, printed copies, and research material from Lewin's articles, lectures,
books, reviews, and poetry. Topics covered include Lewin's research on dreams, elation,
compulsive behavior, and psychoanalytic education. The series includes a long run of
correspondence concerning Lewin's dream screen theories, as well as manuscripts and
publishers' correspondence regarding <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Image and the Past</part>

<p>The papers of William Walden Rubey (1898-1974) span the years 1915-1974, with the bulk
of the items concentrated in the period 1951-1971. The collection primarily documents
Rubey's career with the United States Geological Survey, his consultant work on various
geological projects, and his activities as a member of professional, scientific and
educational organizations. Also included are materials relating to Rubey's technical
speeches and writings in the earth sciences field. The collection is divided into the
following series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencor"> General
Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speech">
Speeches and Writings </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj">

<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencor"> General Correspondence
</ref> series, 1921-1974, primarily contains incoming and outgoing correspondence
between Rubey and associates involved in the earth science fields. Much of the earlier
correspondence relates to his work as a geologist for the United States Geological
Survey and includes letters written and received while Rubey was performing geological
field work in areas of the Midwest, Southwest, the northern Great Plains, and the
northern Rocky Mountains. Later correspondence primarily pertains to his involvement
with numerous scientific and educational associations and his interest in the research
and writings of colleagues.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speech"> Speeches and Writings
</ref> series, 1923-1974, is mostly comprised of research notes, drafts, correspondence,
final copies, printed versions, and other related materials pertaining to Rubey's
articles, book reviews and introductions, speeches, and reports. Research notes in this
series are highly technical and often contain complex mathematical and scientific
formulations. The series features many of Rubey's ground-breaking articles, along with
related correspondence, illustrative materials, and research notes. Included are
materials pertaining to such seminal works as “The Geologic History of Sea Water,” “The
Development of the Hydrosphere and Atmosphere,” and the controversial “Role of Fluid
Pressure in the Mechanics of Overthrust Faulting.” Co-authored with M. King Hubbert, the
latter article was the cause of much dissension in the geological field. Letters from
colleagues in this file primarily pertain to the validity of Rubey and Hubbert's fluid
pressure hypothesis. The authors' replies to published discussions and critiques of
their theory are also found in this series.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj"> Subject File </ref>,
1915-1974, is comprised of correspondence, memoranda, reports, newspaper clippings,
press releases, printed matter, geological maps, research notes, and other materials
relating to Rubey's professional activities as a geologist. Although the series contains
extensive files pertaining to projects Rubey conducted for the United States Geological
Survey, complete documentation of his Survey career as a whole is lacking. Notable files
include records documenting his work in standardizing the nomenclature and symbols used
for defining carbonaceous and stratigraphic materials, several projects that took place
in the western states, and various geological mapping projects. Other significant files
relate to Rubey's work with the Survey's Strategic Minerals Program, in which he was
charged with supervising surveys for vanadium, an important ore used by steel
manufacturers during World War II as a steel hardener.</p>
<p>Also contained in the Subject File are correspondence, memoranda, and reports pertaining
to Rubey's work as a member of many professional, educational, and scientific
organizations. Included are correspondence, memoranda, and reports documenting his
efforts in the Mohole project, a joint effort in the 1960s between the National Science
Foundation and the United States government to obtain a complete core record of the
layers of the earth's crust and the upper part of the underlying mantle. The project was
later discontinued by Congress due to dissension between scientists and government
representatives over the administration of the project, congressional charges of
political influence and irregularities in the awarding of the engineering contract, and
other factors. Correspondence in this file contains Rubey's candid impressions of what
he felt were the root causes of the project's failure.</p>
<p>Other significant files pertain to Rubey's role in establishing the Lunar Science
Institute, his work as a member of the Geological Society of America's Committee on the
War Effort, which made recommendations to the army on the strategic employment of
geologists in the battlefield during World War II, and his efforts in conjunction with
the United States Army Corps of Engineers to determine the cause of a series of
earthquakes plaguing the Denver, Colorado, area.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Harlan Fiske Stone (1872-1946) span the period 1889-1953, but most of the
papers are dated 1925-1946 when Stone served on the Supreme Court of the United States.
The collection consists of <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorres">
Family Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="specialcorresp"> Special Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subjfile"> Subject File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecase"> Supreme Court File </ref>,
and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany"> Miscellany </ref>
series.</p>
<p>Stone's <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorres"> Family
Correspondence </ref> consists chiefly of letters exchanged between Stone and his
brother Lauson, sister Helen, and sons Marshall and Lauson. Very few letters in the
collection are between Stone and his wife, Agnes. Although Stone occasionally mentioned
the Supreme Court or other issues of the day, the letters in this series are mainly
concerned with personal and family matters.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence
</ref> covers a broader range. It contains letters of recommendation supporting friends
for various positions, Stone's comments on the large number of addresses and articles
sent him by others in the legal profession, and discussions of court matters, the
judicial process, legal education, and related subjects. His correspondence with Felix
Frankfurter and John Bassett Moore is voluminous and relates mainly to legal affairs.
Other correspondents in this series include Charles C. Burlingham, Nicholas Murray
Butler, Sterling Carr, John Foster Dulles, Learned Hand, Herbert Hoover, Luther Ely
Smith, Young Berryman Smith, and George Sutherland. The earliest letters in the
collection are from Stone's high school teachers, Jessamine Dixon and Edith Field, in
1889-1892, and concern the course of his future education after being dismissed from
Massachusetts Agricultural College.</p>
<p>In the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="specialcorresp"> Special
Correspondence </ref> series are congratulatory messages that Stone received on his
appointments as attorney general, associate justice, and chief justice, as well as the
condolences received by the family after his death. In addition to the telegrams and
rather perfunctory messages, there are communications commending Stone for his conduct
in the various public offices he held, especially for his statement before the Senate
Judiciary Committee in 1925 concerning his involvement in the prosecution of Senator
Burton K. Wheeler of Montana.</p>
<p>Stone's varied interests and activities are reflected in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subjfile"> Subject File </ref>. His long service as a
trustee of Amherst College and as a chairman of its committee on the Folger Shakespeare
Library, and his abiding interest in these situations, are well documented. He also
served as chairman of the board of trustees of the National Gallery of Art and as
chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution; files on these institutions are also in this
series. The Columbia University Law School material, which dates from 1899 to 1923,
reflects Stone's connection with that institution, first as a teacher and later as dean.
His interest in legal education is also reflected in the files on the American Law
Institute and various bar associations. Other significant files in this series include
those relating to Stone's efforts in appointing new U.S. attorneys during his tenure as
attorney general.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecase"> Supreme Court File
</ref>, which contains correspondence, near-print and printed matter, and clippings, is
divided into three subseries: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecase"> Case Files </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecorresp"> Correspondence </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremeoffice"> General Office Files </ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecase"> Case files </ref>,
which make up the largest part of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecase"> Supreme Court File </ref>, constitute a record of Stone's
written opinions, concurrences, and dissents for his years on the court from the 1924
through 1945 terms. The cases are arranged chronologically by term and alphabetically
therein by case name. The first folder of the case files contains a memorandum prepared
by Stone's secretary explaining the color codes on the folder labels. Contained in the
case files are printed drafts of opinions, memoranda on individual cases, and notes
exchanged by the justices on the cases. The printed drafts of Stone's opinions that he
circulated among the other justices (known as “returns”) often contain their comments on
the back.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremecorresp"> Correspondence in
the Supreme Court File </ref> is organized in two parts: correspondence with other
justices and correspondence with attorneys and petitioners. The correspondence with
other justices covers the years they served on the court with Stone; correspondence
prior to this is located in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence </ref> series. The justices'
correspondence is arranged alphabetically by name and then chronologically. Files for
William O. Douglas, Felix Frankfurter, Charles Evans Hughes, and Owen J. Roberts contain
the largest amounts of correspondence. Stone's correspondence with attorneys and
petitioners regarding cases before the court is arranged chronologically, and involves
in the main procedural matters such as requests for extensions of filing deadlines. Also
included is material concerning affairs of the Second Circuit to which Stone was
assigned.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="supremeoffice"> General Office File
</ref> subseries is arranged alphabetically by subject and contains correspondence with
court officers such as the clerk and the reporter regarding administrative matters. The
file also contains newspaper clippings and correspondence with the public concerning the
court's procedures and decisions. Examples include clippings and letters sent to Stone
supporting his dissent in the flag salute case of 1940 (<emph render="italic">Minnersville School District v. Gobitis</emph>).</p>
<p>Included in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany"> Miscellany
</ref> series are letters to Alpheus T. Mason, Stone's biographer, containing
reminiscences of Stone by Irving N. Brant, Mabel Walker Williebrandt, and others, and
clippings relating to Stone's life and a copy of a letter of 1907 by Theodore Roosevelt
in which he defends his judicial appointments. Other material confirms Stone's
reputation as a wine connoisseur.</p>

<p>The papers of Frank Maloy Anderson (1871-1961) span the years circa
1895-circa 1961 and consist of correspondence, memorabilia, and an extensive

</p>
<p>The bulk of the collection consists of research notes that Anderson
prepared and collected over a twenty-year period in preparation for a
three-volume study of the secession crisis, "The Two Hundred Days of
1860-1861," which remained unwritten at his death. The source notes are drawn
from collections of personal papers, archives, newspapers, and books. The
collection also includes a draft of an introduction to the study presenting a
statement of Anderson's thesis and a proposed outline for the work. The papers
further contain research notes for two of his published works,
<title localtype="simple">

<p>The papers of Florence Deakins Becker (1878-1969) span the years 1891-1963, with the
bulk of the material dating between 1910 and 1963. The papers document her activities as
a volunteer worker for several medical causes. Becker devoted her time and energies to
combating cancer and tuberculosis. Her papers consist of the following seven series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diar">Diaries</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famp">Family Papers</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="spee">Speeches and Writings File</ref>,

<p> The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diar">Diaries</ref> cover 1924,
1929, and 1944, with some undated entries. Subjects in the diaries and engagement
calendars include the Michigan Tuberculosis Association and American efforts to render
medical aid to French refugees during World War I.</p>
<p> Most information about Becker's personal life is in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famp">Family Papers</ref>. Included is correspondence
with various relatives and with her husbands, geologist George F. Becker (died 1919) and
John Campbell Forrester, a British national who was a businessman and politician in
Scotland and Bengal (India). Following her divorce from Forrester in 1930, Becker
resumed her former married name.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">General Correspondence</ref>
series includes business and personal letters as well as letters exchanged with
prominent contemporaries. Business correspondence ranges from the American Public Health
Association to professional associates such as Joseph Colt Bloodgood and Thomas E. Rush.
Correspondence with friends includes letters exchanged with Clarence W. Barron, Suzanne
Bartlett, W. Norman Brown, and Florence Keen. Other correspondents include William Edgar
Borah, Edward T. Devine, William P. Dillingham, and William H. Taft.</p>
<p> The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="spee">Speeches and Writings
File</ref> provides insight into Florence Becker's extensive work in cancer
prevention. Among the most significant material in this series are speeches about
protective measures for women against cancer. </p>
<p>Becker was involved in a number of medical organizations, and there is considerable
material on these activities in the papers. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj">Subject File</ref> documents her work with the Tuberculosis Association
of Bengal, Urgent Relief for France, and the Ligue du Nord Contre la Tuberculose. Becker
also studied and reported on medical conditions within veterans' hospitals. Other
interests documented in the Subject File include the Maryland tercentenary, her founding
of the George Ferdinand Becker Memorial Library in Independence, Virginia, and the
Washington Animal Rescue League. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc"> Miscellany</ref> series

<p>The papers of Clifford Kennedy Berryman (1869-1949) span the years
1814-1965, with the bulk of the material dating from 1890 to 1949. The papers
relate primarily to his career as a political cartoonist for the
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Washington Post</part>
</title> and the
<title localtype="simple">
<part> Washington Star</part>
</title> that spanned more than fifty years. </p>
<p>A large portion of the papers consists of letters Berryman received
from presidents, vice presidents, cabinet members, members of Congress, Supreme
Court justices, and other prominent Americans. Many correspondents commented on
specific cartoons and thanked Berryman for his gift of the originals. Also
included are letters from fellow illustrators, including Charles Bittinger and
John T. McCutcheon. Among a small section of letters sent by Berryman are
illustrated letters he wrote to his mother during the time he was working in
the United States Patent Office.</p>
<p> Other items include drafts of a lecture, “The Origin, Development
and Influence of the Cartoon,” that Berryman delivered to the Literary
Society of Washington in 1921. The drafts contain sketches in the margins and
are accompanied by pencil sketches that later were enlarged to be visible from
the lecture platform. Two autograph albums contain pen portraits of
approximately 120 prominent Americans dating from 1898 to 1949. Each portrait
is autographed by the subject. Among those represented in the albums are
presidents Grover Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Warren G.
Harding, Herbert Hoover, William McKinley, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore
Roosevelt (next to a sketch of the Teddy Bear), William H. Taft, Harry S.
Truman, and Woodrow Wilson. Printed matter includes items relating to the
Gridiron Club. </p>
<p>One item unrelated to Clifford Berryman’s career is an 1814 bill of
sale for a woman and child. The transaction was conducted between Berryman
family members.</p>

<p>The papers of Andrew Jackson Donelson extend from 1779 to 1943, although they are
principally for the period from 1813-1869. Letters received by Donelson constitute the
bulk of the papers, but retained contemporary copies and drafts of letters sent are
present, as well as transcripts and photocopies. Also included are a letter copybook of
Donelson's dispatches from Berlin, 1846-1848, a few drafts of speeches, legal and
financial papers, photographs, engravings, and printed matter. The collection is
arranged in six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="general">
General Correspondence and Other Papers </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="additional"> Additional Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="letter"> Letter Copybook </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany"> Miscellaneous Papers </ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="family"> Family Papers </ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="printed"> Printed Matter, Documents
and Indexes. </ref>
</p>
<p>Others represented in the Andrew Donelson Papers by distinct but lesser groups of
material are Emily Tennessee Donelson, wife of A.J. Donelson, a volume containing
correspondence, journal entries, and photographs; Mary Emily Donelson, daughter of
Andrew Donelson, an album, diary, and scrapbook, with some correspondence; James Glasgow
Martin and Lewis Randolph, correspondence, journals, and notebooks; and Pauline Wilcox
Burke, great-granddaughter of Andrew Donelson, correspondence, notes, and research
materials.</p>
<p>The major portion of the collection relates to the Donelson's public life, as a cadet at
West Point, military aide and private secretary to his uncle, Andrew Jackson, diplomat
in Mexico and Germany, editor, and political candidate. Very few items relate to the
Civil War period or to the years thereafter.</p>
<p>Andrew Donelson was closely associated with Andrew Jackson from early youth until the
latter's death in 1845. Whenever the two were separated, Jackson would write frequent
letters to his nephew, discussing matters large and small. Jackson is, then, a major
figure in the Donelson papers, and there are some 250 of his letters in the collection.
Many drafts and fair copies of Jackson's presidential messages and proclamations were
once a part of the Donelson Papers, but were placed with the Library's Jackson Papers
some years ago.</p>
<p>Among the many subjects touched upon by correspondence in the Donelson papers are
Jackson's presidential campaigns of 1824, 1828, and 1832, the Eaton affair, the
resulting Donelson-Jackson breach, and the subsequent cabinet reorganization of 1831.
The move to recharter the Bank of the United States, nullification, the Poindexter
incident, French spoliation claims, removal of deposits, and other issues of Jackson's
presidency are also subjects of correspondence. There are many letters from office
seekers and from others hoping to influence President Jackson through his secretary.
Family affairs and plantation matters, especially the management of slaves and the
breeding and training of horses, are frequent topics of correspondence.</p>
<p>Donelson's diplomatic career, as chargé d'affaires at the time of the annexation of
Texas, and as minister to Prussia and Germany, is developed in correspondence and in the
case of Germany, copies of dispatches. His brief political career, with the American
Party, is not as fully portrayed as other aspects of his life, and very little is
available to document the later years spent out of public service.</p>
<p>A small, but highly unusual, group of material in the collection consists of documents
relating to Virginia's ratification of the United States Constitution, 1787-1788.
Included is a Dunlap and Claypoole printing of the Constitution with holograph
annotations by Edmund Pendleton.</p>
<p>The roster of prominent correspondents in the Donelson Papers is long and varied.
Presidents in addition to Jackson represented by correspondence are James Monroe, Martin
Van Buren, John Tyler, James K. Polk, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce,
and James Buchanan. Many of Jackson's cabinet members are included, such as Edward
Livingston, Louis McLane, Roger Brooke Taney, Levi Woodbury, John Henry Eaton, Lewis
Cass, Benjamin F. Butler, Amos Kendall, John Branch, and William J. Duane.</p>

<p>The Daniel Schorr Papers (1916-2010) span the years 1922-2010, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1943 to 2006. The papers are organized into the following series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="family"> Family and Personal File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">Correspondence</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="film">Broadcasts and Film</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="public"> Speeches and Public Appearances</ref>,

<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="family">Family and
Personal File</ref> contains biographical material, professional achievement
awards, and estate, financial, and military records. The correspondence
consists chiefly of Schorr's letters to his mother, Tillie Godiner Schorr. They
describe his activities as a United States Army intelligence officer stationed
at Camp Polk, Louisiana, and Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, during World
War II. In later years the letters provide details of his life and work in
postwar Europe into the Cold War era. In addition to politics, Schorr also
covered cultural events. His friendship with violinist Isaac Stern is well
documented. The diaries and notebooks contain Schorr's observations while on
news reporting assignments.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">Correspondence</ref> series contains incoming and copies of
outgoing letters to professional colleagues, friends, and fans. Chief
correspondents are Harry A. Blackmun, Charles W. Colson, Captain Alfred
Friendly, Richard M. Nixon, William S. Paley, Richard S. Salant, Ted Turner,
and Herman Wouk.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="film">Broadcasts and

contracts, correspondence, and publicity material, most of the series consists
of scripts written primarily for Cable News Network, Columbia Broadcasting
System, and National Public Radio. European events covered include postwar
reconstruction, the Marshall Plan, the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, superpower summit meetings, Moscow under Nikita Sergeevich
Khrushchev, and the Berlin crisis of 1961. Individuals receiving coverage by
Schorr were Khrushchev, Konrad Adenauer, Fidel Castro, and Dwight D.
Eisenhower. In the United States, Schorr reported on issues relating to civil
rights, urban problems, and the environment. He is particularly known for his
investigation of the Watergate Affair and scandals involving the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The papers
document his clash with CBS and the United States House of Representatives over
his publication of a suppressed intelligence report.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="public">Speeches and
Public Appearances</ref> series documents Schorr's activities on the
professional lecture circuit as a keynote speaker, as well as a classroom
lecturer, conference participant, and panel moderator. He regularly
participated in the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies (later the Aspen
Institute) in Aspen, Colorado. Material includes background information,
contracts, correspondence, notes, publicity, and texts of speeches.</p>
<p>The

<title localtype="simple">

</title>,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Don't Get Sick in America</part>
</title>, and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Staying Tuned: A Life in Journalism</part>
</title>. Schorr's career as a
print journalist is represented by clippings and typescripts of articles
written for newspapers and magazines. The topics duplicate those covered in his
broadcasts.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subject">Subject File</ref> contains Schorr's reference material for his
writings and broadcasts, chiefly news clippings, reports, and printed material. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscell">Miscellany</ref> series consists of legal case material regarding
freedom of speech issues, Schorr's press passes, and a set of National Public Radio
playing cards featuring its journalists. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addition">2017 Addition</ref> series spans the years 1939 to 2010, with the
bulk of the material dating between 1986 and 1990. The series complements the initial
portion of the collection and relates to Schorr's career as a print and broadcast
journalist. The material is arranged in five groups: broadcasts and film,
correspondence, family and personal file, miscellany, and writings. The majority of the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addition">2017 Addition </ref>consists of scripts of Schorr's regular
commentary on National Public Radio (NPR) as a senior news analyst, including
appearances on <title>

<part>All Things Considered</part>
</title>,
<title>
<part>The Two-Way, </part>
</title>and a special call-in program initiated in 1991 at the
onset of the Gulf War. The period 1986 to 1991 is particularly well documented, though
scripts date throughout the tenure of Schorr's career at NPR, from 1985 until his death
in 2010. Many of the scripts in this series overlap with those in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="film">Broadcasts and Film</ref> series, though many of the scripts contained here include
Schorr's edits and annotations. Also included are several iterations of the script for

<p>The papers of Louise Bates Ames (1908-1996) span the period 1915-1989, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1950 to 1975. The collection consists primarily of
correspondence and manuscript material relating to Ames's career as a child
psychologist, cofounder and codirector of the Gesell Institute of Child Development, and
author of numerous books and articles on child behavior and child development. Included
in the collection are family correspondence, correspondence with friends and
professional associates, a sampling of letters related to the syndicated newspaper
column Parents Ask, and manuscripts and related correspondence for several of Ames's
books and articles. The collection is organized in six original series and five
additions. The original series include <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorres"> Family Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres"> Special Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres"> General Correspondence </ref>,

</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella"> Miscellany
</ref>. The additions are dated according to the year of their arrangement and contain
material organized in the same schema as the original part.</p>
<p>Ames's career as a child psychologist began in 1933 when she joined the staff of the
Yale Clinic of Child Development as research secretary and personal assistant to the
director, Arnold Gesell, with whom she worked until 1948. She received her doctorate in
psychology from Yale University in 1936; was curator of the Yale Films of Child
Development, 1944-1950; and participated in the development of articles, books, and
research projects in the field of child psychology. Material in the collection which
relates to this period may be found in the following series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorres"> Family Correspondence </ref>, especially
letters to Annie E. Bates; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres">
Special Correspondence </ref>, in particular correspondence with James T. Culbertson,
Paul H. Elicker, Guy S. Métraux, and Ruth W. Métraux; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="writs"> Writings File </ref>, "Guide to the Yale Films of
Child Development" by Louise Bates Ames; and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella"> Miscellany </ref> containing a diary, 1928-1937, and annual
reports, 1939-1949.</p>
<p>After Gesell's retirement, the clinic separated from Yale University, and in 1950, Ames
and her associate, Frances Lillian Ilg, founded the Gesell Institute of Child
Development. The institute's name changed to the Gesell Institute of Human Development
in 1978. The Gesell Institute is a private, nonprofit corporation for clinical research
in the field of child psychology. Ames was Director of Research at the Institute until
1968 when she became codirector. In conjunction with her study of children's behavior at
successive age intervals, Ames became one of the pioneers of rorschach psychological
testing. References to this and other aspects of her work may be found in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="famcorres"> Family </ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres"> Special Correspondence </ref>
series, in particular, the letters of Annie E. Bates, Joan Ames Chase, Len Lye, Guy S.
Métraux, Ruth W. Métraux, and Evelyn Goodenough Pitcher. More detailed information about
rorschach testing may be found in Ames's numerous books and articles, bibliographies of
which are in <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella"> Miscellany
</ref>.</p>
<p>As the work of the Gesell Institute became increasingly recognized, requests for
lectures, television appearances, and articles began to increase as well. This aspect of
Ames's career is well documented in her papers. In the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres"> Special Correspondence </ref> series are
files relating to her two television series, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Child Behavior</part>
</title> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Gesell Institute Reports: Your Child and You</part>
</title>. In 1951, Ames and Ilg began their syndicated newspaper column, Child Behavior,
which in 1962 became known as Parents Ask. A sampling of unedited letters from the
column for the period 1954-1964 is included in the collection as well as two sets of the
edited and published columns covering the years 1967-1968. Research files of Robert M.
Zingg on "wolf-children" are included in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addit77"> 1977 addition </ref>.</p>
<p>Ames corresponded with numerous friends, colleagues, and associates, many of whom were
prominent in their fields. Among those whose letters are contained in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres"> Special Correspondence </ref>
series are Fitzhugh Dodson, Arnold Gesell, Gerhard Alden Gesell, Len Lye, Margaret Mead,
Daniel P. Moynihan, Vance Packard, and Benjamin Spock. Also in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speccorres"> Special Correspondence </ref> series are
files concerning Ames's work with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and
the White House Conference on Children and Youth in 1970-1971.</p>

<p>The papers of Howard Scholer Liebengood (1942-2005) span the years 1950-1982, with the
bulk of items concentrated in the period 1973-1981, during which Liebengood worked for
the United States Senate assisting Tennessee senator Howard H. Baker. The Liebengood
Papers represent numerous aspects of Baker's work in the Senate, especially those
activities involving Liebengood, and contain some of Baker's own correspondence and
papers. Included are correspondence, office memoranda, reports, Senate papers, trip
material, research items, speeches, campaign material, legislative proposals, notebooks,
a few newspaper clippings and photographs, and miscellany. The papers are divided into
five series created by Liebengood or his staff, and there is some topical overlap
between the various series. Many original folder titles have been retained, and within
each series, many folders have been grouped together by subject matter. The series
consist of <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="howbakfile"> Howard H. Baker

<p>Liebengood left Nashville, Tennessee, and arrived in Washington, D.C., during the summer
of 1973 to work as part of the minority staff of the United States Senate Select
Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (commonly known as the Watergate
Committee). Baker was the ranking Republican on the committee. Liebengood's
responsibilities included interviewing potential witnesses. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="waterfil"> Watergate Committee </ref> files include a
large group of abstracts of interviews and testimony. Baker conducted a special
investigation of the role of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Watergate break-in
and related events. Much of the research material from the investigation is included in
this series. A number security classified items were removed from this series and placed
in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="class"> Classified </ref> series
thatis described at the end of the container list.</p>
<p>After the Watergate hearings, Liebengood returned to private law practice. In 1975 he
began working with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, first as a consultant
and in 1976 as the minority staff director, a position he held for one year. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="intelfile"> Intelligence Committee </ref>
files reflect some of the intelligence and security concerns of the period: the desire
to define and restrict the scope of operations of the Central Intelligence Agency and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the renewed investigation into President John F.
Kennedy's assassination, and issues such as the Korean influence-buying scandal
("Koreagate") and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II (SALT II) being negotiated with
the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From March 1977 until January 1981, Liebengood served as Baker's legislative counsel in
the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="minleadofffile"> minority leader's
office </ref>. His papers for this period are the most numerous and wide-ranging in
the collection. There are large sections on legislative proposals, nominations and
appointments, Senate committees and Senate Republican groups, and official trips. Also
included are sections on various issues that arose during President Jimmy Carter's
administration, such as the Abscam bribery scandal, the scandal concerning his brother
Billy Carter's ties to Libya, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II.</p>
<p>Papers relating to the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pancantrefil">
Panama Canal treaties </ref> have been separated from the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="minleadofffile"> Minority Leader's Office Files </ref>
and placed in a separate series. The Senate debated the Panama Canal treaties in
1977-1978, and Baker was a central figure during the deliberations and final acceptance
of the treaties. It was perhaps because of Baker's leadership that the treaties were
ratified in 1978. Republican responses to the Panama Canal treaties reveal a split in
the party between moderates who supported Baker and conservatives, such as Ronald
Reagan, who felt that Baker had cooperated in a Panama Canal "give-away."</p>

<p>The papers of John Dean Caton (1812-1875) span the period from 1826 to
1947 with the bulk concentrated in the period 1826-1895. Caton was the first
lawyer who settled in Chicago and was an associate justice of the supreme court
of Illinois from 1842 to 1864 and served as chief justice of that court in 1855
and from 1857 to 1864. For more than a generation he was in correspondence with
lawyers and public men of his state including those prominent in its
history.</p>
<p> Caton’s papers consist of family, professional and legal
correspondence, speeches, drafts of an unpublished memoir, other writings, and
a scrapbook. The bulk covers Caton's activities as a lawyer in Chicago, as an
associate and chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, 1842-1867, as chief
stockholder and director of the Illinois and Mississippi Telegraph Company,
1849-1867, as an investor in western mines, as a stockholder and director of

<p>The papers of Waldo Lee McAtee (1883-1962) span the years 1803-1963, with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1900-1960. The collection covers the full extent
of McAtee's professional career at the Bureau of Biological Survey of the Department of
Agriculture and its successor agency the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of
Interior. He was noted especially for his research on the food habits of birds. Series
within the collection include <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="correspond"> Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researwrit"> Research and Writings File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="handcoll"> Handwriting Collection </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscel"> Miscellany </ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="correspond"> Correspondence File
</ref> includes letters exchanged with numerous professional colleagues in various
scientific fields and reflects McAtee's wide-ranging interests in ornithology,
entomology, botany, and conservation. Prominent and frequent correspondents include
Arthur Mangun Banta, F. E. L. Beal, Donald Beaty Bloch, Lee L. Buchanan, Frank M.
Chapman, Josiah Henry Combs, A. K. Fisher, Ira Noel Gabrielson, Ernest G. Holt, J.
Douglas Hood, Alfred C. Kinsey, Hoyes Lloyd, Harry Malleis, H. L. Mencken, John Russell
Malloch, Edward Alexander Preble, Henry W. Shoemaker, Herbert L. Stoddard, John K.
Terres, Joseph Snford Wade, Florence Warnick, and Casey A. Wood. The file also contains
correspondence with family members including McAtee's wife, Fannie E. McAtee, his
brother, Morris McAtee, and his son, Robert B. McAtee. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researwrit"> Research and Writings
File </ref> contains McAtee's notes and background resources for his professional
writings. Drafts and printed copies of his writings are rarely present since McAtee
donated a large collection of his writings to the Rare Book Collection of the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The files reflect the intersection of McAtee's major
studies in ornithology, entomology, and botany. His focus on the feeding habits of birds
sparked his studies and writings on insects and plants, and he served as curator of
Hemiptera at the Smithsonian Institution for twenty-seven years. </p>
<p>Among the highlights of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researwrit">
Research and Writings File </ref> is a large group of material related to his
observations of wildlife, insects, and flora in and around the District of Columbia
which he used for his book, <title localtype="simple">
<part>A Sketch of the Natural History of the District of Columbia</part>
</title>. Also notable is a large group of notes and background material pertaining to
evolution as well as to an unpublished manuscript titled "A Critique of Darwin." After
thirty years of study in the food habits of birds and other topics, McAtee became
convinced that Darwin's theory of natural selection was flawed. In an application to a
publisher in 1947, McAtee wrote "Average, not fittest or superlative, individuals
survive, so the process provides no motor for evolution; the moving force must be sought
elsewhere than in the 'struggle for existence.'" Other significant files relate to
McAtee's biographical notes on prominent scientists, a large collection of field trip
notes, and a manuscript and notes for his privately published <title localtype="simple">
<part>A Review of the Nearctic Viburnum</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>In the 1940s McAtee collected <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="handcoll">
handwriting </ref> samples of ornithologists, botanists, mammalogists, entomologists
and other groups. His collection consists of fragments of correspondence, receipts,
notes, envelopes, and other sources for examples of handwriting.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscel"> Miscellany </ref> series
includes records of the Bureau of Biological Survey containing correspondence, field
reports, office memoranda, and a report on the early years of the bureau. Also included
is a group of miscellaneous avocational writings by McAtee consisting of poetry, prose,
reviews, and other works which, in many instances, were privately printed by McAtee.

<p>The papers of Nathaniel Alexander Owings (1903-1984) span the years 1911 to 1983, with
the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1960-1980. The papers pertain to
Owings's business, public, and personal affairs, documenting his career as a founding

of several public commissions responsible for the redesign of Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington, D.C.; as a member of various commissions relating to conservation,
preservation, and redevelopment in California; and as an author whose articles and books
reflect his concern with both the aesthetic and practical applications of architecture
in contemporary life. The collection includes correspondence, memoranda, journals,
drafts of speeches and writings, notes, charts, graphs, diagrams, drawings, poetry,
clippings, photographs, printed matter, and other material. The collection is organized
in seven series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp">

<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresp"> Correspondence </ref>
series, 1939-1977, contains Owings's incoming and outgoing correspondence and appended
material reflecting his interests as architect, businessman, conservationist, and
civic-minded citizen Although the series contains business papers pertaining to his role
as a partner in the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, the major portion consists of
personal correspondence relating to his many other activities and interests.
Correspondents include Ansel Adams, Stephen Davison Bechtel, Jerry Brown, Wolf von
Eckardt, Arthur J. Goldberg, Lady Bird Johnson, Robert Moses, Daniel P. Moynihan, Elwood
R. Quesada, David Rockefeller, Nicholas Roosevelt, Wallace Stegner, and Stewart L.

<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="offfile"> Office File </ref>,
1954-1969, consists mostly of correspondence and memoranda relating to business concerns
in the offices of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. The reading file consists of copies of
Owings's outgoing letters and memoranda arranged chronologically. Records included in
the corporate memoranda and general office files provide detailed documentation of the
firm's internal operations. The former includes memoranda exchanged between secretaries
and executives at the San Francisco home office with their counterparts in field
offices, as well as memoranda circulated within the San Francisco office.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>,
1934-1977, documents many facets of Owings's business and personal life. The file
contains information relating to his work on various committees and commissions
including the California Advisory Committee on a Master Plan for State Scenic Highways,
the Monterey Coast Master Plan, and various organizations relating to the redevelopment
of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Owings was appointed chairman of the
President's Advisory Council on Pennsylvania Avenue by John F. Kennedy and later
occupied the same position of its successor organization, the President's Temporary
Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. These organizations were charged, through remodeling
and development, to redefine the area of Pennsylvania Avenue that connects the White
House with the Capitol and, by so doing, bring it more in accord with the design of the
original city plan by Pierre Charles L'Enfant.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speecwrit"> Speeches and Writings
File </ref>, 1944-1977, reflects Owings's interest in numerous architectural and
urban planning topics. The series contains early speeches and writings relating to

segment relating to Owings's winning the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal in
1983. Other topics of interest include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation,
including Owings's letter of resignation to President Ronald Reagan, and his extensive
collection of kachina dolls made by Hopi Indians. A miscellany file contains a copy of
Owings's speech at the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal dinner in 1983. Also
of interest are writings and other material relating to the Hopi Indians and a draft of
an article, "Back to Earth," by Daniel P. Moynihan.</p>

<p>The papers of Frederick Douglass Patterson (1901-1988) span the years 1861-1988, with
the largest group of materials dating from the period after 1965. The collection is
composed of the personal papers of Patterson, third president of Tuskegee Institute and
founder of the United Negro College Fund. They largely reflect his career following his
retirement from Tuskegee in 1953 and highlight his efforts to preserve and develop
historically Black institutions of higher learning. The bulk of the collection consists
of correspondence, reports, organizational records, printed materials, writings and
speeches, notes, clippings, memorabilia, and other miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="correspond">Correspondence</ref>
series of the Patterson Papers contains separate groupings of personal and general
correspondence. Included in the personal correspondence are felicitations regarding
Patterson's election to the presidency of Tuskegee Institute in 1935, his White House
Private Sector Initiative Commendation in 1982, and his receipt of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom from President Ronald Reagan in 1987. A few family letters from the
early 1930s are also contained in this portion of the file. Items in the general
correspondence include communications with organizations and individuals concerned with
education, educational administration, business, fund-raising, and government. </p>
<p>The greatest concentration of materials in the Patterson Papers is found in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref>. The papers in
this series cluster chiefly around Patterson's association with the Robert Russa Moton
Memorial Institute and the College Endowment Funding Plan. Established by Patterson in
the late 1950s in memory of his father-in-law and second president of Tuskegee
Institute, the Robert Russa Moton Memorial Institute provided financial planning and
training for historically Black colleges. Operating under the auspices of the institute
was the College Endowment Funding Plan, devised by Patterson to endow small, poorly
financed Black colleges, thereby securing their long-term stability. The file pertaining
to the College Endowment Funding Plan traces the development of this program throughout
the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on the passage of legislation that established federal
matching grants for Black colleges. The materials document Patterson's work with
educational administrators, financial officers, and government officials. Prominent
correspondents include Caspar W. Weinberger, Willa B. Player of the United States Office
of Education, and Congressman, later Senator, Paul Simon. </p>
<p>Other papers in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject
File</ref> relate to the latter years of Patterson's tenure as president of the
Phelps-Stokes Fund, a foundation devoted to improving housing and educational
opportunities for African Americans and other disadvantaged people. Franklin H.
Williams, Patterson's successor, is a prominent correspondent in the papers relating to
the fund. A key file pertains to education in Africa, including a handwritten journal of
Patterson's travels through Nigeria in 1953-1954 inspecting educational resources on
behalf of the International Bank Commission. Materials relating to Tuskegee Institute in
the Subject File reflect Patterson's continued interest in the school and include
extensive correspondence with his successor as president, Luther H. Foster. Also present
are brief items relating to aviation and low-cost housing at Tuskegee, as well as a
sizable file concerning the institute's veterinary medicine school. Patterson's interest
in Robert Russa Moton and botanist George Washington Carver is also exhibited in the
Subject File. A typescript draft of a biography of Moton is among various biographical
materials found in the file. Patterson served as executor of Carver's estate and
participated in various memorials recognizing his achievements. The file contains copies
of Patterson's speeches honoring Carver. Also included are transcripts of oral history
interviews with Patterson conducted in 1980 and 1981 for the Phelps-Stokes Fund and the
United Negro College Fund.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="clipfile">Clippings File</ref>
consists of newspaper clippings and magazine articles from the late 1930s through the
1970s, which Patterson annotated and organized according to a detailed classification
system. Topics treated include civil rights, desegregation, regional education, the
South, higher education, philanthropy, and other related issues. Also included are a
significant group of draft and printed copies of Patterson's writings and speeches, as
well as notes relating to various topics. Other writings and speeches not included in
this classification scheme are located in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella">Miscellany</ref> series.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella">Miscellany</ref> series
holds, among other materials, a collection of personal clippings relating to Patterson's
career and his work with the College Endowment Funding Plan. Included also are draft and
print copies of speeches and writings by Patterson, as well as a small group of his
published articles among the printed matter. Other materials include certificates,
biographical data, telegrams, and memorabilia.</p>
<p>Prominent or frequent correspondents include Robert L. Clayton, Nathaniel Sextus Colley,
E. Roland Harriman, Patricia Harris, Matthew Jenkins, Maida Springer Kemp, Benjamin E.
Mays, Henry Lee Moon, Ponchitta Anne Pierce, Hollis F. Price, and Robert Ogden Purves.

<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfile">Government File</ref>, the

Budget</ref> (OMB), <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepwel">Department of Health Education and Welfare</ref> (HEW), and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepdef">Department of Defense</ref> (DOD) subseries
documenting Taft's government service. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="offmanbud">OMB</ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepwel">HEW</ref> subseries consist mainly of chronologically arranged
official correspondence, memoranda, and other daily records. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepdef">DoD</ref> subseries includes a large
chronological file of official correspondence, memoranda, and other daily records. The
files from OMB, HEW, and DOD complement the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp">General Correspondence</ref>.</p>
<p>Taft's government service started in 1970 at the Federal Trade Commission during the
Nixon administration. From 1968 to 1970 he participated in a project initiated by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader to probe the effectiveness of the Federal Trade
Commission. The new chairman of the commission, Caspar W. Weinberger, on reading a study
produced by the FTC Investigation Project, asked Nader if any of the project staff were
qualified for service with the commission. Nader recommended Taft, and he was named
attorney-advisor to Weinberger. This appointment was the start of a long professional
relationship between the two. Material related to the FTC Investigation Project and
Taft's attorney-advisor tenure comprise the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fedtradcomm">Federal Trade Commission</ref> file of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfile">Government</ref> series.</p>
<p>The bulk of the material in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="offmanbud">Office of Management and Budget</ref> subseries parallels the
period 1970-1973 during the Nixon administration, when Taft worked as Weinberger's
principal executive assistant while the latter was deputy director and director of OMB.
Subjects of memoranda to Weinberger and others include meeting agendas of the Domestic
Council and the Council of Economic Advisors, federal-state revenue sharing, guidelines
for drafting legislation, projections on the effects of an aging population on
entitlement programs, presidential impoundment of appropriated funds, tax expenditure
analysis, the defense budget, and the "peace dividend" occasioned by the withdrawal of
American troops from Vietnam. Other participants in OMB internal communication include
Samuel M. Cohn and Arthur B. Laffer.</p>
<p>During 1973, Taft served as Caspar Weinberger's executive assistant when Weinberger held
the dual offices of secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and counselor to the
president for human resources during Nixon's second term. There is substantial material
in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepwel">Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare</ref> subseries on the scope, purpose, and activities
of the newly-created office of counselor to the president for human resources.
Weinberger continued to serve as secretary of HEW until 1975, early in the Ford
administration, and Taft continued as his executive assistant. During 1976-1977, Taft
was general counsel, or chief lawyer, for HEW under secretary Forrest David Mathews.
Recurring topics in the HEW subseries include welfare reform, the negative income tax,
school desegregation cases, swine flu vaccine liability, and national health insurance.
Internal and external correspondents besides Weinberger and Mathews include Terrel
Howard Bell, Peter J. Brennan, Frank Charles Carlucci, James H. Cavanaugh, Lewis M.
Helm, Russell B. Long, William A. Morrill, Elliot L. Richardson, Pat Schroeder, and
Julia Vadala (Taft).</p>
<p>Between 1981 and 1989, Taft was successively general counsel and deputy secretary of the
Defense Department under secretaries of defense Caspar Weinberger and Frank Charles
Carlucci during the Reagan presidential administration. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepdef">Department of Defense</ref> (DoD) file
documenting Taft's service in this agency is the largest subseries of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfile">Government </ref>series. It
consists mainly of official outgoing correspondence with attached correspondence and
other daily records arranged chronologically and inventoried by addressee, subject, and
control number. Frequent correspondents besides the secretaries of defense include
Joseph Patrick Addabbo, Les Aspin, Jack Brooks, Robinson O. Everett, Michael Horowitz,
Tip O'Neill, Richard Norman Perle, Colin L. Powell, Melvin Price, William V. Roth, Carl
R. Smith, David Alan Stockman, W. Paul Thayer, Strom Thurmond, John G. Tower, and Joseph
Robert Wright.</p>
<p>The most numerous document types in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella">Miscellany</ref> series are records related to Taft's law
partnership with the Washington firm of Leva, Hawes, Symington, Martin and Oppenheimer
and writings not related to his governmental duties, such as college term papers.
Speeches and writings resulting from his official duties are housed in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfile">Government File</ref>ewith the
files of the appropriate governmental entity. For example, a speeches and writings file
of Taft material is part of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfildepdef"> DOD</ref> subseries of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="govfile">Government File</ref>.</p>

<p>The records of the Democratic Study Group (DSG) document activities of a legislative
service organization in the United States House of Representatives from 1959 to 1995.
The records are arranged in three parts. Part I contains material from 1940 to 1976
organized in six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="factmateri">Fact Sheets, Reports, and Other Material</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="campfile">Campaign File</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chronofile">Chronological File</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="printmat">Printed Matter</ref>; and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="overs">Oversize</ref>. Part II contains records from 1912
to 1995 organized in six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="adminfilii">Administrative File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chronofileii">Chronological File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researpub">Research Publications</ref>,

File</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="restrict">Formerly
Restricted</ref>. Part III contains records from 1967 to 1994, and is organized in
six series: <ref target="legis">
<title>
<part>DSG Legislative Report</part>
</title>
</ref>, <ref target="camp">Campaign Memoranda</ref>, <ref target="daily">
<title>
<part>Daily Report</part>
</title>
</ref>, <ref target="fact">
<title>
<part>Fact Sheet</part>
</title>
</ref>, <ref target="research">Research Publications</ref>, and <ref target="miscel">Miscellany</ref>. There is considerable overlap in Parts I and II for
documentation on major DSG activities. Similar arrangement of series in each part
facilitates access by topic and document type.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>In 1959, a group of liberal Democratic members of the House of Representatives organized
the Democratic Study Group to counterbalance a conservative Republican-Dixiecrat
coalition. The group's first need was for research and analysis of legislative
proposals, policy options, and political issues in order to exchange information and
identify common ground. The DSG provided a constant flow of information to its members
in publications found primarily in the series <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="factmateri">Fact Sheets, Reports, and Other Material</ref> with additional
items in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chronofile">Chronological
File </ref>and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject
File</ref> of Part I. DSG publications are also contained in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researpub">Research Publications</ref> series of Part II. </p>
<p>DSG circulars include the <title localtype="simple">
<part>DSG Legislative Report</part>
</title>, a weekly summary of bills and amendments scheduled for action that week. The
<title localtype="simple">
<part>DSG Legislative Report</part>
</title> also provided background information on parliamentary situations and the
positions of the current presidential administration and public and private interest
groups. A <title localtype="simple">
<part>Fact Sheet</part>
</title> containing a more comprehensive analysis of major legislation was published as
circumstances warranted. <title localtype="simple">
<part>Issue Report</part>
</title>, circulated during election years, briefed members on campaign issues and
election strategy. <title localtype="simple">
<part>Special Report</part>
</title> was issued periodically as background and analysis of controversial issues
while <title localtype="simple">
<part>Record Votes </part>
</title> provided a quarterly breakdown of all record votes taken in the House. Finally,
the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Staff Bulletin</part>
</title>, a weekly publication, reported on committee actions, hearings and markups,
members' projects, and notice of important federal agency rulings. Excerpts from
constituent mail were also published in the bulletin.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="campfile">Campaign File</ref>
documents DSG support for key House of Representatives election campaigns as well as
information concerning Democratic Party candidates in presidential and Senate campaigns.
The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chronofileii">Chronological
File</ref> records the flow of political and legislative events through summaries of
activities and group publications. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref>, the largest series in Part I, also contains the
greatest detail on policy issues, including civil rights and the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party's challenge to seat delegates at the 1964 Democratic National
Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Other issues detailed in the Subject File
include congressional reorganization and reform and tax policy. Administrative records
of the DSG are also located in the Subject File. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="printmat">Printed Matter</ref> series contains
supplemental publications related to subjects studied by the DSG.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, the DSG also organized its own whip system to assist the
Democratic Party whip coordinate votes on key legislation. Whip files are located in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File</ref>.
Simultaneously, DSG leaders challenged congressional rules, working to bring greater
transparency to Congress and revisions to the seniority and committee systems. Through
these combined efforts, documented primarily in the Subject File, the DSG provided the
sustained and coordinated machinery that helped to pass the major civil rights and
social legislation of the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="adminfilii">Administrative
File</ref> of Part II complements the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref> of Part I in documenting the operation and
funding of the DSG. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="adminfilii">Administrative File</ref> includes election records for chair and executive
committee members as well as task force organization and meeting records. Day-to-day
operations were the purview of the executive director as reflected in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chronofileii">Chronological File</ref>.
Included in this series is material of all variety documenting organizational activities
and policy issues as they developed. </p>
<p>As the DSG evolved and the views of its members diverged, emphasis shifted to
nonpartisan research services. In the 1970s and 1980s, under executive director Richard
Conlon, DSG research publications became a primary function of the organization.
Contained in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="researpub">Research
Publications</ref> series is the distillation of information provided by the DSG
research arm for its members. The DSG <title localtype="simple">
<part>Fact Sheet, Issue Report</part>
</title>, <title localtype="simple">
<part>DSG Legislative Report</part>
</title>, and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Staff Bulletin</part>
</title> aimed for impartiality. The <title localtype="simple">
<part>Special Report</part>
</title>, issued ad hoc, remained partisan. The <title localtype="simple">
<part>Daily Report</part>
</title> lists the floor schedule of the House and summarizes anticipated amendments.
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Record Votes</part>
</title> provides detailed analysis of votes taken during each session of Congress. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="servacti">Services and
Activities</ref> series documents the administrative and campaign support provided to
members, including freshman orientation seminars on setting up an office on Capitol
Hill, handling constituent mail, and committee assignments. A DSG Campaign Fund was
established as a political affiliate to raise funds and provide assistance in targeted
election campaigns. Campaign files in the Services and Activities series treat the
resulting support for Democratic Party candidates on presidential as well as
congressional levels and the response of Democrats to Republican Party campaign
arguments. DSG whip system records are located in the Services and Activities
series.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfileii">Subject File</ref> of
Part II documents the issues tackled by the DSG. Files on civil rights include testimony
from clergy and students on the moral conduct of participants in the 1965
Selma-Montgomery civil rights march in Alabama and records relating to the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party that complement the records in Part I of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File.</ref>
</p>
<p>Other files from the 1960s and 1970s feature DSG efforts to end American involvement in
the Vietnam war, redress a perceived imbalance of power between Congress and the
Executive, enact campaign finance reform and consumer protections, and defeat Republican
opposition to federal programs on domestic poverty, the environment, health, education,
and civil rights. Of note in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfileii"> Subject File</ref> from the period is a survey conducted in 1979
by the DSG on White House staff performance during the Jimmy Carter administration. </p>
<p>Prominent as themes during the 1980s are budget, tax, and economic proposals by the
Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, along with arms control and war
power issues.</p>
<p>The DSG also concentrated on reform of House rules and worked to revive the dormant
Democratic Caucus as the basic arbiter of Democratic policy in that body. Group leaders
headed committees to study and propose reforms that would adjust the seniority system,
open committee meetings to the public, allow recorded votes on floor amendments, require
secret ballot votes on committee chairs at the start of each Congress, and give junior
members a voice in committees. Among the relevant files in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfileii"> Subject File</ref> series are the records for
the Committee on Organization, Study and Review, chaired by Julia Butler Hansen in 1971;
records for the Select Committee on Committees, chaired by Richard Bolling in 1973;
records of the Commission on Administrative Review, chaired by David R. Obey in 1976;
and material pertaining to the Second Select Committee on Committees, chaired by Jerry
Patterson in 1979. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="restrict">Formerly Restricted</ref>
series in Part II includes correspondence and memoranda, meeting records, reports, and
printed matter from the period 1986-1995.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part III </emph>
</p>
<p>Part III consists of files that are continuations of and fill gaps in Parts I and II
publication runs. The <ref target="legis">
<title>
<part>DSG Legislative Report</part>

<p>The papers of Faith Berry (1939-2017), excluding research material, cover the period
1963-2009, with the bulk of the collection dating from 1971 to 1983. The papers concern
Berry's research on the life and literary career of poet Langston Hughes, her
collaboration with pioneering African American literature scholar J. Saunders Redding on
an anthology of his works, her membership on the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored (NAACP) Task Force on Africa (1976-1977), and her work as a
television scriptwriter. Berry's involvement in the women's movement is also documented,
principally her membership on the President's Advisory Committee for Women, her contract
work with the Department of Labor Women's Bureau (1979-1980), and her attendance at the
United Nations Decade for Women Mid-Decade Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark (1980). The
collection is organized into two parts. Further description of each part follows. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I, excluding research material, spans the years 1963-1984, and is organized into
five series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="langhugh"> Langston Hughes
</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="naacptaskafr"> National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People Task Force on Africa </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="womeniss"> Women's Issues </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="kissretro"> Kissinger in Retrospect
</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="over1"> Oversize </ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="langhugh"> Langston Hughes </ref>
series consists in part of files generated through Berry's decade-long research on the
poet's life and work. The Langston Hughes (1901-1967) files include correspondence,
photocopies of research material, a program from a memorial service, and various
articles written by Berry about Hughes. Correspondence consists of letters to federal,
state, and local agencies concerning Hughes's birth and possible marriage, his parents'
marriage, the death of an infant sibling, and his father's life after separating from
Hughes's mother. Correspondence also includes Berry's Freedom of Information Act
requests for documents located among the State Department records at the National
Archives and Records Administration concerning Hughes's alleged communist activities.
Photocopied material includes a lengthy run of correspondence between Hughes and
Rinehart and Company publishers between 1953 and 1960. Berry received access to this
correspondence from Theodore S. Amussen, a former vice-president of the company and
later editor-in-chief at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Finally, the
research files include an original program from a memorial service for Hughes held on 25
May 1967 at the Benta Funeral Home in Harlem.</p>
<p>Berry's research culminated in the publication of <title localtype="simple">
<part>Langston Hughes: Before and Beyond Harlem</part>
</title> in 1983, and her papers include published reviews, a certificate of copyright
registration, and a copyedited manuscript of the book. While researching and publishing
on Hughes's life, Berry worked to promote public awareness and appreciation of the poet
within the Washington, D.C., community and beyond. The collection includes a script from
a 1979 radio program honoring Hughes, written, narrated, and produced by Berry. Also
included are two District of Columbia City Council resolutions honoring Hughes, which
were passed in 1979 and 1982 largely through Berry's efforts.</p>
<p>The second series concerns Berry's membership between 1976 and 1977 on <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="naacptaskafr"> NAACP Task Force on Africa
</ref>. The NAACP board of directors created the task force in September 1976,
commissioning it to conduct a thorough study of current conditions in Africa and to
advise the board in the creation of an African policy. Berry was selected as a member of
the task force in part because of her expertise in the field of communications.
Organized into four teams, the task force visited southern African countries during the
spring of 1977 in order to meet with African leaders and gather firsthand information.
Berry visited Botswana, Rhodesia, Tanzania, and Zambia as a member of the team chaired
by Franklin Williams, president of the Phelps-Stokes Fund and former United States
ambassador to Ghana.</p>
<p>Papers relating to the task force document the group's organization and activities and
include correspondence, memoranda, drafts of reports, minutes, itineraries, photographs,
and newspaper clippings. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="naacptaskafrsub"> Subject files </ref>, consisting largely of printed matter,
provide background information on Africa in general and the countries visited by the
Williams team specifically. Printed material includes publications from the African Fund
and the American Committee on Africa; government publications made available to the task
force by the African countries visited; and material published by various African
nationalist organizations such as the United African National Council, the Zimbabwe
African National Union, and the Zimbabwe United People's Organization. The subject files
also contain photocopies of official correspondence and reports, transcripts of
interviews, and miscellaneous printed matter documenting Berry's research on African
media as well as original pamphlets, information sheets, and application forms she
collected on American mercenaries employed in the Rhodesian army.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="womeniss"> Women's Issues </ref>
series concerns Berry's involvement in the women's movement through her employment with
the President's Advisory Committee for Women (PACW) and her contract work with the
Department of Labor Women's Bureau between 1979 and 1980. The PACW, chaired by Lynda
Johnson Robb, was established by Jimmy Carter in 1979 to serve as heir to the National
Advisory Committee for Women, formerly headed by Bella S. Abzug. Berry served as media
coordinator for the PACW from July 1979 until March 1980, a tenure represented in the
Women's Issues series by correspondence, memoranda, minutes, proposals, and newspaper
clippings. Following her resignation from PACW, Berry undertook contract work for the
Department of Labor Women's Bureau where she wrote speeches for the bureau's director,
Alexis M. Herman, and oversaw various press and media projects. Memoranda, proposals,
invoices, and drafts of speeches document her work for the bureau.</p>
<p>In 1980 Berry attended the United Nations Decade for Women Mid-Decade Conference in
Copenhagen, Denmark, as a representative of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW)
to the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) Forum. Immediately before traveling to
Copenhagen, Berry visited Morocco as the NCNW's representative in the Transcentury
Women-to-Women exchange program. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="womeniss"> Women's Issues </ref> series contains brochures, programs,
schedules, reports, notes, press releases, and newspaper clippings from the Mid-Decade
conference, the NCNW Second International Seminar, and the Transcentury Women-to-Women
program.</p>
<p> Subject files complete the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="womeniss">
Women's Issues </ref> series. These consist largely of research materials, including
newspaper clippings, magazine articles, papers, reports, notes, and miscellaneous
printed matter on such issues as education, employment, the Equal Rights Amendment,
military, minority women, and social security. Various women's conferences between 1976
and 1982 are documented through programs, proceedings, newspaper clippings, reports, and
memoranda. More than half of these conferences focused specifically on minority
women.</p>
<p>Printed ephemera scattered throughout the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="womeniss"> Women's Issues </ref> series provides insight into the women's
movement between 1976 and 1982. Brochures, leaflets, and pamphlets reveal how women
organized themselves on the local, national, and international levels and document
issues of greatest concern. The PACW files include an unpublished, in-house directory of
more than 275 women's organizations in existence between 1979 and 1980. The directory
consists of detailed information sheets on the nature and services of each organization
and occasionally includes publications and other printed material issued by the
organization. Printed ephemera collected by Berry in Copenhagen during the Mid-Decade
Conference includes material on communications, education, feminism, health, child care,
peace, ecology, human rights, politics, violence, and work. Some of these materials are
organized by subject, while other files pertaining to a specific country or region are
arranged alphabetically by place of origin. More than thirty-five countries or regions
are represented. Finally, the Women's Issues subject files include printed matter from
more than sixty women's organizations and publications in the United States. This
material is arranged alphabetically by name of organization or publication.</p>
<p>The penultimate series, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="kissretro">
<emph render="italic">Kissinger in Retrospect</emph>
</ref>, consists of a working script for a documentary program produced by WETA/TV-FM
public television in Washington, D.C., which first aired in 1977. Berry served as a
researcher for the script, written by Stanley Karnow, which examined the political
career of former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>The final series of Part I consists of an <ref target="over1">Oversize</ref> consisting
of a resolution of the District of Columbia City Council recognizing Berry's work
towards promoting public awareness and appreciation of Langston Hughes within the
Washington, D.C. community, and posters pulled from the Women's Issues series. </p>
<p>Notable correspondents in the collection include Theodore M. Berry, Broadus N. Butler,
Alexis M. Herman, Franklin Williams, and Margaret Bush Wilson.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II spans, excluding research material, 1970-2009 and is organized into four series:
<ref target="lang2">Langston Hughes</ref>, <ref target="redd2">J. Saunders
Redding</ref>,<ref target="misc2"> Miscellany</ref>, and <ref target="over2">
Oversize</ref>. </p>
<p>This <ref target="lang2">Langston Hughes</ref> series in Part II supplements and expands
on material in the Langston Hughes series of Part I. This Langston Hughes series
includes files, mostly correspondence, on the two literary executors of the Langston
Hughes estate, playwright and theater founder George Houston Bass, and poet Arna
Bontemps. Also part of the series are files on Hughes's friends and associates Berry
talked to, corresponded with, or researched while preparing <title>
<part>Langston Hughes: Before and Beyond Harlem</part>
</title>, and persons she consulted while writing the book; including Edmund Randolph
Biddle, Maxin Lieber, Hollis Ralph Lynch, Charlotte Osgood Mason, Louis Thompson
Patterson, Ted Posten, Harold Rome, Elsie Roxborough, Marie Seton, Ella Winter, and
Thomas Wirth. </p>
<p>Berry did two stints, in 1987 and 1992, as guest editor of the <title>
<part>Langston Hughes Review</part>
</title>, a publication of the Langston Hughes Society founded after the poet's death by
George Houston Bass. Her first editorial product for the <title>
<part>Review</part>
</title> was a 1987 commemorative issue entirely focused on Hughes himself. Writers
whose articles she edited for this issue include George Houston Bass, J. F. Briere,
Victor Carrabino, Michel Fabre, Ellen Conroy Kennedy, Takao Kitamura, Nancy Morejon, Ugo
Rubeo, and Amritjit Singh.</p>
<p>The 1992 commemorative issue of the <title>
<part>Langston Hughes Review</part>
</title> that Berry edited was entirely focused on pioneering African American literary
critic, professor, and fellow Cincinnatian Darwin T. Turner (1931-1991), who took out of
favor Black writers, such as poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar and historical novelist Frank
Yerby, as serious subjects worthy of criticism. Writers Berry worked with for the issue
include J. R. Berry, James C. Hall, Mae Henderson, Wilfred D. Samuels, Fred L. Standly,
and Zelma R. West.</p>
<p>Throughout the Langston Hughes series are files related to Berry's search for Hughes's
more radical and socially critical poems and prose in obscure literary magazines to
solidify Hughes's reputation as a revolutionary writer. Berry's findings were published
as <title>
<part>Good Morning Revolution: Uncollected Writings of Social Protest</part>
</title> in two editions (1973 and 1992). Prominent among Hughes's protest writings was
his 1932 book <title>
<part>Scottsboro Limited</part>
</title>. A file in this series includes this book and material relating to efforts to
free the Scottsboro Boys, nine Black youths unjustly charged with raping two white women
on a freight train in Alabama.</p>
<p>The Part II Langston Hughes series also includes his Federal Bureau of Investigation
case file, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, that delves into
Hughes's alleged Communist activities, affiliations, and sympathies. A related file
includes Berry's correspondence with FBI officials, notably Director Clarence M. Kelley. </p>
<p>The <ref target="redd2">J. Saunders Redding</ref> series includes material Berry
compiled as editor of <title>
<part> A Scholar's Conscience</part>
</title>, an anthology of Redding's writings published in 1991. This includes
correspondence, drafts, and, notably, writings Berry did not select for the book. J.
Saunders Redding (1906-1988), considered the dean of African American literary critics,
was a writer, educator, and, when appointed a visiting professor at Brown University,
Providence, Rhode Island, in 1947, the first African American to teach in the Ivy
League. In 1970, he became the first African American to hold an endowed chair at an Ivy
League institution, at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. </p>
<p>The <ref target="misc2">Miscellany</ref> series documents Berry's association with two
writers' groups, the National Writers Union and Washington Independent Writers. The
series also includes Berry's writings for English and French language publications such
as <title>
<part>Cosmopolitan</part>
</title>, <title>
<part>Crisis</part>
</title>, <title>
<part>Freedomways</part>
</title>, <title>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of William Edgar Borah (1865-1940) span the period 1905-1940, with the bulk
of the material from 1912-1940. The collection constitutes the record of his career in
the Senate, which began in 1907 and ended with his death in 1940, at the midpoint of his
sixth consecutive term. The papers cover virtually every aspect of Borah's political
life and include extensive files on antitrust legislation, constitutional
interpretation, and foreign policy. There is little in the collection about his youth or
his career as an attorney in Idaho, and most of his Senate office files for the years
from 1907 to 1912 were destroyed when his office was moved from the basement of the
Capitol to the Senate office building. A collection of Borah papers at the Idaho State
Historical Society treats his law practice and political activities from 1890 to 1907,
and a collection of scrapbooks at the University of Idaho Library covers the period
1904-1940. A microfilm copy of the scrapbooks is held by the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="genofffile"> General Office File
</ref>, the largest series, is organized by subject and correspondent within
twelve-month increments. Files on politics, Russia, disarmament, and agriculture reveal
the range of Borah's interests, although files that appear to be commonplace, such as
invitations and requests for speeches, often contain significant correspondence on
substantive issues. Significant topical categories include files titled "documents,"
containing correspondence with constituents concerning government publications;
"newspapers," referring to articles in newspapers and periodicals on Borah; and
"manuscripts," relating to papers sent to Borah by authors seeking assistance in
publishing their work.</p>
<p>The World Court, the League of Nations, military activities in Latin America, routine
army matters, legislation, politics, the Red Scare, universal military training, and
Russia are topics that dominate the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="genofffile"> General Office File </ref> from the World War I era to the
Depression. Among the principal themes in the papers from the 1920s are Borah's attempts
to secure American recognition of the Soviet Union, his support of measures that would
outlaw war, and his reactions to domestic political and economical unrest. Material
relating to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal, and the National Recovery
Administration take up an increasingly larger portion of the files during the 1930s, as
do subjects such as China's war with Japan, the Lausanne Settlement, and neutrality
legislation.</p>
<p>Correspondents upon whom Borah relied for advice on state and local political issues
include Evan Evans, James H. Gipson, Frank Robert Gooding, John W. Hart, James H.
Hawley, Ray McKaig, and Irvin E. Rockwell. Files on topics such as politics,
antilynching, Russia, the Justice Department, treaties, and the World Court include
correspondence with Jane Addams, Edwin Borchard, Henry M. Dawes, Leonidas Carstarphen
Dyer, Hamilton Fish, Samuel Gompers, Norman Hapgood, Will H. Hays, John Haynes Holmes,
James Weldon Johnson, Frank B. Kellogg, Frank Knox, Henry Cabot Lodge, Amos Pinchot,
Gifford Pinchot, Raymond Robins, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas Joseph Walsh, William
Allen White, and Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>
contains material on a wide variety of topics, although most of it relates to Borah's
specific legislative and political interests. Included are important files pertaining to
treaties, appointments, Department of State budgets, and the major problems of American
foreign policy in the era between the two world wars. The Subject File complements the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pubopinfile"> Public Opinion File
</ref>, which contains letters from the public on matters such as neutrality
legislation, the World Court, the embargo of Spain, and New Deal reform efforts.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speestatartfile"> Speeches,
Statements, and Articles File </ref> is perhaps the most comprehensive series for
exploring Borah's positions on public issues, for his attitudes are documented more
thoroughly in his speeches and public statements than in his characteristically terse
correspondence. Borah regarded public speaking and debate as a critical ingredient of
public life. His speeches, press releases, and public statements were prepared with
meticulous care, and many of the research materials that formed the basis of his
speeches are organized in subject files within this series.</p>
<p>Borah's activities in behalf of Idaho constituents are documented throughout the
collection, but four series representing major aspects of constituent casework are
particularly salient for understanding this feature of his career. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="penfile"> Pension File </ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="vetclaifile"> Veterans Claims File </ref>
deal exclusively with the problem of individual constituents; the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="patrofile"> Patronage File </ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="landutilfile"> Land Utilization File </ref> contain
materials relating to broad social and political matters as well as assistance to
individuals. The Land Utilization File ranges from applications for homesteads to
research materials for legislation pertaining to the public domain. Many of the
constituent requests in these files were merely routed to the appropriate executive
agency for attention, but Borah occasionally noted his recommendations and policy
judgements when transmitting a request.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="borapres"> Borah for President
Committee </ref> series illustrates the steps taken by a small coterie of loyal
admirers to obtain the 1936 Republican presidential nomination for Borah. Much of the
correspondence consists of exchanges between Carl G. Bachmann, chairman of the
committee, and various contributors to the campaign. Rounding out the collection is a
small group of correspondence and other <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corresGrac"> papers of Grace Hileman </ref>, Borah's secretary. The
correspondence, largely personal in nature, touches on matters of interest to Borah.</p>

<p>The papers of Irving Robert Kaufman (1910-1992) span the years 1934-1992 with the vast
bulk of material dating after 1949, when Kaufman was appointed to the federal judiciary.
The papers document his professional activities while serving for over forty years as a
federal judge, first as a district judge and then as an appellate judge for the second
circuit. Included are speeches and writings, correspondence, scrapbooks, material from
American Bar Association committees that Kaufman chaired or served on, items from the
Juvenile Justice Standards Project which he chaired, conference materials, court papers,
and subject files. Personal and family papers are few.</p>
<p>The first two series are comprised of papers from Kaufman's two judgeships: the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="southdisNY"> Southern District of New York
</ref> (1949-1961) and the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="seccircourtapp"> Second Circuit Court of Appeals </ref> (1961-1992). Each
series is divided into two subseries: Court Papers and Office Files. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="southdisNYcourtpap"> Court Papers </ref>
from the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="southdisNY"> Southern District
of New York </ref> include transcripts of testimony, charges to juries, opinions,
sentences, and appeals. Fourteen of Kaufman's district court cases appear in the Case
Files, including two of his most famous and controversial cases: <emph render="italic">United States v. Rosenberg</emph> (1951 espionage trial of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg) and <emph render="italic">United States v. Bonanno</emph> (1959 trial of
reputed gangsters who had met in Apalachin, New York). Materials related to these and
other cases are also in the scrapbooks, the final series in the papers. Additional
material concerning <title localtype="simple">
<part>United States v. Rosenberg</part>
</title> is under the case name in a <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="southdisNYofffile"> Office Files </ref> for the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="southdisNY"> Southern District of New York </ref> are
quite small and consist of material from professional organizations, committees,
conferences, and seminars. A collection of speeches, mostly written by others and used
as a reference file by Kaufman, relate in large part to communism.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="seccircourtappcourpap"> Court Papers
</ref> of the second series, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="seccircourtapp"> Second Circuit Court of Appeals </ref>, are very few. The
two case files present are composed primarily of memoranda between the judges. Also
included are affirmances, dockets, and opinions. The extensive <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="seccircourtappoffiles"> Office Files </ref> subseries for
the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="seccircourtapp"> Court of Appeals
</ref> is comprised of Kaufman's papers from American Bar Association committees, the
Juvenile Justice Standards Program, professional organizations, conferences and
seminars, materials concerning the operation of the courthouse and the courts of the
second circuit, reference papers, and correspondence with other judges. There is
substantial correspondence between Kaufman and Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger and Justice Tom C. Clark. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>
contains most of Kaufman's correspondence with various individuals. Substantial
correspondence is present between Kaufman and his longtime friend Simon H. Rifkind.
There are also files on the Harvard Law School fellowship named in Kaufman's honor, the
Presidential Medal of Freedom bestowed on Kaufman, several law schools, news clippings,
nonprofessional organizations, and topics of interest to Kaufman, such as drug abuse and
cameras in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Kaufman's prolific writing was aided by his law clerks, as memoranda to them indicate.
He published widely and delivered many speeches. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speewrit"> Speeches and Writings </ref> series has been
split into several chronologically arranged sections: articles, book reviews, letters to
the editor, research material, and speeches. Correspondence with publishers, readers, or
event organizers is often included.</p>
<p>The final series is a set of three <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrapb"> scrapbooks </ref> dating from 1951 to 1970. The books are filled
with news clippings, most dating from Kaufman's service on the district court. The first
volume and part of the second are devoted to the Rosenbergs' trial, appeals, and
execution. With the help of a clipping service, Kaufman assembled items from many
diverse sources. Other cases highlighted in the scrapbooks are <emph render="italic">United States v. Bonanno</emph> and <emph render="italic">Taylor v. Board of
Education</emph>, the 1961 school desegregation case from New Rochelle, New York.</p>

<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fampap">
Family
Papers
</ref> consist of correspondence and other material documenting the lives
of four generations of Tafts. Major correspondents include Robert A. Taft's
parents, Helen Herron Taft and William Howard Taft, his sister, Helen Taft
Manning, his wife, Martha Wheaton Bowers Taft, and his son, Robert Taft
(1917-1993). There is a sizable amount of biographical material on William H.
Taft, twenty-seventh president of the United States, including printed matter
and correspondence with numerous individuals, among them Henry Pringle, author
of <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Life and Work of William Howard Taft.</part>
</title> The series also contains letters of condolence on the death of both
parents.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="persfile">

</ref> reflects Taft's early law career and civic engagements in
Cincinnati, Ohio; his service during World War I, which included a close

occupational and political activities in Ohio until 1927.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp">
General
Correspondence
</ref> series contains letters and other material related to
Taft's numerous business enterprises and associates, his colleagues in the
United States Senate, and other friends and acquaintances. This series, as a
separate filing unit, was terminated in 1945; thereafter correspondence was
filed as political, legislative, or general, with political and legislative
correspondence filed chronologically and general correspondence filed
alphabetically by subject.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="lettsent">
Letters

</ref> series consists of Taft's replies to professional correspondence
received. The series serves as a locator for incoming correspondence filed

<p>The most significant series within the collection are
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="politfile">

</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="legisfile">
Legislative
Papers
</ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject
File
</ref>. They reflect the development of Taft's political career at both the
state and national levels as well as his rise to leadership within the
Republican party. The bulk of the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="politfile">
Political
File
</ref> concerns Taft's campaigns for the United States Senate (1938-1950)
and for the Republican presidential nomination (1940-1952), with over one-third
of the series relating to his bid in 1952. Also notable are files concerning
his years in the Ohio state legislature, organized labor's opposition to his
Senate campaign of 1950, and its consequent investigation by Congress.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="legisfile">
Legislative
Papers
</ref> relate to matters of policy and legislation either proposed or
enacted into law. They include correspondence, petitions, suggestions, and
inquiries concerning programs and positions taken by Taft and the Republican
party on local, state, and national issues not found in the more general
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject
File
</ref>. There are also published committee hearings and reports, files
relating to individuals, and letters containing praise, criticism, or
suggestions from political leaders and the public. Subjects of note include
economics, labor, defense, foreign policy, finance and taxation, and
veterans.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject
File
</ref> represents a broad spectrum of topics concerning public affairs. The
series was organized in Taft's senatorial office in 1946 and was used until his
death in 1953. The papers, filed chronologically and thereunder alphabetically
by subject, illustrate Taft's belief that a politician should not only work for
the good of his constituents and the nation as a whole, but also provide moral
leadership. On the whole, Taft was a staunch believer in party unity, but at
times he was also capable of taking very independent positions on political
issues. This paradoxical nature is reflected on the one hand by his intense
opposition to certain policies of presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisenhower
and on the other hand by his wholehearted support for different policies by the
same presidents.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="specfile">
Special
File
</ref> consists of material on political figures. These include Thomas E.
Dewey, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, Harold E. Stassen, Adlai E.

<p>The

<p>The correspondence of Joseph Brodsky (1940-1996) spans the years
1965-1972 and consists of twenty holograph, signed letters, cards, and
telegrams, some containing unpublished verses and drawings, from the former
poet laureate. This early correspondence is addressed to Kira Fedorovna
Samosiuk, an intimate friend of the poet, and while written largely in Russian,
also contains an early attempt at verse in English and an unpublished poem in
Polish. The letters reflect on a close and important relationship from the
poet's early years as well as document broader aspects of Soviet life.</p>

<p>The papers of Ernest Joseph King (1878-1956) extend chiefly from 1908 to his death in
1956, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1936-1952. The collection
consists of correspondence, subject files, memoranda, reports, orders, notes, and
associated material organized in six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="orders"> Orders to Duty </ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencoresp"> General Correspondence </ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speech"> Speech, Article, and Book File </ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella"> Miscellany </ref>; and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addition">2023 Addition</ref>.</p>
<p>In the early years of his career, King was a submarine officer and from 1923 to 1926 he
was commander of the Submarine Base in New London, Connecticut. There are several
folders of material for this tour of duty, the most important of which documents the
salvaging of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>S-51</part>
</title> sunk off Block Island in September 1925. King was in charge of the successful
raising of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>S-51</part>
</title>, considered an outstanding accomplishment as it was generally thought that a
submarine could not be raised from a depth of 125-130 feet of water. For this he was
awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.</p>
<p>From submarines, King moved into aviation, qualifying as a naval pilot in 1927. In 1933
he was appointed chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, serving in that post until 1936,
when he assumed command of the Aircraft Base and Aircraft Scouting Force in San Diego.
King was promoted to vice admiral in 1938 and given command of all the aircraft carriers
of the fleet. Files for this period of his life are a valuable source for studying the
growth and development of military aviation.</p>
<p>King's papers for the World War II period and beyond are particularly significant. As
commander in chief of the United States Fleet and chief of Naval Operations, Admiral
King attended the Atlantic Charter Meeting (1941), the Quebec Conference (1943), the
Cairo and Teheran Conferences (1943), and the Yalta Conference (1945). After the war,
various individuals frequently sought information from him concerning these conferences
and also about particular aspects of United States military and naval operations.
Wherever possible, King was ready to cooperate and supply essential information. For
example, he explained to Quentin James Reynolds and Robert E. Sherwood the origins of
General James Harold Doolittle's 1942 air raid on Tokyo. Marine Corps General Merritt
Austin Edson was interested in learning the story behind the Guadalcanal campaign. King
responded with a letter of four pages that detailed his determined efforts, over strong
opposition, to strike the Japanese in the Solomon Islands immediately after the Battle
of Midway (June 1942). The letter also reveals the evolution of King's philosophy of
Pacific strategy, beginning with his personal experiences at the Asiatic station during
the early years of the century. Other correspondence in this vein is that of Walter Muir
Whitehill, coauthor of <title localtype="simple">
<part>Fleet Admiral King: A Naval Record </part>
</title>(1952); Merritt Austin Edson for Pacific Island strategy; Bernard M. Baruch, on
international control of atomic weapons; Ferdinand Eberstadt, on national security
organization; and Richard S. Edwards, on matters relating to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Robert Strange McNamara (1916-2009) span the years 1934-2009, with the
bulk concentrated between 1968 and 2005. McNamara was a business executive with Ford
Motor Company before his appointment as United States secretary of defense in 1961. In
1968, McNamara resigned as defense secretary to become president of the World Bank. The
collection is composed of two supplementary parts. Part I documents McNamara's private
and public life primarily following his departure as secretary of defense, including his
terms as president of the World Bank, his role as counselor and adviser to various
private corporations and nonprofit organizations and foundations, and his role as public
statesman advocating solutions for the critical domestic and foreign policy issues of
the times. The series in Parts I and II are similar, and while their proportions vary,
the content of respective series remains largely the same with the notable exception of
files in Part II dedicated to the analysis of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam
War and the publication of his books <title localtype="simple">
<part>In Retrospect</part>
</title> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Argument without End</part>
</title>. Further descriptions of each part follow.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I of the McNamara Papers spans the years 1958-2003, with most of the material dated
between 1968 and 2000. The papers in Part I highlight his position as president of the
World Bank and a member on the boards of directors and advisory councils of numerous
private corporations and nongovernmental institutions. While the papers include some
material concerning his tenure as secretary of defense, Part I contains limited
documentation for the years prior to his service at the World Bank. Part I is organized
into the following series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="icorres">
Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iworbank">
World Bank </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iorgan">

<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="icorres"> Correspondence </ref>
series contains letters received and copies of replies. It was McNamara's practice to
handwrite many of his replies in the upper right-hand corner of the incoming letters
that were then photocopied for later transcription. Although his handwriting is
sometimes difficult to decipher, the photocopy is often the only copy of his
correspondence that remains in the collection. The series informs on a broad scope of
McNamara's personal friendships, professional connections, and advocacy issues providing
an overview of his relationships and interests that are more fully developed in other
series of the collection. Prominent topics include defense and foreign policy issues,
arms control and nuclear policy, the World Bank, foreign and domestic politics, economic
policy, and international development as well as letters from the public that reflect
the variation of popular opinion regarding McNamara's legacy as a leading strategist of
the Vietnam War and director of the World Bank. Included among McNamara's friends,
colleagues, and media representatives noted in the series are Graham T. Allison, James
G. Blight, McGeorge Bundy, William P. Bundy, Lloyd N. Cutler, Alain C. Enthoven, Orville
L. Freeman, Kurt Gottfried, Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman, W. Averell
Harriman, Paul Hendrickson, Henry Kissinger, Frans M. Lurvink, Helmut Schmidt, Sargent
Shriver, Gerard C. Smith, Carl E. Taylor, Stewart L. Udall, Cyrus R. Vance, and Barbara
Ward.</p>
<p>Following his resignation as secretary of defense, McNamara served as president of the
World Bank from 1968 to 1981. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iworbank"> World Bank </ref> series provides insight into the policies and
operations of the bank and its affiliated institutions during McNamara's terms as
president. The series is a study of the organizational reforms introduced by McNamara as
the bank changed from a project-oriented investment bank to a development institution at
the service of its member states while simultaneously increasing the amount of capital
financing needed to accomplish its goals. Under his leadership, the bank targeted
poverty reduction, increased funding for health, food, and education programs, and
instituted new methods of accountability for budgeted projects. The series contains
memoranda, reports, program and policy papers, and other material documenting the bank's
administrative structure and strategic planning projects as well as personnel and public
relations issues.</p>
<p>Organizational restructuring was constant during McNamara's presidency, and several
files contain material related to staff grievances and other commentary concerning
institutional reorganization. Of particular interest are a set of notes and notebooks
kept by McNamara of his conversations and field visits. The notes of conversations
record McNamara's exchanges with and reactions to various officials and directors of the
World Bank and world leaders in meetings concerning the operations of the bank. The
notes of his field visits are filed alphabetically by country and record meetings with
representatives of member countries and other entities, exclusive of the United States.
Memoranda for the record were prepared along with briefing memoranda and background
material, some with handwritten notations by McNamara. Items marked “impressions” are
personal notes written by McNamara for his own reference and were not distributed to
bank staff. The series also includes technical notes containing background papers and
reports and a country file of correspondence, memoranda, reports, and policy papers
providing financial analysis of the bank's development policies.</p>
<p>Upon his retirement from the World Bank in 1981, McNamara served on the boards of
directors and advisory councils of a variety of private corporations and nonprofit
organizations and foundations principally focusing on issues of the environment,
East-West relations, arms control and nuclear weapons, population and development,
especially as it affected the Third World, and world hunger. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iorgan"> Organization </ref> series contains the records
of McNamara's transactions with these institutions and is arranged alphabetically by
name of organization. Prominent organizations include the African Development Bank,
Aspen Institute, Atlantic Council of the United States, Battelle Memorial Institute,
Brookings Institution, Council on Foreign Relations, Enterprise Foundation, Global
Coalition for Africa, Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, InterAction Council, International
Irrigation Management Institute, Kettering Foundation, National Committee on U.S.-China
Relations, Overseas Development Council, and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World
Affairs. The records illuminate the internal operations and policy disputes within many
of the organizations with which McNamara was associated. The series contains
correspondence, notes and notebooks, policy papers, studies and reports, agenda and
briefing books, background material, and other items that chronicle McNamara's travel
arrangements and attendance at various conferences, meetings, symposia, and workshops in
his capacity as corporate adviser on behalf of the organizations. Drafts and typescripts
from speaking engagements and other presentations supplement similar material arranged
in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ispewrit"> Speeches and Writings
</ref> series.</p>
<p>McNamara worked independently on many of the same issues he supported at the World Bank
and as an organizational representative. Among these the most urgent for him was the
threat of nuclear weapons. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="isubfile"> Subject File </ref> contains material on arms control and nuclear weapons that
chronicle McNamara's efforts on behalf of treaties and strategies designed to reduce the
risk of nuclear war. The series also includes material commemorating the twenty-fifth
anniversary in 1987 of the Cuban Missile Crisis, with reflections on the decisions that
prevented an exchange of nuclear missiles between the United States and the Soviet
Union. Other material associated with McNamara's tenure as secretary of defense include
both defense department records and papers relating to post-defense issues. The latter
includes briefs, depositions, and other court records relating to McNamara's testimony
in the 1984 trial of <emph render="italic">Westmoreland v. CBS, Inc.</emph> Though he
had consistently refused to respond to questions concerning the Vietnam War, McNamara,
by agreeing to testify on Westmoreland's behalf and submitting an affidavit at the
trial, compelled the need for deposition and invited cross-examination. Under oath and
for the public record, McNamara, for the first time since he left office as defense
secretary, was forced to defend his role in the formulation of the government's Vietnam
strategy. In a letter written to newly elected President Bill Clinton, November 23,
1992, located within the “presidential administrations and campaigns” files, McNamara
provides a hopeful coda to the controversy stating, “For me–and I believe for the nation
as well–the Vietnam War finally ended the day you were elected president.”</p>
<p>In addition to his efforts towards eliminating nuclear weapons, McNamara also sought to
alleviate global poverty by supporting economic development in Third World countries.
While president of the World Bank, McNamara became committed to fostering programs
designed to break the cycle of poverty afflicting many of the world's developing
nations, particularly food, health, and population problems in Africa. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="isubfile"> Subject File </ref> contains
material relating to these issues under the “geopolitical file” heading. The series also
includes material referencing attempts to eliminate the cause of the parasitic disease
onchocerciasis or river blindness in Africa, a program originated by the World Bank
during McNamara's presidency. In pursuit of his “visions” for a better world, McNamara
became a frequent traveler on a circuit of conferences and meetings that defined his
agenda as outlined above, which papers are located in the Subject File.</p>
<p>McNamara addressed the issues of war and peace most directly in his articles, books, and
speeches. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ispewrit"> Speeches and
Writings </ref> series contains correspondence, drafts and typescripts, background
and research material, and editorial comments largely relating to these public
statements and writings. Articles written by McNamara explore themes such as the
imbalance of population growth and economic development and the threat of nuclear arms
in the modern world. The series contains limited documentation regarding the publication
of McNamara's books with the exception of <title localtype="simple">
<part>Blundering into Disaster</part>
</title>, a plea for nuclear reduction and arms control. Files related to his speeches,
lectures, and participation in symposia contain correspondence concerning booking and
travel arrangements, drafts and typescripts, and printed copies. A file titled “printed
and typescript copies,” labeled “statement file” by McNamara, serves as a partially
indexed selective compilation of his speeches and writings.</p>
<p>In addition to McNamara's speeches and writings, the series also includes papers
concerning his radio and television appearances and interviews as well as the speeches
and writings of others. In November 1983, following the ABC television broadcast of
<title localtype="simple">
<part>The Day After</part>
</title>, a fictional portrayal of the effects of nuclear war on an American town,
McNamara joined a studio panel in reviewing the film and discussing the consequences of
such a war. Public comments and reactions to McNamara's performance, contained in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ispewrit"> Speeches and Writings
</ref> series, reflect the political debate that the film and commentary provoked. After
many years removed from the defense department, McNamara became less reluctant to grant
interviews and agreed to participate in a number of official oral history interviews
conducted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Historical Office, which
transcripts, as well as those of other interviews, are located in Speeches and Writings.
The series also includes material gathered for Deborah Shapley's 1993 biography of
McNamara, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Promise and Power</part>
</title>, reflecting the controversy it generated.</p>
<p>In addition to containing McNamara's appointment books and files on recreation, travel,
and real estate, among other topics, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="imiscella"> Miscellany </ref>series includes material concerning McNamara's
first wife, Margaret, founder of the nonprofit children's literacy organization Reading
Is Fundamental. The series includes condolence letters and other memorial items
occasioned by her death in 1981 as well as a set of interviews conducted by Suzan Ruth
Travis-Cline.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II of the McNamara Papers spans the years 1934-2009, with the bulk of the material
concentrated between 1968 and 2005. Part II supplements Part I and is organized
similarly. The few correspondence files that exist are arranged in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iimiscella"> Miscellany </ref> series.
Compared with Part I, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiworbank">
World Bank </ref> series in Part II is limited in scope, but the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iispewrit"> Speeches and Writings </ref> file is greatly
expanded. Part II is organized into the following series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiworbank"> World Bank </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiorgan"> Organizations </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iisubfile"> Subject File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iispewrit"> Speeches and Writings </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iimiscella"> Miscellany </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiclassi"> Classified </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iitops"> Top Secret </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiformrestrdata"> Formerly Restricted Data
</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iisencominfo"> Sensitive
Compartmented Information </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiovers"> Oversize </ref>.</p>
<p>Although not as extensive as the records in Part I, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiworbank"> World Bank </ref> series in Part II contains
inclusive sets of memoranda for the record and minutes of President's Council meetings.
The material provides a record of bank meetings with a memoranda for the record prepared
by the personal assistant to the president or by McNamara himself. The memoranda
chronicles the bank's operations and decision-making procedures revealing the internal
policy debates that often led to the development of international financial aid
programs. The series also contains a set of historical reports that track the evolution
of the bank's policy agenda over the decades.</p>
<p>The organizations listed in Part II mirror those in Part I and reflect McNamara's wide
range of interests. Papers in Part II of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iiorgan"> Organizations </ref> series overlap and add continuity to
corresponding material in Part I. Organizations with whom McNamara became newly
affiliated or whose records have been significantly expanded or supplemented from Part I
include the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Corning Inc., Drug Strategies,
East African Development Bank, Eminent Persons Group on Curbing Illicit Trafficking in
Small Arms and Light Weapons, Henry L. Stimson Center, Honorary Presidential Advisory
Council on Investment in Nigeria, Rockefeller Foundation, Trilateral Commission, Urban
Institute, World Food Prize Foundation, and World Resources Institute.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1980s, McNamara embraced an historical methodology called
“critical oral history” that provided a framework within which he could publicly analyze
his actions as defense secretary, addressing the questions that had long surrounded his
public service. Unlike conventional oral history, critical oral history subjects
dialogue and memory to documentary analysis and scholarly review. The Cuban Missile
Crisis of October 1962 was the first event McNamara analyzed using this method. In a
series of six major conferences from 1987 to 2002, referred to as the Cuban Missile
Crisis Project, McNamara and other former Kennedy administration officials, along with
their Soviet and Cuban counterparts, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, were
questioned about the crisis. Part II of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iisubfile"> Subject File </ref> contains a full range of documents gathered
and produced by the project, spotlighting the dangers and behind-the-scenes negotiations
that brought the nations to the brink of nuclear war.</p>
<p>While writing his memoir <title localtype="simple">
<part>In Retrospect</part>
</title>, McNamara offered a proposal to initiate a joint American-Vietnamese project on
the Vietnam War based on the principles of critical oral history and modeled after the
Cuban Missile Crisis Project. Principally organized by James G. Blight of Brown
University, and sponsored by Brown's Thomas J. Watson, Jr. Institute for International
Studies, the project consisted of many preliminary meetings and full conferences from
1995 to 1999 that convened under the general title “Missed Opportunities: Revisiting the
Decisions of the Vietnam War.” McNamara's exploratory trip to Hanoi in November 1995 on
behalf of the project, his first trip to Vietnam since the 1960s, generated considerable
domestic controversy and subsequent criticism. Material in Part II of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iisubfile"> Subject File </ref> documents
all aspects of the project whose data provided the basis for McNamara's book <title localtype="simple">
<part>Argument without End</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>Many of the same subjects and topics explored in Part I of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="isubfile"> Subject File </ref> are continued in Part II,
including files on arms control and nuclear weapons, commissions, conferences and
meetings, geopolitical issues, and onchocerciasis (river blindness). Upon his departure
from the Defense Department, McNamara was presented with a multivolume bound compilation
of his background briefings and public statements. These volumes along with several
files of declassified memoranda, position papers, and reports and other related material
provide further insights to McNamara's years as defense secretary.</p>
<p>In 1995, McNamara, in collaboration with Brian VanDeMark, published <title localtype="simple">
<part>In Retrospect</part>
</title>. Described in the preface as “. . . the book I planned never to publish,”
McNamara proceeded to set forth his account and analysis of the Vietnam War with
emphasis on the mistakes made and lessons learned from America's involvement in the
conflict. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iispewrit"> Speeches and
Writings </ref> series contains extensive research files, drafts, editing and
production material, public response and reaction, interview transcripts, promotion and
publicity material, and related items concerning the writing and publication of
McNamara's long-awaited memoir.</p>
<p>Planned as a sequel to his Vietnam memoir and originally drafted as “In Retrospect II,”
McNamara published <title localtype="simple">
<part>Argument without End</part>
</title> in 1999. Based on conversations between Americans and Vietnamese who were
active participants during the war, the book, cowritten with James G. Blight and Robert
K. Brigham, was the product of the Vietnam War Project described above. Proposals and
outlines for the book are contained in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="iispewrit"> Speeches and Writings </ref> series, in addition to
correspondence, editing, publicity and publication material, and drafts from various
stages of the book's progress. These files, along with those for the Vietnam War
Project, provide an extensive record of the project and the book that grew from it.</p>
<p>In <title localtype="simple">
<part>Wilson's Ghost</part>

<p>The papers of the P. Phillips family span the period 1832 1914. The
papers include the writings of Eugenia Levy Phillips and her parents, Jacob
Clavius Levy and Fanny Yates Levy, but the bulk of the material relates to the
law practice of her husband, P. Phillips (1807-1884), and his son, W. Hallett
Phillips, prominent lawyers before the United States Supreme Court. Material
concerning their practice is found primarily in the letterbooks, in the
dockets, and in the legal record books. The collection is organized in eight
series:
<ref target="journal">Journal</ref>;
<ref target="gencorr">General Correspondence</ref>,
<ref target="letterbooks">Letterbooks</ref>;
<ref target="subject">Subject File</ref>;
<ref target="autobiog">Autobiography, Speeches, and Writings</ref>;
<ref target="legal">Legal File</ref>;
<ref target="financial">Financial Papers</ref>; and
<ref target="misc">Miscellany</ref>.</p>
<p>Although Eugenia Levy Phillips was an ardent Southerner, as shown in her journal written during
her internment, P. Phillips apparently played an inactive role in the Civil War.
There is a gap in the otherwise inclusive series of <ref target="letterbooks">letterbooks</ref> for the period 1862 to 1867, but the period is scanned in his
<ref target="autobiog">autobiography</ref>. Both P. Phillips and his son were
champions of the disadvantaged. The elder Phillips was interested in California and
the United States and Mexican Claims Commission, Key West and the slave trade,
judicial reform, and in securing the repeal of the Missouri Compromise with the
passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.</p>
<p>There is little biographical material on W. Hallett Phillips, but something of his character
can be gleaned from his notebooks, translations and miscellaneous writings. His
idealism is shown in material on the preservation of Yellowstone National Park,
support of the Cuban revolution, investigation of a lynching at Hahnville,
Louisiana, and the defense of the rights of the Moki (Hopi) Indians of Arizona.</p>
<p>
<ref target="gencorr">Correspondence</ref> is generally on legal matters and

<p>The Puerto Rican Collection spans the years 1591-1900, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1750 to 1898. The papers are in Spanish with some
English. The papers contain documents from the Spanish colonial government of
Puerto Rico including financial material reflecting budgets, data on imports
and exports, and taxation, military papers from the War Ministry, and orders
and decrees from the Spanish government. A wide variety of other papers
document other aspects of Spanish colonial Puerto Rico including items
concerning slavery, political prisoners, registration of foreigners, the
fortifications of “El Morro” in San Juan, baptismal records, and politics.
Many of these items had belonged to the Puerto Rican writer, historian, and
government official Cayetano Coll y Toste and relate to his research interests.
A very few items, mostly concerning education, date from after the
Spanish-American War and the subsequent American occupation of Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>The papers of Herbert Bain Knowles (1894-1976) cover the years
1941-1945 and describe Knowles’s service in the United States Navy’s
amphibious forces in the Pacific during World War II. The collection traces the
American advance across the Pacific Ocean to Japan via the Solomon Islands,
Attu, Kiska, Tarawa, Kawajalein, Saipan, Guam, Leyte, Lingayen, and Nagasaki,
Japan, during 1942-1945.</p>
<p> Included are mimeographs and carbon copies of after action reports of
Knowles and others, conference notes, service communications, operation plans
and orders for assault landings and training exercises, marine division field
reports, Knowles’s unpublished “History of U.S.S. <emph render="italic">Heywood</emph>,” and his war diaries or monthly logs of
Transport Division 18 and Transport Squadron 12. Also included are photographs
of the Leyte beachhead and a military intelligence bulletin. Personal materials
consist of a few items of correspondence, health reports, orders, response to
orders, vouchers, and similar documents depicting Knowles’s naval life while
not in combat or engaged in ship and troop deployment.</p>
<p> Knowles was a pioneer and innovator in the art of assault troop
landings. His ideas and innovations, as found in his operational plans and
orders and in his after action reports, were to become widely adopted for
amphibious landings by United States forces.</p>

<p>The papers of Montgomery Sicard (1836-1900) span the years 1800-1948,
with the bulk of the material falling in the years 1870 to 1898. The collection
consists of official and general correspondence, a subject file, and
miscellaneous items. </p>
<p> Sicard’s achievements in the field of ordnance are documented with
his diagrams and memoranda for breech-loading howitzers and his plans for steel
armor plate for ships. In his plans for steel plates are holograph and
typescript notes, memoranda, letters, blueprints , and a corrected galley for <title localtype="simple">
<part>Specifications for Armor for the United States Navy</part>
</title>. </p>
<p>The official correspondence includes a few letters, but the majority
of items are orders to duty. Correspondents include William E. Chandler,
William Mayhew Folger, William H. Hunt, Charles O’Neil, and David D. Porter.
The general correspondence consists largely of letters exchanged between Sicard
and his wife, Elizabeth Floyd Sicard, and between the Sicards and their
children, William F. Sicard, Montgomery Sicard, Jr., and Eleanor L. Sicard.
Other correspondents are Ward Hunt, Jr., Kossuth Niles, and Asa Walker.</p>
<p> Sicard’s financial affairs are documented with letters of advice on
investments; papers of profits, management of property, and purchase of
household goods, and tax receipts. There are letters from his brothers, Stephen
Sicard and George J. Sicard, and his brother-in-law, William Floyd. </p>
<p>Of interest in the miscellany are trade papers of Sicard’s father,
Stephen Sicard, and papers on the management of the Floyds’ property in New
York.</p>

<p>The papers of Robert W. Shufeldt (1822-1895) span the years 1836-1910,
with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1860-1880.
Shufeldt’s forty-five year naval career was interrupted by a nine-year period
in the merchant marine service and in surveying for a proposed isthmian canal
route. The correspondence for his broken-service years, however, includes many
papers of interest on naval affairs.</p>
<p> The Shufeldt collection consists primarily of correspondence,
letterbooks, and subject files, supplemented by diaries, notebooks, journals,
logbooks, newspaper clippings, printed matter, and a small file of material
concerning explorations in Africa by Shufeldt’s youngest son, Mason. The
topics of interest are the nineteenth-century navy, its growth and development;
Civil War naval and diplomatic activities; foreign relations in the 1870s and
1880s, especially with Africa and Asia; and the Tehuantepec, Mexico, surveying
expeditions. The collection is organized into nine series:

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="masonfile">Mason A.
Shufeldt File</ref>. </p>
<p>Shufeldt resigned his commission in the navy in 1854 and entered the
merchant marine to command the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Quaker City</part>
</title>. Later, he became interested in the construction of a canal across the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico and in 1860 led an expedition through that
region. In 1861, Shufeldt was appointed consul general to serve in Cuba.
Correspondents for the years 1839-1861 include A. D. Bach, George Bancroft,
Charles Stuart Boggs, Benjamin F. Butler, John Adolphus Dahlgren, Samuel
Ffrancis Du Pont, David Glasgow Farragut, John Pendleton Kennedy, James Murray
Mason, Matthew Calbraith Perry, David D. Porter, and Gideon Welles. </p>
<p>Shufeldt returned to active duty in the navy in 1863 with the rank of
commander. During the Civil War, her served both ashore and afloat. After the
Civil War, Shufeldt served at sea in the Far East and in 1868 he returned to
the United States and was assigned ordnance duty ashore in New York.</p>
<p> In 1870, Shufeldt was promoted to the rank of captain and was
assigned special duty in command of a survey expedition to Tehuantepec, Mexico.
After the exploration, Shufeldt recommended that this territory be considered
as a likely site for a transisthmus canal.</p>
<p> In 1878, Shufeldt was given command of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Ticonderoga</part>
</title> that was to sail on a round-the-world cruise. The documentation for
the cruise fills about one-third of the containers in this collection. After
returning to the United States in 1881, he was reassigned to Peking, China, as
the naval attaché. </p>
<p>Shufeldt was appointed president of the Naval Advisory Board, for
which he served two years before retiring in 1884. It was during this last tour
of duty that he helped formulate the plans for a new navy incorporating the
technological advance from sail to steam propulsion and from wood to iron and
steel hulls.</p>

<p>The papers of Jean Joseph Maurice Dartigue (1903-1983) span the years 1941-1945 and
consist of records relating to the Société haitiano-américaine de développement
agricole. Together with President Elie Lescot and Minister of Finance M. Abel Lacroix of
Haiti, Dartigue established the Haitian corporation in 1941 and became its vice
president. Included in the collection are correspondence, minutes, agreements, financial
reports, and studies concerning the organization’s founding and mission as an effort
during World War II in cooperation with the United States to produce cryptostegia, a
fast growing rubber plant. Lands were cleared and several hundred peasant families were
displaced in implementing a contract with the Rubber Reserve Company, a subsidiary of
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. </p>

others. Notable are the 1917 letters from Carolyn A. Wilson who reported from
France during World War I for the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Chicago Tribune</part>
</title> and corresponded with Davis about what she observed. Later
correspondence reflects Davis's involvement in the political and literary
fields. Correspondents include Bernard Augustine De Voto, Edward R. Murrow,

<p>The papers of Henry White Edgerton (1888-1970) range from 1910 to 1970, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1929 to 1966. The papers document primarily Edgerton's
activities as a law professor at Cornell University, 1929-1937, and as a judge for the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 1937-1970. The
collection is organized into a subject file and an addition. </p>
<p>Pertaining chiefly to Edgerton's career as a law professor and his writings, the subject
file includes correspondence, drafts of articles, letters to the editor, notes,
pamphlets, reports, newspaper clippings, and printed matter. Topics featured are civil
liberties, criminology, law school curriculum, and the roles of the three branches of
government. Edgerton's ideas on curriculum and criminology are revealed in
correspondence with deans and professors at law schools on matters relating to his
activities in the Association of American Law Schools. Among the correspondents are
Herschel Whitfield Arant, Rufus C. Harris, Justin Miller, Roscoe Pound, J. J. Robinson,
and John Barker Waite. Also included is correspondence with Felix Frankfurter and others
relating to an article by Edgerton's about the incidence of judicial supremacy over
Congress, although these files do not contain any drafts or working papers.</p>
<p> The only correspondence covering an appreciable span of years, 1930-1969, is with
Archibald Graustein, an attorney with the Boston law firm of Ropes, Gray, Boyden &amp;
Perkins and president of the International Paper Company. The letters, chiefly from
Graustein, touch on the opinions of Edgerton in various court cases, personal, family,
and business matters, and occasionally on contemporary affairs. Included are references
to Edgerton's activities while on the bench of the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. </p>
<p>Other correspondence documents Edgerton's affiliations with civil liberties
organizations and his interest in several trials in which they were involved. There are
also several manuscripts written while he was a special attorney in the Department of
Justice relating to the National Recovery Administration, and a few items pertaining to
three letters to editors by Edgerton. There is no documentation of Edgerton's activities
as a private attorney and little information on his classroom lectures. </p>
<p> The addition to the collection, 1944-1967, consists primarily of case files documenting
Edgerton's tenure as a judge for the Court of Appeals. The case files include memoranda,
opinions, orders, and judgments.</p>

<p>The Charles Ewing Family Papers span the years 1769-1951, with the
bulk of the material dating from 1850 to 1890. Before arriving at the Library

Thomas Ewing
(1789-1871) Papers
</ref> largely consist of records from the Washington, D.C.,
law office he operated with Orville Hickman Browning and later joined by his
son Thomas Ewing (1829-1886). Included are legal cases involving courts martial
and land claims. A group of correspondence relates to legal cases handled by
Browning. The chronological file of Thomas Ewing (1829-1886) consists of
documents relating to business and land transactions largely in Leavenworth,
Kansas, by Thomas and his brother Hugh, legal cases involving pardons and
amnesty after the Civil War, claims against the military and for restoration of
property, land claims, and a set of notes written circa 1865 concerning Ewing's
representation of Samuel Arnold, a coconspirator in the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln. The scrapbooks, containing memorabilia, articles and
clippings, land plats, commissions, and legal and personal correspondence
relating to Thomas Ewing (1789-1871), were compiled by a family member.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="chas">
Charles Ewing
(1835-1883) Papers
</ref> consist of a diary, military records, correspondence,
scrapbooks, and records relating to the law offices of Ewing &amp; Hunter in
St. Louis, Missouri, and Ewing &amp; Jackson in Washington, D.C. The papers
relate to the Civil War and its aftermath, especially the military circle
formed by brothers Charles, Thomas, and Hugh Ewing, and their brothers-in-law,
William T. Sherman and Clement F. Steele. The diary covers Ewing's service in
the United States Army during the Civil War and his law career after the war.
During the Civil War, Ewing served under Sherman, and was part of
the Atlanta Campaign that included the "March to the Sea." The correspondence
is mostly with family including Hampton B. Denman, Hugh Ewing, Philemon Ewing,
Thomas Ewing (1829-1886), Ellen Ewing Sherman, William T. Sherman, Clement F.
Steele, Maria Theresa Ewing Steele, and nieces and nephews. Other
correspondents include Luke Clarke, Charles S. Lusk, Reade M. Washington, and
Lewis Wolfley. Clarke and Wolfley had served with Ewing during the Civil War
while Lusk served as Ewing's clerk at the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions
and later became its commissioner. The records of Ewing &amp; Hunter consist of
a letterpress book and letters received. The records of Ewing &amp; Jackson
include cases involving courts martial and other military claims, land grant
claims, Office of Indian Affairs claims, Mexican claims, cotton claims after
the Civil War, patents, and legal matters relating to various companies. The
scrapbooks, relating to Ewing, his father, and William T. Sherman, seem to have
been compiled by a family member.</p>

<p>The papers of John Charles Frémont (1813-1890) and Jessie Benton
Frémont (1824-1902) span the years 1828-1980 with the bulk of the material
dating from 1835 to 1890. The collection includes correspondence, presidential
campaign material from 1856, Civil War items, writings, prints, photographs,
printed matter, and books. Throughout the collection are typed transcripts of
letters, lists of items, and occasional typed descriptions of items. These were
not created by the Library of Congress but came with the collection and have
been retained as supplemental information.</p>
<p>The Civil War file contains no items written by John Charles Frémont.
Some letters are addressed to Frémont as commander in charge of the Western
Department and the Mountain Department. Other items are related to his command
during the war or are addressed to Major George E. Waring who took over his
command in Missouri. Before and after the war, Waring was a prominent sanitary
engineer and civic reformer, leading projects such as the engineering of the
drainage system for New York's Central Park.</p>
<p>The correspondence consists mainly of letters sent by Jessie Benton
Frémont and John Charles Frémont. All but five letters are written by the
Frémonts. The Jessie Benton Frémont correspondence includes many letters to
Robert Underwood Johnson and Edward William Bok. A lengthy run of letters to T.
W. (Trenor William) Park in the John Charles Frémont correspondence primarily
concerns the Frémont's California property. Other notable correspondents
include Henry Ward Beecher and Joel Roberts Poinsett. </p>
<p>The presidential campaign of 1856 material includes pamphlets
supporting and opposing Frémont, songbooks, and graphic material. The printed
matter contains both items written by the Frémonts and items written about
them. The book collection, part of the printed matter file, includes items
authored by the Frémonts. The books remain unorganized in four record center
cartons. A list of contents is in each box. Other items in the collection
include engravings, prints, photographs, legal papers, printed matter, and a
dispatch box.</p>

<p>The papers of Arno Allan Penzias (1933- ) span 1931-2006, with the bulk of the
collection dating from 1963 to 1998. Penzias enjoyed a thirty-seven year career with
Bell Laboratories and its successor Lucent Technologies, serving these organizations as
an astrophysicist and eventually as chief scientist and vice president directing the
corporate laboratory’s research and product development. Penzias with his colleague
Robert Woodrow Wilson discovered a uniform microwave radiation emanating from beyond our
galaxy the charting of which documented the Big Bang theory of the origins of the
universe. For this achievement Penzias and Wilson shared a Nobel Prize for Physics in
1978. </p>
<p>Most of the collection is in English but includes material in German, Chinese, French,
Swedish, Japanese, Spanish, Portugese, Italian, and Russian. The papers are organized
into six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres"> General
Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speewrit">
Speeches and Writings </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="overs"> Oversize </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="artif"> Artifact </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="electfile"> Digital Files </ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres"> General Correspondence
</ref> contains letters exchanged with colleagues and friends including David Block,
Paul A. Fleury, George Gamow, Hiroshi Inose, Roy Radner, and Charles H. Townes. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speewrit"> Speeches and Writings
</ref> include files on Penzias’s two books about information technology, <title localtype="simple">
<part> Ideas and Information: Managing in a High-Tech World and Harmony: Business,
Technology &amp; Life after Paperwork,</part>
</title> published in 1989 and 1995 respectively. Correspondence relating to the books
is extensive and correspondents include E. A. Ash, Pierre J. Encrenaz, Midhat J. Gazalé,
George F. Gilder, Hiroshi Inose, Bela Julesz, Philip Morrison, Dieter Nachtigall, Hans
J. Queisser, Masakazu Shoji, Lyman Spitzer, George R. Stibitz, and Michiyuki Uenohara. </p>
<p>Penzias took on his duties directing Bell Laboratories in 1981, the year its parent
company, AT &amp; T, was ordered by court order to divest. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref> documents Penzias’s
leadership during the period when Bell Laboratories became Lucent Technologies. It also
sheds light on his earlier research career, such as his discovery of the cosmic
background radiation for which he won the Nobel Prize, and his work on another indicator
of a Big Bang, the abundance in the universe of deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen.
A file relating to Penzias’s work on the origin of the elements includes correspondence
with Big Bang theorists Ralph Alpher, Robert H. Dicke, Robert Herman (1914), P. J. E.
Peebles, and Steven Weinberg (1933). Documentation obtained from Bell Laboratory’s Horn
Antenna, with which Penzias and Wilson made their discovery on Crawford Hill in Holmdel,
New Jersey, is available in photographs and a rolled, scroll-like “chart record” dating
from 1964. </p>
<p>The <ref target="electfile"> Digital Files </ref> document Penzias's career as a venture

<p>The papers of Oscar Solomon Straus (1850-1926) span the years circa
1856-1955, with the bulk of the material dating from 1856 to 1923. The
collection chiefly relates to Straus's service as minister and later ambassador
to the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), United States secretary of commerce and labor,
and member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Hague, Netherlands. When
appointed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 as secretary of commerce and labor,
Straus became the first Jew to hold a cabinet post. The papers are organized
into the following series:

</ref> includes general correspondence and letterbooks of
Straus's outgoing letters. In the early correspondnece are letters between
Straus and his older brothers, Nathan and Isidor, with many of Isidor's letters

(Turkey). Other correspondents from Straus's career include Robert Bacon, John
Barrett, Thomas F. Bayard, Nicholas Murray Butler, Andrew Carnegie, Grover
Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge, Ralph M. Easley, James Rudolph Garfield, Lloyd
Carpenter Griscom, Warren G. Harding, Benjamin Harrison, John Hay, Lee Kohns,
Robert Lansing, William Loeb, William McKinley, Adolph S. Ochs, George Foster

Wilson.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diar">
Diaries and
Notebooks
</ref> series contains diaries covering Straus's career and
miscellaneous notebooks. The diaries begin with Straus's first appointment as
minister to the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) from 1887 to 1888, resume with his
second appointment to that post from 1898 to 1900, then cover the remainder of
his career beginning with his appointment as secretary of labor and commerce in
1906 through his appointment as a member of the President's Second Industrial
Conference in 1919 and end in 1923. A discrete set of notes tucked inside the
1887-1888 diary is Straus's memorandum about a trip to Egypt in March-April
1888. Also included in the folder with the diary is a memorandum and letter
recounting infringements on religious liberty in the empire probably in
violation of the Berlin treaty of 1878. The miscellaneous notebooks include
lecture notes and thoughts and quotations kept by Straus and two notebooks in
shorthand kept by Straus's personal secretary, Theodore Linus Weed.</p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">

<p>The papers of Adolph Caspar Miller (1866-1953), member of the original
Federal Reserve Board of Governors, span the years 1913-1947 and relate
specifically to the administration of monetary policy during Miller’s service
with the Federal Reserve Board. The collection is organized as received by
topic, name of person or organization, or by type of material. </p>
<p>The collection consists of internal correspondence and memoranda from
individuals and other Federal Reserve banks; typescripts and handwritten copies
of published articles, speeches, and notes relating to international and
domestic banking and finance, drafts and final copies of minutes, reports, and
proceedings of meetings and conferences of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, agents, and chairmen from 1923 to 1936. There are also copies of
correspondence and speeches and articles by several of Miller’s colleagues in
academic and government service that relate to Federal Reserve policy. Among
these items is an unpublished speech by Paul M. Warbug during his term as
president of the Manhattan Corporation in 1930.</p>
<p> The collection includes internal correspondence and memoranda,
internal documents and notes between Miller and members and staff of the
Federal Reserve System, prominent individuals in banking and finance, and
colleagues of Miller’s years as an academician. Correspondents include Carter
Glass, E. A. Goldenweiser, Charles S. Hamlin, W. G. McAdoo Edmund Platt,
Winfield W. Riefler, Walter Lichtenstein, Benjamin Strong, W. W. Stewart
(director of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Analysis and Research),
Paul M. Warburg, and John Skelton Williams.There are also letters and materials
relating to the Panama Pacific International Exposition, of which Miller was
chairman of government exhibits, 1914-1921. </p>
<p>Miller’s close relation with the White House is evidenced in the
official and personal correspondence of the White, House, presidential letters,
and individual correspondence files with Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge,
Herbert Hoover, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The correspondence with Hoover dates
from his wartime service as food administrator, 1917-1919, as secretary of
commerce under Presidents Warren G. Harding and Coolidge, 1921-1928, to his
term as president, 1929-1933. This correspondence relates to international
economic issues and policy such as economic recovery in Europe, inflation,
foreign trade and the Commerce Department’s efforts to absorb the Agriculture
Department’s function in foreign trade. </p>
<p>The papers also include correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports,
press releases and policy recommendations related to the Federal Advisory
Council, dated 1916, 1920-1935, and the Open Market Investment Committee from
1923 to 1930. Parts of handwritten manuscripts and notes by Miller on subjects
such as the Franco-German War, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution of
1837, new conditions favoring commerce, printed matter and miscellaneous
memorabilia comprise the remainder of the collection.</p>

<p>The papers of Kirk Munroe (1850-1930) consist of diaries, correspondence, writings
biographical material, photographs, subject files, printed matter, newspaper clippings,
memorabilia, scrapbooks, drawings and watercolors, and an autographed guest book from
“The Scrubub,” the Munroe home in Florida. The material extends from 1850 to 1940, with
the bulk of the papers concentrated in the period 1867-1932. The collection is organized
into four series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diary"> Diaries
</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorres"> General
Correspondence </ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="artbookfile">
Article, Short Story and Book File </ref>; and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella"> Miscellany </ref>. </p>
<p>The papers relate primarily to Kirk Munroe’s literary career as an author of boy’s
books; his adventures on a survey team for the Union Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and
Santa Fe railroads; trips into the Everglades, into the Hudson Bay region, and to the
Far East on a world tour; his work in behalf of the Seminole people of Florida; and his
canoeing and bicycling interests. These activities are documented principally by his
writings, by the correspondence kept by himself and his two wives, by the diaries kept
by himself, and by his first scrapbooks. The writings include handwritten drafts and
printed copies of articles, short stories, essays, books, and poetry. The period of his
life from 1870 to 1880 is poorly documented.</p>
<p> A diary dated 1853 was kept by Charles W. Munroe, Kirk Munroe’s father. Diaries dated
1867-1869, 1881, and 1923 were kept by Kirk Munroe. Diaries dated 1884-1922 were kept by
Mary Barr Munroe, first wife of Kirk Munroe. There are no diaries for the years
1870-1880. </p>
<p>Correspondence to and from Kirk Munroe is meager and focused exclusively on his family
for the years 1867-1869. There is considerable correspondence to and from his second
wife, Mabel Stearns Munroe, with reference to a proposed biography of Kirk. Her
correspondents include Poultney Bigelow, Frank W. Buxton, Randolph Edgar, Duncan U.
Fletcher, Ward Greene, Hermann Hagedorn, James K. Hand, Arthur Milton Pope, Herbert
Putnam, William F. Raney, Clement Francis Robinson, William A. Rodgers, Charles Scribner
(1854-1930) W. P. Stephens, Lyman Beecher Stowe, and Ray L. Wilbur. </p>

contains family and biographical material, photographs, printed matter, various topical
files, and scrapbooks of miscellaneous writings, diary excerpts, correspondence.
photographs, and clippings. Depicted in the photographs in addition to the Munroe family
are canoeing and bicycling scenes, views from a trip to Hudson Bay in 1909, Indians, and
the Monroe home in Florida. Some of these same topics are documented in a subject file
within the series, which also contains oversize drawings, sketches, and watercolors.</p>

1932-1963, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1957-1962.
The collection consists primarily of correspondence and speeches, supplemented
by reports, memoranda, newspaper clippings, photographs, and biographical
information. The papers are organized into three groupings: subject file,
speeches and writings, and miscellany. </p>
<p>The correspondence in the subject file is composed primarily of
carbons or photocopies of incoming and outgoing letters for the years
1956-1962. There is no correspondence previous to 1956. The correspondence is
mostly of a business nature and concerns Murphree’s activities as president
of Esso Research and Engineering Company, the research and development arm of
the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and his activities as an official of
the Fifth World Petroleum Congress in the period 1956-1960. Of special interest
in the Fifth World Petroleum Congress file is correspondence relating to the
admission of Soviet scientists to the United States and their restriction with
regard to technical information. </p>
<p>Correspondents include William Sterling Byrd Lacy, John A. McCone,
Richard M. Nixon, Glenn Theodore Seaborg, Lewis L. Strauss, and Edward
Teller.</p>
<p> Murphree’s writings include typed, mimeographed, and handwritten
copies of his speeches, addresses, and published articles for 1932-1962. An
index to the published articles is in the biographical file in the
miscellany.</p>

<p>The papers of Albert James Myer (1829-1880) span the years 1851-1933, with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1851-1880. The collection contains
correspondence, biographical material, and printed matter relating to Myer's service as
a surgeon in the army from 1854 to 1860, especially his assignments at Fort Davis and
Fort Duncan in Texas, where he observed warfare with Native American groups, and to his
role in the founding and development of the Signal Corps, 1856-1880. Also treated is the
contribution of the Signal Corps to Union military efforts in the Civil War.
Correspondents include Myer's wife, Catherine Walden Myer, and James Walden.</p>

<p>The papers of Joseph Holt (1807-1894) span the years 1797-1917, with the bulk of the
material concentrated in the period 1859-1889. The collection consists principally of
correspondence supplemented by diaries, ledgers, account books, bills and receipts,
briefs and other legal papers, newspaper clippings, speeches, photographs, and printed
matter. The collection is organized into seven series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="genmat">

</ref>. </p>
<p>Holt’s career as newspaper editor, lawyer, local politician, cabinet
member, and first judge advocate general of the United States Army is illumined
by this collection. Holt’s correspondence from the 1830s and 1840s relates
largely to legal matters and politics in Kentucky and Mississippi. In
particular, the letters from Albert Gallatin Hawes, a United States
Representative from Kentucky, afford generous glimpses into politics of that
state. </p>
<p>The emerging sectional conflicts that ultimately led to the Civil War
drew Holt into national politics. On the eve of the war he occupied a prominent
place in the ranks of the Democratic Party. In 1859, he was appointed
postmaster general by President James Buchanan. In January 1861, he was
appointed secretary of war, an appointment he later described in an article
entitled “How I Became Secretary of War.” Among Holt’s tasks as secretary
of war was keeping the peace in the capital during Lincoln’s inauguration.
Correspondence between Holt and Winfield Scott reflects concern over numerous
rumors of planned assassination attempts by the Knights of the Golden Circle
and other pro-Southern organizations.</p>
<p> On Sept. 3, 1862, Holt was appointed judge advocate general of the
army. Though a Southerner and a Democrat, he supported the Union. The
newly-created post to which he was named carried the responsibility for the
establishment of military commissions with jurisdiction over civilian
offenders.</p>
<p> On May 4, 1865, a military commission was convened to try the Abraham
Lincoln assassination conspirators. The event was to color the rest of Holt’s
life. The Holt Papers contain voluminous correspondence regarding the
commission as well as affidavits, depositions, transcribed testimony, and
various versions of the charges against the conspirators. Particularly
noteworthy is the correspondence between Holt and Louis J. Weichmann, a
principal government witness in the conspiracy trial. Their correspondence
began in May 1865 and continued for almost thirty years. Also in the collection
are items relating to allegations that Holt suppressed a clemency petition
addressed to President Andrew Johnson on behalf of Mary Surratt; a seven-page
letter from Mrs. Samuel Mudd to Holt, pleading her husband’s innocence;
Holt’s correspondence with other members of the commission after the trial;
and a draft of the charges against the conspirators in the handwriting of
Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. </p>
<p>Correspondents include Jeremiah S. Black, James Buchanan, Simon
Cameron, James A. Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, John Marshall Harlan, John Hay,
Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Mary Harrison Holt, Margaret Wickliffe Holt, Richard S.
Holt, Samuel P. Holt, Thomas H. Holt, Reverdy Johnson, Horatio King, Harriet

<p>The papers of Merrill Moore (1903-1957) span the period 1904-1979, with the bulk of the
material concentrated in the years 1928-1957. The collection consists primarily of
correspondence and writings, supplemented by diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, printed
matter, clippings, and miscellany. Documenting Moore's career as a psychiatrist and
poet, the papers are organized into nine series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="dairy">Diaries, Reminiscences, and Notebooks</ref>; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="family">Family Correspondence and Special File</ref>;
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="general">General

<p>Moore made sporadic efforts to keep a diary, but his notes are extensive only for the
period he spent in New Zealand during World War II. These notes are accompanied by
memoranda and miscellaneous items that he collected in anticipation of writing a book
based on his experiences. This material, which documents his service as a medical
officer as well as his literary activities and plans, is most exhaustive for November
1942, when he sailed from San Francisco to Auckland, New Zealand, and for June 1943,
when he made a brief visit to Guadalcanal.</p>
<p>Material concerning Moore's medical career, which spanned almost three decades, is
contained in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="general">General
Correspondence</ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref> series. Graduating from Vanderbilt Medical School in 1928, Moore
served his internship in Nashville and then entered an extensive period of training in
neurology and psychiatry in the Boston area. During the course of his training, Moore
came into contact with several leading neurologists and psychiatrists, including
Alexandra Adler, Arlie V. Bock, Stanley Cobb, Winfred Overholser, Hanns Sachs, Harry C.
Solomon, and Frederic Lyman Wells. All are represented by correspondence.</p>
<p>Moore also devoted much time to original research, particularly in areas directly
related to mental illness and neurological disease. His extensive writings on the
subjects of alcoholism, suicide, syphilis, drug addiction, and related topics are
located in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject
File</ref>. Four years of military service in the Pacific theater failed to dampen
his productivity. His work in the areas of shell shock and alcoholism among military
personnel, as well as his efforts to encourage and improve neurological services in
military hospitals, is amply represented in both series.</p>
<p>Other subjects in the papers include Moore's efforts in 1938-1940 to aid Jewish doctors
who were fleeing Nazi Germany. Moore's role as a consultant in 1940-1941 with companies
making bromides, as well as controversies concerning the products' effectiveness, is
also documented, especially in correspondence with Walter Compton (1912-1955) and George
Ross Veazey in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject
File</ref> series. The papers also contain substantial material relating to Moore's
tour of duty in China in 1946 and correspondence in subsequent years with friends who
remained in China or were deeply concerned about conditions there.</p>
<p>In the tradition of Oliver Wendell Holmes and William Carlos Williams, Moore coupled his
medical career with an equally successful literary career. He derived much of his early
interest in literature from his father, John Trotwood Moore, a poet, novelist, essayist,
and historian. While still in high school, Moore developed his lifelong enthusiasm for
the sonnet as a medium of expression. Soon after entering Vanderbilt University, he
joined a group of fellow students and some of their teachers who were to form one of the
most distinctive and cohesive literary groups of the twentieth century. Adopting the
name Fugitives, the group made its contribution through the pages of <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Fugitive</part>
</title> (1922-1925), a magazine of verse. As a contributor to the magazine, Moore first
revealed the propensity for experimentation and innovation that would mark his
subsequent work and lead his biographer to characterize his poetry as “an essentially
new and a highly significant experiment.” <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot1">[1]</ref> At the same time, he cemented his commitment to sonnets.</p>
<p id="foot1">[1] Henry Willis Wells, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Poet and Psychiatrist: Merrill, M.D.</part>
</title> (New York: Twayne [1955]), 2.</p>
<p>In the following years, Moore became something of a literary phenomenon by writing over
fifty thousand sonnets, only a small portion of which were published. A large part of
this production is represented in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="litfile">Literary File</ref>. The series includes drafts, revisions, and
fragments, as well as complete sonnets, and provides a broad base for a full analysis of
his verse. The wide range of literary correspondence in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="general">General Correspondence </ref>and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref> series serves
as a valuable supplement to the work itself. Moore corresponded with numerous literary
figures, including Donald Davidson, Dudley Fitts, John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, and
Louis Untermeyer.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="addit">Addition</ref> to the papers
contains family and general correspondence and research material for a project Moore
conducted at the Harvard Psychology Clinic. Included are outlines, drafts, and
supplementary research, 1954-1975, for the publication of a book. Interviews were
conducted with Moore by Christiana D. Morgan. Excerpts from these interviews are
scattered throughout the Addition as well as earlier sessions conducted with Robert N.
Wilson, and research notes of Ina Mae Greer. Also included is a typescript of the
intended publication, designated second version: “Merrill Moore, M.D. The Creative
Process in a Living Poet: A Study of the Genesis of Certain Forms of the
Imagination.”</p>

<p>The papers of Garfield Bromley Oxnam (1891-1963) consist of diaries, correspondence,
subject files, writings, addresses, sermons, lectures, notebooks, scrapbooks, daily
records, and related material documenting the span of Bishop Oxnam's long career of
religious and public service. The material extends from 1823 to 1963, with the bulk of
the papers falling within the period 1912-1960. The collection is organized into eight
series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diary">Diaries and

<p>The diaries, subject files, and writings constitute the most important parts of the
collection. Extensive and voluminous, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="diary">diaries</ref> are supplemented by correspondence, newspaper clippings,
programs, church bulletins, photographs, articles, book reviews, addresses, sermons,
lectures, notes, memoranda, reports, and records. Although there are no diaries for
1922, 1924, 1925, 1927, and 1932, entries for these years are contained in miscellaneous
volumes at the end of the series. The diary entries for 1961-1963 are sketchy and
sparse.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref> series
covers Oxnam's role in controversies over diplomatic relations between the United States
and the Vatican, his participation in the issue of church and state and Protestantism as
it related to Catholicism, the charges made against him of un-Americanism, his work with
the Church of All Nations in Los Angeles, academic career, and other subjects closely
related to Oxnam's life.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref> series
presents in great detail Oxnam's life as reported by the press. He was involved in
public as well as religious affairs, and his activities and views generated considerable

<p>The records of the San José de Queréndaro Hacienda consist of two manuscript volumes
relating principally to the areas surrounding La Laguna de Cuitzeo, Michoacán de Ocampo,
in the period 1543-1922. Written in Spanish, the bulk of the documents span the years
1580-1883, with the years 1700-1731, 1805-1839, and 1862-1883 especially well covered.
Each volume is separated into <emph render="italic">cuadernos</emph>, subdivisions based
on subject content. </p>
<p>The Compañía de Jesús (Society of Jesus) received official royal title to the lands in
1643. As early as 1631 the Hacienda de Queréndaro, under the jurisdiction of the Colegio
de Valladolid, produced 1000 bushels of wheat, 600 bushels of maize, and raised 200
cattle and 30 horses. The Jesuit occupiers of the land added to their holdings, most
notably entering into an agreement in 1720 to purchase the adjoining haciendas of San
Antonio, San Bernardo, Zinzimeo, and la Trasquila from the Conde de Lizarraga. By 1767
production included wheat, maize, chiles, beans, sugar, and both large and small
livestock. In 1767 the expulsion of the Jesuits from all Spanish territory as enemies of
the Crown resulted in the expropriation of Queréndaro by the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Ramo de Temporalidades</part>
</title>.</p>
<p> In 1804 the Condes de Heras Soto purchased the estate from the Crown. Sebastian de
Heras Soto served as a royalist commander in the War of Independence. His son, Manuel de
Heras Soto, signed the Act of Mexican Independence, and his decendant, Tómas López
Pimentel, was a supporter of the Mexican empire of Maximillian of Hapsburg. During the
nineteenth century, the Heras/Pimentel family were accused of claiming or purchasing
lands which ostensibly belonged to the neighboring indigenous towns of Zinapécuaro and
Queréndaro.</p>
<p> Documents in these volumes served as supporting evidence in disputes between the owners
of the Hacienda de Queréndaro, neighboring estates, and nearby indigenous pueblos. The
majority of the litigation revolved around the claims of the Jesuits and subsequent
owners of the Hacienda de Queréndaro to various lands and waters in the region. These
claims were frequently disputed by the Hacienda de Santa Clara de Tulillo and the
Pueblos de Queréndaro and Zinapécuaro.</p>
<p> The records include various <title localtype="simple">
<part>Real Provisiones</part>
</title> (royal decrees), <title localtype="simple">
<part>Audiencia</part>
</title> rulings, <emph render="italic">mercedes</emph> (land grants), acts of land
possession, various suits and countersuits, correspondence, estate inventories, wills
and testaments, bills of sale, rental agreements, mortgage/loan material, and fiscal
accounts. Subjects include the acquisition and sale of land, ownership disputes, water
rights, the establishment of property boundaries, rental of property, relations with
indigenous villages, legal procedure, the role of women in estate operations,
inheritance, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Temporalidades</part>
</title> (the royal branch responsible for the sale of Jesuit properties), the impact of
the Mexican War of Independence, agricultural production, the functioning of an <emph render="italic">obraje</emph>, and railway construction. The documents may have been
assembled in their present form in the 1920s-1930s as part of the last recorded dispute
between the Hacienda de Queréndaro and Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México y Anexas. </p>
<p>Individual owners and important figures appearing in the text include Manuel Abad y
Quiepo, Juan Bárcena, Miguel Bárcena, Sebastian de Heras Soto, first Conde de Heras
Soto, Ignacio de Heras Soto, Mariana de Heras Soto (b. 1791), Mariana de Heras Soto

<p>The autograph collection of Sarah Stone (fl. 1840) spans the years
1720-1962, with the latest autographed item dating from 1947. The collection
contains letters, clipped signatures, and other signed items of prominent
American and a few British figures, chiefly of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p> The collection originated with Henry Colman (1785-1849), a Unitarian
clergyman and friend of the Stone family, who initiated it with the gift of
nineteen items to Sarah Stone in the early 1840s. Colman had received the items
mainly in the course of studying agricultural methods in this country and in
Europe, including signed letters by George Washington and British General
Augustine Prevost during the Revolutionary War. Colman’s correspondents
include John Adams, Henry Clay, Edward Everett ( who in 1837 appointed him
commissioner to make an agricultural survey of Massachusetts) Angelina Emily
Grimké, Benjamin Silliman, James Madison, Daniel Webster, and Martin Van
Buren.</p>
<p> Other persons represented include John Quincy Adams, James Buchanan,
Benjamin F. Butler, John C. Calhoun, Albert Einstein, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
Alexander Hamilton, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Thomas Jefferson, James Russell
Lowell, Charles Eliot Norton, and Booker T. Washington. Some letters were
received by Sarah Stone herself or by members of her family, who were sailors
and ship owners of Salem, Massachusetts, during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, active in trade with China, Sumatra, and the West Indies. Some were
friends of the family of Washington Irving. There are references to Irving in
their correspondence as well as one of the author’s letters and a page of a
manuscript in his hand.</p>

<p>The papers of diplomat and economist Norman Hezekiah Davis (1878-1944) span the years
1898-1979 with the bulk of the material concentrated between 1915 and 1944. In 1902
Davis began his business career in Cuba where he organized the Trust Company of Cuba. He
commenced a public career in 1917 and served in four presidential administrations
consulting on international finance at the Department of Treasury, the Department of
State, and international conferences and committees during World War I and the the
interwar period. Davis was chairman of the of the American Red Cross from 1938 to his
death in 1944. </p>

chiefly to Davis’s services as a participant in international conferences and
commissions on peace, disarmament, monetary matters and as a financial and economic
consultant. The series includes material on conferences and organizations including the
Supreme Economic Council of the Allied and Associated Powers (1914-1920), the Armistice,
Paris Peace Conference (1919), International Economic Conference (Geneva, 1927), League

<p>Included in the collection are military records of Doolittle and a large amount of
photographs and printed material. In general, the correspondence contains routine
discussions of business matters, hunting trips, social affairs, and reunions of the
American fliers who attacked Tokyo in April 1942. Materials relating to the raid include
a map of Japan signed by some of the participants, telegrams from Generals George C.
Marshall and Henry Harley Arnold, a handwritten memorandum from Admiral Ernest Joseph
King, and letters of thanks and appreciation from Admiral William F. Halsey and May
Ling-Soong Chiang. Additional correspondents from the war period include letters from
Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton, Carl Spaatz, and Maxwell D. Taylor.</p>
<p>An addition to the papers includes correspondence, articles about Doolittle, and a photograph showing a formation of B-25s in dual mode. Most of the correspondence consists of short notes from Doolittle thanking Lee R. Magnolia for sending clippings related to aviation, aerospace, politics, whaling, and other topics. </p>

<p>The papers of Richard Dudman (1918- ) span the years 1911-2014 and consist of
correspondence, notebooks, writings, and background material relating mainly to his
career as a journalist with the <title>
<part>St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</part>
</title> Prominent topics include his coverage of the war in Vietnam and reporting on
the Middle East, Cuba, Southeast Asia, and China during a period of cold war and
revolutions. Others subjects relate to domestic politics in the 1960s and 1970s
including Watergate, right-wing conservatism, and the Jimmy Carter administration. The
collection is organized into six series whose contents reflect the arrangement and
description of the material as it was received in installments from Dudman: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">General Correspondence</ref>,<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Note"> Notebooks</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Write">Writings</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Add1">Addition I</ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Add2">Addition II</ref>. </p>
<p>In the spring of 1965, the studied calm that generally characterizes meetings of the
Massachusetts Historical society was disturbed when a troubled federal judge, Charles
Wyzanski, posed several questions about the course of current events.[<ref target="note1">1</ref>] Judge Wyzanski was bothered by the little-debated but
widening war in Vietnam, and he asked Walter Lippman, a guest of the society, if all the
facts were accessible to the “informed public,” which he defined as “the type that reads
the New York papers and the Washington papers.” Lippmann replied that the most relevant
facts were available, but not in the New York or Washington papers, and he praised a
recent series by “a correspondent of the <title>
<part>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</part>
</title> who's an old hand out there, Richard Dudman . . . . I have checked those
articles against our own intelligence sources privately. They are perfectly correct. . .
. [H]e shows that the Viet Cong has won the war in the countryside of South Vietnam.”
[<ref target="note2">2</ref>]</p>
<p>Richard Dudman had been a reporter for the <title>
<part>Post-Dispatch</part>
</title> since, 1949, and Walter Lippman's endorsement reflected the widespread respect
that Dudman's work enjoyed among readers and reporters alike. His news articles and
columns are a distillation of the major public events of the post-war era, and his
papers provide important insights into the character of his career. The papers, listed
in the 1978 [Manuscript Division] acquisitions report, were formally deposited by Mr.
Dudman in 1979. They range from 1946 to 1978 and include correspondence, research files,
clippings, and notebooks that document a newspaperman's odyssey. There are fascinating
glimpses of half a dozen revolutions, Israeli operations in the 1956 Sinai campaign, the
Lebanon crisis of 1958, Cuba, Laos, Cambodia, China, the two Vietnams, and other
troubled spots throughout the world. Dudman's papers are also valuable for exploring a
wide range of domestic political problems, and there are interesting files on right-wing
politics, the Watergate scandals, and other major issues that have emerged since World
War II. In 1969, after twenty years and over fifteen hundred stories with the <title>
<part>Post-Dispatch, </part>
</title>he became chief of the newspaper's Washington bureau, a post from which he
continued to survey American politics and the world beyond until his retirement. </p>
<p>The collection consists of approximately sixty-three hundred items, and it has an
organic character that gives it special value for researchers. There are clear
relationships between the notebooks, the columns, and the correspondence that permit one
to follow the story as it emerged, as it appeared, and as it provided the basis for
Dudman's further reflections. On a number of matters, such as the Dixon-Yates plan,
Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign, and negotiations leading to American withdrawal
in Vietnam, there are memoranda from Dudman to his editors that show how his articles
took shape. More frequently, fragments appear in his notebooks that help one understand
events as they unfolded for him. Correspondence with readers and fellow newsmen gives
other insights into Dudman's efforts to reconstruct and interpret the events of the day. </p>
<p>Wide-ranging personal interests and the multiple demands made on reporters in a
Washington bureau have led Dudman to explore an incredible range of problems, but he is
perhaps most frequently associated with his coverage of the war in Vietnam. Dudman first
went to South Vietnam in 1962, and his many subsequent visits to the field combined with
his assessment of his decisions in Washington to make him and the <title>
<part>Post-Dispatch</part>
</title> leading critics of the war. In early 1965, while he was in Vietnam preparing
the series that Lippman praised, Dudman wrote his colleague Marquis Childs, that “[m]y
own view is that the war is being lost, and in a hurry.” As events developed during the
remainder of the decade, Dudman retained a commendable open-minded sensitivity to the
complexities of the quagmire, but his earliest impression that the war was an
overwhelmingly flawed enterprise continued to be the central theme of his reporting.
Thus the jottings in his notebooks on Vietnam are particularly lively, and they reveal
the human dimensions as well as the structural dynamics of war. Typical notes from
January 1970 describe Henry Kissinger's deputy, General Al Haig, as “RA [Regular Army]
all the way. . . . JCS insisted he sit at Henry's elbow. Sits on Henry's info flow.” A
briefing on the situation in Vietnam was summed up as<title>
<part> “The line—Enemy capability down,” </part>
</title>with emphasis supplied by the uncharacteristic underscoring.<title>
<part> “All quotas met” </part>
</title>(and furiously underscored by Dudman) characterized the Phoenix program, an
element in the assault on the Viet Cong infrastructure that included assassination.
Dudman wrote several critical pieces about the Phoenix program, and his papers also
include interesting exchanges with government officials who ran the program. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most unusual documents in the Dudman Papers are the notes he took during May
and June 1970, when he and two other reporters covering the Cambodian incursion were
captured by forces of the National Liberation Front. Dudman and his colleagues were held
for forty days, and following his release he transformed these jottings, many of them on
student's lined copybook paper, into one of the most dramatic series of the war. Other
materials relating to the series and to the book that followed, <title>
<part>Forty Days with the Enemy</part>
</title> (New York: Liversight, 1971. 182 p.), are contained in the papers. Dudman's
capture and release gave renewed hope to the families of many journalists who had not
been so fortunate, and he began to play a larger role in the many efforts to secure the
return of those still listed among the missing. One of the most poignant experiences of
the war is reflected in his exchanges with Patricia Hangen, the wife of a missing
television correspondent, and her spirit, persistence, and dignity give the tragedy of
her husband's disappearance in Cambodia a special sadness. </p>
<p>It is appropriate that a collection which documents the full range of public issues also
runs the gamut of private emotions, for there are lighter moments in the Dudman Papers
that give some balance to the more somber situations he encountered. Among the most
delightful notes in the collection are letters from his daughters in 1966, when he was
midway through his third trip to Vietnam. Janet, a high school student, sought his
advice about which modern language she should study. “I am seriously considering Russian
but I don't know. Please answer because we have to answer soon.” His daughter Martha
asked him “to write me about the situation there, and explain it so I can tell those
guys I argue with. OK?” Such family letters appear throughout the collection, and they
will provide students of modern journalism with a valuable angle of vision on the life
of a reporter on assignment. </p>
<p>Following a tour of the Middle East in 1956, Dudman wrote Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., his
publisher, that he “found government leaders impressed that a Middle Western American
newspaper would send its own reporter there, and they were correspondingly helpful.”
Dudman's career and the traditions of the <title>
<part>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</part>
</title> confirm the important national contributions that regional newspapers have made
to the American experience. The Library of Congress is fortunate to have the papers of
many who have been associated with the <title>
<part>Post-Dispatch, </part>
</title>such as Joseph Pulitzer, Joseph Pulitzer, Jr., Irving Brant, Bill Mauldin, and
Wallace Deuel. Thus future students will be able to consult the Dudman Papers within a
particularly rich documentary context.</p>

<p>The papers of Samuel Franklin Emmons (1841-1911) span the years
1725-1913, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1861-1911.
The collection consists of diaries and field notes, letterbooks,
correspondence, family papers, subject files, financial records, photographs,
printed matter, and scrapbooks. Some material is in French, German, Spanish,
and Italian. The collection was damaged by fire and water prior to being
received by the Library and much of it is in fragile or decayed condition. </p>
<p>The papers treat Emmons's education, personal life, and business
ventures, but the focus is on his explorations in the western United States, on
geological formations and mines and mining, and on the United States Geological
Survey that Emmons cofounded with Clarence King (1842-1901). Prominent in the
collection are files pertaining to the United States Geological Exploration of
the Fortieth Parallel, 1867-1876. There is considerable family material,
including correspondence with his uncle, N. Henry Evans, and papers relating to

consists of correspondence dating between 1927 and 1941 centering on Fitzpatrick's
service as editor of <title localtype="simple">
<part>
<emph render="italic">The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript
Sources, 1745-1799</emph>
</part>
</title>, prepared under the direction of the George Washington Bicentennial Commission.
Included are letters concerning the location of original Washington documents to be
published in the volumes and correspondence with the Government Printing Office relating
to the printing of these volumes.</p>
<p> Because Fitzpatrick was widely regarded as an authority on George
Washington, much of the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
General
Correspondence
</ref> series concerns inquiries the editor received about
Washington. The nationwide observance of the bicentennial of Washington's birth
stimulated interest in every conceivable aspect of Washington's personal and
public life. Fitzpatrick's replies to these wide-ranging questions are a
valuable source of information on Washington. Various letters concern
Washington's appearance and his dental problems, dentures, and dentist. There
is also correspondence regarding the president's birthday, birthplace, death,
burial, grave, and life mask, as well as other questions about his education
and his ideas on education, his library, bookplate, sword, and the coat of arms
and genealogy of the Washington family. Also included is a reply concerning a
portrait of Mary Ball Washington, George Washington's mother, and considerable
material on various portraits of Washington and Jean Antoine Houdon's bust of
the president. Additionally, Fitzpatrick received many inquiries about the
Washington "scandals," which he had attempted to refute in his pamphlet
published in 1929. Washington's acts of charity, his religion and the so-called
Washington's prayer, and his order against profanity are among other topics
covered. </p>
<p>Fitzpatrick also received letters inquiring about Washington's surveys, travels, and writings,
including among the latter his diaries, journals, account books, farewell address to
the army, presidential farewell address, and both inaugural addresses. There is
material relating to Mount Vernon, to Washington's marriage, including the date,
place, and officiating minister, and to Washington's Masonic activities. There is
also material relating to the origin of the Purple Heart award, correspondence about
the papers of Washington's aide and friend, Tobias Lear, and answers to queries
regarding the Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="solb">
Sol Bloom
</ref>, United States
representative from New York, was vice chairman of the Washington Bicentennial
Commission. There are letters to and from him in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
General Correspondence
</ref> series and also a
separate series of his correspondence in connection with the commission. Bloom was
interested in the observance of the sesquicentennial of the Constitution, and his
correspondence contains a file, 1934-1938, concerning this project. William H.
Richardson of New Jersey is also heavily represented in Fitzpatrick's <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corr">
General Correspondence
</ref>.
Richardson wrote extensively about the history of New Jersey during the American
Revolution, Washington's activities in New Jersey, and the "Flying Camp." Also
included in the collection is a file of mimeographed and printed matter that was
sent to Fitzpatrick by Richardson.</p>
<p> Among the items in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">

</ref>
are photostats of letters of most signers of the Constitution, drafts of and notes
for speeches by Fitzpatrick, proofs of the index and illustrative material for

works (schematic plans or layouts of an integrated circuit or computer chip)
deposited with the Library of Congress Copyright Office. Per the Semiconductor
Chip Protection Act of 1984, mask works are deposited with the Copyright Office
by their manufacturers. The Copyright Office is obligated to retain the designs
thirteen years after registration. Because Copyright Records Management was
ready to dispose of the mask works it was no longer obligated to keep, the
Manuscript Division decided to retain them by transfer. The Manuscript Division
retained a representative sampling (every twentieth deposit) rather than accept
the entire transfer.</p>

<p>Rapaport's correspondence dates primarily from 1948 to 1960 during his
years at the Austen Riggs Center. It focuses on his research and writings in
psychology and psychoanalysis including his development of diagnostic
psychological testing and his efforts to clarify and systematize psychoanalytic
theory. The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="igencorrespond">

</ref> series contains Rapaport's extensive correspondence with
psychologists, psychoanalysts, and professional organizations in the United
States. Correspondence with colleagues overseas is located in the

</ref> series
documents Rapaport's prolific writing career, his extensive teaching
experience, and his numerous speaking engagements. Drafts of articles, books,
book reviews, lectures, and speeches, transcripts of discussions,
correspondence with colleagues, and research material explore his research
interests in psychological diagnostic testing, ego psychology, emotions and
memory, metapsychology, motivation, psychoanalytic theory, and thought
processes. </p>
<p>Part II contains an addition to the Rapaport Papers. Included are
photocopies of outgoing letters, largely dated 1950-1960, and a lengthy letter
to friends describing a trip to his native Hungary in 1960. Also included are a
series of dream notes made by Rapaport as part of his research on
consciousness. The addition further includes two of his early psychological
works published in Hungary prior to his immigration to the United States. </p>

<p>The papers of Edgar Kobak span the years 1916-1966, with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1949-1962, during Kobak's
semi-retirement as a business consultant and communications expert in New York.
The collection consists of five series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="autobinter">
Autobiographical Interview,

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp">

</ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella">

</ref>. Included are subject files of personal
business affairs and miscellaneous clippings and scrapbooks. In the
correspondence is an autograph file of letters from prominent individuals who
wrote to Kobak during his career with McGraw-Hill, the National Broadcasting
Company, and other business firms for which he was either a consultant or
director.</p>
<p> A key feature of the collection is an autobiographical account of the
years Kobak spent at McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. Also of importance is the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp">
General
Correspondence
</ref> of letters sent and received from notable politicians,
philanthropists, and military figures, mostly from the 1950s. The main portion
of the correspondence, however, deals with companies that used Kobak's
consulting service and with the various advertising and philanthropic
organizations with which Kobak was associated in the last fifteen years of his
life. Among the most significant and substantive of these letters are those
from the National Association of Broadcasters, the S &amp; C Electric Company,
and the A. C. Nielsen Company. There are also several folders of papers for the
period before 1949, as for example the correspondence files for the Mutual
Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company. Only a small amount
of Kobak's personal correspondence is present in these papers, most of it with
his son, Edgar H. Kobak.</p>
<p> The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speewrit">
Speeches and
Writings
</ref> series, which covers the years 1928-1962, offers perhaps the
best representation of Kobak's work in broadcasting. In them can be found
material relating to the first generation of radio and television, to Kobak's
expertise in public relations, and to federal policy concerning communications.
A smaller and less significant part of the collection is the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="buspap">
Business
Papers
</ref> file. It is devoted exclusively to Kobak's private business
ventures with a farm and radio station in Thomson, Georgia. </p>
<p>Correspondents in addition to those cited include John Conrad,
Nicholas J. Conrad, George Vernon Denny, Edward J. Mehren, and A. C. Nielsen.
The autograph file contains brief notes, usually thank-you letters, from
individuals such as John F. Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson (1900-1964), Harry S.
Truman, Lucius D. Clay, and Tom Clark.</p>

(commissary-general, British army), dealing with trade conditions, Loyalist
matters, progress of British-American relations, and the proceedings for
recovery of property seized from Isaac Low during the Revolution.
Correspondence of Mordecai Lewis &amp; Company, merchants of Philadelphia,
relates in part to events in Congress during the first session following the
adoption of the Constitution. The collection also includes papers relating to
Low’s lands in Kentucky, Ohio, and New York; the founding of Ballston Spa and
Lowville, New York; the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures; and other
matters relating to life in New York. Prominent as well is material relating to

articles on hygiene and medical matters. There are also articles derived from
McGee's studies of communist societies in the United States such as the

<p>The papers of Edward Tracy Clark (1878-1935) cover his political and business activities
during the years between 1923 and 1935, with the bulk of the material concentrated in
the period 1929-1935. When Coolidge came to Washington, D.C., as vice president, Clark,
a fellow alumnus of Amherst College, accompanied him as his secretary. Tracy remained in
his secretarial position in the White House until 1929 when Coolidge chose not to run
for reelection. The collection includes Clark's personal papers for a few years after he
left the political world and entered business, as well as speeches of Calvin
Coolidge.</p>
<p>The Clark correspondence is most numerous for the years following 1929, when he served
as a consultant on legislative, customs, and tariff matters for various business
concerns. His activities as the president's secretary are reflected in Coolidge's
letters to Clark and in carbon copies of his replies on a variety of subjects, including
the Permanent Court of International Justice, Massachusetts politics, patronage, the
McNary-Haugen Farm Bill, Mexican confiscation, and also tickets to Army-Navy football
games, class reunions at Amherst College, and shirts for the president. </p>
<p>The correspondence contains numerous letters to Clark from Coolidge written after he
left the White House. There are also letters from Coolidge's wife, Grace Goodhue
Coolidge, and his sons, John Coolidge and Calvin Coolidge (1908-1924). Other
correspondents include Bruce Barton, William M. Butler, Chauncey M. Depew, William J.
Donovan, Alfred M. Landon, David Lawrence, Louis Liggett, Henry Cabot Lodge (1850-1924),
Andrew W. Mellon, Ogden Livingston Mills, Dwight W. Morrow, David I. Walsh, and Roy Owen

<p>The papers of Frank Knox (1877-1944) span the years 1898-1954. The collection consists
mainly of family and special correspondence, some general correspondence, Knox's
speeches and writings, correspondence and speeches of his wife, Annie Reid Knox, and a
clippings file. Additional papers donated by Annie Reid Knox document the establishment
of the Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship at Harvard University. The Knox Papers are
strongest for his role in politics and government service; they contain little material
relating to his career as a publisher. The collection is organized into eight series:
<ref target="dairy"> Diaries </ref>, <ref target="famcorresp"> Family Correspondence
</ref>, <ref target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="specorresp"> Special Correspondence </ref>, <ref target="speech"> Speeches

<p>The <ref target="famcorresp"> Family Correspondence </ref> reflects Knox's service as a
private in the Rough Riders regiment in the Spanish-American War and his World War I
service as an artillery officer. The letters to his wife in the 1930s and 1940s provide
insights into the development of his public career. A <ref target="specorresp"> Special
Correspondence </ref> file of letters with Theodore Roosevelt documents Knox's
support of Roosevelt's political ambitions from 1911 through 1918. </p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence </ref>extends from 1917 through
1944, but the bulk of the material covers Knox's service as secretary of the navy. This
series includes letters with many prominent public figures such as Calvin Coolidge,
Henry Ford, James Forrestal, Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, Chiang Kai-shek, Harold L.
Ickes, Walter Lippmann, George Marshall, John Adam Muehling, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Arthur H. Vandenberg, William Allen White, Wendell Willkie.</p>
<p> Knox's <ref target="speech"> Speeches and Writings </ref> cover the major addresses he
delivered from the late 1930s through his tenure as secretary of the navy. The writings
include a series of editorials he wrote from 1934 to 1940 while he was publisher and
editor of the Chicago Daily News. The clippings file contains rather extensive coverage
of Knox's campaign as Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1936.</p>

<p>The papers of Maud Wood Park (1871-1955) detail the personal life and
civic involvement of a prominent feminist and social reformer who became the
first president of the National League of Women Voters. Spanning the years
1844-1979, the papers are concentrated in the period between 1886 and 1951. The
early material is essentially that of Park’s father, James R. Wood, Sr.
Posthumous papers contributed to the collection by Edna Lamprey Stantial in the
form of correspondence, notes, and miscellany relate to such figures of the
suffrage movement as Florence Ellinwood Allen, Jennie L. Barron, and Carrie
Chapman Catt. The collection is organized into five series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fampap">

</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="correspond">

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="speechwrit">
Speeches

</ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscella">
Miscellany
</ref>.</p>
<p> The bulk of the family material consists of correspondence between
Park and her second husband, Robert Freeman Hunter. The exchanges begin in
1886, twenty-two years prior to their marriage, and extend to Hunter’s death in
1928. Park’s role as a leading organizer in the suffrage movement required
extensive travel throughout the country, and Hunter’s career in the theater
made him equally nomadic. Students of women’s history will find this
correspondence particularly useful, for it contains remarks by Park on tactics,
strategy, and the ideology of reform. Furthermore, the differences as well as
the distances that separated Park and Hunter lend a special character to these
exchanges as sources for exploring the evolution of the women’s movement. The
correspondence with her husband was particularly important to Park. She
considered publishing it, and much of the material is represented only in the
form of transcripts. For a quarter century following Hunter’s death, she
continued to write him anniversary letters on the occasion of their marriage,
birthdays, and New Year’s day. </p>
<p>Other family correspondence supplements these themes in helpful ways,
such as a revealing analysis of Park’s personality in the Hunter file that he
prepared for a mutual friend, Helen Maria Biscoe. The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="fampap">
Family
Papers
</ref> also include Park’s correspondence with her first husband, Charles
Edward Park; the Civil War memoirs of her father, James R. Wood, Sr., a Union
scout during the war; and miscellaneous Hunter and Wood family material. </p>
<p>The
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="correspond">
Correspondence
</ref> file, particularly the special
correspondence with such individuals as Florence Ellinwood Allen, Helen Maria
Biscoe, Alice Stone Blackwell, Carrie Chapman Catt, Inez Haynes Gillmore, Mary
H. Page, Mary Gray Peck, Pauline A. Shaw, Belle Sherwin, Ann Webster, and Mabel
Caldwell Willard, documents personal friendships between Park and many of the
women involved in the suffrage movement. Many of these correspondents are also
represented in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject
File
</ref> because of their contributions to the various organizations and
events of the period. Included also in the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject
File
</ref> is information relating to Park’s lecture tours for the Boston Equal
Suffrage Association for Good Government (Boston League of Women Voters), as
well as papers and material relating to the activities of the Congressional
Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and legislative
activities of the National League of Women Voters, 1922-1925.</p>
<p> The preservation of the papers of the woman’s suffrage movement was
very important to Maud Park, and she devoted considerable energy during her
retirement to securing the documentary legacy of the suffrage movement and
creating conditions to sustain scholarship. Radcliffe College was at the center
of her efforts and the papers illuminate her contributions to the development
of the Woman’s Rights Collection and her work in establishing a series of
fellowships to permit younger scholars to study there. In addition, there are
materials on the development of manuscript holdings in woman’s history at the
Library of Congress and elsewhere. Of special importance is her correspondence
with W. K. Jordan and Edna Lamprey Stantial, as well as Stantial’s
correspondence relating to the presentation of records and papers.</p>
<p> After retiring from an active role on the national level with the
National League of Women Voters, Maud Park returned to Maine and wrote several
plays and novels. Only a small representation of her literary work is present
in this collection. Typescripts of the unpublished novel “Lisa” and the
published play
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Play Stone</part>
</title>, with correspondence, publicity folio, and some
technical information relating to the production of the play by the Federal
Theater Project in 1939, are a part of the writings file. </p>
<p>Edna Stantial indicates in her notes accompanying the collection that
for a number of years Park carefully reviewed her personal papers, because her
ultimate plans were to write an autobiography. Her efforts toward this goal are
autobiographical notes that cover the various phases of her life from
pre-school days to approximately 1946.</p>
<p> The Park papers conclude with an autograph collection containing
letters and autographs of many prominent political, social, and literary
figures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including Louisa May Alcott,
Clara Barton, Louis Dembitz Brandeis, William Cullen Bryant, Frederick
Douglass, Robert Frost, William Lloyd Garrison, Jeannette Rankin, Harriet
Beecher Stowe, and Booker T. Washington.</p>

<p>The papers of Alton Brooks Parker (1852-1926) span the years
1878-1937, with the bulk of the material from 1904 to 1926. The collection
consists of correspondence, speeches, scrapbooks, clippings, printed matter,
photographs, invitations, legal opinions, financial records, and
autobiographical and biographical material. The papers are organized into seven
series:

<p>The papers of James Alexander Robertson (1873-1939) extend from 1816 through 1939, with
the bulk of the material dated 1898-1939. The major portion of the papers focuses on
Robertson's career as editor, bibliographer, librarian, and educator, a professional
life that spanned the first four decades of the twentieth century and was devoted to the
study of Hispanic America, Florida, and the Philippines. The collection is organized into six series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Diary">Diaries</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">Correspondence</ref>,
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Write">Writings File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Misc">
Miscellany</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Over">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">Correspondence</ref> series constitutes the bulk of the collection and
is divided into three subseries: Family, Special, and General. Some correspondence is in
Spanish and French. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Write">Writings File</ref> includes translations
and editorial notes by Robertson as well as his poems and miscellaneous writings.
Included in the papers are two manuscripts pertaining to Americans in Latin America,
1835 and 1845.</p>
<p> Robertson's letters to his wife, Cora Halsey Robertson, began in 1910, two years prior
to their marriage and continued to 1938. The <ref target="famcor">Family
Correspondence</ref> also includes exchanges with his children and relatives. This
correspondence is particularly revealing for his work on the Philippines from 1910 to
1915, and it gives a daily account of his private and family life. Much of the
correspondence dated 1939 relates to his illness and death. </p>
<p>Robertson's contribution as compiler and coeditor of the fifty-five volumes of
<title>
<part>The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803</part>
</title> is described in the <ref target="speccor">Special Correspondence</ref> from his collaborator, Emma Helen
Blair. This correspondence also gives an account of his travels to Spain, Portugal,
Italy, and France from 1902 to 1907. Other Special Correspondents include Carroll T.
Bond, James A. LeRoy, and Mabel P. LeRoy. Letters to and from Bond relate to Robertson's
appointment as archivist for the State of Maryland. The LeRoy correspondence concerns
research and translations for <title>
<part>The Philippine Islands</part>
</title> project. </p>
<p>The <ref target="gencor">General Correspondence</ref> dates from 1898 to 1939 and covers
Robertson's professional activities in an uninterrupted sequence. It includes copies or
carbons of Robertson's outgoing letters, memoranda, notes, and telegrams. From 1898 to
1900 the letters refer to <title>
<part>The Jesuit Relations</part>
</title> project. In addition to
the material of Emma Helen Blair in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref> series, much of the
General Correspondence file from 1900 to 1907 includes Blair-Robertson correspondence.
Although the letters and other manuscript materials relating to the <title>
<part>Hispanic
American Historical Review</part>
</title> (1916-1918) are a part of the Subject File,
correspondence for the years 1920-1939 in the General Correspondence also concerns
<emph>HAHR</emph> matters. This is especially true of letters between 1923 and 1929,
the period in which Robertson served as managing editor of the journal. Letters
relating to the activities of the Florida State Historical Society and Robertson's
duties as executive secretary of that organization and as general editor of its
publications date from March 1923 to 1932. Specific business letters, reports, and
minutes of the society are a part of the Subject File. </p>

<p>The papers of Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan (1797-1830), span the years 1830-1876, with
the bulk of the material falling between 1845 and 1860. The papers consist of
correspondence, a partial draft of O'Callaghan's <title localtype="simple">
<part>History of New
Netherland</part>
</title>, lists, records, and bibliographical material. </p>
<p>O'Callaghan's diversified career as historian, bibliographer, legislator, physician,
and journalist is only partially documented by this collection. After emigrating
from Ireland in 1823, O'Callaghan became prominent in Canadian politics and was
associated with the revolutionary party. At the same time he was active in the
founding of the Society of the Friends of Ireland and was editor of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Montreal Vindicator</part>
</title>. His political career in Canada reached its zenith
when, in 1835, he was elected to the assembly of Upper Canada. His political career,
however, was cut short by his participation in the Insurrection of 1837. With a
reward offered for his capture, O'Callaghan found it expedient to flee to the United
States. The Canadian phase of O'Callaghan's career is survived by only one document,
but there are references to his activities in Canada in later correspondence,
particularly with William Lyon MacKenzie.</p>
<p> O'Callaghan's first years in the United States were taken up with the practice of
medicine and with editing the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Northern Light</part>
</title>, an industrial journal.
Apparently in connection with the latter occupation, O'Callaghan had reason to
examine the state records of New York. Finding a wealth of material among them,
O'Callaghan embarked upon a new career as historian and bibliographer. In 1846 he
published the first volume of his <title localtype="simple">
<part>History of New Netherland</part>
</title>. Despite
financial losses on that volume, he came out with a second in 1849. The draft of
volume two (books 4-6 and appendices) is present in his papers, as well as related
correspondence. </p>
<p>As a result of this work O'Callaghan was commissioned to edit the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Documentary
History of the State of New York</part>
</title>. A voluminous amount of correspondence
concerning the collection of historical material on New York is contained in the
collection. Additional correspondence deals with other bibliographic matters, with
Americana rarities, editions of the Bible, and O'Callaghan's duties in the office of
the secretary of state of New York. </p>

<p>The papers of Lawrence E. Glendenin (1918-2008) span the years
1935-2009, with the bulk concentrated in the period 1945-1975. The papers
consist of correspondence, writings, subject files, and printed matter. The
collection contains material on the Bikini Scientific Resurvey, Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, and Glendenin and Jacob A. Marinsky's discovery of
Promethium, the 61st element on the periodic table. The collection also
contains material on the Oak Ridge petition written by Oak Ridge scientists in
1945 following review and debate of a petition by Leo Szilard calling for
President Harry S. Truman to describe and demonstrate the atomic bomb's power
and then offer Japan the opportunity to surrender. The collection includes the
Smyth report, an administrative history of the Manhattan Project by physicist
Henry DeWolf Smyth. The report was published on August 12, 1945, under its

<p>Ronald Harmon Brown (1941-1996) was a lawyer and Democratic Party
operative who managed presidential campaigns for Edward Kennedy and Jesse

papers relate entirely to Brown’s term as United States secretary of commerce
during the Clinton administration. The papers span 1992-1996, ending when he
died in a plane crash while on a mission to Croatia. They treat Brown’s death
and legacy as well as his efforts to expand American exports and work with
agencies such as the National Information Infrastructure, National Institute of
Standards and Technology Programs, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric

<p>The papers of Francis LeJau Parker (1873-1966) span the years
1905-1935 and consist mainly of official material gathered in connection with
his duties during World War I and as a member of special missions to Latin
America, especially in the Tacna-Arica dispute in 1926 between Chile and Peru
and in the Nicaraguan elections of 1928. Much of the material is printed or
mimeographed and often includes maps and handwritten notes. The collection is
organized by subject and therein by topic or type of material. An addition is
focused largely on files relating to Mexico and the Philippines and some
general correspondence and miscellaneous reports and memoranda. </p>
<p>The collection contains reports by Parker made while on duty with the
Romanian and Russian armies in 1916 and 1917 and estimates by him of Russia’s
political future. The collection also contains staff lectures on battles and
campaigns of the war. Other material includes accounts of a disputed plebiscite
in the Tacna-Arica area in 1926, and voluminous notes, drafts, and reports of
American supervision of the presidential elections in Nicaragua in 1928. Parker
was vice chairman of the election board. Still other material pertains to

<p> The papers of the Montgomery family record the activities of five generations of the
family and also include two smaller groups of papers belonging to the Peck and Perkins
families that were merged with the Montgomery family by the marriage of George Redington
Montgomery to Helen M. Perkins in 1907. The collection spans the years 1771-1974, with
the bulk of the material from 1858 to 1974, and is organized into three series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Peck">Peck Family Papers</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Perk">Perkins Family Papers</ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Mont">Montgomery Family Papers
</ref>. Included are correspondence, speeches and writings, financial papers, newspaper
clippings, a large assemblage of miscellany, and a special segment of correspondence and
papers relating to the work of the Inter-allied Commission on Mandates in Turkey
(King-Crane Commission) after World War I and the Armenia-America Society.</p>
<p> The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Peck">Peck Family Papers</ref> are
primarily those of Frank Henry Peck, a maternal cousin of Helen Perkins Montgomery.
Although the Peck Family Papers cover the years 1771-1946, most are concentrated within
the period 1856-1864 and consist of correspondence between Frank Peck and his mother and
brother. The letters written between 1856 and 1857 are concerned with his first job as a
teacher following his graduation from Yale University. The first of the Civil War
letters, written in the spring of 1862 after he had joined the 12th Connecticut Infantry
Regiment, reflect the anxiety and trepidation that the new recruit felt in anticipation
of his first encounter with the enemy. Later letters contain accounts of troop
activities and reconnoitering expeditions, and the letters of April 19 and 30 and May 4,
1862, describe in detail the bombardment of Fort Jackson and Fort Saint Philip, and
finally, the capitulation of the city of New Orleans. Some of the letters written during
this period are good sources for impressions and accounts of the military occupation of
New Orleans. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Perk">Perkins Family Papers</ref>
span the years 1832-1953, but the nucleus of the series is the Civil War correspondence
of Newton William Perkins written between 1861 and 1866. Perkins, the father of Helen
Perkins Montgomery, was a colonel and later brevet major with the 13th Connecticut
Infantry Regiment. His letters, written from on board various ships and from different
camps, trace the movement of his regiment from Connecticut to New Orleans and back to
Washington, D.C., and Virginia as changes were made in the strategy of the war. The
letters also recount his daily duties and experiences and describe the general hardships
endured by the soldiers. Some regimental muster rolls and papers from his service as
provost marshal are included in the collection. </p>
<p>The series of <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Mont">Montgomery Family
Papers</ref> extend from 1858 to 1974 and are centered around George Redington
Montgomery and Marshall Hugh Montgomery. The closeness that existed between the members
of the family is reflected in <ref target="montfam">family correspondence</ref> forming
about one third of the series. The letters generally relate to family matters, but also
touch on other areas. Emily Redington Montgomery's letters to her children are
significant for their glimpses of Turkey during the awakening of national consciousness
among the countries of the Ottoman Empire. They contain references to the treatment of
non-Muslims, mention uprisings in various towns, and provide insight into the
difficulties of operating a Christian mission school in Turkey during the reign of
Abdul-Hamid II, Sultan of the Turks. George Redington Montgomery's letters to his family
during 1918-1919 report his observations on America's participation in the Paris Peace
Conference after World War I and comment on the attitudes and objectives of the Allied
Powers at the conference. </p>
<p>The bulk of the <ref target="montgencor">general correspondence</ref> in the Montgomery
Family Papers series consists of letters received and a few copies of letters sent by
George Redington Montgomery; Mary Borglum (daughter of Giles Foster Montgomery and Emily
Redington Montgomery) and her husband, Gutzon Borglum; and Marshall Hugh Montgomery.
Those of George Montgomery relate to the development of his career and to his church
activities. Correspondents include James Trowbridge, Robert Lansing, John L. Franklin,
Ernest Gallaudet Draper, Eugene Meyer, Homer S. Cummings, and Henry Cabot Lodge
(1850-1924). Most of Mary's letters are to and from friends, although some of the later
ones pertain to her financial problems. The letters of Marshall are a commentary on his
standing in the community. They show his support of community and public service
projects, his participation in local government, and his interest in local history. </p>
<p>The <ref target="montbus">business papers</ref> in the Montgomery Family Papers contain
correspondence and printed matter covering the thirty years Marshall Hugh Montgomery
served as a dealer in securities on Wall Street where he pioneered the use of repurchase
agreements. For the most part, the papers contain little information on specific
financial dealings. Those representing his years with D. W. Rich &amp; Company are
mainly letters exchanged with members of the firm while he was on military leave during
the World War II. The letters kept him abreast of developments in the office and up to
date on his financial interests in the company. The papers accumulated during his years
with Aubrey G. Langston &amp; Company are more typical of the kinds of activities and
duties he performed with the company. There are telex messages, internal correspondence,
notices of meetings of financial associations, lists of banks and corporations for which
Aubrey G. Langston &amp; Company purchased securities, and drafts of business letters,
including two that explain how repurchase agreements worked. </p>
<p>The <ref target="montsubj">subject files</ref> in the Montgomery Family Papers relate to
Turkey. In May 1919 George Rediington Montgomery was authorized to accompany Henry
Churchill King and Charles Richard Crane on a trip to Turkey to study political and
economic conditions and to ascertain the views of the people regarding the settlement of
the Near Eastern question. The papers of the King-Crane Commission consist primarily of
the notes he took at the towns where the commission heard testimony. Some working papers
used in preparing the commission's report and a copy of the report as published in the
December 2, 1922, issue of Editor and Publisher are also included in the collection. </p>
<p>The treatment of the Armenians and other Christians was a recurring problem prior to and
during the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The question of a homeland for the
Armenians arose again following the defeat of Turkey and the need to settle the
situation in the Near East at the end of World War I. In 1920 the Armenia-America
Society was formed to secure American support for the Armenian cause. George Redington
Montgomery became its director. His collection of Armenia-America Society papers
documents the activities of that organization in the United States and abroad, including
the final appeal of the society to the Lausanne Conference of 1923 and the trip of
George Montgomery to Russia on behalf of the Armenians. </p>
<p>The <ref target="montmisc">miscellany</ref> section of the Montgomery Family Papers
contains an extensive record of the family's activities. It includes newspaper clippings
about members of the family, their scholastic records, memorabilia from high school and
college days, diplomas, military papers, and other personal material. </p>

<p>The papers of Roland Sletor Morris (1874-1945) span the years 1910-1943. The collection
contains correspondence, telegrams, memoranda, intelligence reports, speeches, newspaper
clippings, photographs, and other papers relating primarily to Morris's service as
ambassador to Japan (1917-1921) and to his special missions to Siberia (1918-1919).
Included are typewritten copies of a translation of a diary of a Japanese mission to the
United States (1860) and official telegrams exchanged with Secretary of State Robert
Lansing, as well as material pertaining to the Allied intervenion in Siberia, 1918-1920.
Also in the collection are papers pertaining to Morris's work as a professor of
international law at the University of Pennsylvania. Correspondents include William
Jennings Bryan, Robert Lansing, Breckinridge Long, Vance McCormick, Leo S. Rowe, and
Woodrow Wilson. </p>

<p>The correspondence of Whiting Griswold (1814-1874) consists of letters
addressed to him over the period 1843-1874. As a prominent lawyer in western
Massachusetts and an active politician, Griswold’s advice and counsel were
sought by prominent figures from all over the state. This correspondence bulks
largest for the 1850s and 1860s and is concerned chiefly with politics on the
local, state, and national levels. The disruption of parties in the 1850s is
well documented, particularly with regard to the decline of the Whigs and the
rise of the Free Soil and American (or Know Nothing) parties, as viewed from
the vantage point of the Democratic Party. Other subjects include legal
questions, patronage, the Hoosac Tunnel in Massachusetts, the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill, the Civil War, and the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853.
Among the principal correspondents are Nathaniel Prentiss Banks, George S.
Boutwell, Benjamin F. Butler, Caleb Cushing, Benjamin Franklin Hallett
(1797-1862), George Frisbie Hoar, George B. Loring, Wendell Phillips, Charles
Sumner, James Lyman Whitney, and Henry Wilson.</p>

<p>The papers of Benjamin Orig Gerig (1894-1976) span the years 1927-1974, with the bulk of
the items concentrated in the period 1930-1968. The collection contains correspondence,
reports, memoranda, printed matter, and other material documenting Gerig's service with
the League of Nations, 1930-1940; the Department of State in a number of positions
relating to international organizations and the administration of the trust territories,
1942-1961; and with the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, 1947-1953. Gerig was
deeply involved in preparations for the formation of the United Nations and served as an
advisor to United States delegations to conferences at Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco,
1944-1945, the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in London, and the first
session of the General Assembly in 1946. The Gerig Papers are arranged by general
correspondence, speeches and writings, subject files, and classified material. </p>
<p>General correspondence, 1930-1974, contains personal and professional correspondence
between Gerig and friends, family, and associates, predominantly those connected with
the League of Nations and the State Department. Correspondents include Isaiah Bowman,
Ralph J. Bunche, Andrew W. Cordier, John Foster Dulles, J. W. T. van Erp, Noel Haviland
Field, Philip C. Jessup, Sean Lester, Henry Cabot Lodge, P. W. Martin, Felix M. Morley,
Bertram Pickard, John D. Tomlinson, and F. P. Walters. Letters of appreciation and
recommendation for Gerig were written by Warren R. Austin, Archibald MacLeish, Mike
Mansfield, Leo Pasvolsky, Dean Rusk, Edward R. Stettinius, and Adlai E. Stevenson.
Additional correspondence, particularly with League officials, is found in the subject
file. Letters that Gerig wrote on the versos of committee reports commenting on his work
on the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations in London are located in the subject
file with other Preparatory Commission material. </p>
<p>The largest group of general correspondence is between Gerig and his first wife Mary and
second wife Pearl and longtime friend and colleague Arthur Sweetser and his wife Ruth
Gregory Sweetser, with whom the Gerigs shared a summer home in Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina. A letter from Gerig to Sweetser, dated from Geneva, January 1, 1950, comments
on the Alger Hiss conviction and John Foster Dulles's testimony. Much of the
correspondence was written after Gerig's retirement from the State Department in 1961.
Arrangement of the general correspondence is alphabetical by name and chronological
therein.</p>
<p> Among the speeches and writings, 1930-1969, are drafts and notes as well as published
speeches and articles. The speeches include remarks given on League of Nations Day,
1939; an address on dependent peoples delivered as deputy United States representative
on the United Nations Trusteeship Council, 1948; an address on the role of the United
Nations in African developments, 1960; and outlines of remarks on the colonial question
and the United Nations, international organizations, and sovereignty. Writings include
publications by the Geneva Research Information Committee in <title localtype="simple">
<part> Geneva Special Studies,</part>
</title> 1930-1931; a statement on progress in the French Cameroons in the State
Department <title localtype="simple">
<part>Bulletin,</part>
</title> 1956; and typescripts on the United States and the colonial question,
1955-1956. Arrangement is alphabetical by type of material and chronological therein. </p>
<p>The subject file, 1927-1969, consists of correspondence, telegrams, memoranda, reports,
press releases, and printed matter dealing with Gerig's activities with the League of
Nations, his work in planning for a new international organization and transferring to
it League of Nations assets, and dependent area affairs and colonial policy, especially
as it related to African nations, in the State Department and the United Nations
Trusteeship Council. Arrangement is alphabetical by name of person or organization,
topic, or type of material, and chronological therein. </p>
<p>Much of the material in the subject file, especially that on the origins of the United
Nations, is security classified. Material in the classified portion has been arranged
according to the organization of the unclassified Gerig Papers. Notices in the
unclassified portion alert researchers that sensitive matter has been removed. Folder
titles given in the container list for the classified segment duplicate the pertinent
folder titles from the unclassified portion. </p>
<p>Material documenting Gerig's tenure with the League of Nations is almost exclusively
connected with his assignment as commissioner-general of the pavilion at the New York
World's Fair in 1939 and 1940; correspondence with League officials predominantly
concerns pavilion business and arrangements for Gerig's move from Geneva to New York.
The files contain documents concerning building arrangements and contracts, insurance
and shipping, and correspondence regarding exhibits, including correspondence with Paul
Manship concerning his sculpture for the pavilion and damage suffered during its
display.</p>
<p> Gerig was employed by the State Department in 1943 as an expert on trusteeship and
colonial questions and served as advisor to United States delegations to Dumbarton Oaks
and San Francisco conferences. In 1943, he chaired a group that wrote an early draft
charter for the United Nations. Numerous early drafts are found in the State Department
portion of the subject file. Files of the Office of Special Political Affairs include
proposals regarding a new court of international justice, considerations regarding the
location of the international organization, and papers prepared and initialed by State
Department consultant Quincy Wright on the legal foundations of the postwar order,
representation and voting, international policing and military sanctions, and trust
territories. </p>
<p>In 1943, Gerig served as advisor to the United States delegation to the Dumbarton Oaks
conference of four "great powers;" the full United Nations Conference on International
Organization at San Francisco, April-June 1945; and the Preparatory Commission of the
United Nations, London, England, September-November 1945. Much of the material in the
files generated at these conferences concerns the transfer of the League of Nations and
its assets to the United Nations. Correspondents include Alger Hiss, director of the
Office of Special Political Affairs. Gerig prepared a memorandum at Senator Arthur
Vandenberg's request explaining the points at which the Dumbarton Oaks proposals were an
improvement over the League of Nations Covenant in terms of security, economic and
social cooperation, and general organization. San Francisco Conference documents include
comments and proposed amendments concerning the Dumbarton Oaks proposals submitted by
national delegations to the conference, drafts and suggested changes to article five of
the chapter relative to trusteeship, and reports. </p>
<p>Gerig served as deputy United States representative on the Trusteeship Council of the
United Nations and travelled in Africa as chairman of the United Nations Visiting
Mission to Trust Territories in West Africa in 1958. Files related to West Africa
contain reports and correspondence relevant to the mission and letters and writings on
West Africa, especially Cameroon. Gerig was offered an ambassadorship to West Cameroon
which he declined because of his wife's failing health. He was also named to delegations
celebrating the independence of both Cameroon and Togo. As chief of the Division of
Dependent Area Affairs, his files contain memoranda and correspondence regarding
colonial policy, foreign service dispatches, and reports, speeches, publications and
clippings on dependent area affairs. </p>
<p>Material in the United Nations file includes working papers and press releases on the
operations of the mandate system under the League of Nations, on non-self-governing
territories, race relations and the territories, press releases of statements by Gerig
on Ruanda-Urundi (present-day Rwanda and Burundi), Cameroon, and Togo, nuclear tests in
trust territories, the growth of Soviet colonialism, and Trusteeship Council verbatim
records pertaining to Ruanda-Urundi, trust territories, and General Assembly
resolutions. Also included are draft articles on international trusteeship, telegrams,
and memoranda regarding trusteeship questions. </p>
<p>The subject file also includes correspondence with Felix Morley and others at Haverford
College and the University of Pennsylvania concerning academic appointments, 1942, and
an honorary doctorate awarded by Haverford College in 1961; a pamphlet by Jacob B. Meyer
on conscientious objectors in World War I, including Gerig; and State Department
personnel records, such as letters of appointment, some signed by Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower, travel orders, efficiency and performance ratings, certificates, press
releases, and the superior service award Gerig received in 1960. Biographical material
concerns the deaths of Arthur and Ruth Sweetser as well as correspondence and material
gathered by Sweetser at the time of Gerig's heart attack and Mary Gerig's death in 1961. </p>
<p>Some photographs, including portraits of Gerig, have been retained in the subject file.
Photographs of the League of Nations, 1931, of the League of Nations Pavilion, 1939, of
Trusteeship Council representatives, 1960, and of the United Nations visiting mission to
West Africa in 1949 have been transferred to the Library's Prints and Photographs
Division. </p>

<p>The papers of Constance McLaughlin Green (1897-1975) span the years 1920-1969, with the
bulk of the material concentrated in the period between 1953 and 1963 when Green
researched and wrote her Pulitzer Prize-winning history of Washington, D.C. Published in
1962-1963 by Princeton University Press, the two-volume work, <title>
<part>Washington, Village
and Capital, 1800-1878</part>
</title> and <title>
<part>Washington, Capital City,
1879-1950</part>
</title>, was the product of a ten-year undertaking that Green completed with
the aid of foundation grants and the administrative support of American University. The
collection contains drafts and galleys of the work, voluminous research notes arranged
according to the chronological blocks established by Green, and subject files that
contain reports and correspondence pertaining to the editing and publishing of both
volumes. Papers unrelated to the Washington project are limited to correspondence and to
miscellaneous speeches and writings. The collection is organized into five series: <ref target="Corr">

<p>As a historian and author, Green's career ranged from teaching positions at Mount
Holyoke and Smith colleges to the post of chief historian, Ordnance, Army History
Division, at the Department of Defense. Most noteworthy, however, was her pioneering
insistence on the significance of the city in American history. Green's portrayal of the
social reality of nineteenth and twentieth century urban life in Washington, D.C., can
be traced in detail in the research notes in this collection. Together with her
manuscript drafts, the note cards in these papers are a supplementary guide to the
social practices, economic policies, racial attitudes, and political and legal standards
that prevailed in the capital during its first one hundred fifty years. Absent from the
papers are the transcripts or notes of interviews Green obtained from persons who lived
in Washington during the years covered by the second volume. Brief recollections of a
personal nature, however, are in the correspondence folder in the subject files of the
Washington history project. Among those who offered their personal reminiscences of
important episodes and conditions in the history of the city were Rayford Logan, Louis
Brownlow, and Ulysses Simpson Grant (1864-1953). </p>
<p>Other writings in the collection include her doctoral dissertation published as
<title>
<part>Holyoke, Massachusetts; A Case History of the Industrial Revolution in
America</part>
</title> (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1939.). Also in the writings are
speeches on such diverse themes as “Project Vanguard” and New England's
contribution to America's economic progress. Additional items include notes and drafts
of journal articles; notes and related material for her published book on urban history
relating to Naugatuck, Connecticut; manuscripts of encyclopedia entries on the subject
of Washington, D.C.; and a book review of Morton and Lucia White's <title>
<part>The
Intellectuals Versus the City</part>
</title>. </p>
<p>Correspondence on subjects other than Washington, D.C., is slight. Important exceptions
are letters from Charles A. Lindbergh concerning the manuscript of a book Green
coauthored with Milton Lomask entitled <title>

<p>The papers of Daniel Carter Beard (1850-1941) span the years 1798-1941, with the bulk of
the material dated between 1915 and 1935. The collection consists of correspondence,
diaries, family papers, speeches, articles, collected source material for writings and
speeches, school composition books, address books, sketch books, illustrations,
photographs, memorabilia, and printed matter relating to Beard's activities at the
Culver Military Academy, Dan Beard Outdoor School, and with the Boy Scouts of America.
The papers are organized into nine series: <ref target="diary"> Diaries </ref>; <ref target="famcorresp"> Family Correspondence </ref>; <ref target="fampap"> Family
Papers </ref>; <ref target="gencorresp"> General Correspondence </ref>; <ref target="speccorresp"> Special Correspondence </ref>; <ref target="subfile"> Subject
File </ref>; <ref target="bookfile"> Speech, Article, and Book File </ref>; <ref target="miscella"> Miscellany </ref>; and <ref target="overs"> Oversize </ref>.</p>
<p>The three major phases of Beard's career as illustrator, author, and guiding spirit of
the American Boy Scout movement are amply documented. Items relating to his life as an
artist include numerous early sketch books and composition books containing essays and
lessons prepared during his student years. Beard furnished pictures for the first
illustrated editions of Samuel Langhorne Clemens's <title localtype="simple">
<part>Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</part>
</title> and <title localtype="simple">
<part>Tom Sawyer Abroad</part>
</title>, and the papers contain his correspondence with Clemens concerning this work.
There is a great deal of correspondence with Charles Dana Gibson, who served as best man
at Beard's wedding. Correspondents from the art world include Gutzon Borglum, Howard
Chandler Christy, Henry C. Pitz, Frederic Remington, Norman Rockwell, Frederic Dorr
Steele, Lorado Taft, John Quincy Adams Ward, S. J. Woolf, and N. C. Wyeth.</p>
<p>Daniel Beard came from an artistic background. His father, James Henry Beard, was a
well-known portrait painter among whose sitters were Henry Clay, John Quincy Adams, and
Benjamin Harrison. His brother, Frank Beard, originated the once popular "chalk talks,"
which were lectures illustrated by the speaker with crayon sketches drawn during the
course of the lecture. The <ref target="famcorresp"> Family Correspondence </ref> and
<ref target="famcorresp"> Family Papers </ref> series in these papers contain many
manuscripts of both Frank Beard and James Henry Beard, including a draft of the latter's
autobiography.</p>
<p>Daniel Beard's career as an author is represented with the original manuscript of his
autobiography, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Hardly a Man Is Now Alive</part>
</title> (1939), and an extensive collection of articles devoted to outdoor life that
range in subject matter from the making of "Billy Bow-Leg Moccasins" to instructions for
tying a "Real Sour-Dough Diamond Hitch." Most of the articles were prepared for
publication in the magazine <title localtype="simple">
<part>Boy's Life</part>
</title>, to which Beard was a regular monthly contributor. There is also a great deal
of correspondence with the publishing firms of J. B. Lippincott Company and Charles
Scribner's Sons, which printed most of the twenty-seven books written by Beard. Among
his correspondents in the field of literature are Samuel Langhorne Clemens, Hamlin
Garland, Zane Grey, William Dean Howells, Edwin Markham, H. L. Mencken, Albert Bigelow
Paine, Maxwell Perkins, Upton Sinclair, Hendrik Willem Van Loon, and Owen Wister.</p>
<p>The third and most bountiful phase of the collection concerns Beard's efforts to create
and develop the Boy Scout movement in the United States. There are papers relating to
Sons of Daniel Boone (renamed Boy Pioneers of America), the organization Beard
established in 1905 that was a forerunner of the Boy Scouts of America. In addition to
the manuscripts detailing the origin of the Boy Scouts in 1910, there is important
correspondence with other leaders of the scouting movement in this country and abroad.
Perhaps the most important of these are with Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, Baron
Baden-Powell of Gilwell, the British soldier who was the founder of the original Boy
Scout movement in 1908; and Ernest Thompson Seton, author of the nature study <title localtype="simple">
<part>Wild Animals I Have Known</part>
</title> and organizer of yet another woodlore group, the Woodcraft Indians (1902).
Among the major figures initially associated with the Boy Scout organization who are
represented in these papers are George J. Fisher, Walter W. Head, Edward Sanford Martin,

<p>President Theodore Roosevelt's dictum regarding the strenuous life strongly appealed to
Daniel Beard, and following the president's death he instituted annual pilgrimages to
his grave at Oyster Bay, Long Island. The papers contain Beard's correspondence with
Roosevelt, his widow, Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, son Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.
(1887-1944), and other members of the family.</p>
<p>There are three groups of <ref target="speccorresp"> Special Correspondence </ref>
relating to the Dan Beard Outdoor School for Boys, the Boy Scouts, and the Sons of
Daniel Boone. The latter two groups consist of letters received by Beard from children
who were members of these organizations. The correspondence relating to the Dan Beard
Outdoor School for Boys concerns the summer camp he established in 1915 at Hawley,
Pennsylvania, and operated until the mid-1930s. The letters are inquiries from parents
concerning the camp and the progress of their children and purely internal
correspondence relating to the financial and logistical operations of the camp.</p>

<p>The papers of Paul Field Sifton (1897-1972) and Claire Ginsburg Sifton (1897-1980) span
the years 1912-1980, but cover primarily the period 1925-1971. They consist of
correspondence, diaries, subject files, writings, personal files, printed matter, and
miscellany. The collection is of interest to students of twentieth-century American
social theater, of the emergence of various labor organizations as a growing political
force, and of the methodology of legislative lobbying on Capitol Hill in behalf of
farmers, labor, civil rights, full employment, and other social causes. The papers are
organized into nine series: <ref target="correspond"> Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="dairy">Diaries of Claire Sifton </ref>, <ref target="subfile">Subject File of
Paul Field Sifton</ref>, <ref target="writfile">Writings File</ref>, <ref target="persfile">Personal Files</ref>, <ref target="prinfile">Printed Matter </ref>,
<ref target="miscella">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="addit">Addition</ref>, and <ref target="overs">Oversize</ref>. Files or folders pertaining to Paul Field Sifton are
connoted in the container list with the acronym PFS; those of Claire Ginsburg Sifton
with the acronym CGS.</p>
<p>The student of the social theater will find a large number of plays in many stages of
composition and production for the 1922-1950 period. The <ref target="writfile">
Writings File</ref> includes material on the press reaction and controversy which
surrounded many of the Siftons' plays: <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Belt</part>
</title> (1927), an indictment of Henry Ford's "speedup" system, was attacked as
anti-capitalist. <title localtype="simple">
<part>Midnight</part>
</title> (1930), which was against capital punishment and press sensationalism, was
criticized on both counts. <title localtype="simple">
<part>1931---</part>
</title> (1931), a naturalistic vision of unemployment and the Great Depression, was
both praised and attacked from several points of view. <title localtype="simple">
<part>Blood on the Moon</part>
</title> (1933), a strong, early condemnation of Nazi Germany, was both eulogized and
vilified; its London production was halted by the Lord Chamberlain as insulting to a
foreign power. The one-act play, <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Doctors</part>
</title> (1938), was roundly condemned by the American Medical Association as
"sanctioning" unethical medical conduct. And <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Girdle of Venus</part>
</title> (1948-1950), depicting the role of Paul Reynaud and his mistress, Hélène
comtesse de Portes, in the fall of France, was dropped by the Theatre Guild when the
countess's living children threatened libel action. Additionally, the Writings File
includes poetry of Paul Sifton as well as short stories, book reviews, and newspapers
and magazine articles of Paul and Claire Sifton. Several disparate book projects,
1922-1962, of Paul Sifton complete the Writings File.</p>
<p>Of importance to the students of the politics of labor organization and of the
methodology of Washington lobbying are the <ref target="subfile"> Subject File of Paul
Sifton </ref>. His involvement in the nation's first full-fledged unemployment
compensation system (New York State, 1934-1938) led to his post in the newly created
Wages and Hours Division in the Department of Labor. This was followed by his position
as consumers' counsel, Bituminous Coal Administration, Department of the Interior. After
leaving government service in 1941, he became national legislative representative for a
number of organizations including the National Farmers' Union, the Union for Democratic
Action, and the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practice Committee,
among others. Additionally, during World War II, he served as a labor representative on
the War Manpower Commission. From 1948 until his retirement in 1962, Paul Sifton devoted
his time and attention to the position of national legislative representative of the
International Union, United Automobile Workers of America (CIO). The subject files have
some chronological overlapping, particularly in the 1941-1947 period when he engaged in
successive lobbying efforts in behalf of several complementary causes.</p>
<p>The <ref target="correspond"> Correspondence </ref>series, <ref target="dairy"> Diaries
of Claire Sifton </ref>, material on a 1963 testimonial dinner to Paul Sifton, and
the <ref target="miscella"> Miscellany </ref> reflect the couple's involvement in
writing and the theater as well as their interest in farmers, labor, women, civil
rights, full employment, and other contemporary issues.</p>
<p>The largest amount of personal correspondence occurred in the summers when Claire Sifton
went to Maine with her two sons, and Paul remained in New York City and (later)
Washington, D.C. Theatrical and literary correspondence is concentrated in the 1929-1940
period. After 1941, the non-family correspondence touches on many of the topics covered
in the <ref target="subfile"> Subject File of Paul Sifton </ref>. <ref target="dairy">
The Diaries of Claire Sifton </ref> include detailed comment on college life in the
1915-1916 period; the thoughts of a young working woman in Manhattan in 1922; the
private comments of a government official's wife in late New Deal Washington; and some
increasingly philosophical and introspective observations in her later years. Perhaps
the most interesting contemporary evaluations of Paul Sifton's impact and influence on
others are contained in the letters presented to him at the testimonial dinner in his
honor in 1963.</p>
<p>The <ref target="prinfile"> Printed Matter </ref> series includes material Paul Sifton
retained for an eventual evaluation of his work and career. The <ref target="miscella">
Miscellany </ref> documents a new group of interests that engaged his attention in
the last decade of his life. A victim of emphysema, he felt that pollution abatement,
alternative energy systems, use of non-fossil fuels, and the use of fish protein (for
the underdeveloped areas of the world) were of paramount importance to mankind's
survival on the planet. The last segment of the <ref target="miscella"> Miscellany
</ref> comprises obituary, funeral, and condolence material on the Siftons, as well as
photographs, press cards, address files, family genealogy, and other items.</p>
<p>Eminent figures represented in the letters presented at the testimonial dinner to Paul
Sifton in 1963 include John F. Kennedy and past and incumbent senators, congressmen,
cabinet officers, and numerous officials in farmer, labor, political, governmental, and
social welfare organizations. Other prominent correspondents in the collection include
Esther Root Adams (Mrs. "F.P.A."), Brooks Atkinson, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Paul H.
Douglas, attorney Walter Frank, British freelance writer Ruth Esther Howe,
German-language translator Heinrich Kranz, James I. Loeb, writer David Loth, Norma
Millay, theatrical agent Adrienne Morrison, Reinhold Niebuhr, National Farmers' Union

<p>On Claire Sifton's background and childhood as the daughter of Southern Baptist
missionaries to Brazil, the reader is referred to her father's official work, <title localtype="simple">

<p>The papers of Abraham Alexander Ribicoff (1910-1998) span the years 1927-1981, with the
bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1963-1980. The collection contains
correspondence, memoranda, reports, press material, voting records, statements,
congressional testimony, speeches, articles, printed matter, scrapbooks, other
administrative and legislative matter, and miscellaneous material, including microfilm
of correspondence and scrapbooks, relating chiefly to Ribicoff's senatorial career. The
material is organized into eight series: <ref target="presenate">Pre-Senate
Records</ref>; <ref target="senrec">Senate Records</ref>; <ref target="polipap">Political Papers</ref>; <ref target="miscella">Miscellany</ref>; <ref target="additgovfile">1987 Addition</ref>; <ref target="additspeech">2023

Scrapbooks</ref>.</p>
<p>The papers of Abraham Ribicoff, lawyer and public official, constitute an important
collection that touches upon many of the most significant developments in modern
American government. <ref target="note1"> [1] </ref> Ribicoff was born in a tenement in
New Britain, Connecticut, on April 9, 1910, the son of a factory worker, and the urban,
industrial environment in which he grew to maturity provided much of the agenda for his
long years of public service. At the age of twenty-eight, after establishing a law
practice in Hartford, he was elected to the lower house of the Connecticut General
Assembly, where he served in the first of his many varied roles in American political
life. He was a municipal judge, chairman of the Hartford Charter Revision Commission, a
hearing examiner to enforce the state fair-employment practices act, a member of
Congress (1949-1953), governor of Connecticut (1955-1961), secretary of health,
education, and welfare (1961-1962), and United States senator (1963-1981). This
collection relates principally to his service in the Senate, but there are fragments
that bear upon his earlier positions as well, and researchers will often catch a glimpse
of Ribicoff's experiences in state and local government with problems that concerned him
as a senator and cabinet officer.</p>
<p>A large body of his papers relating to his governorship is in the Connecticut State
Library, but important material is to be found in this collection. His election as
governor in 1954 was widely applauded by reformers and the Democratic faithful, and the
national significance of his victory can be gleaned from the congratulations of
political figures such as W. Averell Harriman, Adlai E. Stevenson, and Bernard M.
Baruch. His speech files as governor are especially useful for an examination of his
evolving positions, and they contain themes that would recur throughout his career. Not
the least of these themes was the plea in his inaugural message for all political
factions “to cooperate to respect each other's motives, to search for areas of common
agreement, to share credit, in short, to understand and practice what I should like to
call the integrity of compromise. . . .”</p>
<p>Connecticut politics during the 1950s was characterized by strong party leadership,
disciplined organizations, and an unusually high degree of straight-ticket voting, but
underneath the order and regularity was one of the most diverse and volatile
constituencies in the nation. Any disturbance in the surface calm revealed this
political complexity, and a particularly interesting episode can be explored in the
correspondence Ribicoff received during the struggle for the Democratic Senate
nomination in 1958. There was an impassioned letter from Philip C. Jessup, the
distinguished diplomat and jurist, who implored the governor to support Chester Bowles
as “the man who can make the greatest contribution to the solution of the crucial
international issues which beset us. If we do not solve them, it will in the long run
make no difference to any of us what we do on various local issues.” Other
correspondents were more concerned about domestic policy, and many asked Ribicoff to
support former senator William Benton as “an able and progressive-minded man . . . who
did more than anyone else to start McCarthyism on its downward course.” The candidacy of
Thomas J. Dodd, who subsequently received the nomination, was urged by many
correspondents, including a Dodd associate who advised Ribicoff that “your endorsement
will be a good thing not only for Tom, but also for your own future plans.”</p>
<p>Ribicoff as governor clearly had his future plans well under control, and the extensive
scrapbooks in the collection contain numerous press accounts describing his many
initiatives in Hartford, such as highway safety reform and the abolition of county
government, which inspired boomlets by admirers to secure the vice-presidency or a
Senate seat for him. He quickly emerged as New England's leading governor, and it was in
this capacity that he played such a critical role in the presidential aspirations of
John F. Kennedy, his former colleague in the House of Representatives. Ribicoff later
recalled that his relationship with Kennedy, “prior to and after the election, was on a
personal face-to-face oral basis,” and thus the material in the collection bearing
directly upon the Kennedy-Ribicoff relationship is not extensive. There is,
nevertheless, useful data in the Ribicoff and memoranda from the Kennedy headquarters
outlining campaign strategy. There is an intriguing letter from Ribicoff to Pierre
Salinger, Kennedy's press secretary, regarding the frequent inquiries about the
potential influence of Rome in a Kennedy administration: "It is amazing how many times
you must repeat yourself before it gets into the consciousness of people. From long
experience, however, I know that even the most simple thoughts must be repeated over and
over again." </p>
<p>Ribicoff resigned as governor of Connecticut to become secretary of health, education,
and welfare in the Kennedy administration, but he continued to follow Connecticut
developments through correspondence from journalists and political associates. Ribicoff
also returned to Connecticut frequently throughout his service in the cabinet, and his
scheduling files are particularly helpful for understanding his relationship to state
and local politics. Itineraries and correspondence about engagements are also useful
supplements to his speeches for reconstructing the Connecticut dimension of his cabinet
service.</p>
<p>About ninety percent of this large collection documents Ribicoff's career in the Senate
(1963-1981). He is perhaps best known for his long tenure on the Governmental Affairs
Committee, which he chaired during the 94th through 96th Congresses, where his work in
civil service, government reorganization, ethics legislation, nuclear nonproliferation,
and energy policy represented major themes in the political life of the late 1970s. In
addition to files on these continuing legislative interests, there is also material on
many individual investigations that had lasting significance. Students of modern reform
will profit, for example, from examining a series of files relating to Ribicoff's
investigations of the Chevrolet Corvair and highway safety, a classic inquiry into the
complex juncture of modern corporate policy, government regulation, and the consumer
movement. The Corvair investigations were a natural outgrowth of his concern while
governor of Connecticut with highway safety. There are also extensive files on
Ribicoff's investigations of mismanagement and corruption in the conduct of the war in
Vietnam, which are intriguing for what they reveal about the dynamics of congressional
oversight as well as for the light they shed on military organization in the combat
zone.</p>
<p>As a leading spokesperson for modern liberalism, Ribicoff's legislative interests
touched every aspect of welfare reform, urban development, civil rights, and the federal
role in education and health care. His papers are a distillation of the reform agenda of
the 1960s and the 1970s. He was a prominent figure in the most important legislative
initiatives of the New Frontier and the Great Society, and one can explore the entire
range of domestic policy in the varied material of this collection.</p>
<p>Although Ribicoff was associated with many of the most advanced reform measures of our
time and happily acknowledged that he “grew up with the New Deal ideology as an article
of faith,”<ref target="note2"> [2] </ref> he was deeply troubled by a tendency among
fellow liberals to make hasty predictions about programs that had not been adequately
planned or tested. This became a major theme in his strategy as a reformer. Many of his
reservations were expressed in a letter about the Head Start program to Douglass Cater,
a special assistant in the Johnson White House. Ribicoff understood the virtue of
preschool education for disadvantaged children, but he felt that “we are wasting our
resources when we commit them to programs that do not fulfill their promised results.”
Head Start did not identify and attract the most seriously disadvantaged children, it
did not pay sufficient attention to the child's subsequent school experience, and it
suffered from fragmented administrative structures, mismanagement, and lack of
coordination. “We must focus attention on the problems our efforts are designed to
resolve,” he concluded, “and ignore the opportunity to satisfy ourselves with the fact
we have passed, established, and funded <emph render="italic">x</emph> number of
programs.”</p>
<p>The extensive Legislative File in the collection contains bill files, documents relating
to the oversight functions of congressional committees, and the working files of various
staff members. Although all of these files are fragmentary, many of the fragments
provide important insights into the legislative process. Among the most interesting
files are those relating to Ribicoff's role on the Finance Committee in considering the
Family Assistance Plan, the Nixon administration's principal welfare reform measure. It
was a far-reaching proposal for income maintenance, and Ribicoff remarked to his
colleagues in the Senate that he had “never been involved in a piece of legislation as
controversial, which is more diverse, and contains as many emotional, philosophical,
economic, and social problems.” The proposal passed the House but failed in the Senate,
and not the least of the many ironies involved was that Ribicoff found himself, “as a
Democrat, fighting for the administration proposal, opposing the proposal of the man I
nominated as the Democratic nominee for the presidency.”</p>
<p>As the Finance Committee member who was most knowledgeable about welfare measures,
Ribicoff received an avalanche of mail about the Family Assistance Plan from some of the
most articulate sectors of American society. Letters from university professors such as
Chester McArthur Destler, an important historian of American reform, and James Tobin,
who later received a Nobel Prize for economics, give the constituent correspondence
files an unusually sophisticated character, and there are also letters from an array of
Fortune 500 executives, civil rights spokesmen, and directors of public welfare agencies
throughout the country. Ribicoff established a welfare advisory group to review the
administration's proposals, and the work of these advisers can be studied in several
files. There are exchanges between Ribicoff and administration officials such as Daniel
P. Moynihan, Elliot Richardson, and Robert Finch, and there is a particularly poignant
letter to George S. McGovern in which Ribicoff details the deficiencies of the McGovern
proposals. Within the welter of technical details, however, several fundamental reform
principals were always in the forefront of Ribicoff's strategy: he insisted upon (1)
pilot programs to test novel propositions; (2) the establishment of attainable goals;
(3) assistance to <title localtype="simple">
<part>all</part>
</title> impoverished Americans, not simply the unemployed and single-parent families;
and (4) ancillary measures to create employment opportunities for able-bodied welfare
recipients. Perhaps more than any of his colleagues in the Senate, he understood the
“guaranteed income” features of the program and endorsed them as a radical departure
from the conventional welfare system.</p>
<p>In addition to the strength of Ribicoff's papers for studies of government operations,
social welfare policy, and urban affairs, scholars will also find the collection useful
for tracing the evolution of international trade policy, arms control, consumer
legislation, and environmental protection measures. Ribicoff's efforts to protect the
environment were national in scope, but they were particularly relevant for the
Northeast, and one finds rich material for projects concerning the Long Island Sound,
the Connecticut River, and the Housatonic River valley. There are also individual
documents of considerable significance, such as Ribicoff's detailed response to the
elaborate questionnaire Ralph Nader circulated for his study of Congress. Several
transcripts of oral history interviews conducted with members of his staff are also
contained in the collection.</p>
<p>The 1987 Addition is comprised of files related to the Government Operations Committee’s
investigation of computer crime in federal programs and private industry. Material
includes correspondence, memoranda, reports, congressional testimony statements,
transcripts, clippings, and other printed matter.</p>
<p>The 2023 Addition consists of bound volumes, titled “Speeches,” containing select
speeches, hearing statements, and articles from Ribicoff's tenure as a United States
senator. This material addresses a variety of topics, including defense, economics,
education, energy, the environment, governmental affairs, health, international affairs,
trade and finance, Jewish concerns, social justice, legal issues, taxes, transportation,
and urban affairs and development.</p>

<p>The papers of Peter Marshall (1902-1949) and Catherine Marshall (1914-1983), husband and
wife, span the years 1927-1964, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period
1933-1956. Personal materials of Peter Marshall comprise about a fourth of the
collection, including a small amount of correspondence and a large file of notes for his
sermons. The sermons, about 850 in number, cover the period 1933 through January 1948
and include such well-known sermons as “Singing in the Rain,” “Go Down Death,” “Under
Sealed Orders,” “The King is in the Audience,” and “Rendezvous in Samarra.” There are
also synopses of many of the sermons and various indexes that list the sermons by title,
date, location, subject matter, and quotations used. The collection is organized into
seven series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Ser"> Peter Marshall:

<p>Catherine Marshall's papers, in addition to treating her own career as an author and
lecturer following the death of her husband, are mainly oriented to the life of Peter
Marshall and to her biography of him, <title>
<part>A Man Called Peter.</part>
</title> Most of her correspondence consists of mail from persons who read her numerous
books and saw the motion picture based on the biography. </p>
<p>A significant portion of the papers concerns the production by Twentieth Century-Fox
Film Corporation of <title>
<part>A Man Called Peter.</part>
</title> There are verbatim records of the conferences attended by Catherine Marshall
and representatives of Twentieth Century-Fox during planning of the film. In addition to
many versions of the film script, these records present the metamorphosis of the work
from printed page to celluloid. Important correspondents include screenwriter Eleanor
Griffin, producer Samuel G. Engel, and the film's principal performers, Richard Todd,
Jean Peters, and Marjorie Rambeau. </p>
<p>Also in the collection are other manuscripts of Catherine Marshall's published works,
some of which include both original drafts and corrected copies of proofs. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Scrap"> Scrapbooks </ref> series is

bulk of the collection dating from 1954 to 1974, including correspondence, writings,
bibliographical material, invitations, schedules, programs, committee reports,
congressional bills, reports, newspaper clippings, and photographs.</p>
<p>Mumford’s correspondence chiefly reflects the personal aspects of his career, beginning
with his special appointment as director of the Processing Department at the Library of
Congress while on leave of absence from New York Public Library, 1940-1942. His
nomination as Librarian of Congress by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954 is
documented by letters of support and congratulations from Library colleagues. His
correspondence as librarian consists primarily of letters of thanks and recommendation
and reflects the social and cultural duties of his office. </p>
<p>The writings consist of articles by Mumford and publications by others on topics of
interest to him.</p>
<p> A miscellany file includes appointment schedules, invitations, and programs;

well as scrapbooks of clippings relating mainly to his professional career. The papers
span the years 1905-1951, but bulk largest from 1929 to 1941. The collection is
organized into eleven series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gencorresp">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="genrailfile">General Railroad File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="canrailfile">Canadian National

<p>During Beyer's military service in World War I, he developed a program of
union-management cooperation in army arsenals. Thereafter, he served as consulting
engineer to unions and management in various industrial concerns and in railway systems
such as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company and the Canadian National Railways,
acquiring a reputation as a leader in the improvement of labor-management relations.
From 1933 to 1948, Beyer held a number of posts in the federal government. His papers

<p>The papers of Jabez Lamar Munroe Curry (1825-1903) consist of diaries, correspondence,
an autograph collection, printed matter, clippings, memorabilia, notes and memoranda,
legal papers, accounts, lectures and sermons, essays, scrapbooks, a manuscript of an
autobiography, speeches and articles, and miscellaneous material. The collection spans
the years 1637-1939, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1866-1903.
The papers are organized into two parts. Part I is composed of a <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Gen"> Correspondence and General File. </ref> Part II
consists of four series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr">
Correspondence </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Auto">
Autographs </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Diary"> Diaries
</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Misc"> Miscellany </ref>. </p>
<p>Included in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Auto"> Autographs </ref>
series are correspondence and letters (many to Curry himself) from United States
presidents; Confederate statesmen; Spanish noblemen, royalty, and writers; and American
and European artists, clergyman, diplomats, educators, historians, jurists, literary
figures, military men, reformers, scientists, and statesmen. Among the signatories are
John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Gallatin, Washington Irving,
Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Johnson, James Madison, Luis de Onís, James K. Polk, Richard
Rush, Daniel Webster, Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and Roger Williams. </p>
<p>Reports, journals, writings, printed matter, and other material in the Miscellany series
are organized mainly in bound volumes designated as Record Books A to G compiled by
Curry. Subjects in the collection concern topics such as the Peabody Education Fund, the
John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen, the Southern Education Board, Curry’s
studies on Civil War history and the civil government of the Confederacy, and diplomatic
matters in Spain. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Diary"> Diaries </ref> and much of
the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Corr"> correspondence </ref> relate
to Curry’s career as an educator, diplomat, and Baptist minister. Correspondents include
William Aiken, James Burrill Angel, Thomas F. Bayard, William Ashmead Courtenay, William
Maxwell Evarts, Hamilton Fish (1808-1893), Melville Weston Fuller, Moses Coit Gilman,
Rutherford Birchard Hayes, Samuel A. Green, Henry R Jackson, Theodore Lyman, James D.

<p>The papers of Juliana Knoepfmacher (1899-1974), known primarily as “Lia” during the
American period of her career after the 1940s, span the years 1929-1980, with the bulk
of the material concentrated in the years 1940-1960. The collection consists of
professional files relating to her work as a child therapist and her writings on the
treatment of children. The papers contain lectures, speeches, writings, notes, minutes,
agenda, correspondence, memoranda, biographical material, and printed matter arranged
alphabetically by topic or type of material. Patient case files and notes are closed. </p>
<p>Much of the collection relates to Knoepfmacher’s professional associations and her work
as a training supervisor with the Jewish Board of Guardians in New York City. Minutes,
memoranda, and reports from the Jewish Board of Guardians and other organizations
explore such topics as supervision and teaching methods, time in treatment, treatment
goals, diagnostic criteria, private practice, and fee structures. Files from the Paul
Federn Study Group feature meeting notes and discussion material, including a paper by
August Aichhorn on transference in child guidance dated 1936. Writings by Knoepfmacher
include her account of a Montessori school she directed in Vienna from 1927 to 1937 and
articles and papers principally relating to her work in the field of child therapy. The
balance of the professional files include speeches, lectures, and writings of
others.</p>

<p>The papers of Joseph Anthony Lewis (1927-2013) span the years 1941-2007, with the bulk
of material dating from 1963 to 2001. The papers document primarily Lewis’s career as a
newspaper reporter and columnist for the <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> and his work as an author of several books about legal issues. In 1963 Lewis
won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting about the Supreme Court and is credited with
changing the field of legal journalism. Although not a lawyer, Lewis had a grasp of the
complexities of the law and a clear writing style that made legal issues more
understandable to the public. The collection consists of two parts with some topics and
time periods common to both parts. Part I consists chiefly of drafts and research files
for two of Lewis’s books, <title>
<part>Gideon’s Trumpet</part>
</title> (1964) and <title>
<part>Portrait of a Decade</part>
</title> (1964), and letters from readers of Lewis’s <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> column between 1969 and 1975. Part II makes up the bulk of the collection and
pertains chiefly to Lewis’s tenure while a reporter and columnist with the <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> from 1955 to 2001. Also included in Part II are files relating to his endeavors
as a university lecturer and his writings, including drafts of articles, book drafts,
and research files. The papers contain only a few items relating to Lewis’s career
before 1955. The collection is in English.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>Part I of the Lewis Papers spans the years 1941-1975, with the bulk of material produced
from 1963 to 1974. Drafts, research files, and letters from readers of Lewis's <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> column between 1969 and 1975 are organized into three series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Lett">Letters from Readers</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Write">Writings</ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Lett">Letters from Readers</ref>
series comprises the largest part of Part I. Lewis's staff organized most of the letters
he received between 1969 and July 1973 into a topical file and those received after July
1973 into a chronological file. The series provides insight into public opinion during a
politically and socially turbulent era. Most of the letters were written by the general
public and concern issues such as busing for racial integration of schools, medicine and
health care, student protests, the Vietnam War, and Watergate. Prominent correspondents
include Hubert H. Humphrey on busing; Allen Ginsberg on crime and drugs; general
comments by David Halberstam and Daniel P. Moynihan; and Alfred M. Landon, John Le
Carré, Lewis Mumford, and Benjamin Spock on Vietnam. Lewis's replies to these letters
are included in the series. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Write">Writings</ref> series
contains drafts and research files for two of Lewis's books. In <title>
<part>Gideon's Trumpet,</part>
</title> he explored the Supreme Court ruling in <title>
<part>Gideon v. Wainwright</part>
</title> that required states to provide indigent criminal defendants with free counsel.
Research for the book includes copies of letters between Clarence Earl Gideon, Abe
Fortas, and the court; correspondence and documents concerning amicus curiae briefs
filed by various states; correspondence with lawyers representing Gideon in his second
trial; and a survey of state public defender programs. In <title>
<part>Portrait of a Decade,</part>
</title> Lewis traced the civil rights movement from 1954 to 1964 largely through the<title>
<part> New York Times</part>
</title> reporting of these events. Although the research files consist primarily of
clippings, they also contain correspondence and an unsigned letter from Harris Wofford
concerning his role in arranging John F. Kennedy's phone call to Coretta Scott King in
November 1960. </p>
<p>The collection also contains a small <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref> comprising research material for some of Lewis's
articles.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II of the Lewis Papers spans from 1944-2007, with the bulk of material dating from
1964 to 2001. Papers in this addition supplement Part I of the collection. The majority
of the papers in Part II document Lewis’s career with the <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> from 1955 to 2001. Lewis reported and commented for over five decades on many
prominent issues relating to national and international affairs, including civil rights,
the press, the Supreme Court and various legal issues, the Vietnam War, the Watergate
scandal, the Iran-Contra Affair, the Middle East, the apartheid regime in South Africa,
immigration, and terrorism. Also represented in Part II are teaching files pertaining to
university classes that Lewis taught about legal issues and journalism, book files, and
a few family papers. The papers of Part II are arranged into the following series: <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref>, <ref target="letters">Letters from Readers</ref>,
<ref target="writ">Writings</ref>, <ref target="note">Notebooks</ref>, <ref target="miscell">Miscellany</ref>, and <ref target="class">Classified</ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> in Part II, 1949-2007, includes
correspondence, subject files, interviews, notes, reports, newspaper clippings, and
speeches and writings by Lewis. It is the largest series and focuses mainly on his
tenure as a reporter and columnist for the <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> from 1955 until his retirement in 2001. Papers in the <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref>, dating from 1955 to 1964, document Lewis’s reporting for the
Washington, D.C., bureau where he covered the Department of Justice and the Supreme
Court and includes files about various justices and Lewis’s notes for the October 1963
and 1964 terms. Other topics treated during his time in Washington are civil rights,
reapportionment, and habeas corpus. Also chronicled in the <ref target="annual">Annual
File</ref> is Lewis’s tenure as chief of the London, England, bureau from 1965 to
1972. Lewis’s reporting from London varied widely with coverage of politicians such as
Harold Wilson and Baron George Alfred Brown and topics such as architecture, Anthony
Burgess (writer), the Concorde, and the royal family. The London files also include
topics that featured prominently in later columns by Lewis such as, Africa, the Vietnam
War, the press, and race relations. Drafts of his “London weekender articles” are filed
in Part II of the <ref target="writ">Writings</ref> series. </p>
<p>In 1969 while still in London, Lewis began a column for the <title>
<part>New York Times</part>
</title> that would later be entitled “At Home Abroad” or “Abroad at Home” (depending on
his location) about national and international affairs. In 1973 Lewis returned to the
United States, writing the column from his home in Boston. Many of the columns reflected
Lewis’s interest in the law and his belief in its importance to a diverse country such
as the United States. Lewis brought a liberal perspective to his column on a wide-range
of issues such as the energy crisis in the 1970s, immigration, courts, the Supreme
Court, the environment (filed as surroundings), capital punishment, the press
(especially libel issues), free speech, civil liberties, human rights, terrorism,
presidential administrations and elections, the Iran-Contra Affair, Watergate, Latin
America, the Middle East, the Vietnam War, Africa, the struggle against apartheid in
South Africa, and the unrest in Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Files from 2001 to 2007
reflect Lewis’s interest and thoughts about the reaction of government leaders to the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the ensuing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the
War on Terrorism. </p>
<p>The <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> is arranged by year except for the first
group of files from 1949 to 1965 which were filed together as a group by Lewis. <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> topics "A-L" for 1966 were not received by the
Library. Items from a prior <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> year are occasionally
carried over to the next year. Also some years of the <ref target="annual">Annual
File</ref> contain background information items that are dated earlier than the year
in which they are filed. The majority of the papers in the <ref target="annual">Annual
File</ref> were used by Lewis as background research for his reporting and columns.
Lewis, however, also traveled to gather information for his articles and columns. The
<ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> is replete with trip files, particularly for
Africa, the Middle East, and Vietnam, documenting Lewis’s insights. Information relating
to his trips is also chronicled in Part II of the <ref target="note">Notebooks</ref>
series.</p>
<p> The <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> also documents Lewis’s correspondence with
an array of individuals including colleagues, Supreme Court justices, judges, lawyers,
members of Congress, government officials, academics, entertainers, friends, and the
public. The bulk of the correspondence, usually including both incoming and outgoing,
features praise by Lewis relating to an achievement by a correspondent or vice-versa.
Most of the letters are filed in the miscellaneous folders located after topics in the
<ref target="annual">Annual File</ref>. Also documented in the <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> are invitations and arrangements for social engagements.
Correspondents include Russell Baker, Felix Frankfurter, Anna Freud, Henry Kissinger,
James Reston, and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. </p>
<p>The <ref target="letters">Letters from Readers series</ref> in Part II complements the
<ref target="Lett">Letters from Readers</ref> in Part I. This series includes
incoming letters, usually accompanied by Lewis’s outgoing replies. The incoming letters
are usually a one-time response to Lewis’s articles and commentary, although the letters
do feature recurring correspondents. Topics represented are the Middle East, Cambodia,
the Vietnam War, South Africa, abortion, race, immigration, the environment (filed under
surroundings by Lewis and his staff), Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George
W. Bush, and political conflict in Yugoslavia during the 1990s. </p>
<p>The <ref target="writ">Writings</ref> in Part II are comprised chiefly of drafts of
Lewis’s “London weekender articles,” and files relating to several of Lewis’s books.
Most of the book files pertain to <title>
<part>Make No Law: The Sullivan Case and the First Amendment</part>
</title> in which Lewis examines the issues of freedom of speech, libel, and the press
in the Supreme Court case <emph>New York Times v. Sullivan</emph>. Other writings by
Lewis are located in Part II of the <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref>, especially
the byline folders and topical files. Some proposed books and a few books authored by
Lewis were also filed in the <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> by Lewis’s staff.
Files pertaining to <title>
<part>Gideon’s Trumpet</part>
</title> occur throughout the <ref target="annual">Annual File</ref>. Years after its
publication, Lewis still received correspondence about the book. Papers in 1979 and 1980
<ref target="annual">Annual File</ref> contain files relating to a movie based on <title>
<part>Gideon’s Trumpet</part>
</title>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="note">Notebooks</ref> series documents many of Lewis’s endeavors as a
reporter and columnist from 1974 to 1999. The Notebooks from his London bureau tenure,
1965-1972, cover a wide range of topics such as the beginning of the political violence
in Northern Ireland, the British entry into the European Economic Community (EEC), the
withdrawal of British forces abroad, and the relationship between the United States and
Great Britain. The Notebooks include Lewis’s interviews of people from Northern Ireland
regarding the Irish Republican Army bombings and the policies of the Democratic
Unionists Party. Also represented in the series are the British Parliament’s discussions
on withdrawing forces from territories east of Suez and military forces which were a
part of the British Army of the Rhine. Other notebooks chronicle the parliamentary
discussions about the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and the
bombing of Cambodia. Notebooks from 1973 to 1999 document mainly Lewis’s many trips to
London, Africa, and the Middle East. One 1973 notebook contains notes relating to
Watergate. </p>
<p>The <ref target="miscell">Miscellany</ref> series consists chiefly of files pertaining
to Lewis’s teaching files about legal issues and journalism. The majority of the
teaching files document Lewis’s lectures at Harvard Law School, Columbia University, and
Yale University. This series also includes appointment books, photographs, and a few
family papers.</p>

<p>The papers of George Kleine (1863-1931) span the years 1886-1946, with the bulk of the
material dated between 1900 and 1930. The collection consists primarily of business
records including correspondence, financial and legal papers, newspaper clippings,
printed matter, and miscellaneous material generated by Kleine's various financial
ventures in the motion picture industry. The papers are organized into three series:
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="list"> Inventories and Lists </ref>, and
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="distrifile"> Distribution File
</ref>.</p>
<p>A variety of material in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile">
Subject File </ref> documents the early history of the motion picture industry. There
are patent papers for some of the first projection equipment, legal documents from court
suits, and correspondence of major producers, distributors, and exhibitors.</p>
<p>The extent of Kleine's involvement in the industry is evident from files on corporations
that comprise a large portion of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>. In addition to papers relating to companies
that Kleine either owned or was associated with, such as Kleine Optical Company, Kalem
Company, and United Theatre Equipment Corporation, there are papers for Eastman Kodak
Company, Biograph Company, Essanay Film Manufacturing Co., and Famous Players-Lasky
Corporation.</p>
<p>Kleine's relationship with the Thomas A. Edison enterprises is documented in a file on
Edison and in correspondence with Thomas A. Edison, Inc. Kleine made extensive use of
Edison's “Conquest Film” series, which was especially designed for use in schools,
churches, and civic organizations. Kleine was also a member with Thomas A. Edison, Inc.,
and other firms in the first motion picture trust, the Motion Picture Patents Company,
and its distributing arm, the General Film Company, in which Kleine served as vice
president and later president. There are substantial files for this venture. The papers
also document the trust's fall from power following a suit against it by the Greater New
York Film Rental Company. The particulars of this suit and other legal entanglements are
detailed in files on litigation and Motion Picture Patents Company litigation.</p>
<p>Both the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref>
and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="distrifile"> Distribution File
</ref> series document Kleine's efforts to establish a non-theatrical film distribution
system. His aim to provide wholesome and instructional films is evident in the titles of
subject files: “better and highbrow film movements,” non-theatrical films,” “educational
films,” “educational distribution to universities,” and “educational institutions.” In
correspondence with William H. Dudley, chief of the Bureau of Visual Instruction of the
University of Wisconsin and organizer of the National Academy of Visual Instruction,
Kleine discusses his proposals for ensuring the moral content of film subjects. In the
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="distrifile"> Distribution File </ref>
series is evidence of his system for distributing films to schools, churches, and
community organizations through state universities.</p>
<p>The importation of foreign films consumed a significant part of Kleine's professional
interests beginning in 1903. Kleine eventually became the largest importer of foreign
films in the United States and Canada. In the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subfile"> Subject File </ref> is correspondence with foreign film companies
such as Ambrosio (Societá Anonima Ambrosio), Cines (Societá Italiana Cines), and Eclipse
(Société Générale des Cinématographers). Among the foreign films featured are <title localtype="simple">
<part>The Last Days of Pompeii, Julius Caesar</part>
</title>, and the spectacular motion picture, <title localtype="simple">
<part>Quo Vadis?</part>
</title> Kleine discontinued importing films after the start of World War I, but
correspondence in the 1920s with Alfred Bourget, his representative in France, reveals a
continuing interest in the subject.</p>
<p>Other topics in the collection that reflect on the early history of the film trade
include files on censorship, copyright, prize fights, and World War I.</p>
<p>Though brief in size, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="list">
Inventories and Lists </ref> series and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="distrifile"> Distribution File </ref> series provide an overview of the most
popular or sought-after film releases for the periods covered. Together with subject
files on banks, branches, distribution, finances, and historical material, they give a
detailed picture of the film distribution system for which Kleine is best known.</p>

<p>The papers of Elizabeth Severn (1879-1959) and Margaret Severn (1901-1997) span the
years 1880-1994, with the bulk of the material dating from 1910 to 1992. The collection
is in two parts. The part processed in 2013 is focused on Elizabeth Severn's activities
as a psychotherapist. The 2018 addition consists primarily of material related to dancer
Margaret Severn, Elizabeth Severn's daughter. The collection contains correspondence,
writings, photographs, printed matter, sketches, and digital files consisting of two
video documentaries, edited correspondence, and draft writings. The digital files are
related to Margaret Severn.</p>
<p>In the first part of the collection, focused on Elizabeth Severn, the correspondence is
almost entirely incoming letters, mostly from patients of Severn. There are also some
carbon copy letters written by World War II American Field Service volunteers giving
descriptions of wartime activities and postwar Germany. Other correspondents include
William Beebe and H. Halliday Sparling. Also of interest are the notes made during
lectures and seminars by Paul Federn and Robert Waelder. Although Elizabeth Severn and
her daughter Margaret maintained a long correspondence, Elizabeth Severn's portion is
not represented. Margaret, reportedly, in accordance with her mother's wishes, burned
her mother's letters in 1986. Elizabeth Severn's speeches and writings files include
drafts of three unpublished books as well as a set of typescript essays and speeches.
The printed matter includes publicity material for Elizabeth Severn's psychotherapist
career. The leaflets and cards advertise her lectures or her availability for therapy
sessions and document her travels. Newspaper clippings concern Severn lecture
appearances, news about psychoanalysis, and clippings of people who were close
acquaintances or patients of Severn. Reference copies of some photographs transferred to
the Prints and Photographs Division, including those with substantial writing on the
back, have been kept with the papers. Photographs include travel pictures, snapshots,
and portraits of Elizabeth Severn, as well as photographs of friends, family, and
patients, including a group of photographs of Severn with her analyst Sándor Ferenczi
and his wife, Gizella Ferenczi.</p>
<p>The 2018 addition is substantially larger than the original collection. Material
concerning Elizabeth Severn in the addition includes addressed envelopes tracking her
travels and residency changes from 1907 to 1935, received correspondence, writings, and
miscellaneous documents and printed matter. The bulk of the 2018 addition consists of
family correspondence: Margaret Severn's letters to her mother and grandmother (Amma).
In her responses to her mother's letters, information can be gleaned about Elizabeth
Severn's activities, travels, opinions, and her ongoing psychoanalytic relationship with
Sándor Ferenczi.</p>
<p>Margaret's letters to her mother and grandmother provide a detailed description of her
dance career and her personal life from 1919 to 1939. She often wrote daily letters and
was surprisingly frank with her mother concerning all aspects of her life including
sexual activity. Margaret Severn performed at the highest professional level of the
dance world in the United States and Europe. Trained as a ballet dancer when there were
no ballet companies in the United States, she spent years performing in vaudeville,
cabarets, and in the New York theater. In 1932 she moved to Paris and danced ballet in a
professional world dominated by Russian émigrés. Over the years, she danced with many of
the top dancers and choreographers of her time, and her letters provide an inside view
of the world of dance from 1920 to 1939. Dancers, choreographers, musicians, and
impresarios who worked with Margaret Severn, often appearing multiple times over the
years, and who figure in her letters are many but include the following: Luigi
Albertieri, Agnes De Mille, Michel Fokine, Ota Gygi, Eugene Iskoldoff, Kurt Jooss,
Bronislava Nijinska, Ida Rubinstein, Ruth St. Denis, and Alexander Steinert. An abortion
in April 1925, fully described in the letters, was the result of her 1924-1925 affair
with Hungarian violinist and fellow vaudeville performer, Ota Gygi. </p>
<p>Margaret Severn had her first major critical acclaim in 1920 when she performed in the
Greenwich Village Follies using masks created by artist Wladyslaw T. Benda. After the
success this performance, Benda taught Severn how to make her own masks for dance
performances. Her mask dances remained a signature performance piece throughout her
dance career. Two small masks of Margaret Severn are in the collection. In addition to
an active performance schedule, Severn opened the Dancers' Club at 347 W. 56th Street in
Manhattan (1930-1932). The club provided living accommodations, mail and laundry
services, practice facilities, an employment register, and social activities for
professional dancers, teachers, and students. Margaret sometimes included newsletters
from the club with her correspondence to her mother. In 1932, Margaret traveled to
Budapest to visit her mother and subsequently settled in Paris. She danced with
Bronislava Nijinska's ballet company in 1932 and with Ida Rubinstein's company for the
1934 Paris Opera House production that included the premiere of Stravinsky's <title render="italic">
<part>Perséphone</part>
</title>. Her letters to her mother provide lively
backstage descriptions of rehearsals and performances. Margaret Severn performed as
principal dancer and ballet master for a traveling company called the Ballet Russes de
Paris, 1935-1937. The company participated, with Margaret Severn as lead dancer, in the
July 1936 outdoor spectacle in Nymphenburg Park, Munich, Germany, called "Nacht der
Amazonen" (Night of the Amazons). For the performance, Severn was kidnapped by
horseback-riding Cossacks and later saved by Amazons (played by German women) on
horseback. "Nacht der Amazonen" was an annual event, 1936-1939. </p>
<p>The letters have many editorial marks, usually in green ink, that were made years later
when Margaret Severn was working on her memoir. Envelopes have been inscribed with notes
about the contents of the letter. The original writing in the letters and on the
envelopes, however, is still legible even with the edits. Although she never completed
her memoir, she did publish three articles in <title render="italic">
<part>Dance
Chronicle</part>
</title> based on parts of her correspondence. The articles are in the
autobiographical writings file. The digital files include her draft memoir and typed and
edited transcriptions of many of the letters, including early letters for which the
original paper copy is not in the collection. Presumably, the transcriptions of these
early letters are edited versions. Margaret Severn was also an artist. In addition to a
folder of her sketches, many of her letters are illustrated.</p>

<p>The papers of Norman Podhoretz cover the period 1950-1986 and consist of correspondence,
subject material, speeches and writings, printed matter, and miscellaneous material. The
collection is organized into five series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Gen">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Speech">Speeches and Writings File</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Misc">Miscellany</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Add">Addition</ref>. </p>
<p>Norman Podhoretz was educated as a literary critic under such teachers as Lionel
Trilling at Columbia University and F. R. Leavis at Cambridge University. Early in his
career, Podhoretz was an advocate of left-wing ideology. He was later to break from the
predominantly leftist and liberal New York intellectual community and become a leading
spokesman for a conservative philosophy, using <title>
<part>Commentary </part>
</title>as a vehicle for discussing neoconservative ideas. His papers document the
development of his career as a writer, editor, and social and political thinker.</p>
<p> Podhoretz throughout his career corresponded with many prominent writers, critics,
editors, politicians and other public figures. The bulk of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Gen">General Correspondence</ref> series is formed from
letters in Podhoretz's correspondence files at <title>
<part>Commentary</part>
</title> that were deemed inappropriate for the magazine's archive maintained by the
American Jewish Committee. Letters within the General Correspondence document
Podhoretz's involvement in literary and political activities. Among the correspondents
are Eldridge Cleaver, Allen Ginsburg, Lillian Hellman, Daniel P.Moynihan, Susan Sontag,
Terry Southern, Diana Trilling, and Kurt Vonnegut. There are also letters concerning
Podhoretz that were sent as enclosures to him, for example, a letter from Lionel
Trilling to Eliot Cohen, then editor-in-chief of <title>
<part>Commentary.</part>
</title> Although most of the correspondents are represented by only one or two letters,
the issues and ambiance of the time are chronicled in these communications.</p>
<p> Topics discussed in the General Correspondence series include censorship of Podhoretz's
writing as well as other literary works, endorsement of political candidates, support
for political points of view, and discussion of social and cultural issues such as
racism and poverty. Podhoretz's philosophical shift can in part be traced through the
General Correspondence. Letters related to individual works by him are filed in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Speech">Speeches and Writings File</ref>
series. </p>
<p>Featured in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Subj">Subject File</ref>
is Podhoretz's trip to India, Australia, and Asia in 1973, including a journal
containing sketches of people and places encountered in the various countries he
visited. His trip to Australia in 1982 to promote <title>
<part>The Present Danger</part>
</title> is also well documented. Another file in the series concerns Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's campaign for the Senate from New York in 1976. </p>
<p>The most extensive series is the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Speech">Speeches and Writings File</ref> including interviews, speeches, undergraduate
writings, short stories, articles, and books. Among the undergraduate writings are
Podhoretz's notebooks from a course in nineteenth-century British poetry taught by
Lionel Trilling. These notebooks are annotated by Trilling. Material from Podhoretz's
years at Cambridge includes copies of the English Tripos along with notes, drafts of his
thesis on Benjamin Disraeli, and notes from a class on the English moralists. The
collection also includes three unpublished short stories written when Podhoretz was in
the army. </p>
<p>The Articles subseries in the Speeches and Writings File contains a representative
sampling of Podhoretz's literary, social, and political criticism, including a number of
unpublished pieces. Drafts, galleys, published copies of articles along with
correspondence and research material are often present. Within the Articles file is an
expanded version of Podhoretz's thesis on Disraeli that he attempted to have published
in <title>
<part>Scrutiny</part>
</title> in 1953. Included with the essay is F.R. Leavis's critique of the piece. Among
the other literary essays in the collection are "Edmund Wilson: The Last of the
Patricians," "The Know Nothing Bohemians," "The Adventures of Saul Bellow," "Prurience
Subverted, or the Redemption of Candy," "In Defense of Editing," "Camus and His
Critics," and "F.R. Leavis: A Reevaluation." </p>
<p>Some of Podhoretz's social and political writings include "Masses, Classes, and Social
Criticism," "The New American Majority," and "J'Accuse," along with other articles
expounding Podhoretz's neoconservative point of view on subjects such as defense, the
Middle East, and Vietnam, most of which appeared in national magazines and newspapers. </p>
<p>Material exists in varying degrees to document the creation, production, and reception
of Podhoretz's five published books. In addition to drafts, galleys, and page proofs,
the collection includes correspondence from publishers and readers, book reviews, and
research material. The correspondence and book reviews impart a sense of how Podhoretz's
books were received and how he reacted to the mixed reception he met his works.</p>

<p>The papers of Robert Porter Patterson (1891-1952) span the years 1909-1956, with the
bulk of the material concentrated between 1930 and 1952. The papers are organized into
eight series: <ref target="correspond">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="legal">Legal
File</ref>, <ref target="speech">Speech File</ref>, <ref target="miscella">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref>, <ref target="war">Under
Secretary of War Files</ref>, <ref target="utid10001">2023 Addition</ref> and <ref target="classi">Classified</ref>. The <ref target="correspond">Correspondence</ref>
series is further arranged into seven subseries differentiated mostly by chronological
spans as compiled and maintained by Patterson before being received by the Library.
Additional correspondence can be found in the <ref target="utid10001">2023
Addition</ref> series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="legal">Legal File</ref> consists of briefs and memoranda on cases in
which Patterson presided as a judge, correspondence concerning the cases, and notes
taken or collected by him. Patterson served on the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, 1930-1939, and on the United States Court of Appeals,
Second Circuit, 1939-1940. The case material from his judgeships is filed alphabetically
according to the type of case and therein alphabetically by name. The collection also
contains a file of legal note by Patterson on a variety of subjects. These notes, along
with Patterson's law school notebooks, illustrate the intensity of preparation and the
care that went into his study of the law. In the <ref target="legal">Legal File</ref> as
well is an index to Patterson's legal cases from 1930 to 1939 and memoranda concerning
his legal cases from 1939 to 1940.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech">Speech File</ref>, <ref target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref>, <ref target="miscella">Miscellany</ref>, and <ref target="war">Under Secretary of War
Files</ref> are primarily concerned with Patterson's career as a government official.
Also present are materials relating to his estate and to Margaret Patterson's donation
of the collection to the Library.</p>
<p>The <ref target="utid10001">2023 Addition</ref> series consists of outgoing
correspondence documenting Patterson's professional activities in the latter years of
his career, and speeches and statements given during and after his tenure as secretary
of war. </p>
<p>Patterson's career covered a wide variety of interests and activities. His early years,
1891 to 1930, are represented by general correspondence covering the years, 1919-1927,
his law school notebooks, 1912-1915, and a diary, 1925. There is no personal material
prior to 1919 and none between 1927 and 1930. The only other pre-1930 material is
correspondence and other material concerning the Harvard Law School Association that was
given to Patterson during his presidency of the organization, 1937-1949.</p>
<p>The files for the years 1930-1940 are primarily concerned with legal matters and
Patterson's judicial career. The only personal material from the period is
correspondence pertaining principally to New York city and state politics.</p>
<p>The period 1940-1947, when Patterson served in the War Department, is well documented in
the collection. As assistant secretary, then under secretary of war, 1940-1945,
Patterson's primary responsibility was procurement and supply. Subjects covered in the
correspondence, memoranda, and reports for the period include civilian versus military
control of the wartime economy, military strategy, projected problems of the postwar
world, and the difficulties involved in regulating and controlling a wartime economy. Of
special interest is a file on wartime cabinet meetings that Patterson attended as a
representative of the War Department.</p>
<p>Patterson's tenure as secretary of war, 1945-1947, is also well documented. Photocopies
of his appointment books record in detail his daily activities for the period. Important
subjects include cabinet meetings, the postwar settlement in Europe, switching from a
wartime economy to a peacetime economy, the demobilization of the American military, and
the projected merger of two cabinet departments into the Department of Defense.
Patterson was an ardent believer in universal military training. Files on the issue can
be found throughout the correspondence and the reports of the 1940s.</p>
<p>After his resignation as secretary of war in 1947, Patterson formed the legal firm of
Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler. Topics from the period include, the Marshall Plan,
the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the embryonic European
Common Market. Patterson served actively on such organizations as the American
Association for the United Nations, the American Committee on United Europe, the
Atlantic Union Committee, the United States Committee for a United Nations Genocide
Convention, the Committee on the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the United States
Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (1947-1953, the
first Hoover Commission). Also covered is Patterson's chairmanship of the Long Island
Rail Road Commission and his chairmanship of the American Bar Association Commission on
Organized Crime. Of interest as well is a file concerning Francis Joseph Cardinal
Spellman and the war claims of the Vatican in the late 1940s. Patterson was a strong
supporter of civil rights as evidenced by the file on Freedom House and correspondence
with Walter Francis White, executive secretary of the NAACP.</p>

<p>The papers of Barry Commoner (1917-2012 ) span the years 1915-2009, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1940 to 1990. The collection documents Commoner's career as a
biologist, ecologist, writer, and environmental activist. The papers are organized into
seven series: <ref target="personfile">Personal File</ref>, <ref target="speech">Speeches and Writings File</ref>, <ref target="xx01">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="sf">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="organ">Organizations File</ref>, with a
<ref target="addit">1990 Addition</ref> and a <ref target="ad2">2019 Addition</ref>.
Researchers should keep in mind that the additions are sizeable with many repetitions of
file names and folder headings from the original accession. </p>
<p>Commoner, one of the founders of the environmental movement and a political activist,
was a professor of plant physiology and botany for many years at Washington University
in St. Louis, Missouri. He researched and published extensively on the tobacco mosaic
virus (for which he received the 1953 Newcomb Cleveland Prize) and the role of free
radicals. In addition to his purely scientific publications, Commoner wrote books on
environmentalism and the social aspects of science for the general public. Indeed,
providing scientific knowledge to the general public was the core of his political
activism. </p>
<p>Commoner’s political activism began with opposition to aboveground nuclear weapons
testing and the danger of radioactive fallout. In 1957, in collaboration with Linus
Pauling, Commoner wrote and distributed a letter calling for an end to nuclear testing.
Signed by thousands of scientists, it was presented to the president of the United
States and to the United Nations. In 1958 Commoner helped found the Greater St. Louis
Committee for Nuclear Information (CNI). The Baby Tooth Survey, conducted by CNI with
Commoner as one of the leaders, collected over two hundred thousand baby teeth to
measure the rising levels of radioactive strontium-90 in children’s bodies, the result
of fallout that had spread across the country from nuclear weapons testing in Nevada.
The Baby Tooth Survey attracted wide public attention, generating opposition to the
nuclear tests and influencing the signing of the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Commoner
considered this the first victory of the environmental movement. </p>
<p>The core of Commoner’s philosophy of environmental activism was already at the heart of
the Baby Tooth Survey: a belief that scientists have a moral obligation to explain
science to the general public so the public, not just scientists and politicians, can
make informed decisions about science policy. He called this the “science information
movement.” The other cornerstone of his environmental thinking was his conviction that
unless the means of production, especially energy production, changed, environmental
degradation could not be stemmed, thus requiring political solutions. With the goal of
establishing a new, progressive, environmentally-engaged political party, Commoner ran
as the presidential Nominee of the Citizens Party in 1980. </p>

<p>The records of the French and American Claims Commission span the years 1861-1884. The
commission was established by a treaty between the governments of France and the United
States in 1880 to resolve outstanding claims by French citizens residing in the United
States for property confiscated or destroyed during the Civil War. The records include
correspondence, petitions, inventories, depositions, lists, certificates, and receipts.
The bulk of the correspondence is conducted in French among non-naturalized French
residents, the French consul in New Orleans, and the French agent appointed to represent
the claims before the commission. Correspondence from American officials is in English.
The collection is arranged in two series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Claim"> Claimant Petitions </ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Misc"> Miscellany </ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Claim"> Claimant Petitions </ref>
series is composed of two groups of case files arranged alphabetically by the name of
the claimant or occasionally the name of an attorney or ship. The bulk of the first and
largest group of cases dates from 1862 to 1865 and contains petitions and related
documentation written by native French residents to the French consul in New Orleans,
the French minister in Washington, and the Ministère des Affaires Étrangères in Paris.
Many of the letters and inventories date from the spring and summer of 1862 soon after
Union forces captured New Orleans and launched a major western offensive in Mississippi.
The majority of petitions are from French residents of Louisiana, particularly New
Orleans. Also included are petitions from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi,
Missouri, and Texas. This group of case files was turned over to an agent assigned to
represent French claims before the commission in 1880. A second case file was created by
the agent and the commission in 1880. </p>
<p>The petitions provide insight into the Union Army's western offensive and its occupation
of New Orleans. The vast majority of petitions concern the confiscation or destruction
of property, including warehoused cotton, shop inventories, restaurant provisions, ships
and ship cargoes, homes and personal effects, crops, livestock, wagons, and farm
buildings. Some petitioners were Union prisoners suspected of fighting with or supplying
the Confederate army. Petitioners' letters often describe the circumstances surrounding
their loss of property or imprisonment. Also included are responses from American civil
and military officials at times refuting the claims in some detail. Included are letters
from Nathaniel Prentiss Banks, Benjamin F. Butler, William Henry Seward, and Edwin
McMasters Stanton. </p>
<p>Apart from the events of the war, the files reveal much about the social composition and
experiences of a transatlantic French community. Many of the letters contain
biographical information, including date and place of birth, date of immigration,
occupation, and occasionally family data. Detailed inventories shed considerable light
on the economic activities and personal effects of the claimants. </p>
<p>Unnumbered folders filed at the end of the first group of petitions include petitions by
groups and claims not covered by the commission, such as requests for compensation for
damages caused by Confederate forces and for emancipated enslaved people. Also included
among the unnumbered folders are protests from French residents of Bagdad, a town in
Mexico near the port of Matamoros. According to its residents, the town was attacked and
pillaged by United States soldiers in January 1866. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Misc"> Miscellany </ref> series
contains legation correspondence, lists of claims, notification of attorney
representation, powers of attorney, proofs of citizenship, and receipts for documents
returned to petitioners.</p>

<p>The papers of Philip Lee Phillips (1857-1924) span the years 1885-1921 and consist of
correspondence, writings, printed matter, and other personal material focused on
Phillips’s work and career at the Library of Congress as a cartographer and chief of the
Library’s Map Division. Almost entirely letters received, the correspondence is mostly

<p>The papers of Lewis Varick Frissell (who was known throughout his life as Varick
Frissell) span the years 1917-1970, with the greatest portion of the material dated
1925-1931. The diary, correspondence, writings, and business papers of these years
reflect a short but intense career of arctic exploration, writing, and documentary and
feature film making. Earlier papers are Frissell's juvenilia (mostly fiction), and later
papers are those of his family. The collection is organized by type of material. </p>
<p>Frissell's expedition to the Unknown River region of Labrador in 1925 resulted in his
discovery of the Lower Twin Falls of that river and in the first photograph of the Grand
Falls on the Hamilton River (now Churchill River and Falls). The journey is documented
in the diary, correspondence, and articles in the collection. This and subsequent
explorations in Labrador earned Frissell election as a Fellow of the Royal Geographic
Society and as a member of the Explorer's Club. </p>
<p>Much of the general correspondence and most of the business papers, as well as the
scripts and related papers in the collection, pertain to the two feature films produced
by Frissell. <title>
<part>The Great Arctic Seal Hunt </part>
</title>(1928), a silent documentary, was
written, produced, and photographed by Frissell while he worked as a sealer off the
Labrador coast in 1927. <title>
<part>The Viking</part>
</title> (1931), the first feature-length sound
film produced entirely on location, was written and produced by Frissell and was
directed by George Melford. The writings file in the collection includes synopses for
both films and scripts, continuity notes, and a negative film record for <title>
<part>The
Viking.</part>
</title> Distribution contracts and agreements, schedules of showings for both
films, and copies of correspondence between third parties about these arrangements are
included in the business papers. </p>
<p>In addition to the papers related to motion pictures, the writings contain numerous
articles on Labrador and the Arctic, reflecting Frissell's interest in the promotion and
development of the region. Other writings include Frissell's fictional pieces and his
poetry. </p>
<p>The largest sequence of general correspondence is between Frissell and Sir Wilfred
Thomason Grenfell and his philanthropic organization, the International Grenfell
Association. Grenfell, with whom Frissell had stayed on his first and on many later
visits to the North, was a well-known medical missionary to the Eskimos of Labrador.
Other prominent correspondents are Robert Joseph Flaherty, the noted documentarist, and
George Allan England, whose story "Vikings of the Ice" Frissell adapted for <title>
<part>The
Viking. </part>
</title>
</p>
<p>Family correspondence in the papers contains letters to and from Frissell and his
father, Lewis Fox Frissell, regarding Frissell's plans for and experiences on his
northern journeys. A large portion of the correspondence of Frissell's father relates to
the search for Frissell that was instituted during the spring of 1931, after the ship on
which he was retaking some scenes for <title>
<part>The Viking </part>
</title>exploded. Frissell was
never found, but the search for him is closely chronicled in telegrams and letters, as
well as newspaper clippings in the subject file and in scrapbooks. </p>
<p>The much later, 1965-1970, correspondence of Toni Frissell in the family correspondence
reflects her attempts to ascertain and publicize the facts of her brother's career.
Several of these letters contain enclosures that are copies of Frissell's correspondence
with his lawyers and with the Royal Geographic Society.</p>

<p>The papers of James Guthrie Harbord (1866-1947) span the years 1886-1938, with the bulk
of the material concentrated in the period 1917-1919. The collection consists of
correspondence, personal diary, confidential cables, administrative memoranda of General
John J. Pershing, records of conversations, clippings, scrapbooks, operational maps,
barrage charts, sketches, a portrait, records of the United States Army 2nd Division, a
portrait, translations of war diaries of the German army, and other papers pertaining to
Harbord's career in the United States Army. Featured are Harbord’s service as Pershing's
chief of staff during World War I; as commander of a marine brigade during the battle of
Chateau-Thierry, France, in 1918; commander of the 2nd Division in the Soissons
offensive; and commander of the American Expeditionary Forces Service of Supply,
1918-1919. Also documented is Harbord’s service as chief of the American Military
Mission to Armenia in 1919 as well as his postings prior to World War I, especially as
assistant chief of the Philippine Constabulary. The papers are organized by topic or
type of material. </p>
<p>Subjects include political and administrative issues within the military, Newton Diehl
Baker's activities as secretary of war during World War I, and the relationship between
Harbord and Baker until the latter’s death in 1938. Secretary Baker’s two visits to
Europe, one during the war in 1918 and one in 1919 while the Peace Conference was in
session at Paris, are briefly described, with accounts by Harbord on his conversations
with the secretary. Contained in a volume of Harbord-Pershing correspondence are copies
of Pershing’s administrative memoranda as well as Harbord’s own letters and
communications. A volume of personal miscellany contains a note from J. C. Grew,

<p>The papers of Nathan W. Daniels (1836-1867), spanning the years 1861-1867, consist of a
handwritten diary with photographs, illustrations, and newspaper clippings mounted
throughout the text in three volumes. Included are a typescript of summaries and
transcripts of the diaries by C. P. Weaver, who donated the collection, and a scrapbook
of newspaper clippings. </p>
<p>In volume one, Daniels describes his Civil War service with an African-American
regiment, the U.S. Army 2nd Native Guard Infantry Regiment, chiefly while stationed at
Ship Island, Mississippi, and his time in New Orleans during the summer and fall of
1863. In volume two, Daniels discusses military, political, and social affairs in
Washington, D.C., during his years in the capital, 1863-1865. Subjects include civil
rights, the creation of the Freedmen's Bureau (U.S. Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and
Abandoned Lands) in March 1864, radical Republicans, and the theater. Volume three was
written primarily by Daniels's wife, the Spiritualist medium Cora Hatch (Cora L. V.
Richmond). Topics include the Freedmen's Bureau, speaking engagements at
African-American churches in Washington, D.C., a visit with her family in Cuba, N.Y.,
and a lecture tour of the Midwest.</p>
<p>An addition to the Nathan W. Daniels collection consists of a scrapbook of newspaper
clippings, 1863-1867, probably assembled by Daniels or his wife. The scrapbook
complements the topics and events chronicled in the diaries of Daniels and Hatch. The
articles were usually written by Daniels under the pseudonym "Viator." They include
references to either him or his wife or pertain to subjects of interest to the couple,
such as African-American military service during the Civil War, the condition of
freedpeople after the war, Reconstruction, and spiritualism, particularly Washington,
D.C.</p>

<p>The papers of Rosa Louise Parks (1913-2005) span the years 1866-2006, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1955 to 2000. The collection documents many aspects of Parks's
private life and public activism on behalf of civil rights for African Americans. An
array of personal papers contains family papers, correspondence, writings, notes,
statements, event programs and invitations, tributes, medals, photographs, printed
matter, books owned by her, and a variety of employment, financial, health, and
residential records that reveal much about the material conditions of her life. Events
surrounding her arrest in 1955 for violating Montgomery, Alabama, segregation laws by
refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger, as well as the subsequent Montgomery
Bus Boycott, are described in many of her writings, notes, and correspondence from 1955
to 1956. The collection is arranged in eleven series: <ref target="parks1">Family
Papers</ref>; <ref target="parks2">General Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="parks3">Subject File</ref>; <ref target="parks4">Writings, Notes, and Statements</ref>; <ref target="parks5">Events</ref>; <ref target="parks6">Resolutions and Other
Honors</ref>; <ref target="parks7">Miscellany</ref>; <ref target="parks8">Printed
Matter</ref>; <ref target="parks9">Books Owned by Parks</ref>; <ref target="parks10">Medals</ref>; and <ref target="parks11">Oversize</ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="parks1">Family Papers</ref> open a window into some of Rosa Parks's
most important relationships. The series contains her correspondence with family
members, most notably her husband Raymond A. Parks, her mother Leona McCauley, and her
brother Sylvester McCauley. Correspondence with her husband and mother contains the
largest number of letters written by her in the collection. Her letters to Raymond Parks
date between 1957 and 1958 when she was living and working at the Hampton Institute in
Virginia and he was living in Detroit. Written in the aftermath of the bus boycott, the
letters reveal the personal toll those events took on both of them and the emotional
hardship of their separation. Rosa Parks's back-and-forth correspondence with her mother
Leona McCauley is more voluminous and spans several decades, largely from the late 1940s
to McCauley's death in 1979. The letters were written during periods when they were
apart from one another, most significantly between 1956 and 1958 during Rosa Parks's
speaking tours and employment at the Hampton Institute. James McCauley, Parks's father,
was not a consistent part of her life, a circumstance he reflects on in a letter written
to her in 1950. Letters by Sylvester McCauley largely concern his efforts to convince
his sister to move to Detroit. Correspondence with extended family consists of letters
from nieces, nephews, aunts, cousins, and other family members. Also included in the
series are other family papers that shed further light on the lives of Parks's husband,
mother, father, and brother. Raymond A. Parks's papers include several letters from
friends and acquaintances, as well as employment records, barber licenses, photographs,
certificates, Masonic dues books, and receipts, including one from their move to Detroit
in 1957. Among Leona McCauley's papers is an exchange of letters in 1956 with writer and
political activist Edita Morris. Some of Sylvester McCauley's papers relate to his
military service in World War II.</p>
<p>The <ref target="parks2">General Correspondence</ref> series is arranged in four files:
an alphabetical file, a chronological file, greeting cards, and letters and drawings
from children. The alphabetical file contains letters from prominent individuals and
those who played a significant role in Parks's life. Among them are Johnnie Rebecca
Carr, a prominent member of Montgomery's civil rights movement; Septima Poinsette Clark
of the Highlander Folk School; Virginia Foster Durr, a white civil rights advocate
living in Montgomery; and Fred D. Gray who represented Parks after her arrests in 1955
and 1956. Also included is a note from civil rights leader Audley Moore, better known as
Queen Mother Moore. A postcard written by Martin Luther King, Jr., while traveling in
Europe in 1957 was kept by Parks in a keepsake portfolio that is currently filed in the
Miscellany series. The postcard was transferred to the alphabetical correspondence file
during processing. Letters signed "Galatas" are from a childhood friend living in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The alphabetical file features several letters written by
Parks in 1956-1957, including one to "Anne," possibly Anne Braden, and another to
Jessica Mitford, both of which describe events during the Montgomery Bus Boycott. </p>
<p>A chronological file of largely incoming correspondence spans the years 1948-2006, but is more heavily weighted toward the last decades of Parks's life. The earliest correspondence in the 1940s and 1950s contains invitations to weddings and graduations, but also letters from friends and others, some of which make reference to civil rights issues. Later correspondence is composed principally of letters from organizations, event planners, some friends and acquaintances, and private individuals who wrote to express their admiration for her. Many of these letters contain requests for her to appear at events, to grant permission to quote from her interviews and writings, and to comment on scripts and other writings sent to her by the authors. A large file of greeting cards contains well wishes sent by friends and the public on her birthday, holidays, and during her periodic illnesses. Letters from school children, often illustrated, convey endearing, unselfconscious expressions of admiration. </p>
<p>The <ref target="parks3">Subject File</ref> focuses more narrowly on Parks's affiliation
with several organizations and institutions, her participation in major civil rights
events, and various efforts to honor her. Material on her institutional memberships
ranges from the Masonic Order of Eastern Star to St. Matthew Church in Detroit. Many of
the programs from her home church contain her notes and annotations. Included among the
material from the Highlander Folk School is a 1963 flyer condemning it as "a communist
training school" and reprinting an often-reproduced photograph of Parks, Martin Luther
King, Jr., and others at the school's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1957. Files are also
featured from leading civil rights organizations including the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Notable among
the major civil rights events documented in the file is the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Most
of this material dates from the boycott itself and includes draft instructions to
car-pool drivers and passengers written in Parks's hand and a Montgomery Fair department
store date book for 1955 that Parks used as a notebook during 1956. In it are lists of
names, including drivers during the boycott, as well as notes and reflections during
that critical year. These items suggest the active role she played in helping to
organize the boycott. Other material on the boycott includes a series of typescripts of
writings and interviews by Aubrey Willis Williams, most of which are annotated and
corrected by Parks. Interview transcripts consist of those between Williams and Martin
Luther King, Jr., Edgar Daniel Nixon, and Parks. Articles and a series of chronologies,
most of which are attributed to Williams and annotated by Parks, concern Parks's arrest,
the subsequent bus boycott, and race relations in the South in general. Material
relating to the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in 1957 includes advice to her from Bayard
Rustin. Ephemera documents her participation in other key events and includes a copy of
the first organizing manual for the March on Washington in 1963 and her name tag and
identity card from the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project in 1964 and the Poor People's
Campaign in 1968. Also explored in the <ref target="parks3">Subject File</ref> are
efforts to honor Parks, among them the creation of two national committees, the renaming
of a Detroit street in her honor, the establishment of a scholarship named for her, and
the awarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and Congressional Gold Medal
in 1999. A small file stemming from her work in Congressman John Conyers's Detroit
office and files from the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, an
organization founded by her to promote youth development and civil rights education,
round out the series.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks's <ref target="parks4">Writings, Notes, and Statements</ref> are organized as
a separate series and span several decades from her arrest on December 1, 1955, to her
final years at the end of the twentieth century. The series includes galleys and other
items from three co-authored books by her; drafts of writings from around 1956-1958;
prayers and spiritual reflections; statements honoring John Conyers and opposing the
appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court; and notes that range from
note-taking at meetings to random personal reflections to mundane jottings. A notebook,
probably dated 1956, records in part her travels to California where she had numerous
speaking engagements and attended the NAACP annual convention in San Francisco. Perhaps
most notable among her writings are two folders of handwritten, draft accounts of her
arrest, the subsequent bus boycott, and the dynamics of race relations in the South.
Although undated, some of these drafts are written on the back of 1956 letters,
envelopes, and a program. It is likely that many of them were written that year,
possibly for speeches given by Parks. Some may have been written between 1957 and1958
when Parks was living and working at the Hampton Institute. Also of note are drafts of
autobiographical writings in which Parks explored the impact of racism and
discrimination on her own life. It is uncertain why she wrote these drafts. Some may
have been written as notes for interviews or speeches, or she may have considered
writing her memoirs in either article or book form. </p>
<p>Many of Parks's speaking engagements, the honors she received, and events she attended
are documented in an<ref target="parks5"> Events</ref> series that contains programs,
invitations, flyers, and other publicity material. The file is arranged in two sections:
events featuring or honoring Parks and a general file for events that she most likely
attended even though her name does not appear in the programs. Items from events
featuring or honoring Parks trace the evolving way Parks was remembered and honored by
the American public. Some of the earliest events were organized as fund-raising benefits
to assist the Parks family as it struggled financially in the aftermath of her arrest.
Later events focused more exclusively on celebrating her as an iconic national hero and
the "mother of the civil rights movement." The programs in the general file are useful
in documenting the organizations, people, and movements she supported by her mere
attendance. The collection also includes numerous resolutions, tributes, honorary
degrees, and other honors awarded to Parks. These are arranged as a separate series and
are housed among the collection's <ref target="parks11">Oversize</ref> material.</p>
<p>A <ref target="parks7">Miscellany</ref> series documents many day-to-day and material
aspects of Rosa Parks's life including her employment, financial status, health,
memberships, donations, household furnishings, residences, and circle of friends,
family, associates, and contacts. Employment files largely consist of pay stubs and
vouchers, including those from the Montgomery Fair department store where Parks was
employed as an assistant tailor at the time of her arrest. Income tax records track the
financial status of the Parkses from 1943 to 1987 and expose the couple's prolonged
financial struggle following Rosa Parks's arrest in 1955. Other records including
insurance and banking records and receipts for household goods and rent provide further
insight into their financial conditions and coping strategies. Rosa Parks's web of
personal connections is partially documented through address books, invitation lists,
and telephone messages. Telephone messages dated 1974-1975 in particular provide a
glimpse into the casework handled by Parks and other staff in Congressman John Conyers's
Detroit office. </p>
<p>The <ref target="parks8">Printed Matter</ref> series contains material about Parks and
collected by her. Collected material focuses on such topics as civil rights, Martin
Luther King, Jr., and religion. It also includes commemorative stamps sent to her by
others and magazines and newspapers she presumably read and saved. Magazines and
newspapers with articles about Parks or briefly mentioning her are arranged separately
within the printed matter. The collection also contains books owned by Parks. Some of
the earliest publications were owned by family members whose names are written in the
books. Prominent among the family-owned books is a Bible recording births, deaths, and
marriages of members of the Percival, Arberry, and Edwards families. Copies of the
family register pages have also been made available in the <ref target="parks1">Family
Papers</ref> series. Some of the later books contain inscriptions to Parks by Fred D.
Gray, Alex Haley, John Oliver Killens, Coretta Scott King, Olivia Pearl Stokes, and
Studs Terkel, among others.</p>

<p>The papers of Gregory Goodwin Pincus (1903-1967) span the period 1920-2006, with the
bulk of the material concentrated in the years 1950-1967. The collection consists of
diaries, correspondence, writings, research files, and miscellaneous material relating
to Pincus's life and career, especially his role in developing and testing the
contraceptive pill. The papers are organized into nine series: <ref target="ping1">Diaries</ref>; <ref target="ping2">Personal Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="ping3">Professional Correspondence</ref>; <ref target="ping4">Speech,
Article, and Book File</ref>; <ref target="ping5">Research Material</ref>; <ref target="ping6">Notebooks</ref>; <ref target="ping7">Financial Papers</ref>; <ref target="ping8">Miscellany</ref>; and <ref target="add">Addition</ref>. The largest portion of the collection, the <ref target="ping3">Professional Correspondence</ref> series, is compartmented into four
subseries:<ref target="ping3a"> General File</ref>, <ref target="ping3b">G. D. Searle
&amp; Company File</ref>, <ref target="ping3c">Cancer Chemotherapy National Service
Center File</ref>, and <ref target="ping3d">Grants File</ref>.</p>
<p>Prominent in the <ref target="ping3a">General File</ref> subseries of the <ref target="ping3">Professional Correspondence</ref> are materials pertaining to the
Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, which Pincus helped found, and the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Among the studies documented are projects
conducted by Pincus in Haiti and Puerto Rico while developing and testing the oral
contraceptive. Correspondence and reports concern the women who participated in the
project and note their experiences, side effects, and thoughts and feelings about the
contraceptive pill. Significant correspondents include Alberto Ercoli, Celso-Ramon
Garcia, Mary Lasker, Katherine Dexter McCormick, Edris Rice-Wray, Hector Rocamora, John Rock, and Margaret Sanger.</p>
<p>Files relating to the <ref target="ping3b">G. D. Searle &amp; Company</ref>, which
manufactured most of the compounds investigated by Pincus in the search for the oral
contraceptives, document his relationship with Searle from as early as 1942, including
research projects that predate its association with the pill. The files are primarily correspondence and include related material. The <ref target="ping3d">Grants File</ref> subseries of the <ref target="ping3">Professional Correspondence
</ref>documents the range of research grants provided Pincus and his staff from many
sources.</p>
<p>Also in the collection are data files and experiment books kept by Pincus, the reports
of his staff at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, and manuscripts and
correspondence relating to the many articles he wrote concerning the results of his
research. The chronological arrangement of the <ref target="ping5">Research
Material</ref> series reveals the development of his interests and the thrust of his
research at different periods in his life. The volume of writings in the <ref target="ping4">Speech, Article, and Book File</ref> on the topic of the contraceptive
pill suggests the importance of this development and some of the controversy which
surrounded it.</p>
<p>The <ref target="ping1">Diaries</ref> series contains two volumes, one from 1920, with
original poetry, recounting the thoughts and experiences of Pincus as a youth of
sixteen, and the other, from a few months in 1941, describe the research in which he was
engaged and prospects for the future.</p>
<p>The <ref target="add">Addition</ref> includes writings by Pincus; correspondence; glass slides containing data and results of fertility control experiments, clinical trials, and control groups in the form of tables, graphs, and charts; a scrapbook of newspaper clippings related to the birth control pill; and other papers.</p>

<p>The papers of Harold Gould Henderson (1889-1974) span the years 1918-1955, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1937 to 1946. The papers consists of correspondence
memoranda, military papers, reports, notes, translations, drafts of writings, and
printed matter. They document Henderson’s service during World War II as chief of the
Japanese Language Section of the Allied Forces South West Pacific Area Psychological Warfare Branch, and later as head of the
Education Division of the Civil Information and Education Section, Supreme Command for
the Allied Powers, in occupied Japan. Included are reports and notes on wartime
propaganda leaflets and on postwar education reform. The papers also contain Henderson’s
account of having drafted a clause in the imperial rescript delivered on 1 January 1946
in which the emperor renounced his divinity. The collection further consists of
Henderson’s writings on Japanese art and literature, some of which he wrote while
teaching Japanese art and culture at Columbia University between 1935 and 1944. Included
are his English translations of Japanese haiku poems, principally those of Matsuo Bashō
and Yosu Buson. Henderson’s several books on haiku, beginning with <title>
<part>The Bamboo Broom: An
Introduction to Japanese Haiku</part>
</title> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1934) popularized the
poetic genre in America. </p>

<p>The records of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund span the years 1915 1968,
with the bulk of the material ranging from 1940 to 1960. Consisting of an <ref target="office">Office File</ref>, <ref target="subfile">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="legal">Legal Case File</ref>, <ref target="restrict">Restricted</ref> series,
and <ref target="overs">Oversize</ref>, these records document the work and procedures
of the organization as it combated racial discrimination against African Americans
during an era of legal segregation. The fund waged its battle against discrimination in
the nation's courts, and in so doing, initiated a public interest legal practice that
was unprecedented in American jurisprudence.</p>
<p>This collection is inextricably linked to the records of its parent organization, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and a full account
of most issues will require readers to consult both collections. The relationship
between the two entities is documented in the <ref target="office">Office File</ref> of
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund records. Furthermore, the Office File
documents the complex organizational and administrative decisions that set the course
for the NAACP's legal program during the crucial middle years of the twentieth century.
During its first few decades, the NAACP's legal work was often done on an unpaid and
voluntary basis. Later, guided by a board of directors and the recommendations of a 1931
report on legal strategy by Nathan Margold, the NAACP began mapping out an ambitious
legal program to seek equal justice, full citizenship rights, and an end to racial
segregation. It was clear that this legal program required a paid staff and solid
funding. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., was formed as a membership
corporation in 1939 to take advantage of tax exemptions available to nonprofit,
nonpolitical charitable organizations, a tax status that had been denied to the NAACP by
the Internal Revenue Service. Commonly known as the "Legal Defense Fund," the "Inc.
Fund," or simply "the Fund," its purpose was to obtain income for the NAACP legal
program.</p>
<p>In 1940 the U.S. Treasury Department granted tax-exempt nonprofit status to the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. Thurgood Marshall was named director of the
fund and, concurrently, special counsel to the NAACP. The executive secretary of the
NAACP was appointed to the board of directors for the fund. Budgets for the two
operations were to remain separate. However, the interlocking boards of directors and
shared office space at the NAACP headquarters in New York City meant that the separation
was little more than a technicality.</p>
<p>By the early 1950s, the fund was outgrowing its office space and its subsidiary role.
The Internal Revenue Service continually questioned the fund's tax-exempt status, since
the NAACP and the fund were operated by the same people out of the same office.
Reasoning that a move would placate the IRS and ease the crowding, the Legal Defense
Fund moved its offices in December 1952. At the time of the move, the staff included
Thurgood Marshall, five attorneys, a research assistant, a field worker, a fund-raiser
and secretarial and clerical personnel. The Legal Defense Fund staff took a number of
NAACP files which it had been reviewing, such as those concerning Josephine Baker's
treatment at the Stork Club in New York City, and files pertaining to the Detroit riot
of 1943. These records were incorporated into the fund's records and can now be located
in the <ref target="subfile">Subject File</ref>. Confusion as to which documents
belonged where continued to plague both organizations. A courier system was established
to exchange mail and other documents twice a day, a necessary expedient since many legal
matters were addressed to the NAACP for years to come.</p>
<p>To protect itself and the legal program against charges of stirring up lawsuits, and
especially to shield lawyers from disbarment who were associated with its cases, the
fund established new procedures in handling litigation. After 1955 it only took cases of
indigent African Americans who had been denied a civil or constitution right solely
because of race or color and who personally or through their attorneys or immediate
family requested the assistance of the Legal Defense Fund. No longer did the fund work
at the behest of branch or national officers of the NAACP. </p>
<p>Unlike the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund did not have branches, but retained services of
regional lawyers in California, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Louisiana, and Texas
typically to handle cases in federal courts. It also paid and supervised local attorneys
who conducted litigation in state courts. Records concerning these attorneys are in the
<ref target="office">Office File</ref>.</p>
<p>Success in court brought intense scrutiny. After the interlocking boards of directors
became an issue, the boards of the NAACP and the Legal Defense Fund agreed to separate
in late 1956. Marshall became the director of the fund and relinquished his title as
special counsel to the NAACP. An office of NAACP General Counsel was created to which
Robert Carter was named, bringing an end to Carter's association with the fund. The
legal program, in effect, was transferred from the NAACP to the Legal Defense Fund in
1956. When its lease ended in 1957, the fund moved again and opened its new offices in
January 1958. This move signaled a break with the parent organization, one that did not
cause too much concern so long as Marshall remained director. When he left in 1961 to
become a federal judge, the question of the relationship between the two organizations
was reconsidered.</p>
<p>Jack Greenberg succeeded Marshall as director of the fund in 1962. Thereafter, the NAACP
reestablished its own legal department under the direction of Robert Carter. However,
until the mid-1960s, litigation undertaken in the name of the NAACP was handled by Legal
Defense Fund lawyers, and documentation of such action is located in the Legal Defense
Fund records. The records in the <ref target="office">Office File</ref> thus represent a
period of transition for the NAACP and for the Legal Defense Fund. </p>
<p>The legal program of the NAACP is documented in the <ref target="subfile">Subject
File</ref> as well as the <ref target="legal">Legal Case File</ref>. Any matter not
in the form of a legal proceeding is filed as a subject. Thus, "crime," "soldier
troubles," and "veteran's complaints" contain many requests for aid along with nonlegal
documents concerning specific cases. Similarly, broad areas of civil rights violations
are documented under "armed forces," "discrimination," "housing," "labor," "schools,"
"transportation" and "voter registration." </p>
<p>The<ref target="legal"> Legal Case File</ref> documents cases handled by the fund in its
coordinated attack aimed at laws or practices of racial discrimination which limited or
prohibited access to education, property, and the political process; or laws which
excluded or imposed special restriction on racial groups in domestic relations, criminal
law, public accommodations and services, and elsewhere. The strategy was to initiate or
counter an interrelated set of cases which would cumulatively bring an end to racial
segregation and discrimination. </p>
<p>Cases are filed alphabetically by title in keeping with the original order as
established by the Legal Defense Fund. Material within the file is arranged to reflect
the development of each case. The emphasis is on chronology and on the progression from
unofficial, incomplete, and related material to the official records and the summarized
presentations. Therefore, <title>
<part>correspondence</part>
</title> which is not part of the court record is filed first. <title>
<part>Background material</part>
</title> is next and comprises a working file of memoranda, notes, data, reports, and
drafts. <title>
<part>Legal documents</part>
</title> are the official documents transmitted to and from the court during legal
proceedings. Legal documents can include the following: affidavits, briefs,
correspondence, depositions, exhibits, finding of facts, judgments, memoranda, motions,
notices, opinions, orders, interrogatories and answers to interrogatories, and trial
transcripts. Documents are arranged chronologically or by document type if bulk
necessitates, as with some transcript and exhibit books. At case closing, or for
particular presentations, various actions and decisions were published in an edited and
condensed form and are designated as <title>
<part>printed case records</part>
</title>. </p>
<p>Occasionally, the case file will include records of litigation from a lower court,
counter actions, or related records in test cases. These records are designated <title>
<part>related cases</part>
</title> and cited thereunder. Related cases are cited by title and may include all of
the record types as found in the main case file.</p>
<p>A parenthetical note indicates the general category for the case and the location by
state of the proceedings. Cases litigated up to the mid-1960s can be grouped into the
following broad categories: armed forces, civil rights protest demonstrations, criminal
proceedings, domestic relations, education, elections, housing and real property, labor,
public accommodations, recreational facilities, and transportation. See the index
appended to the register for a description of these categories and a listing of cases by
category and state.</p>
<p>Over 450 cases are represented in the <ref target="legal">Legal Case File</ref> and
education cases comprise the largest category. <title>
<part>Brown vs. Board of Education</part>
</title> is the fund's landmark case, the case that ended racial segregation in the
public schools, and yet case files for <title>
<part>Brown</part>
</title> are not included in this series. They are preserved among the records of the
NAACP along with those of other important education cases decided by the Supreme Court
including <title>
<part>State of Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada</part>
</title> (1938), <title>
<part>Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma</part>
</title> (1948), <title>
<part>Painter v. Sweatt</part>
</title> (1950), and <title>
<part>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents</part>
</title> (1950). However, records related to the <title>
<part>Brown</part>
</title> case can be found in the other series in this collection. The Supreme Court
took up the school segregation cases consolidated under <title>
<part>Brown</part>
</title> in the spring term of 1953. Unable to reach a decision, the justices requested
that both sides address five questions and reargue the case in the fall term. Records
pertaining to the reargument are in the <ref target="office">Office File</ref>,
particularly the extensive records of the Committee on Historical Development. The Court
decided the case in May 1954; segregation was ruled to be unconstitutional. But
questions remained concerning implementation of the ruling. The court again asked the
litigants to argue the case for implementation in what is commonly referred to as <title>
<part>Brown II</part>
</title>. The Legal Defense Fund organized a Committee of Social Science Consultants to
address the questions of implementation. Committee records are located in the <ref target="office">Office File</ref>. Related documents in the <ref target="subfile">Subject File</ref> series are filed under "schools."</p>
<p>Housing and property cases in the <ref target="legal">Legal Case File</ref> series
include documents from the NAACP's first case on this issue: <title>
<part>Buchanan v. Warley</part>
</title> (1917). Public accommodations, transportation, and recreation cases date from
the 1950s to the 1960s. Cases concerning elections and voting rights are mostly from the
1940s and 1950s with one large case, <title>
<part>Gray v. Main</part>
</title>, from 1966. The landmark white primary case of <title>
<part>Smith v. Allwright</part>
</title> (1944) is located in the NAACP records. Labor cases span the 1930s to the
1950s, however, much of the related material is in the <ref target="subfile">Subject
File</ref> series, including material on the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union. Cases
concerned with the armed forces were litigated primarily in the 1940s and early 1950s,
including the Korean War cases reviewed by Thurgood Marshall while investigating combat
conditions and court martial proceedings in Korea. Civil rights protest demonstration
cases were litigated primarily in the early- to mid 1960s. </p>

<p>The Truman administration adopted a policy in 1948 of "equality of treatment and
opportunity" in a plan which called for racial integration of the United States
armed forces by 1954. The Korean War accelerated the process so that integration
was to be implemented by 1952. However, the NAACP continued to receive and
investigate complaints of bias relating to assignments, promotion, discipline, or
the administration of military justice. Furthermore, integration was much slower
in reserve units, and few African Americans received Reserve Officer Training
Corps scholarship awards. Finally, the fund challenged lingering segregation in
schools, housing, and other collateral activities on military bases.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>By 1960, court cases and integration efforts were sometimes accompanied by forms
of social protest such as sit-ins and group marches. Demonstrators were often
arrested for breach of peace or trespassing and some were defended by the fund.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The fund litigated cases in which a defendant claimed denial of due process
because of racial discrimination. Usually these cases raised questions about jury
selection, coerced confessions, competent legal representation, and unfair
sentencing. Some cases involved lynchings; others concerned police misconduct and
racial segregation in prisons. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Antimiscegenation laws were challenged, as were those which prohibited interracial
cohabitation or which imposed special penalties if the offenders were of different
races. Similarly, the fund challenged adoption and child custody cases which were
based on racial considerations. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Discrimination in education was the fund's primary area of litigation from the
1940s to 1960s. Initial efforts were directed at gaining equal facilities and
curriculum for students and equal pay for teachers in Negro schools. By the 1950s,
it had been clearly demonstrated in the courts that separate schools would never
be equal. Thereafter, cases aimed for integration at all levels of public
education: first in professional schools, and then in elementary and secondary
schools, colleges, and universities. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The fund took cases to gain or protect voting rights in general elections and
primaries. Other cases concerned electoral district apportionment and strictures
on Negro candidates and bloc voting. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p> The fund challenged racial zoning laws and restrictive covenants which excluded
ethnic groups, and segregation or discrimination in federal housing and other
public housing aid programs. Other litigation involved individuals who resorted to
the courts to protect private property rights, or cases brought against
individuals who obstructed integration of residential neighborhoods. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Depression era cases often concerned forced labor or peonage. Thereafter, the fund
worked to define fair employment practices by challenging discrimination in
government employment or by companies receiving government contracts, exclusion of
African Americans from professional associations or union membership, especially
when unions negotiated contracts and were otherwise consulted on labor practices.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Includes cases which do not fit into outlined categories. Of note are the cases
involving the NAACP's right to do business in various states in the 1950s,
particularly in Texas. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Segregation in public accommodations, recreational facilities, and transportation
were daily manifestations of "Jim Crow." Racial distinctions in public
accommodations were usually not imposed by state statutes; many facilities banned
African Americans or were segregated by custom, or local ordinance and regulation.
Cases of racial discrimination were brought against auditoriums, hospitals and
health facilities, hotels, insurance companies, libraries, restaurants,
cafeterias, and lunch counters, retail stores, theaters and other places of
entertainment. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The fund undertook cases which specifically targeted segregated recreational
facilities supported by public funds such as parks, beaches, swimming pools, golf
courses, and tennis courts because these cases provided a clear and strong
challenge to separate-but-equal precepts. Later, the fund brought cases of racial
discrimination against privately owned and operated facilities. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The fund challenged various state laws requiring segregated travel in buses and
trains. Suits contended that separate quarters were not equal and also raised
jurisdictional questions. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was eventually
vested with the authority to revoke segregation when it impeded interstate
commerce, and cases involving segregation on interstate trains and buses were
thereafter heard by the ICC. Local transit authorities, mainly city bus and
street-car systems, continued to be challenged in the courts. </p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p> The records of the Hillcrest Children's Center span the years 1815-1966, with the bulk
of the material concentrated in the period 1880-1960. Largely administrative, the
records reflect the financial and managerial techniques of the institution that until
the 1950s provided for the care and protection of homeless youths and in subsequent
years for the treatment of emotionally disturbed children. The records include
correspondence, minutes of meetings, committee and staff reports, admittance and
application records, indentures, journals, ledgers, financial statements, deeds,
mortgages, bank checks, budget estimates, index cards, and miscellaneous material.</p>
<p> The records have been organized into three series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="unbound">Unbound
Records</ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="bound">Bound Records</ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="misc">Miscellany (Oversize)</ref>. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="unbound">Unbound Records</ref> are further subdivided into seven numerically classified
categories: general records (100s), children's records (200s), lady managers' records
(300s), trustees' records (400s-500s), property records (600s-700s), legacy and gift
records (800s), and historical and miscellaneous records (900s). The numerical
classification system, which also extends to the other two series, was designed by
Dorothy Smith Coleman for the center in 1953 and has been left largely intact with only
minor revisions and processing refinements. </p>
<p>The Washington Female Orphan Asylum, Hillcrest Center's original name when it was
founded in 1815, was initially established to care for girls left homeless by the
British invasion of the capital during the War of 1812 <ref target="war">[1]</ref>. In
the years since its founding, many Washington notables, including Dolly Madison (the
center's first director), Marcia and John Van Ness, William Corcoran, and Blair Lee,
among others, have contributed to the success of the institution as trustees or members
of the Board of Lady Managers. Documentation relating to the early history of the
institution is scanty and can be found chiefly in the minutes of the meetings of the
Board of Lady Managers.</p>
<p id="war">1. In 1828 the institution's name was changed “forever” by act of Congress
(May 24) to the Washington City Orphan Asylum. Though Washington City Orphan Asylum
still remains its official name, the institution was called Hillcrest Children's
Village from 1927 to 1953 and Hillcrest Children's Center since 1953.</p>
<p>Traditionally the administration of the asylum rested with a Board of Lady Managers,
charged with supervising the daily management of the institution and the care of the
children, andwith five male trustees, whose duties included financial and property
management. Of the two administrative units, the ladies' records are the more varied and
complete, especially after the turn of the century. Of prime importance to the ladies'
records are the minutes of the meetings which contain much of the basic information
abstracted for the annual reports. The minutes contain correspondence, directives,
committee and staff reports, resolutions, and memoranda prepared for and included as a
result of the meetings. Other informative data concerning the lady managers, as well as
the children receiving services, will be found in the staff and committee reports which,
for the most part, are organized separately. Staffing, budgeting, maintenance, and
medical services available for the children are the central points depicted in the
superintendent and staff reports for the period 1933-1956. Beginning in the 1930s, a
social worker prepared reports for the case committee detailing information on the
applicants and residents. This information, in the form of case histories, describes to
some degree the child's family background and personality traits. The lady managers'
records also include reports of the Grounds and Educational Committees, journals listing
the amount of overhead such as staff salaries and plant maintenance, and financial
records pertaining to the Hillcrest home on Nebraska Avenue, N.W. </p>
<p>The records relating to the trustees are primarily financial in character, reflecting
their role as budget directors and property managers. Although incomplete, the files
include minutes of meetings, ledgers, journals, auditors' reports, promissory notes, and
some correspondence. The property records, which comprise a separate series, greatly
augment the fragmentary trustees' file and contain a wealth of information focused
equally between investment properties and the asylum's residences.</p>
<p>The property records, while lacking in correspondence, reflect land values, building,
repair, and rental costs in Washington, especially for the years 1870-1900. The trustee
and property records and the files relating to legacies form the core of the center's
financial records for the middle period and later years.</p>
<p>A significant though limited amount of material remains in the collection relating to
the merger of Hillcrest with the Washington Institute of Mental Hygiene and Children's
House. Documentation supplied by the annual reports and the ladies' minutes outlines the
merger procedure which took place over the period 1953-1961. The superintendent's
reports, together with information supplied by the case histories, treat with detail the
staff's growing conviction that psychological treatment of children took precedence over
other considerations. Consequently, in 1953 Hillcrest formed a working arrangement with
the above-mentioned institutions to care exclusively for emotionally disturbed children.
In 1961, after a report prepared by the Community Research Center of New York, the
separate institutions merged under one administration.</p>
<p>Rounding out the collection are three file groups entitled children, general, and
miscellaneous records. Files within these groups contain references to adoptions,
indentures, constitutions, bylaws, annual and biennial reports, early acts of Congress
relating to the formative years of the institution, historical sketches of the asylum,
and complete description of the archives by Coleman.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerical classification outlined above, there is a further decimal
classification for some of the records (see the first folder in Container 1 for
details). Generally, the numerical classification is followed by three letters as
described below: </p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p> The papers of Saul Robert Kleiman (1918-2004) span the years 1935-1983, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1943 to 1945. The papers are mostly in English and Japanese,
with Burmese, Kachin, Shan, and other ethnic Asian languages. The collection is arranged
largely according to the groupings established by Kleiman: biographical information,
correspondence, Office of War Information files, research files, submissions for awards,
and writings, and therein alphabetically by type of material or topic.</p>
<p>The largest portion of the papers relates to Kleiman's service with the United States
Office of War Information (OWI) during World War II and pertains to psychological
warfare and the use of propaganda in the Far East. The Office of War Information files
contain correspondence, memoranda, propaganda in various languages with English
translations including leaflets, newspapers, printed matter, broadsides, and ephemera,
interrogations of prisoners of war, reports on the effectiveness of propaganda,
newsletters, newspaper clippings, and Japanese propaganda in the Philippines. The files
also contain personal papers relating to Kleiman's duties and his daily diary. The
personal correspondence from the war years also contains information relating to his
propaganda activities. Kleiman's writings contain drafts of articles and a radio program
he wrote during the war.</p>
<p>On April 3, 1943, Kleiman arrived in New Delhi, India, and was attached to the
China-Burma-India Theater (CBI), until June 1, 1944. His papers, however, were grouped
under Burma-India. In May-June, 1943, he traveled to Burma and Assam, India, to make a
study of the area of CBI-projected operations, to establish liaisons with the American
and British military commanders in the area, and to arrange distribution channels for
CBI-projected leaflets and other propaganda. Kleiman's multipage report discusses opium
distribution in Burma, plans for Burman reconstruction, interviews with British and
American military officials, events in the Hukawng Valley and attitudes of the Kachins,
propaganda strategy, and the vegetable seed program that dropped seed packets by
airplane. He also submitted an intelligence report detailing the speeches and activities
of Eddie Rickenbacker during the captain's tour through the Assam area. Also chronicling
some of Kleiman's activities in the CBI is his daily diary dating from March 1944
through May 1944. The diary discusses design and production of leaflets, use of Nisei to
translate leaflets into Japanese, scheduled drops of leaflets, a radio broadcasting
project, use of a public address system to broadcast propaganda, problems with supplies,
resettlement of Kachin refugees, and meetings with military personnel. Further material
on the CBI is under the heading of leaflets produced in other areas.</p>
<p>Even though China was part of the CBI, Kleiman's files on Yenan, actually Yan'an, were
kept separately. Material on this area consists of leaflets and reports. The reports are
comprised of intelligence reports on the Eighteenth Group Army of the Chinese that was a
combination of the Eighth Route Army of Chinese communists and the New Fourth Army, and
a series of "Yenan Reports" submitted by Francis McCracken Fisher, chief of the China
Division, OWI, covering psychological warfare findings at and about Yenan from 1944 to
1945.</p>
<p>From June 2, 1944, until May 13, 1945, Kleiman was attached to the Southwest Pacific
Area. He surveyed the New Guinea combat zones in June and July, and in early September
1944 arrived in Hollandia, New Guinea, to set up a psychological warfare operation at
the headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur and the Sixth Army. There Kleiman was in
charge of all forward operations for the OWI in the Southwest Pacific Area and director
of leaflet production for the Sixth Army. On October 20, 1944, soon after General
MacArthur's landing, Kleiman also landed at Red Beach on Leyte Island in the
Philippines. He put on the first <title>
<part>Voice of Freedom</part>
</title> radio broadcast from the <emph render="italic">Apache</emph> (radio
broadcasting ship). Propaganda operations were then moved inland to Tacloban. The close
timing of his arrival in New Guinea and his landing on Leyte Island is probably why
Kleiman combined the two areas in his files. Material consists of leaflets,
correspondence, reports, interrogations of prisoners of war, radio broadcasts, and the
basic military plan for psychological warfare in the Southwest Pacific Area. Under the
heading of Leyte Island, Philippines, are propaganda newspapers and bulletins produced
in the Philippines including the <title>
<part>Leyte Shimbun</part>
</title>, <title>
<part>Leyte-Samar Bulletin</part>
</title>, <title>
<part>Leyte-Samar Free Philippines</part>
</title>, and the <title>
<part>Voice of Victory</part>
</title>.</p>
<p>On February 8, 1945, Kleiman flew into the Philippine capital of Manila where he stayed
until May 13. Material relating to his efforts there includes leaflets and the
newspapers <title>
<part>Manila Free Philippines</part>
</title> and <title>
<part>Airborne Edition Free Philippines</part>
</title>. Of interest among the usual reports on the effectiveness of the leaflets and
Japanese morale is a report on Chinese guerrilla organizations on Luzon and their
activities.</p>
<p>The Office of War Information files also contain a group of uncategorized material,
scrapbooks, and propaganda from the Asian and European theaters of war. Items in the
uncategorized material, consisting of documents either designated by Kleiman as
miscellaneous or found loose, are the same type of material housed in the categorized
files. In all probability, the loose items were originally part of the categorized
material. The scrapbooks were presented to personnel who had worked in propaganda in the
Far East and contain runs of propaganda leaflets and newspapers. Propaganda from both
theaters of war include leaflets, broadsides, magazines, pamphlets, and ephemeral items
(called novelties by Kleiman) that include matchbooks, matchboxes, leaves of soap, and
sewing kits, all marked with propaganda.</p>
<p>A large part of the personal correspondence relates to Kleiman's activities during World
War II. There are letters to and from his first wife, Elnora H. Kleiman, with friends
serving in the war and at home, and with his colleagues in the OWI. The correspondence
with his colleagues is the same type Kleiman filed in the Office War Information files
and often discusses propaganda and the war. Of interest are discussions on how to phrase
propaganda so that conquered peoples understand that the Americans are freeing them from
the Japanese and not from European colonizers. Correspondents include Frederic S.
"Fritz" Marquardt, Barbara R. "Bobbe" Monroe, and Marshall Darrow "Marsh" Shulman.</p>
<p>Rounding out the collection are clippings of articles written by Kleiman from 1935 to
1955, biographical material, and his research files for articles written after the war
concerning United States-European relations.</p>

<p>The papers of Peyton Conway March (1864-1955) span the years 1897-1955, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1898 to 1933. The papers are organized into the following
series: <ref target="cor">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="spw">Speeches and
Writings</ref>, <ref target="sf">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="mis">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="scr">Scrapbooks</ref>, and <ref target="ov">Oversize</ref>. The collection is focused on March's globe-spanning military career,
specializing in artillery command, and his retirement writings and opinions on military
topics. March is given credit for establishing the primacy of the chief of staff
position within the army hierarchy. As chief of staff, March succeeded in transporting
the troops and supplies to Europe for the rapid buildup of the American Expeditionary
Forces in 1918 and then overcame the logistical challenge of demobilization in 1919.
Notable correspondents in the papers include Newton Diehl Baker, Tasker Howard
Bliss,William Sidney Graves, and John J. Pershing.</p>
<p>The <ref target="cor">Correspondence</ref> series has a chronological file from 1911 to
1955 and a small alphabetical file that dates solely from 1918 to 1921, while March was
chief of staff. The correspondence is largely military-related before 1921, the year of
his retirement. Post retirement correspondence concerns his writing projects, special
requests from the public, and personal correspondence with friends, often other retired
military personnel.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spw">Speeches and Writings</ref> file includes the drafts of his 1932
book <title render="italic">
<part>The Nation at War</part>
</title>, March's personal history of World
War I and a critical response to Pershing's 1931 book <title render="italic">
<part>My
Experiences in the World War</part>
</title>. Book reviews and related material are also
included. Additionally, this series contains copies of lectures before the Army War
College, speeches, newspaper articles, and draft writings on the Astor Battery, his
memoirs, and his thoughts on Japanese intentions in Asia in 1933.</p>
<p>The<ref target="sf"> Subject File</ref> is largely organized around March's various
military assignments: command of artillery at Fort Riley, Kansas, command of the Astor
Battery in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War, service in the Philippines
working with General Arthur MacArthur during the 1899 Philippine American War,
assignment to the Japanese Imperial Army in Manchuria as an observer during the
Russo-Japanese War, and service in France during World War I. Also in the Subject File
are reports and training manuals on a variety of army topics, but with a special focus
on World War I and on artillery. March's memorandum arguing against the Siberian
intervention by Allied forces in 1918 is in the Subject File; correspondence concerning
the Siberian intervention is in the Correspondence File.</p>
<p>The <ref target="mis">Miscellany</ref> series is primarily composed of news clippings
and printed matter related to March, an assortment of War Department proposals and
reports, and other miscellaneous material.</p>
<p>The <ref target="scr">Scrapbooks</ref> series, all placed in Oversize, has nine volumes,
seven of which are collections of newspaper clippings, with a few photographs and
magazine articles, documenting the career of March. The last two scrapbooks relate to
March Air Force Base, Riverside, California, which was named for March's son, Peyton C.
March, Jr., an army air corps pilot who was killed in a 1918 flight training exercise in
Texas.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence Collection, dating from 1776 to 1942, consists of
miscellaneous copies of documents, mostly photostats, relating to the creation of the
Declaration of Independence and its Virginia antecedents. Originals are at the Library
of Congress, New York Public Library, University of Virginia Library, Massachusetts
Historical Society, and the Department of State. Also in the collection are nineteenth
and early twentieth-century printed copies of the Declaration of Independence. Of note
are photostats of the Virginia Constitution and Declaration of Rights, 1776; photostats
of the Resolution for Independence passed by the Continental Congress on June 7, 1776;
photostats of Thomas Jefferson's record of debates in the Continental Congress, July
1-12, 1776 (originals in the Thomas Jefferson papers at the Library of Congress); and
two copies of William James Stone's facsimile edition of the Declaration of
Independence, published for the U.S. Secretary of State in 1823, and one later edition
of Stone's facsimile. It is possible that some of these documents were assembled for a

<p>Johnston served with the 92nd Infantry Division, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers
Division, during World War II, and the division saw heavy combat in northern Italy from
1944 to 1945. Included in the papers are Johnston's Buffalo Soldier patch, a publication
about the division, and documentation regarding his award of a Bronze Star Medal in
1945. As a white, commanding officer in a primarily African-American unit of the
segregated United States Army, Johnston wrote to his wife about his dealings with the
troops. He was proud of their accomplishments and recommended some for decorations.
There are glimpses of the racial dynamics and tensions in the division in Johnston's
early correspondence. The full extent of Johnston's experience with the division is
discussed in the oral history interviews conducted by Carolyn Johnston, daughter of
Eugene Edwin Johnston, from 2001 to 2005. In 2012, Carolyn Johnston used the oral
history interviews in her publication <title>
<part>My Father's War: Fighting with the Buffalo
Soldiers in World War II.</part>
</title> The oral history interviews are located in the
digital files. In addition, Johnston's military papers and personnel 201 file chronicle
his service in Austria with the 350th Infantry Regiment from 1950 to 1953 and his role
as a military advisor in Taiwan from 1956 to 1957 and in Thailand from 1961 to 1962.</p>
<p>Correspondents include Johnston's wife, Alta Ross Johnston, and his daughters, Carolyn
Ross Johnston and Nancy Jean Johnston Smith. Many letters from the World War II era are
in V-mail format.</p>
<p>The digital files mainly consist of images of Johnston's correspondence. The images were
created in 2014 and are in PDF format. Not all correspondence is digitized. Also
included are WAV files containing audio recordings of Johnston's oral history interviews
from 2001 to 2005.</p>

<p>The papers of Anne Porter (1911-2011) span the years 1911-2014, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1931-2006. Correpondence, poems, notebooks, photographs, articles, legal papers, and other miscellany pertain
chiefly to the life and career of Porter.
The papers are in English. The collection is arranged alphabetically by topic or type of
material and therein chronologically or alphabetically. </p>
<p>The papers primarily consist of Porter's correspondence and poems that were assembled and inventoried by her son, Laurence M. Porter. Correspondents include Laurence M. Porter, Fairfield Porter, Katharine Minot Channing, and other Porter family members. Topics include family, friends, faith, poetry, and members of the New York School of poets and painters.</p>
<p>Porter published a few poems in the 1930s, and after the death of her husband, artist Fairfield Porter, she again began publishing poems in journals and books. The papers include drafts and copies of published and unpublished poems on loose pages and in notebooks. Porter's love of nature and Christian faith permeate the poems, and several include variant drafts with edits. Many of the poems appeared in Porter's books <title>

<p>The papers of Princess Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962) span the years 1889-1962, with the
bulk of the material dating from 1913 to 1961. The collection documents Bonaparte's
interest and involvement in the field of psychoanalysis. The papers are in French,
German, and English and include journals, memoirs, correspondence, drafts of writings,
notebooks, legal documents, obituaries, genealogical notes, photographs, watercolor
drawings, and printed matter arranged in five series: <ref target="gencorresp"> General
Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="subfile">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="writ">Writings</ref>, an <ref target="addit">Addition</ref>, and <ref target="close">Formerly Closed</ref> material.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorresp">General Correspondence</ref> series consists of letters to
Bonaparte by fellow psychoanalysts including Edward Bibring, Grete L. Bibring, Ruth Mack
Brunswick, Max Eitingon, Paul Federn, Sándor Ferenczi, Anna Freud, Dora Hartmann, Heinz
Hartmann, Ernest Jones, Hans Lampl, Jeanne Lampl-de Groot, Rudolph Maurice Loewenstein,
Heinrich Meng, Géza Róheim, Hanns Sachs, and Max Schur. Relatively few of Bonaparte's
outgoing letters are included in the series other than numerous letters written by her
to Eitingon between 1925 and 1941.</p>
<p>The <ref target="gencorresp">General Correspondence</ref> series traces Bonaparte's
introduction to psychoanalysis in the 1920s and her subsequent rise to prominence in the
field due perhaps to her close relationship with Sigmund Freud. The series documents her
willingness to expend her personal influence and financial resources on behalf of
individual psychoanalysts, psychoanalytic organizations, and publishing endeavors in
France and elsewhere. Letters from René Allendy, A. Hesnard, Jacques Lacan, René
Laforgue, Daniel Lagache, Sacha Nacht, Charles Odier, George Parcheminey, Edouard
Pichon, Raymond de Saussure, and other French psychoanalysts illuminate her role in the
establishment and development of psychoanalysis in France. Bonaparte's role in
facilitating the emigration of psychoanalysts, most notably Sigmund Freud, from
Nazi-controlled countries prior to World War II and the immigration of European analysts
to the United States after the war is also documented. The geographical range of
Bonaparte's correspondence reflects the extent of the psychoanalytic movement's diaspora
and the breadth of her activities and associations.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subfile">Subject File</ref> series contains correspondence from the
International Psycho-Analytical Association and the Internationaler Psychoanalytischer
Verlag, information concerning Bonaparte's purchase of Freud's letters to Wilhelm Fliess
in 1937, obituaries and genealogical notes, and a photograph of Bonaparte. Other files
relate to Margaret Williams, an American child analyst in Paris who was sued by the
French medical establishment for practicing medicine without a medical degree. Included
are letters from psychoanalysts pertaining to lay analysis in various countries, copies
of interrogatories and depositions, newspaper clippings, and notes by Bonaparte
providing an historical survey of lay analysis. Also included in the series is a
proposal sent by Bonaparte to William C. Bullitt and Franklin D. Roosevelt in late 1938
recommending that the United States purchase Baja California from Mexico and establish a
Jewish refugee state there. Bonaparte noted that she had developed the plan in
consultation with Freud. </p>
<p>A small <ref target="addit">addition </ref>contains Bonaparte's notes on Sigmund Freud's
letters to Wilhelm Fliess that came open for research use in 2010.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Bonaparte Papers was closed to research use until January 2020. The <ref target="close">Formerly Closed</ref> series includes Bonaparte's journals dated
1913-1927 and 1959-1961; her dream journals dated 1923-1961; unpublished portions of her
memoir; and a series of five original notebooks and watercolor drawings created by
Bonaparte as a child that became the basis of her book,<title>
<part> Cinq cahiers écrits par une petite fille entre sept ans et demi et dix ans et
leurs commentaires.</part>
</title> Also in the series are short writings by Bonaparte, many of which are
autobiographical. The correspondence includes typescripts of letters exchanged between
Bonaparte and the French statesman Aristide Briand between 1914 and 1931. The collection
also contains a large number of letters exchanged by Freud and Bonaparte between 1925
and 1939. Also included are a series of notebooks in which Bonaparte recorded the
progress of her analysis with Freud.</p>

<p>The papers of Leon Howard Sullivan (1922-2001) span the years 1940-2002 with the bulk of
the material concentrated in the period 1988-2002. The collection consists primarily of
correspondence, reports, personal files, program files, articles, and miscellaneous
material from Sullivan’s role as president of the International Foundation for Education
and Self Help (IFESH), with additional material regarding Opportunities
Industrialization Centers of America. The papers are arranged in three series: <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ifesh">IFESH </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="oic">OIC </ref>, and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pm">Personal Miscellany </ref>.</p>
<p>Leon Sullivan devoted many years of his life to the Philadelphia community, serving as
pastor of the Zion Baptist Church from 1950 until his retirement in 1988. In that span,
Sullivan founded the Zion Non-Profit Charitable Trust in 1962, Opportunities
Industrialization Centers of America in 1964, the OIC International in 1969, and served
on the board of directors for General Motors beginning in the 1970s, where he developed
a code of conduct for companies called the Sullivan Principles.</p>
<p>After his retirement, Sullivan founded the International Foundation for Education and
Self Help, which would extend his principles of self-help and community empowerment to
Africa. Through the use of assistance programs, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ifesh"> IFESH </ref> helped educate and train Africans in the areas of
health, business, and economic development in order to reduce poverty and unemployment.
As president, Sullivan began the African-African American Summit to bring together world
leaders and highlight issues facing African countries. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ifesh"> IFESH </ref> series contains program files,
reports, summit materials, contributions, and administrative files documenting the
various functions of the organization.</p>
<p>While serving as president of <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ifesh">

<p>The records of the Elections Research Center span the years 1918-1992, with the bulk of
the material concentrated between 1932 and 1992. The records consist of newspaper
clippings, ballots, election returns, reports, notes, statistical data, voting district
maps, printed material, and correspondence. The collection is arranged, filed, and
numbered as received from the donor and organized into a <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gen1"> General File </ref>, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state2"> State File </ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="ov1"> Oversize </ref>.</p>
<p> The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gen1"> General File </ref> contains
newspaper clippings, ballots, notes, and correspondence covering a variety of topics,
namely voting and election matters of broad national and international interest. The
material includes newspaper clippings documenting national coverage of the 1980 general
election, the 1990 Census and resulting congressional reapportionment, and printed
material regarding the 99th through 101st Congresses, among other topics. Newspaper
clippings and printed materials regarding elections in Poland, Germany, Great Britain,
and the Soviet Union are also comprised in this series, as are subject files regarding
politician George C. Wallace. The correspondence in this series largely pertains to
expenditures and funding requests for a voter registration project conducted by the
Center between 1973 and 1977.</p>
<p> More extensive in scope and chronology is the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state2"> State File </ref>, which contains newspaper clippings from local
news outlets, sample ballots, notes compiled by Scammon, voting district maps,
statistical data, and printed materials covering election campaigns and outcomes for all
fifty states and the District of Columbia. Within each state is documentation of the
biennial primary and general elections, which for most states ranges between 1956 and
1992. Some states, though not all, include separate coverage of gubernatorial and
municipal elections, dating primarily from the early 1950s until the mid-1980s. Election
returns and voting statistics by district for major American cities, including New York
City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago, among others,
is also comprised within the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="state2">
State File </ref>. Of particular note are the sample ballots collected for several
states, the majority of which date between 1932 and 1948 and illustrate the variety of
mid-twentieth century American political parties and their logos. Significant ballot
measures chronicled in this series include Oklahoma’s repeal of prohibition in 1959, and
Virginia, North Carolina, and other states' attempts to maintain and later eliminate
segregation in public schools. Also of note is a file pertaining to the creation of the
District of Columbia's Board of Elections in 1955 and later, correspondence regarding
the establishment of Home Rule in the District in 1973, for which Scammon served as a
consultant.</p>
<p> With the exception of one file regarding the Stern Family Fund grant for a voter
registration project in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="gen1">
General File </ref>, this collection does not document the Elections Research
Center’s business operations or functions, nor does it chronical publication processes
for the <title>

however serve as a comprehensive database of voting statistics throughout the United
States for nearly half of the twentieth century. The inclusion of local newspaper
clippings furthermore provides a local perspective on election matters at the voting
district level.</p>

<p>The papers of Richard Lathers (1820-1903) span the years 1826-1901, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period 1848-1887. The collection consists of correspondence, speeches, writings, circulars, clippings, and other printed matter. Born in Georgetown South Carolina, Lathers became a merchant, banker, and president of the Great Western Insurance Company after moving to New York in 1848. He opposed secession, and contained in the papers is documentation of his efforts traveling through the South days before the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 addressing Southern leaders, including Jefferson Davis, in order to dissuade them from seceding from the Union. Included also are writings by Lather on the outcome of the Geneva Arbitration Tribunal (1871-1872) that decided American claims against Great Britain for attacks on Union merchant ships by Confederate raiders during the conflict. Lather had been unsuccessful in securing for the Great Western Insurance Company a financial settlement based on the so-called Alabama claims cases.</p>
<p>Other material in the papers concerns tariff reforms, charters and prospectuses of the Great Western Insurance Company, the development of railroads, Reconstruction, and Lathers’s extrapolations of the history of South Carolina, particularly of Georgetown, and of New York state and city. Also reflected are Lathers's social, philanthropic, and religious activities, and his collection of letters of John C. Calhoun and John A. Dix (1798-1879). Among local events featured is the Charleston, South Carolina, earthquake of 1886 and the charitable response to it.</p>

<p>The papers of I. M. Pei span the years 1920 to 2016, with the bulk of the material
dating from 1960 to 2000. The collection documents the professional activities of Pei,
best known for his architectural design, which is represented in buildings across the
world. Also present in the collection are files related to Pei’s professional
associations and activities as an urban planner. Its ten series include <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corres">General Correspondence,</ref>

</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corres">General Correspondence</ref>
series documents the broad scope of Pei’s professional associations, activities, and
friendships. The correspondence is arranged chronologically by year or year span and
alphabetically therein by name of correspondent. The series begins with correspondence
dating from Pei’s early career, including his association with William Zeckendorf’s real
estate development firm Webb &amp; Knapp, first as architectural director for
Zeckendorf, 1948-1955, and then as head of his own firm I. M. Pei &amp; Associates
beginning in 1955. The bulk of the series, however, dates after 1960 when Pei’s practice
became fully independent of Webb &amp; Knapp. This later material includes some internal
memoranda from Pei’s architectural firm, but most of it concerns his professional
associations outside his architectural practice. These activities relate to professional
organizations including the American Institute of Architects and Architectural League of
New York; universities, most notably his alma maters Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Harvard University; galleries and museums; architectural magazines and
publishers; the United States government including the Federal Housing Administration
and Department of State; and honorary societies and organizations, among them the
Académie d’architecture, American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, and American Society of the French Legion of Honor.
Correspondents include architects, designers, artists, editors, gallery owners, museum
directors, corporate executives, public officials, and university presidents, among
others. Prominent correspondents include Marcel Breuer, Henry Dreyfuss, Jean Dubuffet,
O’Neil Ford, Ulrich Franzen, Alexander Girard, Walter Gropius, Victor Gruen, Fran P.
Hosken, R. Sturgis Ingersoll, Philip Johnson, Pierre Matisse, Henry Moore, Chester E.
Nagel, Carl Nesjar, Richard Joseph Neutra, John Carl Warnecke, Yang Yingfeng, and Zao
Wou-ki. Letters from other well-known correspondents can be found in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref> series. A
significant portion of the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corres">General Correspondence</ref> series documents Pei’s connections with his native
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the wider Chinese diaspora. Included are
letters from family members, friends, architects, artists, students, and various Chinese
and Chinese-American organizations. Much of this correspondence is in Mandarin or
Cantonese.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pci">Projects
Completed/Inactive</ref> series documents projects where Pei was the design
principal. Files include projects undertaken by Pei Freed Cobb &amp; Associates and by
Pei after his retirement from the firm, yet often in collaboration with Pei Partnership
Architects, a firm established in 1992 by Pei’s sons C. C. (Chien Chung) Pei and Li
Chung Pei. Most of the projects include corporate headquarters, commercial structures,
residential properties, schools, museums, concert halls, transportation terminals, and
civic buildings designed by Pei, and in some cases, site plans for urban planning and
community development projects. The series has been maintained as it was arranged by
Pei’s staff by city, and therein by name of building or project. Most of Pei’s major
works are well-documented in the files, most notably the John F. Kennedy Library,
Bedford-Stuyvesant Superblock, Raffles City, Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, Musée
du Louvre, Musée d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean in Luxembourg, and the Miho Museum. The
files track project history from the proposal stage to project completion, and sometimes
track the subsequent development of the building once the contract has been fulfilled.
Typical documents include administrative files including meeting minutes, proposals,
contracts, financial documents, memoranda, clippings, studies, reports, blueprints,
architectural renderings, plans, drawings, maps, and photographs with a focus on Pei’s
personal correspondence with clients, project stakeholders, and contractors. Files
maintained after projects have been completed document renovations, historic landmark
status, research queries, legal issues, and the evolution of buildings over time. In
most cases these are the personal files of Pei, maintained by his executive assistant
Leicia Black, and later by her successor, Nancy Robinson. The records of a few projects
are much more voluminous and include the files of project manager Perry Y. Chin along
with extensive shop drawings and design schematics. These projects include the Museum of
Islamic Art, Four Seasons Hotel, and Oare Pavilion. Little documentation exists of early
projects from the 1950s when Pei was working exclusively with Webb &amp; Knapp. Also
absent from the series are many of Pei’s files relating to the East Building of the
National Gallery of Art, which he transferred to the gallery in 1986 . There is also no
documentation in this series of the air traffic control towers Pei designed for various
U.S. airports throughout the 1960s.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pa">Projects Aborted</ref> series
contains similar materials as the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pci">Projects Completed/Inactive</ref> series and likewise tracks the history of various
projects. The major difference is that in almost all cases, while the projects were
initiated, the buildings were never completed. Pei’s staff chose the designation of
“aborted,” but this does not necessarily indicate that Pei intentionally abandoned the
project. In most cases, these projects were stalled due to financial, political, or
logistical issues. The only exception to this is the China Pavilion at Expo ’70, which
was completed, but for which Pei was not the design principal, but rather the
supervising architect. The major projects documented in this series include the Bilbao
Emblematic Building in Bilbao, Spain; Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia Center in Jakarta,
Indonesia; Château de La Rochefoucauld in France; and the Athens Museum of Contemporary
Art in Athens, Greece.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pp">Projects Proposed</ref> series
consists of projects declined by Pei, often due to his firm’s heavy workload, or
accepted by Pei but later cancelled for a variety reasons. Also included are projects
for which Pei’s firm was not selected by the client. The projects represent the type of
work for which Pei is best known and largely include institutional and corporate
buildings and urban planning projects. Other projects include the 2000 Olympics in
Beijing and the design of bottles for L’Oréal perfume and Taittinger champagne. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pp">Projects Proposed</ref> series has
been maintained as it was arranged by Pei’s staff by year and therein by name of city or
country. A list of files (1952-1991) located at the beginning of the series records
individual project names. Documentation for the projects, although not extensive in most
cases, includes correspondence, memoranda, project proposals and reports, meeting
minutes, plans, maps, photographs, financial records, and newspaper clippings. Two sets
of report forms on prospective jobs are available for the 1960s and 1970s. These
single-sheet summaries record project names, clients, locations, descriptions, and
dispositions, and are occasionally supplemented by copies of correspondence and other
documentation. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub">Publicity File </ref>spans
Pei’s career and is arranged in three file groupings: general, projects, and speaking
engagements. The general file explores the broad scope of Pei’s work as an architect and
urban planner from 1946 to 2012. Included are newspaper and magazine articles, book
excerpts, and interviews, as well as correspondence with writers, interviewers, and
publishers. A bibliography of articles about Pei from 1952 to 1983 follows the general
file. The project file documents individual works by Pei and his firm, largely through
newspaper and magazine articles. The file is arranged alphabetically by name of city or
country and therein by name of project. The speaking engagement file, dated 1979-2012,
consists largely of requests for Pei to speak and arrangements for the engagements he
accepted. Only a few texts of his remarks are included. The<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub"> Publicity File</ref> overlaps considerably with
several other series. Correspondence with writers and publishers, speaking engagement
requests, and transcripts of interviews can also be found in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="corres">General Correspondence</ref> series. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany">Miscellany</ref> series
includes acceptance speeches for some of the more major awards received by Pei. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref> series overlaps
with the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub">Publicity File</ref>
series to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>Complementing the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub">Publicity
File</ref> series are more than one hundred volumes of scrapbooks compiled by Pei’s
staff. The content of each scrapbook has been rehoused in folders to better preserve the
material. Consisting largely of newspaper and magazine articles, the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref> series includes forty-five
general volumes spanning the years 1944 to 2004, as well as separate volumes focusing on
specific projects, including Dallas City Hall in Texas, East Building of the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., Grand Louvre in Paris, John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston, and Miho Museum in Japan. Four additional volumes contain published interviews
with Pei between 1948 and 1989. Six volumes house memorabilia dating from 1960 to 2006.
Included are programs and invitations from award ceremonies, building openings, and
dinners honoring foreign dignitaries; certificates, awards, and honorary degrees; press
releases and some acceptance speeches; a letter from Ronald Reagan congratulating Pei on
receipt of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1983; and a note dated December 1981
arranging a meeting with François Mitterrand early in the planning process for the
renovation and expansion of the Musée du Louvre. Seven scrapbooks contain special
letters. Many of the letters are congratulatory notes to Pei on the winning of design
competitions, opening of buildings, receipt of awards, and special birthdays. The
eclectic range of letters also includes a copy of a 1946 letter from Pei concerning his
master’s thesis on a Shanghai art museum, a 1948 letter of appointment from Webb &amp;
Knapp, a 1949 letter from Le Corbusier, mentioning Pei’s “maison cylindrique,” a sketch
by Pei of the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center on the back of an October 1983 incoming
letter, a February 1981 letter from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis about the John F. Kennedy
Library, a cheerful postcard from Zubin Mehta and Itzhak Perlman on a trip to China in
1994, and a handwritten letter from Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on the opening of the
Suzhou Museum in 2006. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany">Miscellany</ref> series
documents many aspects of Pei’s professional life. The award and honorary degree files
document the recognition Pei received for his many achievements from the 1960s to 2014.
Most notably, the series documents Pei’s significant awards including the 1979 American
Institute of Architects Gold Medal, 1983 Pritzker Architecture Prize, 1986 Medal of
Liberty, and his election to l’Académie des beaux-arts, Institut de France. Pei’s
appointment calendars and logs date from 1955 to 2012 and provide documentation of his
work schedule, including daily appointments, events, and meetings. Extensive files
document Pei’s travel for a variety of purposes including meetings with clients,
monitoring the status of projects, events, and vacations. Arranged according to month of
travel, and later by departure date, the files consist of detailed itineraries,
correspondence, and documentation of the projects for which he was traveling. Missing
from the series are travel files from 1988. The bulk of photographs accessioned as part
of the Pei Papers now reside in the Library’s Print &amp; Photographs Division. The
photographs in this series mostly include individual portraits of Pei and portraits of
his family. Photographs of buildings designed by Pei can be found in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub">Publicity File,</ref>

<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pa">Projects Aborted,</ref> and <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="scrap">Scrapbooks</ref> series. Education
files mostly document his undergraduate career and 1940 bachelor’s thesis at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and
Peace Time China." Notably missing is a copy of Pei’s master’s thesis at Harvard
featuring a Shanghai art museum. The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="miscellany">Miscellany</ref> series is also composed of biographical files,
exhibit files, architectural registrations, recommendation letters for colleagues, and a
portfolio prepared by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners that provides general information
and images of many of their more notable buildings. Very little biographical information
exists from Pei’s early life in China before he immigrated to the United States.</p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="subj">Subject File</ref> series
includes documentation of organizations and institutions to which Pei belonged including
the Committee of 100, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Corporation, National
Council on the Arts, National Council on the Humanities, National Endowment for the
Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Urban Design Council of the City of New
York. These files document Pei’s membership and involvement within each organization,
mostly through correspondence and mailings regarding their activities. Files related to
the American Institute of Architect task forces on National Urban Policy and West front
of the U.S. Capitol primarily contain research and design information. This series also
contains files for various architecture juries on which Pei served from 1955 to 2012,
including juries for the National Gallery of Canada, the Parliament House of Canberra,
and various design contests. </p>
<p>The <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="df">Digital Files</ref> series
contains files from digital storage media removed from paper files in the course of
processing. The bulk of these are most closely related to the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="pub">Publicity File</ref> series and include photographs,
documentaries, videos of interviews and conversations with Pei, and footage from
television shows on which Pei appeared. In some cases, videos focus on the construction
of specific buildings such as the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and Deutsches
Historisches Museum. Digital files related to projects mostly include drawings, plans,
and surveys, though there are very few of these.</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Correspondence and related material including memoranda, reports, proposals,
agendas, minutes, mail and invitation logs, programs, announcements, press
releases, invitations, resumes, brochures, ballots, interviews, plans, maps,
photographs, news clippings, and other printed matter largely relating to Pei’s
professional associations, activities, and friendships outside his architectural
practice. A small amount of interoffice memoranda from Pei’s architectural firm is
included. Other topics include his personal and professional connections within
the Chinese diaspora. The series has been maintained for the most part as it was
created and used by Pei’s staff. Letters from individual correspondents may be
filed either under the person’s name or institutional affiliation. The
chronological date span of folders is occasionally broader than the year under
which they are filed. Separate files containing copies of Pei’s outgoing
correspondence are available for many years beginning in 1953. Mail logs date from
1979 to 2010.</p>

Pavilion at Expo ’70 that was completed, but for which Pei was the supervising
architect. Pei's staff designated these projects as "aborted."</p>

selected by the client. Pei’s staff created the series and characterized the
projects filed within it as “proposed.” Documentation for most projects is not
extensive since many of the projects did not progress much beyond the initial
inquiry from a prospective client or preliminary fact gathering by Pei’s staff. In
addition to individual project files, report forms provide single-sheet summaries
of prospective projects for the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>The African American Soldiers in World War II Collection spans the years 1918-2018, with
the bulk of the collection dating from 1997 to 2010. It consists of correspondence,
memoranda, oral history interview transcripts, reports, government documents, books,
notes, photographs, articles, maps, a scrapbook, newspaper clippings, printed matter,
digital files, and other material utilized by Maggi M. Morehouse to document the service
primarily of two African American combat divisions in World War II, the 92nd and 93rd
Infantry Divisions of the United States Army. The 92nd Infantry Division saw heavy
combat during the Italian campaign from 1944 to 1945. The 93rd Division was reactivated
in 1942 at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and served in the Pacific Theater chiefly in
construction work and in combat support positions. The collection is in English and is
arranged into four groups: interviews and related material, Maggi M. Morehouse's
personal file, subject files, and digital files.</p>
<p>Morehouse began researching the service of Black soldiers in World War II in 1995 for a
graduate history seminar. She continued to study the topic for her master's thesis and
dissertation which later became a book titled <title>
<part>Fighting in the Jim Crow Army: Black Men and Women Remember World War II</part>
</title>. She has written a number of articles and papers about the subject. This
collection documents her research using secondary sources and primary sources. The topic
also had a personal connection for Morehouse because her father, Lee Sinclair
Quarterman, served as a white officer in the 93rd Infantry Division. </p>
<p> Almost one half the collection is comprised of interviews by Morehouse with World War
II veterans. The interview files include transcripts, correspondence, government
documents, notes, photographs, unit histories, newspaper articles, and other material
relating to the individual interviewed. Although both the 92nd and 93rd divisions were
trained for battle, many of the men were assigned non-combat duties. Some of the
training locales mentioned are Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Benning, Georgia, and
Fort Huachuca, Arizona. In the interviews the soldiers describe what it was like to
serve in a segregated army and the racial attitudes they encountered at home and abroad.
They describe life before and after the army. Serving in the military allowed the
soldiers to experience the world outside their segregated communities and to obtain an
education using the G. I. Bill. As a result many became part of the middle class and
were active in the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s. </p>
<p>Represented in the interviews are two women veterans, Susan Adams, who served in Germany
in the Army Dental Corps, and Madine Davis Lane, who served as a nurse at Fort Huachuca,
and in the China Burma India Theater, Egypt, Europe, and Okinawa. Some interviews
include the participation of a soldier's spouse, and a few interviews consist solely of
children discussing their father's military service. Filed at the beginning of the
interviews are alphabetical lists of the soldiers interviewed by Morehouse. The lists
also include a brief synopsis of the interview. One of the lists noted that there was an
interview of Morehouse's father in the interview files. The Library, however, did not
receive it. Quarterman's interview file does contain extensive military papers about his
service and some original photographs of him. Additional interviewees include Hattie Mae
Settles Allen, William S. M. Banks, Ogelsby B. Barrett, J. Herman Blake, Albert Burke,
Leonard Cunningham, Roland Dix, Ruth Earl, Howard Fletcher, Arthur Goodwin, Felix
Goodwin, Allen E. Green, Anna Hairston, Joseph Hairston, Charles Hanson, Dennette Arthur
Harrod, Arnett Hartsfield, Cleather Hathcock, Howard Hickerson, Levi Hill, Reuben
Horner, Jehu Callis Hunter, Fred L. Hurns, Ezell Jackson, Niani Kilkenny, Lawrence
Johnson, Charles Lancaster, Robert P. Madison, Mick Marshall, John B. Mathews, William
C. McCullough, Dorothy McIver, I. P. McIver, Thomas McKinney, Cullen McKissock, Donald
McNeil, Harold Montgomery, Helen Montgomery, Spencer Moore, Susie Moore, William H.
Payne, Nelson Peery, A. William Perry, Matthew J. Perry, Alex Pitcher, Edward Price,
Joseph L. Stephenson, Thomas P. Stoney, Allen Thompson, W. E. ("Burg") Turner, Woodrow
Walton, Fred Watt, Charles Wesly, Edgar Whitley, Clyde Whitted, Henry L. ("Hank")
Williams, and Jim Williams.</p>
<p>Morehouse's personal file features her correspondence with veterans and research
institutions pertaining to her research, her presentations, and writings about African
Americans' participation in World War II, particularly her dissertation and book, and
her work on an exhibit and book project entitled <title>
<part>A War on Two Fronts: Fighting for Victory at Home and Abroad</part>
</title>. Also included is a scrapbook relating to Morehouse's father that features
government documents, family papers, and photographs pertaining to his army career.</p>
<p>The subject files provide further documentation of Morehouse's research and include
files about African American history, military units, and the integration of the armed
forces. Subject files featured are the 93rd Infantry Division and Fort Huachuca,
Arizona, and the Buffalo Soldiers (92nd Infantry Division). The nickname Buffalo
Soldiers was given by Native Americans to African American cavalrymen who served in the
American West in the nineteenth century. The most comprehensive files are those about
Fort Huachuca and the Buffalo Soldiers. Most of the photographs are copies from the
1940s. Photographs from the 1990s and 2000s mainly document reunions of the
veterans.</p>
<p>The digital files mainly consist of audio and video files of interviews conducted by
Morehouse with veterans. In some cases, recordings are incomplete or include distorted
audio. Also included in the digital files are materials relating to the subject file and
Morehouse's writings.</p>

<p>The papers of Edward F. Edinger (1922-1998) span the years 1550-2016, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1951 to 1998. The collection relates primarily to Edinger's
career as a leading Jungian analyst. He was known for his ability to elucidate C. G.
Jung's ideas and concepts in a simple and precise manner, making Jung's work more
accessible. The papers also provide insight into Edinger's own theoretical work,
including his belief that modern man's psychological disorientation was a result of the
loss of a core religious mythology, and his interest in the therapeutic role of alchemy,
literature, philosophy, and religion. The collection consists of writings, lectures,
correspondence, notes, photographs, military records, slides, digital files, printed
matter, and other material. The papers are in English and arranged alphabetically by
topic or type of material.</p>
<p>The majority of the papers comprise Edinger's lectures and writings. Most of his books
are based on edited transcripts of lectures. Topics include alchemy, archetypes, C. G.
Jung's work, collective unconscious, Greek mythology and philosophy, individuation, the
psyche, psychotherapy, symbols, and the transformation of the God-image. The collection
does not include Edinger's entire body of work. Files pertaining to lectures and
seminars contain correspondence, handwritten and typed lectures, research material, and
transcriptions. Writings include handwritten and typed drafts along with supporting
material. Edinger's handwritten edits are found throughout the writings. Additionally,
the papers document Edinger's efforts, as president of the New York Association for
Analytical Psychology, to plan a memorial meeting to honor C. G. Jung in 1961. Also
included are occasional journal entries. Digital files consist of audio recordings of
Edinger's funeral service. The two files were originally received on two CDs and
complement the funeral service paper file.</p>
<p>The 2020 Addition further documents Edinger’s career as a Jungian analyst. Edinger's
writings in the 2020 Addition relate to Gnosticism, the psyche, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Edinger saw parallels between Emerson and Jung and credits Emerson with the development
of the introverted intuition. Also included in the addition are notes pertaining to
three reading courses taught by Edinger to deepen the understandings of Jung's work.
Edinger's reflections on the courses and Jung are reflected in the notes, and the notes
also include supporting material. Copies and reprints of lectures and writings about and
by M. Esther Harding and C. G. Jung along with writings by others feature topics such as
alchemy, C. G. Jung, collective unconscious, dreams, Gnosticism, Ralph Waldo Emerson,
and schizophrenia. Prominently featured in the addition is Jung's emphasis on alchemy as
not just mystical philosophy or chemistry, but as the symbolic representation of the
process of individuation, the path towards psychological wholeness. The 2021 Addition
contains two letters between Edinger and Russel B. Huff and Clifford Rollins relating to
the collective unconscious. Attached to the letters are images of Rollin's paintings
with descriptions. </p>

<p>The papers of Walter Sullivan (1918-1996) span the years 1929 to 1997, with the bulk of
the material dating between 1948 and 1992. The papers are organized into the following
series: <ref target="personal">Personal File</ref>, <ref target="correspondence">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="book">Book Files</ref>, <ref target="newspaper">Newspaper and Magazine Files</ref>, <ref target="television">Television and Radio
Files</ref>, <ref target="Alphabetical">Alphabetical Files</ref>, <ref target="digital">Digital Files</ref>, and <ref target="oversize">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The collection primarily focuses on Sullivan’s work as a writer and science editor at
the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>. The papers chronicle Sullivan’s
coverage of a range of topics including space exploration, plate tectonics, black holes,
expeditions to Antarctica, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and the
International Geophysical Year. Represented to a lesser extent are materials related to
Sullivan’s activities as a lecturer and teacher, and his involvement in television,
radio, and film. There is little documentation of Sullivan’s life before becoming a full
time reporter at the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> in 1945.</p>
<p>The <ref target="personal">Personal File</ref> series comprises documentation of
Sullivan’s life and work, mostly between 1950 and 1990. The series includes an extensive
collection of Sullivan’s notebooks, expense reports, material related to his lectures,
and documentation of his involvement in various professional organizations. In addition
to general biographical information, the series includes draft copies of his memoirs,
though most of these are available in the <ref target="digital">Digital Files</ref>
series.</p>
<p>The <ref target="correspondence">Correspondence</ref> series primarily includes
Sullivan’s incoming letters and is organized into chronological and subject groupings.
It spans the period 1948 to 1995, with the bulk of the correspondence concentrated
between 1957 and 1989 when he was most active in writing about science. The files
consist mostly of professional correspondence and internal <emph render="italic">New
York Times</emph> memoranda. In many cases, correspondence files exist in other
series as they relate to specific projects, especially within the <ref target="book">Book Files</ref> series.</p>
<p>The largest series of the collection, the <ref target="book">Book Files</ref> comprise
materials related to the books in which Sullivan was author, editor, and contributor.
The bulk of the file focuses on his six major publications: <emph render="italic">Quest
for a Continent: The Story of the Antarctic</emph> (1957), <emph render="italic">Assault on the Unknown; the International Geophysical Year</emph> (1961), <emph render="italic">We Are Not Alone: The Search for Intelligent Life on Other
Worlds</emph> (1964; revised 1993), <emph render="italic">Continents in Motion: The
New Earth Debate</emph> (1974; revised 1991), <emph render="italic">Black Holes: The
Edge of Space, the End of Time</emph> (1979), and <emph render="italic">Landprints:
On the Magnificent American Landscape</emph> (1984). The files primarily include
research files, drafts, correspondence, and book artwork. Additional research materials
related to the topics explored in the books are also filed in the <ref target="Alphabetical">Alphabetical Files</ref> series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="newspaper">Newspaper and Magazine Files</ref> series primarily

the Korean War, the Cold War, and the United Nations. Starting in the late 1950s,
the articles begin to focus more on science, including exploration of outer space
and Antarctica, then branching further into topics related to astronomy,
seismology, tectonics, oceanography, and climatology. The bulk of the foreign
correspondent materials relate to Sullivan’s time as a correspondent in China.
They comprise alphabetical files and copy on labor, trade, land reform, and
politics around the time of the People’s Republic of China revolution of 1949. The

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Pamela Harriman (1920-1997) span the years 1909-1997, with the bulk of material dating from 1943 to 1997. The collection documents most phases of Harriman's adult life, including her wartime marriage to Randolph S. Churchill, Winston Churchill's only son; her marriage to agent and producer Leland Hayward from 1960 until his death in 1971; and her marriage to diplomat, politician, and entrepreneur W. Averell Harriman from 1971 until his death in 1986. Also included are extensive records from Harriman's political action committee Democrats for the 80's and files from her role as United States ambassador to France from 1993 to her death in 1997. Largely absent from the collection is material from her childhood, and relatively little is included from her life in Paris during the 1950s. The collection material is in English and French.</p>
<p>The collection is arranged in two parts. Part I comprises the more personal parts of the
collection and is arranged in nine series: <ref target="pipersfam">Personal and Family
Papers</ref>, <ref target="pigencorres">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="piambfile">Ambassadorial File</ref>, <ref target="pispewrit">Speeches and
Writings</ref>, <ref target="pischtrav">Scheduling and Travel</ref>, <ref target="pimiscell">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="piarti">Artifact</ref>, <ref target="piclass">Classified</ref>, and <ref target="piovers">Oversize</ref>. Part II
consists largely of the records of the Democrats for the 80's and is arranged in seven
series: <ref target="piisubj">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="piiadminfil">Administrative File</ref>, <ref target="piiprojfile">Projects File</ref>, <ref target="piievent">Event File</ref>, <ref target="piilist">Lists</ref>, <ref target="piiovers">Oversize</ref>, and <ref target="piidigifiles">Digital Files</ref>. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part I</emph>
</p>
<p>The <ref target="pipersfamfam">Family Papers</ref> in the <ref target="pipersfam">Personal and Family Papers</ref> series contain correspondence and related material from Harriman's own Digby family and from the families into which she married. The correspondence chronicles Harriman's relationships within this broad family network that included her son, grandchildren, parents, siblings, in-laws, stepchildren, nieces, and nephews. With the exception of her wartime letters to W. Averell Harriman, however, very little correspondence is included between Pamela Harriman and her husbands. The Digby family correspondence mostly dates after Pamela Harriman's move to the United States in 1959 and contains letters to and from her parents, siblings, nieces, and nephews. The Churchill family material includes two letters from Harriman's husband Randolph S. Churchill to his father Winston Churchill during the war. Harriman's own correspondence with her parents-in-law is more extensive. Most of the letters from the Churchills discuss visits from their grandson Winston S. Churchill and express appreciation for gifts sent by Harriman. A few letters discuss more personal matters including Harriman's divorce from their son and her later marriage to Leland Hayward. The bulk of Harriman's Churchill family correspondence is with her son Winston S. Churchill, her daughter-in-law Minnie Churchill, and her grandchildren. Most of these letters discuss family matters and the activities of the grandchildren. </p>
<p>The Hayward family material includes a small number of items documenting Leland Hayward's career as an agent and producer, including an undated client list. Most of his professional papers, however, were given by Harriman to the New York Public Library following his death in 1971. Notable in this series are letters received during Hayward's last illness and condolence letters received after his death. The letters reflect the breadth of Hayward and Harriman's friendships both within and beyond the world of theater and film. The Hayward family files also contain Harriman's correspondence with her stepchildren, including Brooke Hayward whose 1977 memoir <title>
<part>Haywire</part>
</title> dwelled in part on her relationship with the last of her stepmothers.</p>
<p>The earliest Harriman family material dates from the Second World War when Pamela and W. Averell Harriman first met. It contains only one wartime communication from Averell Harriman to Pamela Harriman- a brief note annotated by Harry L. Hopkins under whose door it had been placed mistakenly. Far more extensive are Pamela's letters to Harriman and his daughter Kathleen Lanier Harriman Mortimer. The letters begin after the Harrimans moved to Moscow following Averell Harriman's appointment as United States ambassador. In addition to describing her own activities, Pamela's letters recount war news, events in London, and encounters with mutual friends. Kathleen Harriman's letters to Pamela Harriman discuss her life in Moscow where she served as her father's hostess. Included are accounts of her trips to Katyn Forest with journalists in January 1944 and to the Yalta Conference with her father in February 1945. Other Harriman family material postdates Pamela's marriage to Averell in 1971. Included are notes between husband and wife on the occasion of birthdays and anniversaries; a declaration of gift to her in 1982, including works of art; and a large set of files on Averell's death in 1986. Present are condolence letters from prominent friends, political leaders, and heads of state, among them Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher. Completing the subseries is a small amount of correspondence with members of the Whitney family which has been included in the subseries because of the Whitneys' connections with the Harriman family. </p>
<p>The <ref target="pipersfampers">Personal Papers</ref> in the <ref target="pipersfam">Personal and Family Papers</ref> series were kept as a separate set of files by Harriman and her staff. The bulk of the subseries consists of her personal correspondence. Included are wartime letters and notes from Max Aitken Beaverbrook; Charles de Gaulle; Charles Frederick Algernon Portal, Viscount Portal of Hungerford; and William ("Bill") Walton. Most of the correspondence in the subseries dates after Harriman's move to the United States in 1959. This later correspondence includes letters from friends she made during her years in Paris in the 1950s, among them Giovanni Agnelli, Maurice Druon, Stavros Niarchos, André de Staercke, and C. L. Sulzberger. Other friendships, including those with Brooke Astor, Kitty Carlisle Hart, and Katharine Hepburn, followed her marriage to Leland Hayward. Washington friends include Katharine Graham and members of the Kennedy family whom she first knew in postwar Europe. The subseries also contains her correspondence with United States presidents and first ladies, most notably Bill Clinton who served briefly on the board of her political action committee and whose presidential campaign in 1992 she supported as a national co-chair; Lady Bird Johnson with whom she shared an interest in gardening; and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Also found in the Personal Papers subseries are marriage certificates and other records documenting her three marriages, congratulatory letters on her marriage to Averell Harriman, records from the Jansen Shop she owned and operated in New York in the 1960s, a horoscope from 1955 when she was living in Paris, passports and other personal documents, and photographs. </p>
<p>The bulk of the <ref target="pigencorres">General Correspondence</ref> series is concentrated in the years 1971-1993. As such, it reflects her immersion in Washington, D.C., life, her active role in Democratic Party politics as the founder and chair of the Democrats for the 80's, and her involvement in the world of diplomacy and international relations following her marriage to Averell Harriman. The series contains correspondence with politicians, public officials, Supreme Court justices, diplomats, foreign leaders, university presidents, academics, journalists, writers, corporate heads, union presidents, actors and other performers, and an array of Washington insiders. Represented are leading Democrats who served on the Democrats for the 80's board of directors, among them Samuel R. Berger, Clark M. Clifford, Stuart Eizenstat, Abraham Feinberg, Harry McPherson, Edmund S. Muskie, Walter H. Shorenstein, and Robert S. Strauss; Democratic presidential candidates, most notably Al Gore and John D. Rockefeller, IV, both of whom she supported; and Democratic National Committee chairs Ronald Harmon Brown, Paul G. Kirk, and Charles T. Manatt, in addition to numerous Democratic members of Congress, governors, mayors, and other office holders. The series also contains correspondence with diplomats, foreign policy advisors, and academics. Among these are Graham T. Allison, McGeorge Bundy, Richard Helms, Richard C. Holbrooke, and Marshall Darrow Shulman. A large file on the Soviet Union includes correspondence with Anatolii Fedorovich Dobrynin, as well as material on Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev's state visit in 1987 during which Harriman hosted a luncheon for Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev. Subject file material in the series includes correspondence, memoranda, agenda, minutes, and reports from various boards and committees on which Harriman served and organizations in which she was active. These include the Atlantic Council of the United States, Brookings Institution, College of William and Mary, Council on Foreign Relations, Menninger Foundation, National Gallery of Art, Rockefeller University, and the Averell Harriman Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union at Columbia University, as well as various Churchill foundations. </p>
<p>The <ref target="piambfile">Ambassadorial File</ref> chronicles Harriman's role as United States ambassador to France from 1993 to 1997. Included are files from her confirmation hearings and swearing-in ceremony early in the Clinton presidency. Aspects of her official duties as ambassador can be traced through an alphabetical correspondence file, copies of unclassified State Department records, her speeches and writings, a scheduling file, and travel vouchers. A significant portion of the series, including much of her correspondence, is more personal in nature. Very little is included on her death in Paris in February 1997 apart from copies of eulogies. </p>
<p>The <ref target="pispewrit">Speeches and Writings</ref> series contains speeches delivered by Harriman between 1973 and 1992 and articles, largely op-ed pieces, written between 1980 and 1990. Most of the speeches and articles cover similar topics, including Democratic Party politics, foreign relations, and Harriman's recollections of Winston Churchill during World War II. A master speech file contains final versions of her speeches while separate files document the drafting process. Initial drafts were often authored by others, including Robert Shrum, and contain annotations and comments by Samuel R. Berger, Clark M. Clifford, and others. A similar drafting process is evident in files of her articles. The series also contains a draft novel by John Bowles, IV, who served on the Democrats for the 80's board. He sent a copy of the novel with the hope of getting assistance in finding a publisher.</p>
<p>The <ref target="pischtrav">Scheduling and Travel</ref> series consists of engagement
calendars, event files, invitations, miscellaneous records and calendars, scheduling
binders, and foreign travel files. Harriman's engagement calendars span the years 1959
to 1997, with some years missing. An extensive event file largely documents events
hosted by Harriman, but also includes some that she attended as a guest. The bulk of the
file dates after her move to Washington, D.C., in 1971, and many of the events were
political fund-raisers. The event files in this series overlap considerably with the
<ref target="piievent">Event File</ref> series in Part II, but are more distilled
than the larger working files found in Part II. The trip file at the end of the series
documents Harriman's foreign travel, most often to France, Great Britain, and the Soviet
Union. Included are itineraries, arrangements, correspondence, and several photograph
albums.</p>
<p>The <ref target="pimiscell">Miscellany</ref> series documents many aspects of Pamela
Harriman's life. Her wide circle of family, friends, and connections can be traced
through her address books which date from the late 1940s to the 1990s, and through
Rolodexes, largely from the 1980s and 1990s. Biographical material relates chiefly to
proposed and published biographies of Harriman. Included are transcripts of extensive
interviews in 1991 with writer Chris Ogden with whom she had contemplated writing her
autobiography. Subsequent legal files discuss the termination of their collaboration.
Also contained within Miscellany is a series of diary excerpts, memoranda of
conversations, and trip reports written by Harriman between 1973 to 1993. Although
episodic, the accounts are generally rich in descriptive detail. Guest books record the
numerous visitors to Harriman's homes in Barbados, New York, Virginia, and Washington,
D.C. Press files include clippings that chronicle her activities from the 1937 to her
death in 1997, correspondence with journalists, and some transcripts of interviews. The
series also contains scrapbooks, some of which document specific events, others of which
are compilations of letters from prominent political figures, many of whom thanked
Harriman for supporting their campaigns. Finally, an <ref target="piarti">Artifact</ref>
series contains a gold medal depicting Konrad Adenauer that Salvador Dali designed in
1967. It is uncertain when Harriman acquired the medal. </p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Part II</emph>
</p>
<p>Part II contains the records of the Democrats for the 80's, the political action committee founded by the Harrimans after the 1980 elections when Democrats lost both the White House and Senate. The records provide a case study on the proliferation and evolution of political action committees in the 1980s. More specifically, they chronicle the role played by the Democrats for the 80's in helping to reshape the Democratic Party's agenda, fund its candidates, and introduce modern campaign techniques. Renamed the Democrats for the 90's in 1989, the political action committee was dissolved at the end of 1990. Pamela Harriman continued to support the Democratic Party and its candidates during the early 1990s, most notably Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992. These activities are also documented in Part II.</p>
<p>The <ref target="piisubj">Subject File</ref> series contains files relating to Democratic committees and organizations, Democratic National Conventions, party conferences and meetings, political analysts and newsletters, political campaigns of various candidates, and a variety of topics including campaign finance, political action committees, polling, and women in politics. The series also features a large reference file of election-year data from 1980 to 1990. Correspondence, memoranda, minutes, and reports from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democratic Governors' Association, Democratic National Committee, and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee provide insight into the evolution of Democratic strategy in the 1980s and the ways in which the Democrats for the 80's supported these efforts. Among the project initiatives funded by the Democrats for the 80's was the establishment of the Harriman Communications Center which sought to make state-of-the-art communication technology available to Democratic candidates and members of Congress. Files on the Democratic National Conventions include related material on efforts to improve communications at the 1988 and 1992 conventions. Other topics covered in the Subject File include her membership on the Commission on Presidential Debates from 1987 to 1993 and her support as national co-chair of Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992. The series contains memoranda, correspondence, and talking points from the campaign, and post-election letters from individuals seeking appointments in the new administration. </p>
<p>The operations of the Democrats for the 80's and the shaping of its priorities are documented in the <ref target="piiadminfil">Administrative File</ref> series. A large chronological arranged by year contains correspondence, memoranda, board minutes, reports, financial records, and lists of political contributions to candidates by the political action committee and Harriman personally. The founding of the Democrats for the 80's is detailed in chronological files for 1980 while its dissolution is covered in those for 1990. Other material in the series includes bylaws, board lists and resolutions, brochures and newsletters, contributor lists, Federal Election Commission and non-federal filings, office memoranda, and procedural manuals. Legal guidance on federal and state laws governing political action committees is found in a file of correspondence with attorneys for the Democrats for the 80's. Talking points in a press file trace how the political action committee defined itself, its activities, and its political message. The series also contains transcripts of some of the committee's early events and meetings. Washington insider Janet A. Howard served as the political action committee's third executive director. A large chronological file under her name was assembled from unfiled correspondence, reports, notes, and printed matter and reflects her busy schedule and the full array of her activities. </p>
<p>The <ref target="piiprojfile">Project File</ref> series features some of the Democrats for the 80's major initiatives. The committee raised funds for federal campaigns as well as those for local and statewide office. Beginning in 1982, it concentrated its fund-raising efforts on Senate candidates, launching the Win the Senate '84 campaign and, in 1984, the Senate Majority '86 initiative. Both projects were supported by direct-mail campaigns well documented in the series. One of the earliest priorities of the Democrats for the 80's was an effort to counter the influence of New Right conservatism in the Republican Party. The Project File includes research files and drafts of a 1981 <title>
<part>New Right Manual</part>
</title> that provided Democratic candidates with information and talking points on conservative political groups. Related correspondence with and about the National Conservative Political Action Committee, a primary focus of this campaign, is available in the Subject File. In 1982, the Democrats for the 80's produced a more general <title>
<part>Democratic Fact Book</part>
</title> for use by candidates. Included are working files from the 1982 edition, as well as from its 1984 and 1986 revisions. The Democrats for the 80's partnered with the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1983 in analyzing the legislative records of Republican incumbents in key Senate races. Copies of the reports on Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, and New Hampshire are available in the series. The Democrats for the 80's also launched various media campaigns, producing radio and television advertisements and short films, the earliest of which were aimed at the New Right conservatism. A fund-raising campaign to pay for satellite technology at the Harriman Communications Center followed in 1987. The renamed Democrats for the 90's undertook a series of national polling projects in 1989-1990 that included full-scale national polls on voter attitudes, perceptions of the Democratic Party, and the testing of themes. Smaller surveys and focus groups gauged voter opinions on campaign finance reform, capital gains tax cuts, medicare catastrophic coverage, and other issues. The polling projects were coordinated by Peter D. Hart. Finally, files from two major fund-raising events, the celebration of W. Averell Harriman's ninetieth birthday in 1981 and a Democratic gala at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1990, are included in the series because of the size of the events and the complexity of their planning. </p>
<p>The <ref target="piievent">Event File</ref> series contains working files from other
events, most of which were hosted by the Harrimans and the Democrats for the 80's. The
series complements material found in the <ref target="pischtrav">Scheduling and Travel
File</ref> in Part I, providing a fuller record through correspondence, memoranda,
lists of attendees, financial records, invitations, programs, notes, photographs,
seating charts, speeches, publicity, and news clippings. The types of events documented
in the series include fund-raising dinners, lunches, breakfasts, receptions, garden
parties, and "issue evenings," small gatherings in the Harriman home that featured talks
by prominent Democratic leaders. Other event files include material from Democratic
National Conventions and election-night gatherings hosted by the Harrimans in their
home. Pamela Harriman held a major fund-raising event for Bill Clinton and Al Gore at
her estate in Middleburg, Virginia, in September 1992 and a dinner for the
president-elect during the Clintons' first trip to Washington after the election. Both
events are documented in the series.</p>
<p>The <ref target="piilist">Lists</ref> series contains lists from a wide variety of sources including political candidates, office holders, Democratic Party committees and organizations, political action committees, lobbyists, labor unions, corporations, industries, foundations, institutions, and religious organizations. The original titles of the lists or those supplied by the Democrats for the 80's have been retained. Although the use of these lists by the Democrats for the 80's is rarely indicated, they were most likely culled for fund-raising campaigns, invitation lists, and general networking. Database lists created by the Democrats for the 80's are also included as well as lists identified as "Harriman contacts" that are filed by state.</p>
<p>The collection contains a small <ref target="piidigifiles">Digital Files</ref> series. The digital content was originally stored on thirty-nine 5.25" disks and comprises just over one thousand files dating from 1982 to 1990. Several disks represent an attempt to systematically backup files from a staff member's personal computer. The remainder are more random assortments of the office's work product. Word-processed documents include drafts of fund-raising letters and event correspondence, biographical statements, newsletters, press releases, speeches, and talking points. Topics include the Party of the Decade at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, annual dinners, and other events hosted by the Democrats for the 80's, the National Polling Project, and satellite communication projects. Also included are lists of names and addresses and databases of contributors dated 1985-1986. Data from three magnetic tape reels are currently unprocessed and unavailable. </p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., (1941- ) span the years 1934-2014, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1966 to 2012. The papers are organized into the following
series: <ref target="persfil">Personal File</ref>, <ref target="chronfile">Chronological
File</ref>, <ref target="heritfound">Heritage Foundation</ref>, <ref target="orgfile">Organizations</ref>, <ref target="othprof">Other Professional Files</ref>, <ref target="speech">Speech and Trip Files</ref>, <ref target="writ">Writings</ref>, and
<ref target="digit">Digital Files</ref>. The collection documents Feulner's career
devoted to conservative public policy and the rise of the Heritage Foundation as the
leading conservative think tank and public policy research organization during Feulner's
presidency.</p>
<p>The <ref target="persfil">Personal File</ref> series is a compilation of material
relating to Feulner's personal life and interests, his education, and other records
documenting his life and accomplishments. A section of family papers includes Feulner's
correspondence with his parents, siblings, children, and several uncles who were
Catholic priests, with the largest portion being copies of letters and notes sent by
him. A general correspondence file contains his correspondence with friends, associates,
businesses, and organizations spanning over forty years. Diary entries for the years
1980-1982 offer Feulner's reflections on his work on the presidential transition team
and his meetings and interactions during the early years of the Ronald Reagan
administration. A grouping of appointment books and daily schedule card files is most
extensive for Feulner's time at the Heritage Foundation, although there are gaps in
coverage. Biographical information files and a collection of press clippings and other
items mentioning Feulner help to provide an overview of his life and activities.</p>
<p>The <ref target="chronfile">Chronological File</ref> series consists of correspondence
spanning the years 1965-2013 that provides an in-depth look at Feulner's personal and
professional endeavors before and during his years at the Heritage Foundation. A
majority of the copies of this outgoing correspondence appears on pink paper.</p>
<p>The <ref target="heritfound">Heritage Foundation</ref> series constitutes the bulk of
the papers and documents the work of the this conservative public policy think tank
promoting a strong national defense, tax cuts and reform, welfare reform, free trade,
free enterprise, free markets, less government, and traditional values. Folders for this
series are stamped with the letters THF, the abbreviation used by Heritage Foundation
staff to indicate the foundation. Highlights include the Board of Trustees files,
correspondence, reports, financial records, meetings, notebooks, administrative
memoranda, and a people file. The Board of Trustees files provide insight into the
policy- and decision-making processes of the foundation and includes budget proposals,
committee meeting files, correspondence shared with the board, financial reports, and
memoranda sent to the board members by Feulner. The committee meeting files are largely
comprised of briefing booklets prepared for individual meetings. Feulner's memoranda to
the members is a chronological file of individual memoranda that in some instances has
other material attached. Correspondence shared with the board consists of letters and
copies of letters that Feulner passed on to board members. Actual correspondence
relating to the Board of Trustees is part of the Heritage Foundation's main
correspondence file that is arranged into Board of Trustees, general, internal
memoranda, members of Congress, miscellaneous, and White House. The correspondence file
covers a myriad of conservative issues and policies and documents the internal workings
of the Heritage Foundation. The general correspondence, arranged chronologically by year
and therein alphabetically, was designated by Feulner's staff as "whites" because his
replies appeared on white paper. Providing further insight into the foundation are the
annual, quarterly, and weekly reports. The 2011 annual report is absent. Some of the
quarterly reports are incomplete, and the weekly reports for the years 1980-1995, 2007,
and 2011-2013 are absent. The financial records, consisting mostly of cash reports and
monthly reports, are incomplete. The meetings file consists mostly of agendas, some with
attached material or short notes penned by Feulner, for the senior management, weekly
management, and other meetings of the Heritage Foundation. The weekly management
meetings are often designated as MMM referring to Monday management meetings. Contained
in Feulner's notebooks are further notes on these and other meetings. The administrative
memoranda, miscellaneous correspondence, and miscellany were created from unfiled
material found in the papers.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation's people file is comprised of correspondence, clippings,
speeches, and other material concerning prominent conservatives as well as Heritage
Foundation board members. It is a compilation of overlapping files originally grouped
under the headings people, very important persons, and board members. Correspondents
include Richard V. Allen, Belden Bell, William J. Bennett, David R. Brown, William F.
Buckley, Jr., George Bush, Joseph Coors, Philip M. Crane, Shelby Collum Davis, Midge
Decter, Milton Friedman, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp (1935-2009), Russell Kirk, Friedrich
A. von Hayek, Robert Henry Krieble, Ernest W. Lefever, Lewis E. Lehrman, Donald J.
Lipsett, Clare Boothe Luce, Edwin Meese, John William Middendorf, Ronald Reagan, Henry
Regnery, J. Frederic Rench, Thomas Anderson Roe, Donald Rumsfeld, Thomas A. Saunders,
III, Richard M. Scaife, Frank J. Shakespeare, William E. Simon (1927-2000), Margaret
Thatcher, and Paul M. Weyrich. Arrangement is alphabetical by name of person and therein
chronologically.</p>
<p>The <ref target="orgfile">Organizations</ref> series contains files relating to
Feulner's membership in various organizations, boards, councils, commissions, and
committees outside of the Heritage Foundation. Featured in this series are the Aequus
Institute, Alpha Kappa Psi, Clare Boothe Luce Program of the Henry Luce Foundation,
Council for National Policy, Credit International Bank and Sequoia National Bank, George
Mason University, Institute for European Defence &amp; Strategic Studies,
Intercollegiate Studies Institute, National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax
Reform, Philadelphia Society, Regis University, Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the United
States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. Included in this material are board and
committee reports, memoranda, meeting documents, financial records, correspondence,
legal records, and other general information regarding these organizations and Feulner's
involvement in them.</p>
<p>The <ref target="othprof">Other Professional Files</ref> series is comprised of files
pertaining to Feulner's professional employment in the years prior to 1977 and
assignments in later years outside of the Heritage Foundation. The earliest material
pertains to Feulner's initial work relating to conservative public policy, as a public
affairs fellow, first at the Center for Strategic Studies at Georgetown University and
then assigned to the staff of Melvin R. Laird, head of the House Republican Conference,
in the United States House of Representatives. Other sections focus on his years as
legislative assistant and administrative assistant for Representative Philip M. Crane
and his time as president of the Schuchman Foundation Center for the Public Interest.
The largest portion of this series concerns Feulner's years as executive director of the
Republican Study Committee, a conservative caucus in the United States House of
Representatives, from 1974 to 1977. Included are briefing books for members, material
relating to the Republican Study Committee's Campaign Fund for 1976 Congressional
elections, files pertaining to policy issues, and a chronological grouping of work
papers that document the work of the group. This Republican Study Committee material is
closely related to documents pertaining to Feulner's doctoral dissertation and
subsequent book on the Republican Study Committee located in the Writings series. Other
files relating to assignments Feulner undertook during breaks from his Heritage
Foundation duties cover his work on Ronald Reagan's presidential transition team and two
White House consultancies during the Reagan administration as well as his work as staff
director and counselor to Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp during the
1996 presidential campaign. A subject file is comprised mainly of research files on
issues of interest to political conservatives, that Feulner compiled during the years he
was working as a public affairs fellow and in Congressional staff positions with the
House Republican Conference and the Republican Task Force on East-West Trade. There are
also files related to other projects and topics of interest. Individuals featured in
this series include Richard V. Allen, Philip M. Crane, Jack Kemp, and Melvin R.
Laird.</p>
<p>A <ref target="speech">Speech and Trip Files</ref> series combines several overlapping
speech, trip, and event files. The series covers various speaking engagements, trips,
and other activities Feulner attended as president of the Heritage Foundation and as a
member of numerous other organizations. Many of the events and engagements occurred in
the Washington, D.C. area, but Feulner also traveled extensively around the United
States and internationally. On his international trips, he generally traveled to
multiple cities and countries. Feulner's focus on Asia is recorded by his many trips to
South Korea, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan, Japan, China, and Thailand. Some speeches and
conference files can be found in the <ref target="orgfile">Organizations</ref>
series.</p>
<p>The <ref target="writ">Writings</ref> series is comprised of articles and columns, book
reviews, books, essays, manuscripts, and a dissertation written by Feulner. Topics
include conservative public policy, Congress, the United Nations, China, South Korea,
the Soviet Union, foreign trade, economics, national defense, and the Republican Study
Committee. By far the largest amount of material consists of Feulner's research and
drafts for his doctoral dissertation "Evolution of the Republican Study Committee" that
evolved into his book <title>
<part>Conservatives Stalk the House: The Republican Study Committee</part>
</title>. Most of the research material for the dissertation and book was pulled from
Feulner's files as executive director of the Republican Study Committee. The bulk of the
committee's files are located in the <ref target="othprof">Other Professional
Files</ref> series.</p>
<p>The <ref target="digit">Digital Files</ref> are comprised of audio files, video files,
and text files largely relating to Feulner's speeches and speaking engagements and the
1996 vice presidential campaign of Jack Kemp.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p> The papers of Theodor Reik (1888-1969) span the years 1905-1994, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1939 to 1969. The collection documents Reik's contributions to
psychoanalytic theory and practice as a lay analyst and researcher, and as one of
Sigmund Freud's first students. The papers date largely after Reik's immigration to the
United States in 1938, but also include material from his earlier years in Austria,
Germany, and the Netherlands. Much of the collection focuses on Reik's prolific writing
for both professional and popular audiences. Many of these works explore Reik's theories
on the psychological differences between men and women and were published as gender
relations were being transformed in the postwar years. Included are partial drafts of
many of Reik's books, reprints and copies of his published articles, notes, and research
files, as well as correspondence, publishing contracts, royalty statements,
certificates, interviews, photographs, and news clippings. The collection is in English
and German, with English predominating after 1938. It is arranged in four series: <ref target="pfp">Personal and Family Papers,</ref>
<ref target="gmseries">Gustav Mahler,</ref>
<ref target="wf">Writings File,</ref> and <ref target="ov">Oversize.</ref>
</p>
<p>The <ref target="pfp">Personal and Family Papers</ref> series contains material from
Reik's personal files as well as those of his son Arthur Reik who served as his father's
literary agent and later as the literary executor for his estate. The series represents
a small portion of what must have once comprised Reik's personal files, but nevertheless
provides insights into his career and the reception of his work, particularly in the
United States. Highlights of the series include correspondence from colleagues,
publishers, and readers of Reik's books; royalty statements; book reviews and publicity
materials about his books; oral history interview transcripts; and newspaper articles
about him. Also included are certificates, 1908-1912, from Reik's studies at the
University of Vienna. </p>
<p>The <ref target="gmseries">Gustav Mahler</ref> series is the most intact portion of the
collection and consists of Reik's research and writings on the composer's life and work.
Included are concert programs, journal articles, booklets, and news clippings about
Mahler and performances of his works, some dating from the 1920s and 1930s, as well as
Reik's research notes and drafts of his writings. Among these writings are an article on
Sigmund Freud's analysis of the composer and a file of handwritten draft manuscripts in
German that eventually became <title>
<part>The Haunting Melody: Psychoanalytic Experiences in Life and Music</part>
</title> (1953), Reik's book on Mahler that explores the nature of musical associations. </p>
<p>The <ref target="wf">Writings File</ref> is the largest series in the collection and
includes drafts of some of Reik's books, articles, introductions, and speeches; printed
copies of his journal, newspaper, and magazine articles; three notebooks; and a large
volume of notes. Reik wrote in English and German, switching largely to English after
1938. Copies of Reik's published articles and commentary span his publishing career from
1911 to 1968. The series' book files, however, date largely after his immigration to the
United States and focus in particular on his writings on Judaism and gender relations.
The surviving book drafts and notes suggest several ways Reik emulated his mentor
Sigmund Freud's approach to writing. Reik, like Freud, preferred to compose on large
sheets of paper. Many of Reik's writings, therefore, are stored in the <ref target="ov">Oversize</ref> series. Also like Freud, Reik showed an apparent disregard for his
drafts and notes after a work was published. Reik's writing files arrived at the Library
minimally organized and described and in poor physical condition. Yet most of the
bundles of otherwise unidentified drafts and notes seemed to have distinct focuses,
making it possible to associate them with specific writing projects. Even so, many of
the books in the collection are only partially documented, at times with no more than
several pages or a single chapter. Exceptions are Reik's books <title>
<part>Jewish Wit</part>
</title> and <title>
<part>Pagan Rites in Judaism</part>
</title> which have more complete drafts and <title>
<part>The Many Faces of Sex,</part>
</title>
<title>
<part>The Need to Be Loved,</part>
</title> and Part IV in <title>
<part>Of Love and Lust</part>
</title> on Reik's theories regarding the emotional differences between men and women.
Files for these latter three books consist of randomly organized notes and partial
drafts rather than complete manuscripts. The large volume of notes stored in the book
files and in separately organized note files capture the unfolding of Reik's thought
process. According to Reik, he would record his thoughts, insights, and observations in
note form, often in the evenings after a full day of seeing patients. The first drafts
of his books grew out of these notes. Also included in the series are writings by
others. Some of these article-length works explore Reik's contributions to
psychoanalysis. Also included are writings by two women who, at one time, may have been
Reik's analysands. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Correspondence, interviews, certificates, publishing contracts, royalty
statements, reviews of Reik's books, publicity materials, a tribute on his
seventieth birthday, brochures, programs, a photograph, postcards, and news
clippings from the personal files of Reik as well as those of his son Arthur who
served as Reik's literary agent and later as the literary executor for his estate.
Most of the material in the series dates after Reik's immigration to the United
States and, although not extensive, sheds light on Reik's contributions to the
growing popularity of psychoanalysis in postwar America. A small general
correspondence file focuses largely on Reik's research and writing and includes
several letters from colleagues, among them psychoanalysts K. R. Eissler, Joost
Abraham Maurits Meerloo, and Jule Nydes. Also included are letters, some with
extensive commentary, from people who read Reik's books. Among these is a letter
from novelist Herbert Gold on <title>
<part>Psychology of Sex Relations</part>
</title> which Gold read in 1945 while serving in the army at Camp Albert C.
Ritchie, Maryland. Other correspondents include physicist Abraham Pais. Posthumous
correspondence is addressed to Arthur Reik and includes condolence letters on
Reik's death in 1969, letters from scholars about Reik's work, and correspondence
about Arthur's interest in Gustav Mahler which he shared with his father. The
reception of Reik's work can be traced through book contracts and correspondence
with publishers, royalty statements, book reviews, and news articles about him.
<lb/>
</p>
<p>Reik's life in Europe before his immigration is documented through certificates
from his studies at the University of Vienna; newspaper articles, 1913-1938, about
or referring to him; and later interviews with Reik in which he discussed his
family and childhood, studies at the University of Vienna, relationship with
Sigmund Freud, analysis with Karl Abraham, controversies surrounding lay analysis,
his research and writing on psychoanalysis, and other aspects of his life and
work. A small amount of family papers includes his first wife Eleanore Oratsch
Reik's residential certificate in 1915, a copy of Arthur Reik's 1936 marriage
certificate, and letters from Reik to his son in 1939-1941 urging his immigration
to the United States from Palestine. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Drafts of writings, notes, photographs, and collected printed matter consisting of
newspaper clippings, concert programs, journal articles, and booklets stemming
from Reik's research and writings on Gustav Mahler. Reik's research on the
composer stretched over many years, beginning before his immigration in 1938 and
culminating in the publication of <title>
<part>The Haunting Melody: Psychoanalytic Experiences in Life and Music</part>
</title> in 1953. Included in the series is a set of five binders containing
notes, drafts, printed matter, and photographs stored in topically labeled
folders. The contents of Binder A focuses largely on Mahler's biography,
commemorations of the seventy-fifth anniversary of his birth and twenty-fifth
anniversary of his death in 1935-1936, and writings about the composer by Guido
Adler, Max Graf, Arnold Rosé, and Bruno Walter, among others. Binder B covers a
wide variety of topics, including anecdotes about Mahler, his relationships with
Hans von Bülow and Sigmund Freud, his religious and superstitious inclinations,
his years in Vienna, and a planned memorial. Files on Mahler's symphonies and
other compositions are housed in Binder C. Binders D and E contain Reik's notes on
Mahler which he taped to numbered sheets. The tape has been removed, but the
original order of the notes has been maintained. In addition to the binders, the
series includes loose notes and drafts, largely in German, and additional printed
matter including booklets, journals, reprints, catalogs, concert programs, news
clippings, and a facsimile edition of Mahler's Symphony no. 10. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>Handwritten notes, notebooks, and German and English manuscripts, handwritten and
typed drafts of books and articles, copies of articles published in journals and
magazines, two speeches, introductions to works by others, and a file of writings
by others. Like his mentor Sigmund Freud, Reik often wrote on large sheets of
paper so a significant portion of the series is stored in the <ref target="ov">Oversize</ref> series. Some of the oversize material is in fragile condition
and should be handled with care. <lb/>
</p>
<p>The Writings File, with its collection of notes, early drafts, and, in some cases,
near-complete book drafts, reflects Reik's writing process. Reik wrote notes on
scraps of paper and grouped them into packets by topic, most numerously on Judaism
and the relationship between men and women. These original groupings have been
retained and are identified by the topical headings created by Reik. The notes
consist largely of Reik's own reflections and observations as well as insights
gleaned from psychoanalytic sessions and his readings. The topics discussed in the
unidentified manuscript pages mirror those found in the note packets, with a
majority of the pages focusing on the relationship between men and women. Many of
these unidentified handwritten pages have no title, page number, or other
identifying characteristics that might tie them to a particular article or book of
Reik's, and so have been separated by language and then grouped into sets based on
the original order as received. Identified manuscript drafts of books and articles
are sorted by title; however, even when identified, a majority of the book drafts
are incomplete and some contain only a few miscellaneous pages. <lb/>
</p>
<p>While most of the material in the series was generated after Reik's immigration to
the United States in 1938 and before his death in 1969, some newspapers,
magazines, and journal articles as well as writings by others extend before and
after those dates. Reik began writing literary and general articles for Viennese
newspapers and magazines soon after completing his doctorate in 1912, and
continued publishing in newspapers and magazines after his immigration. Included
in the collection is a series of articles on “Men, Women and Love” published in
the <title>
<part>New York Herald Tribune</part>
</title> in 1958. Other topics covered in his magazine and journal articles
include couvade, gender relations, guilt, humor, masochism, and puberty rites.
Some of the newspaper and magazine articles are in very poor physical condition
and have been photocopied for ease of use. <lb/>
</p>
<p>The file of writings by others includes article-length drafts and reprints, some
of which pertain to Reik or topics of interest to him. Also included in the file
are journal-like letters and manuscripts by two women who may have been Reik's
analysands. Barbara Ivins' writings contain the reflections of a young woman
living in wartime New York in 1944. Dorothy Jeffery's letters and manuscripts,
written in 1954, discuss her thoughts on the relation between men and women, her
marriage, and life in California. </p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p> The records of the Citizens Party span the years 1976 to 1993, with the bulk of the
material ranging in date between 1979 and 1981. The collection is arranged
alphabetically by topic or material type, with a significant portion concentrated in a
grouping representing papers maintained by Dan Leahy, executive director, national
secretary, and executive committee member of the party from 1979 to 1981.</p>
<p> The collection primarily chronicles the Citizens Party’s organization at the national

<p>The papers of Seymour Martin Lipset (1922-2006) span the years 1824-2013, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1985 to 2001. The papers pertain to Lipset's career as a
sociologist and political theorist and his body of work, including his work on American
exceptionalism, democracy, Judaism in America, political extremism, the politics of
academe and intellectuals, social mobility and stratification, socialism, and trade
unions. He was most recognized for his comparative studies of democracy and its
relationship with economic development. A son of Jewish Russian immigrants, Lipset grew
up immersed in the political discussions of his Bronx neighborhood. This environment
along with his continuing political interests would later affect the substance of his
academic career and interests. Included in the papers are correspondence, writings,
speeches, teaching material, notes and notebooks, photographs, projects and studies,
printed matter, and other papers. The papers are in English and are organized into the
following series: <ref target="corr">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="speech">Speech
and Engagement File</ref>, <ref target="subj">Subject File</ref>, and <ref target="wrtgs">Writings</ref>. </p>
<p>The <ref target="corr">Correspondence</ref> series primarily documents the range of
Lipset's activities after his appointment as the Virginia E. Hazel and John T. Hazel Jr.
Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University, Fairfax, Va. in 1990.
Correspondence include exchanges between Lipset and colleagues, government officials,
publishers, students, various organizations, and the public. In some cases, Lipset's
handwritten draft of a letter or response is accompanied by the typed version along with
supporting material. Topics include academe, the American Jewish community and history,
Canada, political extremism, neoconservatism, socialism, and other various aspects of
sociology or political science. Correspondents include Amitai Etzioni, Larry Jay
Diamond, Drora Kass, Everett Carll Ladd, Juan J. Linz, Noah M. Meltz, Earl Raab, David
Riesman, and many others. The majority of the correspondence in the collection is
professional in nature, but some letters provide insight into the Lipset's mentorship of
students and collaborative attitude with other colleagues. Additionally, some of
Lipset's letters to publishers show his keen interest in the production and distribution
of his books.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speech">Speech and Engagement File</ref> consists of speeches,
published and unpublished conference papers, correspondence, printed matter, and other
complementary material pertaining to Lipset's many engagements, lectures, and talks. The
progression of Lipset's speeches and papers are represented by handwritten, typed, and
edited drafts along with final versions of papers or speeches in the collection. Topics
featured are American exceptionalism, the American Jewish identity and community,
comparative studies of the United States and Canada, democracy, presidential elections,
socialism, social mobility, the state of sociology, and student involvement in politics. </p>
<p>The <ref target="subj">Subject File</ref> series includes awards, clippings,
correspondence, interviews of Lipset by others, notes, photographs, project files,
proposals, teaching material, and printed matter relating to Lipset's career and
research interests. Files document Lipset's thoughts about the controversial elections
of Samuel P. Huntington to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986 and 1987;
involvement and affiliations with different professional organizations; projects and
studies, particularly his multi-year project with Drora Kass to study Israelis in
America; research interest in social mobility and stratification; and teaching files,
primarily from his tenure at George Mason University, Fairfax, Va. Also included are a
report, transcript, correspondence, and other documentation of Lipset's involvement in
two federal cases related to the Canadian Wheat Board in 1996 and 1998.</p>
<p>The <ref target="wrtgs">Writings</ref> series consists of the bulk of the papers. During
Lipset's academic career, he authored, coauthored, edited, or coedited over fifty books
and 500 articles. He wrote prolifically to contribute a wide range of ideas and findings
and to have an intellectual impact in the fields of sociology and political science. The
series is comprised of abstracts, articles, books, notes and notebooks, reprints for the
Seymour Martin Lipset Lecture on Democracy in the World, and writings by others. </p>
<p>In 1992, a festschrift, <title>
<part>Reexamining Democracy: Essays in Honor of Seymour Martin Lipset,</part>
</title> was published in Lipset's honor. The festschrift includes an appendix listing
Lipset's articles from 1947 to 1991 in a chronological and numerical sequence. Later
this list was expanded to include publications up to 2001. Drafts and printed copies of
articles arranged according to the numerical sequence of the festschrift appendix are
located in the collection under the Festschrift file. Also included in some folders are
reprints and translations. The collection includes the majority, but not the complete
run of articles in the festschrift appendix. Additionally, some article and folder
titles are slightly varied from how they are listed on the appendix.</p>
<p>The collection also contains published and unpublished articles which were not included
in the festschrift appendix. These articles are housed under Other articles. Another
category of articles in the series reflects Lipset's interest in academia and
intellectuals, a topic which dominated much of his research agenda in the 1970s. Lipset
and Everett Carll Ladd conducted national surveys of college and university faculty in
1969, 1975, and 1977 and gathered information about the educational, social, and
political perspectives of professors. The surveys were usuallly referred to as the
Ladd-Lipset surveys, and Lipset and Ladd wrote two series of articles about their 1975
and 1977 findings for the <title>
<part>Chronicle of Higher Education.</part>
</title> Other related surveys were also conducted in 1972, 1976, and 1979. Drafts and
copies of the articles, correspondence, questionnaires, tabulations, reports, codebooks,
and other material relating to the surveys are in the papers.</p>
<p>The book file contains reviews of most of Lipset's books from the 1950s to the 1980s.
For books published in the 1990s and 2000s, more complete files containing handwritten
drafts; typescripts; galleys; correspondence with publishers and collaborating authors
or editors; material relating to studies and projects conducted for the books; and other
research material are available. Prominent in the series are files related to <title>
<part>It Didn't Happen Here: Why Socialism Failed in the United States,</part>
</title> Lipset's multifaceted answer to Werner Sombart's question, "Why is there no
socialism in the United States?". The papers document Lipset's initial work in the 1970s
and collaborations with Gary Marks in the 1990s to finally finish the book. Also
included are various drafts of the preliminary or completed book and chapters from the
1970s to the 1990s.</p>
<p>Lipset's other topics of interest are also featured in the book file. His career-long
interest in comparing the United States and Canada is reflected in <title>
<part>The Paradox of American Unionism: Why Americans Like Unions More Than Canadians
Do, But Join Much Less,</part>
</title> written with Noah M. Meltz, Rafael Gomez, and Ivan Katchanovski. Conditions for
democracy are covered in files related to <title>
<part>The Democratic Century.</part>
</title> Most of the manuscript for this book was completed by Jason M. Lakin after
Lipset suffered a debilitating stroke in 2001. Lipset also collaborated with Earl Raab
to document the American Jewish experience and community in the United States in <title>
<part>Jews and the New American Scene.</part>
</title> Furthermore, Lipset's attempt to explain contemporary America, including
addressing various aspects of American exceptionalism, is reflected in <title>
<part>American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.</part>

<p>The papers of Edward Ellsberg (1891-1983) span the years from 1891 to 2008, with the
bulk of the material dating from 1926 to 1998. Ellsberg earned the reputation as one of
the United States Navy’s premier experts on salvage operations and deep-sea rescue work.
The collection, largely contained in notebooks, documents Ellsberg’s career as an
officer in the United States Navy, his activities as a consulting engineer, and his
authorship of articles and popular books relating to his salvage exploits while in the

Ellsberg, and correspondence of Edward Ellsberg Pollard, grandson of Ellsberg, regarding
Ellsberg. The collection includes correspondence, memoranda, lectures, articles, book
drafts, short stories, play drafts, radio scripts, notes, military papers, patents,
notes, digital files, newspaper clippings, and printed matter. The papers are in English
and are arranged as follows: notebooks, <title>
<part>Salvage Man</part>
</title> John Doughty Alden
file, writings by Edward Ellsberg, and writings by Lucy Buck Ellsberg.</p>
<p>The notebooks are arranged by number and therein by topic or type of material.
Documented in the notebooks are Ellsberg’s two tours of duty in the navy (1914-1926 and
1941-1951). Topics featured are his endeavors in solving the ventilation problems in

<p>The papers of Louis Simpson (1923-2012) span the years 1922-2011, with the bulk of the
material dated between 1937-2011. The papers contain correspondence, working drafts of various
poems and prose, administrative material regarding publishing and publications, reviews,
translations, interviews, memorabilia, copyright permissions, collected material, and
subject files related to Simpson's career as an author and professor. The papers are
organized into five series: <ref target="corr">Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="writings">Writings File</ref>, <ref target="prof">Professional File</ref>,
<ref target="sf">Subject File</ref>, and <ref target="ov">Oversize.</ref>
</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr">Correspondence</ref> series, arranged both alphabetically and
chronologically, contains personal and professional correspondence with Louis Simpson’s
many friends and associates in the literary world. Among the noted figures in the
Correspondence series are: Saul Bellow, Brian Cox, Serge Fauchereau, Thomas Flanagan,
John Haines, Hiram Haydn, Seamus Heaney, David Ignatow, Carolyn Kizer, Lotte Kramer,
Elizabeth Kray, J. T. Ledbetter, Alison Lurie, James Nolan, Micheal O'Siadhail, Robert
Pack, Allan Temko, Claire Nicolas White, Jon Manchip White, and James Wright. Featured
within this series are correspondence with the poets Robert Bly, Donald Hall, Jane
Kenyon, and writer Carol Bly, with whom Simpson wrote to frequently with throughout his
life. The early correspondence between Simpson and his Columbia University mentor, Mark
Van Doren are also included. Beyond the listed correspondents and personal
correspondence, other material appearing in the Correspondence series features various
aspects of Simpson’s professional life, potentially including material also found in the
<ref target="prof">Professional File</ref> series such as speaking engagements,
correspondence with publishers, and various administrative affairs.</p>
<p>Also included in the <ref target="corr">Correspondence</ref> series are letters between
Louis and his family, notably his mother, Rosalind de Marantz, and his children,
Anthony, Anne, and Matthew Simpson. Rosalind de Marantz lived in New York while Louis
Simpson was a teenager at Munro College in Jamaica and later moved to Italy when Louis
was an adult. While Louis served in the U.S. Army during World War II, he frequently
wrote to his mother and the extended Marantz family.</p>
<p>The <ref target="writings">Writings File</ref> contains primarily working and edited
drafts of various poems, prose, and other types of writings spanning Louis Simpson’s
entire career. The papers document Simpson's evolution as a poet, moving from
conventional poetic forms to a more Walt Whitman-influenced free verse style. Featured
are Simpson’s drafts for books including <emph render="italic">Adventures of the Letter
I</emph>, <emph render="italic">Caviare at the Funeral</emph>, <emph render="italic">Searching for the Ox</emph>, and <emph render="italic">At the End of the Open
Road</emph>, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Other featured works
within the series include several unpublished notebooks, translations, and reviews of
and by Simpson. Many of the papers included in the Writings File arrived at the Library
in a state where it was extremely difficult to identify from which books, if any, many
of the drafts originated. Effort was made to identify where possible what books belonged
to which set of drafts; however, if a book could not be positively associated with a set
of drafts, it was placed at the end of the series under the "working drafts" heading and
arranged by circa date. Drafts of individually titled works can be found under the
"poems, prose, and other writings" heading, but may also appear among the "working
drafts." Documentation of Simpson's works published in anthologies, print magazines,
newspapers, and poetry journals, are located under the features in "books and
periodicals" heading. Poems and prose sent to Simpson from colleagues, fans, and
friends, appear under the "other people's writings" heading.</p>
<p>The <ref target="prof">Professional File</ref> covers the administrative dealings of
Simpson’s career in both the literary and academic world. Included in this series are
various administrative memoranda regarding Simpson’s published works. Additionally
featured is professional correspondence between periodicals that frequently published
Simpson’s poems, including the <emph render="italic">American Poetry Review</emph>,
<emph render="italic">American Scholar</emph>, <emph render="italic">New York
Times</emph>, <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hudson Review</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Ohio Review</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Gettysburg Review</emph>. Additional material related to
publishing may be found within the general publishing correspondence folders.</p>
<p>Material concerning Simpson's academic career within the <ref target="prof">Professional
File </ref>relates to both his time as a student at Columbia University and
professorships he held at the University of California, Berkeley and State University of
New York at Stony Brook. Also covered are Simpson’s Pulitzer Prize, his serving as a
jury member for various literary awards, and his various engagements including poetry
readings, speeches, and award ceremonies. Many of the poetry readings are documented on
index cards with the date, location, and titles of poems read. Simpson's involvement in
professional organizations such as the Academy of American Poets and the Guggenheim
Foundation are documented as well.</p>
<p>The <ref target="sf">Subject File</ref> contains items collected from Louis Simpson’s
personal filing cabinets, including memorabilia, scrapbooks, and printed material on
various topics of interest. Major aspects of this series include Simpson’s awards,
travel files, personal papers related to himself and his family, interviews, articles
about Simpson, and personal recommendations for other poets, authors, and students.</p>
<p>The <ref target="ov">Oversize</ref> series contains two items: an undated poster for a

<p>The papers of Charles Augustus Hill (1833-1902) span the years 1863-1971, with the bulk
of the material dating between 1862 and 1865. The papers include correspondence,
transcripts of the correspondence, and miscellaneous material chiefly documenting Hill's
service as a Union army officer in the 1st Colored Infantry Regiment, United States
Army. The papers consist primarily of letters written by Hill to his wife Lydia Hill
during the Civil War. The subjects covered in Hill’s letters include major battles in
which his regiment participated during its two years of service, including the assault
on Petersburg, Virginia, in June 1864. A letter written in May 1864 refers to the
retribution taken by Black troops after the Fort Pillow Massacre, Tennessee, in April
1864. Hill often provides his view of the Black troops serving under him and their
treatment throughout the war. Other letters describe camp life in the Union army and his
time spent as a patient in Chesapeake Hospital, Hampton, Virginia, from July to November
1864. Hill’s letters written between July and September 1865 describe his role as acting
superintendent for the United States Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands
in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. These letters provide insight into the political
tension in the South immediately following the Civil War, as well as a glimpse into
Hill’s view of the early Reconstruction era. The papers also include family
correspondence consisting mostly of letters written by Hill to his family while serving
as assistant attorney general of Illinois in 1898. </p>
<p>The 2022 Addition, 1862-1863, complements the initial portion of the collection and
includes additional correspondence and related transcripts from Hill to his wife Lydia
relating his experience during the Civil War and his role as acting superintendent for
the United States Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in Elizabeth City,
North Carolina. The subjects covered in Hill’s letters depict major battles such as the
Battle of Antietam (September 1862), the Battle of Wilson's Wharf (May 1864), and the
capture of Fort Fisher, North Carolina (January 1865). Military maps and histories
included in later publications are attached to several of Hill's letters and add context
to the military engagements described in them. These include a June 1863 battle map of
Brandy Station, Virginia, from Fairfax Downey's <emph render="italic">Clash of
Cavalry</emph> (1959), as well as two entries from John Barrett's <emph render="italic">The Civil War in North Carolina</emph> (1963) . </p>

<p>The papers of Louis Patrick Gray III (1916-2005) span the years 1931-2008. The
collection focuses on Gray's time as acting director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon and the
impact of this period on his life in the following years. The papers are organized into
eight series: <ref target="corr">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="fbi">Federal
Bureau of Investigation</ref>, <ref target="leg">Legal File</ref>, <ref target="sw">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="alph">Alphabetical File</ref>, <ref target="clo">Closed</ref>, <ref target="class">Classified</ref>, and <ref target="over">Oversize</ref>. </p>
<p>While the L. Patrick Gray III Papers contain material relating to his military career in
the United States Navy, his work as a lawyer in private practice, and his positions in
the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Department of Justice in the
early years of the presidency of Richard M. Nixon, the major focus of the papers is
Gray’s experience as the acting head of the FBI, following the death of J. Edgar Hoover,
from May 1972 to April 1973. The Watergate Affair is a key topic; the papers chronicle
the FBI investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Committee
headquarters, Gray’s actions at the time, and his recounting and explanation of these
events during testimony at congressional hearings and before grand juries, while under
investigation by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and in preparation for writing
a book. The changes and tensions in the FBI following the death of J. Edgar Hoover are
another topic covered in the material. The collection also chronicles Gray’s indictment,
along with W. Mark Felt (associate director of the FBI), and Edward S. Miller (head of
the FBI's Domestic Intelligence Division), for allegedly authorizing break-ins aimed at
locating Weather Underground (Weatherman) fugitives while he was acting director of the
FBI. Originals and copies of memoranda, reports, notes, testimony, and correspondence
relating to Gray’s actions and those of others in the FBI in response to events in 1972
and 1973 appear in numerous series throughout the collection because Gray used documents
from his personal FBI files as background and exhibits in hearings and legal proceedings
and as resource material for a prospective memoir. Some documents contain dated comments
written by Gray when he reviewed them in later years. Additional material was compiled
by his son, Ed Gray, in the preparation of Gray’s posthumous memoir. W. Mark Felt
figures prominently in the collection. </p>
<p>A small <ref target="corr">General Correspondence</ref> series contains letters received
by Gray and copies of his responses. They are primarily of a personal nature and most
date from the 1970s and 1980s. Correspondents include FBI agents and officials, figures
from the Nixon administration, and friends. A number are letters of support and
congratulations when the charges against Gray were dropped in 1980. A file of
correspondence with W. Mark Felt also contains notes on telephone conversations and
copies of letters Gray sent to his lawyer in response to one of Felt’s letters.</p>
<p> The <ref target="fbi">Federal Bureau of Investigation </ref>series comprises files
generated during Gray’s year as acting director. Position papers on issues, practices,
and proposed changes at the FBI, memoranda to special agents in charge, notes Gray took
at meetings, and notes he added to routing slips illuminate the actions of the FBI under
his leadership. Information relating to the Watergate Affair is scattered throughout the
collection, but among the material found in this series is the Watergate detailed
memoranda file Gray used at his confirmation hearings, general investigation division
summaries of the break-in investigation, a compilation of questions and answers, and
digital files containing scans of the FBI’s Watergate file obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act request. Other files relate to the hijacking of aircraft, the George C.
Wallace assassination attempt, the American Indian Movement occupation at Wounded Knee,
South Dakota, and the Weatherman. Also included are a compilation of press clippings
about Gray and the FBI during that period, congratulatory correspondence, and letters
sent to Gray after the withdrawal of his nomination. Some documents that had once been
part of Gray’s FBI files are now part of other series. The <ref target="leg">Legal
File</ref> series contains documents Gray used as exhibits when he testified before
the Watergate hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign
Activities, as documentation submitted in response to the investigation by the Watergate
Special Prosecution Force, and as part of his defense in the <emph render="italic">United States v. Gray</emph>. Although <emph render="italic">United States v.
Gray</emph> centered on actions taken with regard to the Weatherman, documents pulled
together as general exhibits also pertain to the FBI response to other events including
the Watergate burglary investigation and the American Indian Movement occupation at
Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Speeches delivered by Gray as acting FBI director and
documents he gathered as resource material for his memoir are located in the <ref target="sw">Speeches and Writings </ref> series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="leg">Legal File</ref> series documents Gray’s involvement in
congressional hearings, grand juries, investigations, and federal and civil legal cases
in the years after his resignation from the FBI that stemmed from his tenure as acting
director. Gray's relationship with his lawyers is evident throughout the series. Notes
Gray wrote for his lawyers describe his memories and thoughts about the issues under
consideration and explain the documents he reviewed to prepare for testimony or plan his
legal defense. His detailed notes of telephone conversations and correspondence with his
attorneys recount his feelings about the legal investigations and prosecution as well as
statements about him in the press. Gray’s files are supplemented by those kept by his
lawyer, Stephen H. Sachs. The bulk of the files relate to the Watergate Affair and <emph render="italic">United States v. Gray</emph>. FBI memoranda, notes, and reports
relating to the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Committee
headquarters, press reporting on the investigation, and leaks to the press are included
in a set of numbered exhibits pertaining to Gray’s Senate Select Committee on
Presidential Campaign Activities. Additional documents relating to Gray’s actions were
submitted in response to requests by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and are
filed with material on that investigation. Among the files compiled during the course of
<emph render="italic">United States v. Gray</emph> are discovery documents and
exhibits pertaining to the FBI procedures and the response to terrorism and events of
the period. <emph render="italic">Gray v. Bell</emph>, the lawsuit Gray filed against
Attorney General Griffin Bell and others after the charges against him were dropped, is
among the material pertaining to civil litigation in which he was involved. Transcripts
and notes about grand jury testimony are filed in the Closed series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="sw">Speeches and Writings</ref> series features writings, recordings,
and resource material that Gray created and compiled for a book project he began in the
1970s and early 1980s but discontinued until the end of his life when his son, Ed Gray,
resumed work on the memoir and published <title>
<part>In Nixon’s Web: A Year in the Crosshairs
of Watergate </part>
</title>three years after his father's death. Among the book project
material are handwritten narratives, sample chapter drafts, recordings, and edited
transcripts of tape recordings Gray made in 1978-1979. A numerical file contains
resource material that Gray compiled; original folders with his original labels have
been retained. Among the material relating to <title>
<part>In Nixon’s Web</part>
</title> are digital
files documenting Ed Gray’s research and resource material, including scans of documents
from Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the
University of Texas at Austin, and transcripts and recordings of conversations from
Nixon’s White House tapes. Typescripts of speeches and remarks delivered by Gray while
at the Department of Justice and the FBI are also part of this series. </p>
<p>The <ref target="alph">Alphabetical File</ref> series contains material pertaining to
other phases of Gray’s life, including his tenures as executive assistant to secretary
of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Robert Finch, and assistant attorney
general for the Department of Justice's Civil Division. Appointment books, photographs,
and a scrapbook supplement those files. A grouping of military papers document Gray’s
twenty-year career in the United States Navy and includes copies of Gray’s letters to
friends and relations that provide details about his family life. Files from the Pat
Gray Legal Defense Fund document the effort by United States Naval Academy classmates
and other supporters to ease the financial burden of years of legal defense. A press
problems file reveals Gray's reaction to statements about him in the press, and his
annotations in books written by others about the FBI offer Gray's thoughts on their
accounts of him and his tenure there. Material from the last year of Gray's life focuses
on his private and public response to W. Mark Felt's announcement in 2005 that he was
"Deep Throat," the informant who assisted Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with their
reporting on the Watergate Affair.</p>
<p>The remaining series comprises a <ref target="clo">Closed </ref>segment of material

<p>The papers of Art Buchwald (1925-2007) span the years 1885 to 2007, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1962 to 2000. The collection documents Buchwald’s career as a
humorist and columnist, as well as many aspects of his personal life and relationships.
The papers are organized into nine series: <ref target="Correspondence">General
Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="Writings">Writings</ref>,
<ref target="Paramount">
<emph render="italic">Buchwald v. Paramount Pictures Corporation</emph>
</ref>,

<p>The collection extensively documents Buchwald’s work as a syndicated columnist in Europe
(1949-1962) and the United States (1962-2006), as well as his work as an author,
playwright, and public speaker. These papers primarily focus on Buchwald’s professional
pursuits, especially his years in Washington, D.C., while working for the
<title>
<part>Washington Post</part>
</title>, though evidence of his personal relationships with
entertainers, political figures, print and broadcast journalists, musicians, literary
figures, friends, and family members form a significant part of the collection. These
papers further illustrate the many connections Buchwald made during his life in Paris,
France, Washington, D.C., and summers in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Buchwald’s
papers also broadly chronicle his youth and include material related to his childhood in
the Hebrew Orphan Asylum and New York City’s foster care system, service in the United
States Marine Corps during World War II, education at the University of Southern
California, and his efforts to establish himself as a writer in Paris in the late 1940s
and 1950s. Buchwald’s illnesses later in life, stay in hospice care, and death in 2007
are also documented in this collection. To a lesser extent, these papers reflect
Buchwald’s lifelong struggle with depression. Though more minimally documented, this
marks an important aspect of Buchwald’s life and character. </p>

<p>Letters across the General Correspondence series are largely personal in nature
and chronicle Buchwald’s relationships with entertainers, political figures, print
and broadcast journalists, musicians, literary figures, and friends. This series
broadly reflects Buchwald's many circles of friends, especially those associated
with Paris, Washington, D.C., and Georgetown specifically, summers in Martha's
Vineyard, and Hollywood, as well as others working in the news industry. Topics
covered vary based on the correspondent, but many letters detail life in Paris,
time in the United States Marine Corps, shared personal history or acquaintances,
projects and events in which Buchwald participated, and responses to his columns
and books. The humor shared between Buchwald and his friends is well documented in
this series. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The Writings series forms the largest portion of the collection and documents
Buchwald’s work as a columnist, novelist, autobiographer, and playwright and
documents his many articles, books, columns, memoirs, plays, and screenplays. A
nearly complete chronological run of Buchwald’s columns is contained in this
series and dates between 1949 and 2006. The columns take the form of newspaper
clippings and drafts bearing Buchwald’s edits. Russian translations of Buchwald’s
columns as they appeared in Soviet periodicals, especially <title>

</title>,
are also included. These translations date primarily between 1958 and 1969 and
were sent to Buchwald by a variety of sources, among them, Radio Free Europe, the
United States Information Agency, and a reader named Misha Allen. Material related
to Buchwald’s numerous books, most of which are anthologies of his columns and
articles, are also contained in this series and are largely documented by
correspondence with publishers, friends, and readers, book reviews, and other
publishing work product. Buchwald’s memoirs, <title>

<p>The <emph render="italic">Buchwald v. Paramount Pictures Corporation</emph> series
chronicles a lawsuit Buchwald and producer, Alain Bernheim, filed against
Paramount Pictures in 1988 for breach of contract in the development of a film
treatment. The suit was filed in the state of California on Buchwald’s claim that
Paramount Pictures based their film <title>
<part>Coming to America</part>
</title> on his and
Bernheim’s treatment titled “King for a Day,” thereby violating their contract
agreements providing them compensation and credit if Paramount Pictures produced a
movie based on their creative work. Buchwald was ultimately awarded damages in
1992. This series comprehensively documents the legal proceedings of the suit and
includes draft copies of Buchwald's "King for a Day" and the screenplay directly
based on his treatment, the initial complaint filed in 1988, briefs, motions,
memoranda, depositions, and court transcripts. Correspondence from friends and

<p>The Personal File documents Buchwald’s youth, early career in Paris, France,
family, health, and death. The bulk of the material chronicles Buchwald’s
childhood in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum’s foster care system, service in the United
States Marine Corps, and years at the University of Southern California. Documents
and printed ephemera reflecting Buchwald’s fourteen years in Paris (1948-1962) are
comprised in this series and document his work as a critic and humorist for the
<title>
<part>New York Herald Tribune</part>
</title>, as well as his household and family
life at that time. The Personal File also contains Buchwald’s family papers, which
include letters with his sisters, in-laws, and other family members and documents
collected and created by Buchwald’s wife, Ann. Ann Buchwald’s papers contain
correspondence with Art and other members of her family, as well as transcripts
and drafts of her memoir, <title>
<part>Seems Like Yesterday</part>
</title>. Early examples of
Buchwald’s writings are found throughout the Personal File beginning with a poem
written when he was twelve years old, circa 1937. Several newsletters for which
Buchwald wrote while in the United States Marine Corps, including <title>
<part>The Coral

<p>The Subject File holds a wide range of files pertaining to Buchwald’s personal
interests, organizations and charities he supported, and organizations in which he
was involved, among other topics. Buchwald’s many charitable contributions are
documented in this series and include scholarships he funded, undergraduate
students he sponsored, monetary donations to nonprofit organizations, prizes he
donated for charitable auctions, which was usually the right to name a character
in one of his upcoming columns, and his service as the auctioneer for the annual
Possible Dreams auction in Martha’s Vineyard. Many humor conferences and
organizations are represented in this series and include material regarding an
exchange of American and Soviet humorists in 1988, for which Buchwald traveled to
the Soviet Union. Letters from readers are included in the Subject File and record
reactions to some of Buchwald’s columns. Correspondence and printed matter

<p>The Digital File series contains the contents of a personal computer and
word-processing disks created and used by Buchwald between 1987 and 2006. The
series documents his professional activities during this period and focuses
primarily on speech and column drafts, though to a lesser extent, correspondence
and photographs are also represented. The file structure of the digital content
has been maintained as received and Buchwald’s word-processing files were saved in
no particular chronological or topical order, resulting in a mix of date ranges,
subjects, and document types across digital ID numbers. In general, speeches and
columns found on disks range in date from 1987 to 1996, while those found on
Buchwald’s personal computer range in date from 2002 to 2006. An inventory of some
of the disks was created, presumably by one of Buchwald's assistants, and a PDF
copy is appended to the finding aid as <ref target="AppendixB">Appendix B</ref>.
Correspondence was saved among column and speech drafts and dates between 1987 and
1996. In an effort to ensure correspondence was not overlooked among the digital
files, digital ID numbers containing letters are listed under “Correspondence”
<emph render="italic">and</emph> under “Columns and speeches.” Correspondence
found in the Digital File series includes several letters Buchwald wrote to his
wife, Ann, during their separation and her cancer treatments. Letters from
Buchwald to his children and friends are also found in this series. In other

<p>The papers of Julius W. Becton (1926-2023) span the years 1780-2008, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1951 to 2008. The collection documents Becton's career as a
United States Army officer who commanded infantry and armor in war and peace, the first
African American general to command a corps, director of the Federal Emergency
Management Administration during the Reagan administration, an educator and president of
Prairie View A &amp; M University in Texas, and superintendent of the District of
Columbia Public Schools. The papers are primarily in English, with some German and
Vietnamese. The papers are organized into twelve series: <ref target="gencor">General
Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="armyc">Army Career</ref>,<ref target="ofda">
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance</ref>,<ref target="fema"> Federal Emergency
Management Agency</ref>, <ref target="pvamu">Prairie View A &amp; M University</ref>,
<ref target="dcps">District of Columbia Public Schools</ref>, <ref target="orgs">Organizations</ref>, <ref target="speech">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="subj_file">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="misc">Miscellany</ref>, <ref target="natsec">National Security Classified Information</ref>, and <ref target="overs">Oversize</ref>. Scattered documents are in German and Vietnamese.</p>
<p> The <ref target="gencor">General Correspondence</ref> series is arranged
chronologically and mainly documents Becton’s interests, activities, and friendships
outside of day-to-day professional commitments. The series is mainly a product of his
post-retirements from the army and from his civilian jobs, much of it retrospective,
looking back at people, incidents, and issues from his working life. It also documents
periods in his army career when he was between commands, on short staff stints, and
matriculated at military and civilian academic institutions. Correspondents in the
series include Harry W. Brooks, Edmund L. Goldsborough, Harvey Gough, Chester Higgins
(1917-2000), Benjamin L. Hooks, John Q. Taylor King, Charles C. Moskos, Robert L.
Nabors, Colin L. Powell, and Manfred Rommel. </p>
<p> The General Correspondence, though extensive, does not account for the bulk of the
correspondence in the papers. Most correspondence is part of series and files related to
his army commands and leadership of military agencies while on active duty; to the
civilian disaster relief agencies he directed after retiring from the army, the Office
of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency; to
his presidency of Prairie View A&amp;M University; and to his superintendency of the
District of Columbia Public Schools.</p>
<p> The <ref target="armyc">Army Career</ref> series documents Becton’s nearly forty-year
career in the United States Army, from his enlistment in 1943 to his retirement as a
lieutenant general (three stars) in 1983. The series is organized into files relating to
his troop commands and leadership of Army agencies; an academic file relating to his
stints in the armed forces graduate programs; and topical files on subjects such as race
relations in the Army and the Officer Efficency Report System (OERS). Large groupings in
the Army Career series include files on the 9th Infantry Division (platoon leader and
company commander in combat during the Korean War, 1950-1953); 101st Airborne Division
(squadron commander of the attached 17th Cavalry Regiment), and assistant brigade
commander in combat in Vietnam, 1967-1968; 2nd Armored Division (brigade commander,
1970-1972); United States Army Training Center at Fort Dix, N.J. (deputy commanding
general, 1972-1975); 1st Cavalry Division (commanding general, 1975-1976); Army
Operational Test and Evaluation Agency (commanding general 1976-1978); 7th Corps
(commanding general, 1978-1981); and the Training and Doctrine Command (deputy
commanding general, 1981-1983). </p>
<p>Correspondents in the Army Career series include Sidney B. Berry, Harry W. Brooks, Leo
A. Brooks, Bruce C. Clarke, Roscoe Robinson, Harvey G. Dickerson, H. Minton Francis,
Harvey Gough, James F. Hamlet, West A. Hamilton, Chester Higgins (1917-2000), Robert C.
Larson, Sharon B. Lord, Glenn K. Otis, George S. Patton (1923-2004), Charles C. Rogers,
Bernard W. Rogers, Manfred Rommel, Robert M. Shoemaker, Hervey S. Stockman, La Vern E.
Weber, John A. Wickham, and Oliver W. Willard, </p>
<p> Two series document Becton’s service in the Ronald Reagan and George Bush
administrations as the director of two federal disaster relief organizations, the <ref target="ofda">Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance</ref> (1984-1985), part of of the
Agency for International Development, and the <ref target="fema">Federal Emergency
Management Agency</ref> (1985-1989). Part of his job at FEMA was coordinating
international civil defense policy by meeting regularly with counterparts from countries
participating in the North Atlanic Treaty Organization. Some documents relating to this
function are classified and withdrawn to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
Classified series.</p>
<p>From 1957 to 1960, Becton was a professor of military science and tactics in the ROTC
program at Prairie View A&amp;M University in Texas. He used this opportunity to
matriculate, graduating with a BS in mathematics in 1960. In 1989 he was inaugurated as
president of Prairie View A&amp;M University, the first graduate of the school to become
its president. The <ref target="pvamu">Prairie View A&amp;M </ref>series documents his
presidency (1989-1994) of the historically black university, and his post-presidency. A
large file in the series, prepared by lawyers for the Texas A&amp;M System, relates to <title>
<part>Knight v. State of Alabama</part>
</title> federal case that alleged that state property tax systems discriminated against
black students by underfunding public schools and historically black institutions of
higher education. </p>
<p> In 1996 Becton commenced what he called his “toughest challenge,” running the District
of Columbia Public Schools as superintendent and CEO. The <ref target="dcps">District of
Columbia Public Schools </ref>series documents Becton’s tenure as school chief under
the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority,
commonly known as the Financial Control Board, or simply the Control Board. The Control
Board, a five-member panel created by an act of Congress, oversaw the District's
finances during 1995-2001. It had the power to override decisions of the mayor and city
council. The Control Board overrode the elected school board and installed as the
effective board the Emergency Transition Board of Trustees, which, in 1996, fired the
superintendent and hired Becton in his place. Becton held the position until he resigned
in 1998. There is frequent correspondence with Bruce E. Maclaury, chairman of of the
Emergency Transition Board of Trustees. Other correspondents include Andrew Brimmer and
Arlene Ackerman. </p>
<p>The <ref target="orgs">Organizations</ref> series includes files on veterans'
organizations of World War II era African American units, such as 555th Parachute
Infantry Regiment and the 761st Tank Battalion; and files on the veterans and historical
interest organizations of African American units that served in the American West during
the aftermath of the American Civil War through the World Wars, such as the Ninth and
Tenth Cavalry Association and Southwest Association of Buffalo Soldiers. While the file
on the Ninth Infantry Regiment (Manchu) in which Becton served during the Korean War is
part of the Army Career series, information on on the 2nd Infantry Division, which
included the Ninth, is documented in the Indianhead Association file of the
Organizations series. A file on the Ninth Infantry Regiment's veterans organization, the
Ninth Infantry (Manchu) Association, is also part of the the Organizations series. Also
in the Organizations series is a large file relating to The Rocks, an orgainization that
mentors African American officer candidates and junior officers. Other professional
service organizations documented in the series include the Association of the United
States Army, George C. Marshall Foundation, Non-Commisioned Officers Association, and
United States Armor Association. Most of these organizations are also well-documented in
the General and other correspondence files. </p>
<p> Two major components of the <ref target="speech">Speeches and Writings</ref> series are
files relating to Becton’s book, <title>
<part>Becton: Autobiography of a Soldier and Public Servant</part>
</title> (2008), and to his speeches. The book gestated nearly three decades resulting
in several drafts. Some drafts, though unpublished, are fairly complete versions with an
organization, chapter headings, anecdotes, and content that differs substantially from
the published book. The speeches as a whole work the way the correspondence does, with
most speeches focused on his army commands and civilian leadership positions and found
within the Army Career series, and in series relating to OFDA, FEMA, Prairie View, and
District of Columbia Public Schools. Speeches in Speeches and Writings are more generic
and focused on his post-retirement years.</p>
<p> The <ref target="subj_file">Subject File</ref> series includes biographical material on
Becton; files on his family, including correspondence and diaries; and files relating to
Becton’s hometown, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on the "Main Line" outside of Philadelphia,
including files on Lower Merion High School from which he graduated. Also part of the
series is material relating to African American history, particularly military history,
with files on units of the pre-1950s segregated army and on the first African American
general officers. The oldest in the papers, a 1780 document certifying three years of
service in the Continental Army during the American Revolution of one Jonathan Cain, or
Crain, is also part of the Subject File. </p>

<p>The papers of Albert Gallatin Marchand span the period 1801-1862, with the bulk of the
material dating from 1839 to 1843. The collection documents Marchand’s tenure as a
two-term Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives (1839-1843) and
his life as a transitory resident of Washington, D.C., and consists almost entirely of
letters to his wife, Susan S. (Kuhns) Marchand. Though he was not an influential member
of the House, Marchand's correspondence provides insight into the daily workings of that
body during the administrations of presidents Martin Van Buren and John Tyler. (No
letters from William Henry Harrison’s month-long presidency are included.) He offers
observations on the legislative process, comments on the distinctions between Democrats
and Whigs, and relates his often witty and withering assessments of fellow
representatives. His letters convey the details of his daily routine, such as living
arrangements at Gadsby’s Hotel and other temporary residences and his frequent
constitutionals around Capitol Hill, while also expressing his longing to return home to
his wife and young children. Additional correspondence includes letters from Susan’s
brother, Daniel S. Kuhns, a letter from Marchand to his younger brother, Henry Clay
Marchand, and an 1862 condolence letter to Susan upon the death of William K. Marchand,
Albert and Susan’s son. Of note is his June 8, 1840, speech supporting the creation of
an independent United States treasury, the collection's sole item of an official nature illustrating his
role as a representative.</p>

<p>The papers of Stephen D. Pyle consist chiefly of correspondence written to him by two members of the American Colony in Jerusalem, Jacob E. Spafford and G. Eric Matson. The American Colony was established in Jerusalem in 1881 as a Christian utopian society led by Anna and Horatio Spafford, Jacob E. Spafford’s adoptive parents.</p>
<p>Spafford's letters date from 1924 to 1927 and document daily life and social events in the American Colony, the travels of some American Colony members, and occasional philosophical musings on religion. A few letters contain photographs and other ephemera. Two pieces of Arabic writing, a handwritten "Arabic grammar" and an illuminated printed page from an unidentified text, were enclosed with the letters. Also included are three printed Christmas cards from the American Colony.</p>
<p>Matson's letter of September 18, 1924, discusses the travels of mutual acquaintances of his and Pyle's, as well as a brief description of his struggle to obtain a marriage license to Edith Yantiss Matson.</p>

<p>The papers of Robert Orben (1927-2023) span the dates 1941-2019. The collection
documents Orben's career as a comedy writer and humor consultant, and speechwriter for
President Gerald R. Ford. The papers are arranged into five series: <ref target="GC">General Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="Alpha">Alphabetical File</ref>, <ref target="SW">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="Misc">Miscellany</ref>, and
<ref target="OV">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>This collection documents Orben's work as a comedy writer and promoter of humor. Orben
initially focused on magic and magicians, but over time expanded his reach and wrote
material for use by a wide range of performers and public speakers. A strength of this
collection is the compilation of jokes and one-liners he wrote over the second half of
the twentieth century, that he published under his own name, prepared for other
performers, created for <title>
<part>The Red Skelton Hour</part>
</title> television program, and supplied for corporate events. His periodical, <title>
<part>Orben's Current Comedy</part>
</title>, a topical subscription service, contains jokes relating to the public figures,
cultural trends, and current events from 1958 to 1989. A smaller amount of similar
material from the 1990s that he sent to columnists and others is dispersed throughout
collection. Orben's work as a promoter of and advisor on the use of humor in public
speaking and his life-long connection to magicians and the magic profession are also
documented. The collection complements a larger collection of Robert Orben Papers at the
Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Material pertaining to Orben's time as a
speechwriter in the Ford White House includes memorabilia, photographs, an oral history
transcript, speeches, and an unpublished memoir. </p>
<p>The collection's series are listed and briefly described below. A fuller description of
each series and a list of its contents can be accessed in the series descriptions within
the container list.</p>
<p>The <ref target="GC">General Correspondence</ref> series comprises a chronological
grouping of letters sent and received by Orben between the years 1963 and 2019.</p>
<p>The <ref target="Alpha">Alphabetical File</ref> series touches on all aspects of his
career and documents Orben’s dealings with colleagues, publishers, publications,
organizations, columnists, clients, and friends. </p>
<p>The <ref target="SW">Speeches and Writings</ref> series contains approximately sixty
years of jokes, one-liners, writings, and remarks from Orben's career as a comedy writer
and humor consultant for performers, television programs, public figures, and corporate
clients. </p>
<p>A small <ref target="Misc">Miscellany</ref> series contains additional material
documenting Orben's life and career including press clippings and photographs depicting
his work with President Gerald R. Ford. </p>
<p>The remaining series contains <ref target="OV">Oversize</ref> material.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The General Correspondence series comprises a chronological grouping of letters
sent and received by Orben between the years 1963 and 2019. The letters date from
the period that Orben moved to California to work as a writer for the television
program, <title>
<part>The Red Skelton Hour</part>
</title>, and continue into his retirement years. While some of the correspondence
relates to his work, much of it is of a personal nature. Additional
correspondence, grouped alphabetically by name of correspondent or topic, is

<p>The Alphabetical File series touches on all aspects of his career and documents
Orben’s dealings with colleagues, publishers, publications, organizations,
columnists, clients, and friends. Files relating to Orben’s business partner in
the 1960s, Stanley Kupferman, contain their extensive correspondence from when
Orben was in California containing details about their business, Orben
Publications, and their efforts to promote and sell Orben’s books and other comedy
products. Orben’s letters to Kupferman also describe his experience as a writer
for <title>
<part>The Red Skelton Hour</part>
</title> and touch on his work for comedian Dick Gregory. A large portion of this
material dates from the years after Orben’s work for President Gerald R. Ford.
Items relating to Gerald R. Ford include letters from Ford documenting Orben’s
continued assistance with speeches in the years following his presidency and
memorabilia from Orben’s time in the Ford White House. </p>
<p>Material types include correspondence, business papers, printed matter, and
one-liners and other humorous material Orben sent to individuals and publications.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
<p>The Speeches and Writings series contains approximately sixty years of jokes,
one-liners, writings, and remarks from Orben's career as a comedy writer and humor
consultant for performers, television programs, public figures, and corporate
clients. His earliest material is included in a grouping of small self-published
books, such as <title>
<part>The Encyclopedia of Patter</part>
</title> (1946), <title>
<part>Magicdotes </part>
</title> (1948), and <title>
<part>The Working Comedian’s Gag File</part>
</title> (1956), that Orben wrote for magicians, emcees, comedians, and other
performers. The largest portion of this material relates to his topical humor
service, <title>
<part>Orben’s Current Comedy</part>
</title>, that he edited from 1958 to 1989 with a small break between 1968 and
1971. This periodical, issued monthly and then bi-monthly, contains jokes and
one-liners relating to current events and prominent figures in politics and
entertainment. Orben later compiled some of this material into a series of books.
Orben’s writing for television is documented in an index card file arranged by
topic, labeled “Skelton Stockpile,” containing jokes he wrote for <title>
<part>The Red Skelton Hour</part>
</title> as well material he wrote for <title>
<part>The Jack Paar Program</part>
</title> in 1962. Another set of index cards contains material Orben wrote for
comedian Dick Gregory’s book, <title>
<part>From the Back of the Bus</part>
</title> (1962). Additional material relating to this project can be found in the
Alphabetical File series. Another group of writings contains material he wrote for
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) corporate events. Orben’s
articles and essays about the writing, effective delivery, and use of humor in
speeches, as well as his speeches and speech material about humor in the
presidency are also included in this series. An unpublished memoir offers Orben’s
account of events in his life until the end of his time in the Gerald R. Ford
administration. Additional jokes that he sent to individuals and publications,
particularly topical material written in the 1990s, are located in the
Alphabetical File series under the name of the person or publication. </p>
<p>Material types include jokes, articles, books, book drafts, periodicals, a memoir,
notes, interview transcripts, speeches, and scripts.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of John A. Casazza (1924-2019) span the years 1938-2018, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1970 to 2012. The collection documents Casazza’s career in
the electric power industry as an engineer, educator, and author. The papers are in
English. The collection is organized into five series: <ref target="spwr">Speeches
and Writings File</ref>, <ref target="subjfile">Subject File</ref>, <ref target="coursefile">Course Materials</ref>, <ref target="misc">Miscellany</ref>,
and <ref target="digital">Digital File.</ref>
</p>
<p>The collection documents Casazza’s long career as an electrical engineer and business
executive at Public Service Electric and Gas Company. His papers also include
material related to his consulting firm, Casazza, Schultz &amp; Associates, his
teaching efforts with the American Education Institute, his advocacy work with Power
Engineers Supporting Truth, and the writing of his books and other publications.
Much of Casazza's work was published under the name Jack Casazza. As Casazza
believed engineers and their employers have a moral responsibility to provide a
service to society instead of prioritizing commercial interests, the papers
frequently explore ethical issues within the electric power industry. While he
advocated for engineers to have a greater role in setting electric power policy,
Casazza also worked to improve the technical competence of existing government
officials through educational programs.</p>
<p>The collection’s series are listed and briefly described below. A fuller description
of each series and a list of its contents can be accessed in the series descriptions
within the container list.</p>
<p>The <ref target="spwr">Speeches and Writings File</ref> series includes book drafts,

<p>The Speeches and Writings File series includes book drafts, articles,
reports, unpublished memoirs, and talks written by Casazza. The series
contains drafts of several books by Casazza, including the first edition of <title>
<part>Understanding Electric Power Systems</part>
</title>. Research materials, correspondence, reviews, and copies of figures
and illustrations are also present for some of his books. The chronological
file in this series contains copies of Casazza’s professional articles,
conference talks, reports, lectures, and expert testimonies given before the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and various congressional committees.
Casazza collected these materials in a set of twelve binders, assigned each
binder a number (i.e. “Book I”), and created separate indexes for the
contents of each binder. The container list maintains his original
organization of these materials. A complete index of all twelve “Books” is
included at the end of the chronological file. Additional articles and
reports not part of the chronological file are listed individually in the
container list. Some articles explore Casazza’s personal views on topics
like race relations and religion. The series also contains copies of
Casazza’s unpublished memoirs and a collection of writings he identified as
his most important works. This series also includes a selection of writings
by others that feature Casazza's annotations. For the most heavily annotated
books, the entire book was retained. In other cases, only the relevant pages
were photocopied. Also present is a draft of former Federal Power Commission
chairman Joseph C. Swidler’s autobiography. After Swidler's death, an edited
version of this autobiography was published as <title>

<p>The papers of Isabella Karle and Jerome Karle span the years 1912-2012, with the bulk
of the material dating from 1948 to 2008. The collection documents the Karles’
sixty-five year careers as physical chemists in the field of x-ray crystallography,
most of which was spent at the Laboratory for the Structure of Matter at the Naval
Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC. The papers are primarily in English,
with Polish and some German, Russian, Spanish, and Chinese. The papers are organized
into four series: <ref target="ik">Isabella Karle Papers</ref>, <ref target="jk">Jerome Karle Papers</ref>, <ref target="collaborations">Collaborations</ref>,
and <ref target="oversize">Oversize</ref>.</p>
<p>The collection focuses almost entirely on the Karles’ professional careers with
little documentation of their personal lives. With the exception of the files in the
<ref target="collaborations">Collaborations</ref> series, Isabella and Jerome
maintained separate files which are arranged into distinct series, the <ref target="ik">Isabella Karle Papers</ref> and the <ref target="jk">Jerome Karle
Papers</ref>. Both of their papers reflect the development and use of methods
for crystal structure analysis with Jerome’s work skewing more toward theoretical
investigations and Isabella’s work involving the development and execution of
specific processes to analyze crystal structures, most of which were based on
Jerome’s theories and calculations. Furthermore, Isabella’s papers focus mostly on
her work within the laboratory, while Jerome’s reflect his wider involvement in the
field as an administrator and participant in a variety of professional organizations
and institutions. Though their working relationship is rarely evidenced in the
files, it is explored through oral history interviews and other biographical
materials throughout the collection. There is no documentation in the collection of
their involvement with the Manhattan Project or other aspects of their career
outside the NRL.</p>

<p>The Consultant File documents the mostly political work of Arthur J. Finkelstein,
containing memorandum, polls, and other material related to various campaigns or
organizations. Specifically, the series contains material primarily from AJF &amp;
Associates, the polling and consulting company founded by Finkelstein. The firm
specialized in political consulting for Republican candidates, and Finkelstein’s
polling, coupled with direct mail for campaign fundraising and the use of
independent expenditures, helped lead to a wave of Republican victories in the
1980s. The work for these campaigns could range from a simple poll to complete
campaign management, where Finkelstein consulted on the crafting of oft-negative
television and radio advertisements, direct mail letters, and other general
advisement. Consequently, the amount of material in this series can vary from
client to client. Some of the most noteworthy clients represented in this series
are: James Lane Buckley, Alphonse D’Amato, Jesse Helms, Judy Koehler, Ronald S.
Lauder, Don Nickles, Connie Mack III, and Denny Smith. Alongside individual
candidates, Finkelstein played important roles in political action committees,
such as the National Conservative Political Action Committee and the National

<p>The papers of Thomas Lowe Hughes (1925-) span the dates 1918-2018, with the bulk of
the material dating from 1961 to 1991. The collection documents Hughes's career in
United States politics and foreign policy, especially as an aide to United States
politicians, Chester Bowles and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, as director of the
Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and, later, as the
president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The collection is
organized into eight series: <ref target="Congress">United States Congress </ref>,

<p>The collection documents Hughes's interest and work in federal politics and foreign
policy, much of which was informed by his early involvement with and leadership in
the Student Federalists movement as a student at Carleton College and his travels
throughout Europe as a Rhodes scholar in the immediate postwar period. His papers
comprehensively cover the trajectory of his career in American foreign policy,
beginning in the United States Congress as an administrative assistant to Chester
Bowles and as legislative counsel to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, then moving into
various leadership roles in the Department of State and, finally, the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. Hughes's professional contacts, associations, and
affiliations, many of which Hughes worked to foster and maintain for the duration of
his career and beyond, feature prominently through correspondence and meeting notes,
filed across several series and found throughout the collection.</p>

for Bowles, files documenting bills Bowles worked on, as well as his
platforms and policies. Bowles’s participation in John F. Kennedy’s 1960
presidential campaign and subsequent appointment to Kennedy’s administration
as undersecretary of state is well represented through copies of letters to
Kennedy. Replies from Kennedy are present to a lesser degree. Also featured
is material relating to Bowles's two appointments as United States
ambassador to India, including drafts of his book, <emph render="italic">Ambassador's Report</emph>, and correspondence to Hughes from his
second tenure as ambassador. The Hubert H. Humphrey material documents
Hughes’s work with Humphrey as well as his continued association until
Humphrey’s death in 1978 and Hughes’s involvement with Humphrey’s legacy
after his death. Materials cover Humphrey’s policies in the Senate, his
electoral campaigns, the inner workings of his Senate office, and, to a

arranged some of the material, sometimes including personal notes to provide greater
context to the files. Some personalized or unconventional folder headings were placed in
quotation marks to reflect Free’s original terminology and language used throughout the
collection. The collection reflects the many topics Free was passionate about and
explored in her writing throughout her life. Prominent topics include animal welfare,
the environment, nature, civil rights, the plight of refugees, and the empowerment of
women. </p>

<p>The papers of <persname>
<part>Henry Harley Arnold (1886-1950)</part>
</persname> span the years 1903 to 1967, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the
years of World War II (1940-1946). The collection is large and contains material on
almost all aspects of Arnold's adult life. The most comprehensive documentation,
however, covers Arnold's tenure as chief of the <corpname>
<part>United States Army Air Corps</part>
</corpname> (1938-1942), chief of the <corpname>
<part>army air forces</part>
</corpname> (1941-1942), and commanding general of the <corpname>
<part>army air forces</part>
</corpname> (1942-1946). These changes in nomenclature reflect the growth of the
military air arm from a small auxiliary of the <corpname>
<part>army</part>
</corpname> in the 1930s to a massive semi-autonomous armed service in World War II
which became formally independent of the <corpname>
<part>Army</part>
</corpname> in 1947. Arnold, one of the nation's earliest military pilots, built what
became the modern <corpname>
<part>United States Air Force,</part>
</corpname> and his papers are a documentation of that creation.</p>
<p>The papers are divided into a number of series and subseries. Several of the subseries
contain detailed indexes which were prepared contemporaneously by Arnold's military
staff or later by personal assistants either to Arnold or his wife, Eleanor Pool Arnold,
after he left active service. In some cases, documents on the same or similar subjects
are found in different subseries. When Arnold's papers arrived at <corpname>
<part>Library of Congress,</part>
</corpname> large sections came in an arrangement devised by Arnold and his staff during
the creation and use of the papers. It was judged best not to modify Arnold's
arrangement because it reflected Arnold's use of the papers and because several of these
sections came with detailed indexes providing excellent research access to this
material.</p>
<p>The <ref target="family" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Family Papers </ref>
series, 1922-1955, consists largely of correspondence between Arnold and his family
during the 1930s and 1940s. Most of this correspondence deals with family affairs along
with some family business activities.</p>
<p>The <ref target="journals" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Journals and Notebooks
</ref> series, 1908-1946, includes a few journals that go back to Arnold's earliest
flying days and the <corpname>
<part>army air corps.</part>
</corpname> Of significant interest are Arnold's notebooks from World War II when he
took part in several of the major wartime conferences of the Allied leadership. Arnold
kept notes on those meetings in small pocket diaries. These notes were later
transcribed, and Arnold often interspersed with the typed transcriptions documents
relating to the events noted in the journals. Arnold's notes include both substantive
remarks about the issues discussed as well as observations about the principal figures
at the conferences and physical aspects of the trip. Among the key wartime conferences
recorded in Arnold's journals are those of <persname>
<part>Roosevelt</part>
</persname> and <persname>
<part>Churchill</part>
</persname> at <corpname>
<part>Placentia Bay in 1941,</part>
</corpname> the <corpname>
<part>1943 Cairo conferences</part>
</corpname> with <persname>
<part>Roosevelt</part>
</persname> and <persname>
<part>Churchill,</part>
</persname> the <corpname>
<part>Teheran conference</part>
</corpname> with <persname>
<part>Stalin,</part>
</persname>
<persname>
<part>Churchill</part>
</persname> and <persname>
<part>Roosevelt,</part>
</persname> and the <corpname>
<part>1944 Roosevelt-Churchill conference at Quebec.</part>
</corpname> Also present are journals Arnold kept for wartime inspection trips to <geogname>
<part>Great Britain,</part>
</geogname>
<geogname>
<part>China,</part>
</geogname>
<geogname>
<part>North Africa</part>
</geogname> and the <geogname>
<part>Pacific</part>
</geogname> theater.</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Correspondence </ref> series,
1907-1967, is divided into several subseries. The <ref target="chron" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Chronological </ref> subseries consists largely of military
correspondence, reports, memoranda, and other official documents. Among its earliest
items are the 1911 reports of then Second Lieutenant Arnold on his training as a pilot
by the <corpname>
<part>Wright brothers aviation company.</part>
</corpname> Also present are copies of letters from <persname>
<part>Wilbur and Orville Wright</part>
</persname> to Arnold in which the <famname>
<part>Wrights</part>
</famname> answer Arnold's technical questions about the aircraft the brothers were
building for the <corpname>
<part>army.</part>
</corpname> By 1939 Arnold was a brigadier general in charge of America's growing but
still small <corpname>
<part>army air corps.</part>
</corpname> His files for 1939 and 1940 are filled with reports by American military
observers in Europe about the rapid evolution of German, French, and British aircraft
and air warfare tactics under the pressure of combat. As one report noted, European
fighter aircraft in 1940 were routinely equipped with guns whose firepower was several
times that of existing American fighters. Under Arnold's command, America's military air
arm quickly caught up with and then surpassed in lethality those of other nations.
Present in Arnold's 1945 file is an 8 August 1945 report to him on the dropping of the
atomic bomb that begins “ <geogname>
<part>Hiroshima</part>
</geogname> is no more.”</p>
<p>The <ref target="congrat" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Congratulatory and
Condolence Letters </ref> subseries comprises files generally in chronological order
for major events in Arnold's life.</p>
<p>The <ref target="genl" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> General Correspondence </ref>
subseries is further divided into two parts. The first is an alphabetical file
consisting largely of correspondence and other documents of a military or semiofficial
nature from Arnold's World War II years, although correspondence about personal matters
is also found. The second part of this subseries, a Serial file, 1946-1950, consists of
files numbered 1 through 714. Access to these numbered files is provided by an index
which lists personal names or private institutions with a designation of the numbered
file in which relevant material can be found. The material in these files is a mixture
of correspondence and other documents dealing with Arnold's professional and personal
activities after his retirement.</p>
<p>The <ref target="pers" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Personal Correspondence
</ref> subseries includes material from the early 1930s and the period from 1943 to
1950. The material for 1930-1934 is largely professional correspondence dealing with
aviation and <corpname>
<part>army air corps</part>
</corpname> activities. The files for 1943-1950 consists largely of documents dealing
with Arnold's purchase and maintenance of a residential property in <geogname>
<part>Sonoma, California,</part>
</geogname> to which he retired after his World War II duties.</p>
<p>The <ref target="mil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Military File </ref> series is
the largest in the collection and is extremely rich with material on all aspects of
American military air activity in World War II: mobilization, organization, supply,
weaponry, training, personnel, strategy, command, intelligence, and technology. Only the
official records of the <corpname>
<part>army air force</part>
</corpname> exceed in abundance the resources offered by the Arnold papers for the study
of American air warfare in World War II. Much of the material in the Military File
series consists of copies of official records which can be found at the <corpname>
<part>National Archives.</part>
</corpname> What gives this collection research interest is that it consists of copies
of those documents that Arnold or his staff regarded as of sufficient significance to
cull from the flood of paper that passed through his office during World War II.</p>
<p>In the <ref target="mil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Military File, </ref> the
first subseries, entitled the <ref target="decimal" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Decimal File, </ref> 1940-1945, consists of military documents, messages,
correspondence, memoranda, and reports filed in accordance with a decimal filing system
(similar to the Dewey decimal system) used by the <corpname>
<part>army</part>
</corpname> during World War II. Access to the material in these files in best sought by
use of two card-file indexes. The first index is alphabetical by the name of an
individual connected to the documents. The index gives the decimal files in which
documents by or about that person can be found. The second index is alphabetical by
subject, institution, or organization. The indexes are detailed, with the name index
taking up containers 39-46 and the subject index containers 47-60. In addition to the
decimal designation, some of the decimal files also have subject matter titles which
have been included in the container listing of the Arnold Papers.</p>
<p>The <ref target="message" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Message File </ref>
subseries consists of incoming and outgoing official cables and other messages between
Arnold's headquarters and other offices during World War II. Most messages are filed
alphabetically by subject, office, or the name of a frequent correspondent, <persname>
<part>Dwight Eisenhower,</part>
</persname> for example. This subseries also contains a chronological file of Arnold's
incoming and outgoing messages filed under his name.</p>
<p>The <ref target="official" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Official File </ref>
subseries includes military reports, memoranda, correspondence, and other documents
designated by files numbered 1-287 and 516-540. Files 1-210 have subject matter titles
in alphabetical order while files numbered 211-287 have geographic area titles in
alphabetical order along with a few files for non-geographic military commands, ferrying
command, for example. Files numbered 516-540 contain a variety of reports, logs, and
extensive documentation deriving from the investigation of the <geogname>
<part>Pearl Harbor</part>
</geogname> attack and the role of the <corpname>
<part>army air force</part>
</corpname> in that disaster. Indexes are available for both of these numbered
sequences. Files numbered 288-515 are not extant in the Arnold Papers.</p>
<p>The <ref target="reports" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Reports </ref> subseries,
1913-1949, consists of official military reports related to air warfare topics. Some of
the reports are printed or near-print reports while others are in manuscript form.
General reports largely concern the overall status of American military air power.
Specialized reports relate to a variety of topics, such as atomic energy, analytic
studies of American air warfare campaigns during World War II, and estimates of German
war potential.</p>
<p>The <ref target="subj" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Subject File </ref>
subseries, 1917-1950, deals with a wide variety of official, professional, and private
matters, treating such diverse topics as “Elks in <geogname>
<part>Mexico,</part>
</geogname>” regarding the <corpname>
<part>fraternal order of Elks,</part>
</corpname> military aircraft production, 1938-1945, and the <corpname>
<part>1941 Argentia conference</part>
</corpname> of Allied leaders in <geogname>
<part>Newfoundland.</part>
</geogname> Most of the files deal with important military affairs during World War
II.</p>
<p>The <ref target="milmisc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany </ref>
subseries, 1934-1951, of the Military File series also contains a variety of files,
including a chronological file of <corpname>
<part>army air force</part>
</corpname> air adjutant general memoranda and messages; a chronological mail log for
Arnold's office listing “to,” “from,” and the subject of correspondence; a chronological
file of Arnold's military correspondence spanning 1934-1945, the bulk of which is
concentrated during World War II and deals with a wide variety of military topics; and
an extensive chronological log of incoming telephone calls, often with notes on the
subject of the call. In addition to the telephone logs, this subseries also includes a
number of transcripts of telephone conversations between Arnold and members of his staff
with other officials. Files of official war communiques publicly released by military
offices relate to the course of the war effort. A Personal File index for files numbered
1-50 is included but only files numbered 34-40 and 42 are present in the collection.</p>
<p>The <ref target="postmil" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Postmilitary File, </ref>
1946-1949, contains Arnold's extensive correspondence after his retirement. The
correspondence is divided into two sets, “A” and “B,” and is filed alphabetically.
Indexes are provided for both sets. This series also contains subject matter files on
the B-36 bomber, atomic testing, and congressional hearings on aviation policy.</p>
<p>The <ref target="speeches" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Speeches and Writings
</ref> series, 1923-1955, includes Arnold's extensive speeches and writings, most of
which relate to aviation and military matters. Arnold had a clear sense that he was
taking part in the creation of a powerful American air arm, and many of his speeches and
essays reflect his sensibility about the history-making character of the events he was
discussing. Also in this series are files related to his 1949 book <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Global Mission,</part>
</title> his memoir of the <corpname>
<part>army</part>
</corpname> air force in World War II.</p>
<p>Among the <ref target="misc" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Miscellany </ref>
series, 1903-1963, are photographs, financial papers, and biographical material, printed
material, and other items that further reflect Arnold's historical sensitivity,
especially the material he collected about the early years of American military
aviation. Included are photographs, lists and biographies of early pilots,
contemporaneous print and near-print accounts of important events in military aviation
history, and extensive scrapbooks.</p>
<p>The <ref target="jocham" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Jo Chamberlin File </ref>,
1941-1989, consists of scrapbooks containing memoranda, reports, speeches, military
papers, printed matter, and other miscellaneous material reflecting Chamberlin's
assignment to the Office of Information Services, Army Air Forces, and as an aide to
Arnold. Included are drafts of reports to the secretary of war by the commanding
general, Army Air Forces, with annotations by Arnold, speeches drafted by Chamberlin for
Arnold, reports from the Aleutian Island Campaign, information regarding 'foo-fighters,'
and writings on Chamberlin's trip to Germany in the waning days of World War II.</p>
<p>The <ref target="class" show="replace" actuate="onrequest"> Classified </ref> series
consists of security classified items removed from the collection. Removal sheets for
all such material can be found in the files from which the items were removed. When any
item in this series is declassified, it is restored to its original file. Classified
items are not included on the microfilm edition of the Arnold Papers prepared in
1995.</p>

<p>The papers of
<persname>
<part>Joshua Lockwood Logan (1908-1988)</part>
</persname> span the years
1723-1992, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period 1940-1980. The
collection documents Logan's career as a director, producer, and author of
stage and film productions. Included are family papers, correspondence,
business papers, financial papers, production records, writings, and
scrapbooks.</p>

Papers
</ref> reflect Logan's multifaceted involvement in the theater world as
well as his personal business matters. Correspondence with agents includes
management of Logan's career in addition to employment inquiries from authors
and actors. The financial papers include Logan's investments in theater
productions and the stock market. Correspondence with Logan's entertainment
lawyers in the legal section contains much information on the preparation of
his shows, as do the interoffice memoranda and office diaries. The projects
section contains idea files and material related to the many properties on
which Logan held or negotiated an option but never actually mounted. Shows
staged with his active participation are represented with various materials in

</ref>
</p>
<p>The
<ref target="production" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Production
File
</ref> consists of papers relating to the preparation and management of
shows in which Logan was personally connected as director, producer, author, or
actor. Also included are productions for which Logan was hired but from which
he resigned before the show opened. In cases where Logan was involved in both
the stage and screen version of a work, separate files have been maintained.
Subjects relate to casting, financial management, legal matters, derivative
productions such as touring companies and amateur performances, publicity,
research, reviews, and tickets, including benefit shows. The working papers
sections contain correspondence and notes on rehearsals, performance quality,
plot development, script revisions, costumes, set design, location
arrangements, equipment, and editing. The amount of material on each show
varies greatly. Some productions, such as
<title localtype="simple" render="italic">

<p>The
<ref target="legal" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Legal
File,
</ref> 1905-1992, constituting over half of the collection, documents
Gertz's lengthy and prominent legal career. Papers in the series are divided
into two subseries:
<ref target="personal" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Personal
</ref> and
<ref target="prof" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Professional.
</ref> The
<ref target="personal" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Personal
</ref> subseries, 1950-1988, pertains to cases in which
Gertz was a litigant. The private lawsuit which brought Gertz national
attention was <emph render="italic">Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,</emph> a
precedent-setting case which changed libel laws throughout the nation. The
<geogname>
<part>Chicago</part>
</geogname> attorney sued the publishers of a
<corpname>
<part>John Birch Society</part>
</corpname> publication for reporting that
Gertz was involved in a Communist plot to discredit the
<corpname>
<part>Chicago Police Department.</part>
</corpname> The
<corpname>
<part>United States Supreme Court</part>
</corpname> ruled that Gertz, as a
private individual, did not have to prove “actual malice” to
receive compensatory damages.</p>
<p>The
<ref target="prof" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Professional
</ref> subseries, 1905-1992, consists of correspondence
and memoranda, chiefly between Gertz and clients, lawyers, and judges, as well
as extensive legal files including opinions, orders, briefs, writs, motions,
petitions, exhibits, and transcripts. Both case files and client files reflect
the wide range of cases handled by Gertz, particularly those involving libel,
obscenity, capital punishment, and copyright issues. One of Gertz's clients was
novelist
<persname>
<part>Henry Miller,</part>
</persname> who challenged charges that his work
was obscene. Gertz fought successfully in Illinois against censorship of the
writer's book
<title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Tropic of Cancer.</part>
</title>
</p>
<p>Another of Gertz’s clients, Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, was
convicted with Richard Loeb of murdering fourteen-year-old Bobby Franks in a
sensational trial that captivated the nation in 1924. Gertz later helped
Leopold obtain a parole after thirty-four years in prison. Correspondence
relating to Leopold's release is located in the early correspondence files of
<emph render="italic">Leopold v. Levin</emph>, Leopold's suit seeking
compensation from Meyer Levin, whose book and film,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Compulsion,</part>
</title> were based on the murder and subsequent trial.
Background files for the Levin case also contain court documents and other
material relating to Leopold's murder trial, <emph render="italic">Illinois v.
Leopold.</emph>
</p>
<p>Gertz was also one of a team of lawyers representing Jack Ruby, who
was convicted of killing Lee Harvey Oswald, assassin of President John F.
Kennedy, in November 1963. Gertz joined the defense team in December 1964 and
assisted with Ruby's appeal which succeeded in getting his death sentence set
aside. Several items in the <emph render="italic">Ruby v. Texas</emph> case
file are worthy of mention: Ruby's letter to his brother Earl, located in the
folder "Miscellaneous, 1964-70, undated"; Ruby's note to Gertz of 9 September
1965, located in the folder "Correspondence, Aug.-Sept. 1965"; and a reporter's
note to Gertz describing his visit with Ruby shortly before Ruby's death,
located in the folder "Correspondence, Mar.-Aug. 1967, undated" Additional
material pertaining to Ruby may be found in the Speeches and Writings File
relating to Gertz’s book
<title localtype="simple">

</title>
</p>
<p>Papers in the
<ref target="subj" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Subject
File
</ref> series, 1894, 1903-1990, illustrate Gertz's diverse interests and
activities. This series chronicles his service with committees and
organizations and documents his duties as a delegate and committee chair of the

<geogname>
<part>Illinois</part>
</geogname> constitutional convention, 1969-1970; his
work with the
<corpname>
<part>Chicago Bar Association,</part>
</corpname> 1977-1985 and the
<corpname>
<part>Illinois Coalition Against the Death Penalty,</part>
</corpname>
1977-1985; and his membership on the
<corpname>
<part>Chicago Citizens Commission to Study the Disorders of
Convention Week</part>
</corpname> (1968 Democratic national convention). Also
reflected in the series is Gertz's interest in various historical and literary
figures:
<persname>
<part>James Baldwin,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>Clarence Darrow,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>Frank Harris,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>John F. Kennedy,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>Henry Miller,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>Carl Sandburg,</part>
</persname>

<persname>
<part>Harry S. Truman,</part>
</persname> and
<persname>
<part>Bernard Shaw.</part>
</persname> Other topics prominently featured
include censorship, housing, obscenity, and the death penalty. There is some
overlap between this series and the
<ref target="gencorr" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
General
Correspondence
</ref> series, and many of the same individuals appear in both
series. Also included are legal papers relating to Gertz's consultations in his
later years.</p>
<p> The
<ref target="sandw" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and
Writings File,
</ref> 1888-1990, document Gertz’s activities as a prolific
writer and speaker interested not only in legal matters but in literary
subjects as well. Some of his most voluminous papers relate to two of his
books,
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Frank Harris: A Study in Black and White</part>
</title> and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>Odyssey of a Barbarian: The Biography of George Sylvester
Viereck.</part>
</title> Gertz corresponded with both Harris and Viereck and
accumulated a large amount of research material pertaining to each, including
some of their original manuscripts, numerous autograph letters, and notes from
prominent literary figures. The Viereck research material includes one reel of
microfilm of original material not in the collection, letters and messages of
Sigmund Freud to Viereck. Other books by Gertz include
<title localtype="simple">
<part>A Handful of Clients,</part>
</title> a description of some of the
attorney's more interesting clients, and
<title localtype="simple">
<part>To Life,</part>
</title> an account of his personal and professional life.
</p>
<p>The
<ref target="misc" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Miscellany
</ref> series, 1789, 1860-1991, consists chiefly of
manuscripts and printed matter collected by Gertz, which complement material in
the
<ref target="sandw" show="new" actuate="onrequest">
Speeches and
Writings File
</ref> and pertain to his general research interests. Also
included in the series are papers relating to his academic career and his
awards and honors.</p>
<p> The
<ref target="add" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
Addition
</ref> series
supplements previous installments of the Gertz Papers and span the years
1921-1997, with the bulk concentrated from 1989-1996. The Addition includes
correspondence, memoranda, family papers, legal files, subject files, and
writings. The subject file, comprising almost half of the addition, reflects
Gertz’s affiliation with organizations such as the Blind Service
Association, the Caxton Club, and the Decalogue Society of Lawyers. Also
documented in the subject file is Gertz’s interest in writers Frank
Harris and George Sylvester Viereck and the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
The writings file in the Addition relates primarily to <emph render="italic">Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</emph> and the revised 1990 edition
of Gertz’s memoir
<title localtype="simple">
<part>To Life.</part>
</title> This file also includes a number of articles and
book reviews that Gertz wrote for

<p>The papers of <persname>
<part>Archibald MacLeish</part>
</persname> cover the period from 1907 to 1981, with the bulk of the material dated
between 1925 and 1970. Although MacLeish gave most of his literary manuscripts to <corpname>
<part>Yale University,</part>
</corpname> the <corpname>
<part>Library of Congress's</part>
</corpname> collection is particularly rich in its assemblage of correspondence
reflecting MacLeish's relationships with personal friends, literary colleagues, and
government associates and in its holdings of MacLeish's notebooks containing the origins
of some of his greatest poems. The papers also include notes, worksheets, and manuscript
drafts which detail the development of several of MacLeish's plays as well as document
the political and moral convictions which motivated the many speeches and radio
broadcasts he made both before and during World War II. Notes and manuscripts also exist
for a series of classroom lectures on the form and condition of modern poetry conducted
by MacLeish while serving as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at <corpname>
<part>Harvard University</part>
</corpname> from 1949 to 1962.</p>
<p>Few items remain for the period prior to 1923 when MacLeish left the <geogname>
<part>Boston</part>
</geogname> law firm where he was employed to live in <geogname>
<part>Europe,</part>
</geogname> devoting his time to reading, travel, and writing poetry. The earliest
material in the <ref target="corr" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref>
series is that between MacLeish and his father, <persname>
<part>Andrew,</part>
</persname> while MacLeish was a student at <corpname>
<part>Hotchkiss School</part>
</corpname> and <corpname>
<part>Yale University.</part>
</corpname> There are also several letters from MacLeish's brother, <persname>
<part>Kenneth,</part>
</persname> whose death in action during World War I greatly affected the poet. Of
additional interest are letters from personal friends, such as <persname>
<part>Robert Newton Linscott,</part>
</persname> editor at <corpname>
<part>Houghton Mifflin Company,</part>
</corpname> and <persname>
<part>Charles Rumford Walker,</part>
</persname> which reflect some of the personal and artistic struggles MacLeish
encountered during his years abroad.</p>
<p>MacLeish was one of a number of American literary expatriates living in <geogname>
<part>Europe</part>
</geogname> between the wars, enjoying the advantages of a favorable monetary exchange
rate and the camaraderie of sympathetic fellow artists and writers. Many of the
friendships which MacLeish made during the 1920's continued through later years, and the
<ref target="corr" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series
contains substantive letters from <persname>
<part>Kay Boyle,</part>
</persname>
<persname>
<part>Ernest Hemingway,</part>
</persname>
<persname>
<part>Gerald and Sara Murphy,</part>
</persname> and <persname>
<part>Ezra Pound.</part>
</persname> Incoming letters are also included in the <ref target="subj" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Subject File</ref> from those who, along with MacLeish, advocated
the release of <persname>
<part>Pound</part>
</persname> from <corpname>
<part>St. Elizabeth's Hospital,</part>
</corpname> the mental institution in <geogname>
<part>Washington, D.C.,</part>
</geogname> where the poet had been confined after he was declared incompetent to stand
trial for treason at the end of World War II. Other writers, artists, and scholars with
whom MacLeish corresponded include <persname>

</p>
<p>During the 1930's MacLeish became increasingly politicized and was outspoken in support
of an American commitment to protect the liberal democratic principles which he felt
were being threatened by the rise of fascism in <geogname>
<part>Europe.</part>
</geogname> Several of his verse plays for radio, such as <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Air Raid</part>
</title> (1938), <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>The American Story</part>
</title> (1944), and <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>The Fall of the City</part>
</title> (1937), illustrate these national or democratic themes. Material for these
dramatic voice productions is contained in the <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File</ref> series.</p>
<p>MacLeish more fully explicated his political philosophy in a series of prose pieces
written for various journals and magazines throughout the 1930s and 1940s as well as in
the many radio broadcasts and speeches he made during the same period. Notes and
manuscript drafts for the writings are contained in the <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File,</ref> while similar documents for the broadcasts
and speeches are located in the <ref target="speech" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Speeches and Lectures File.</ref> The latter series also contains copies and drafts
for speeches which MacLeish prepared for <persname>
<part>Franklin D. Roosevelt,</part>
</persname>
<persname>
<part>Edward R. Stettinius,</part>
</persname>
<persname>
<part>Harry S. Truman,</part>
</persname> and other government officials.</p>
<p>From 1929 to 1938 MacLeish worked as a writer and editor for <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Fortune</part>
</title> magazine, accepting the position from <persname>
<part>Henry Robinson Luce</part>
</persname> on the understanding that his commitment to the new publishing venture would
be limited to the extent that, having earned enough money to satisfy his needs, MacLeish
could return whenever he wished to his newly-purchased farm in <geogname>
<part>Conway, Massachusetts,</part>
</geogname> to work on his own writing. The <ref target="corr" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series contains a separate file for <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Fortune</part>
</title> magazine and MacLeish's correspondence with <persname>
<part>Henry Robinson Luce.</part>
</persname> Other colleagues and friends from the field of publishing with whom MacLeish
corresponded include <persname>

</p>
<p>In 1939, <persname>
<part>President Franklin D. Roosevelt</part>
</persname> persuaded a reluctant MacLeish to accept what proved to be a controversial
appointment as the ninth Librarian of Congress. MacLeish implemented a thorough
reorganization of the <corpname>
<part>Library's</part>
</corpname> administrative offices, published the <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress,</part>
</title> and established the Library's series of poetry readings. Because of his
managerial skills and political involvement, MacLeish was also asked to serve,
concurrent with his Library position, as director of the <corpname>
<part>Office of Facts and Figures</part>
</corpname> and assistant director of the <corpname>
<part>Office of War Information</part>
</corpname> from 1941 to 1944. In 1944, after his resignation from the <corpname>
<part>Library,</part>
</corpname> MacLeish was appointed assistant secretary of state for cultural affairs, in
which capacity he helped plan the establishment of the <corpname>
<part>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</part>
</corpname> Although the <ref target="subj" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Subject
File</ref> contains headings for these government agencies, none of the files
contains extensive amounts of material. Official documents produced by MacLeish in his
capacity as public servant are more likely to be represented in the central files or
archival records of the respective federal agency.</p>
<p>The <ref target="corr" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Correspondence</ref> series
contains correspondence and copies of memoranda with many of MacLeish's associates, as
well as with public figures, both in and out of government, whom MacLeish came to know
during the war years. Correspondents of interest include <persname>

<p>The <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File</ref> contains an
extensive set of notes for a series of classroom lectures which MacLeish delivered at <corpname>
<part>Harvard University</part>
</corpname> from 1949 to 1962. The purpose of these lectures was to provide a
theoretical and historical framework within which a student could analyze the structure
of modern poetry. MacLeish emphasized the influence of certain poets as pivotal to the
development of modern poetry, and the notes he kept are quite thorough, providing
insight into his teaching techniques.</p>
<p>With time afforded him after his retirement from public service, MacLeish published
several books of poetry, produced dramatic pieces for various media, and wrote prose
works, including social and political commentary. The <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File</ref> contains correspondence and manuscript
material for collections of poems such as <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Actfive</part>
</title> (1948) and <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>New and Collected Poems, 1917-1976</part>
</title> (1976). Although files related to the individual poems listed in this series
include some worthwhile records, many contain material of little value, in some cases
nothing more than copies of poems typewritten by MacLeish.</p>
<p>MacLeish continued to produce verse plays for stage, radio, and television, and the <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File</ref> contains important
material relating to these dramatic productions. Manuscript drafts and worksheets are
contained in the collection for MacLeish's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, <title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>J.B.</part>
</title> (1958). Similar material, including correspondence, is also included for other

<part>The Trojan Horse</part>

contained throughout the collection is the result of MacLeish's work habits. Describing
the state of disarray of a draft for one of his plays, MacLeish wrote that it “can't be
put together because I work like the crab retreating ten steps to go forward two and
thus getting nowhere.” <ref target="no.1" show="new" actuate="onrequest">(1)</ref>
</p>
<p>The greatest literary treasure of the collection is a set of notebooks kept by MacLeish
from 1919 through the 1940s located in the <ref target="lit" show="new" actuate="onrequest">Literary File.</ref> Containing drafts of much of his poetry and
prose, the notebooks help trace the creation and development of some of MacLeish's
finest work. They also include notes about his travels and readings and his reflections
about other writers and their conversations on literature.</p>
<p>A notebook kept by MacLeish in <geogname>

<p>The papers of
<persname>
<part>Julius Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967)</part>
</persname> span the
years 1921 to 1980 with the bulk of the material concentrated in the period
1947-1967, the years during which Oppenheimer was director of the
<corpname>
<part>Institute for Advanced Study</part>
</corpname> in
<geogname>
<part>Princeton, New Jersey.</part>
</geogname> The collection comprises
Oppenheimer's personal papers and relates only incidentally to his directorship
of the institute. The papers consist chiefly of correspondence,
<ref target="desk" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
desk books,
</ref>
printed copies of Oppenheimer's lectures, statements, and scientific notes,
supplemented by memoranda, inventories, photographs, and newspaper
clippings.</p>
<p>There was no major rearrangement of these papers; Oppenheimer's own
filing arrangement and cross-reference system were used wherever possible. He
once described the papers as a “hideously complete archive,” and they
document the many facets of his career. The collection includes material on
theoretical physics, the development of the atomic bomb, the relationship
between government and science, the organization of research on atomic energy,
control of atomic energy and its role in international affairs, security in
scientific fields, secrecy, loyalty, disarmament, the education of scientists
and international intellectual exchange, the moral responsibility of the
scientist, the relationship between science and culture, and the public
understanding of science.</p>
<p>Material in the collection prior to 1941 comprises two small groups of
scientific papers consisting chiefly of reprints of Oppenheimer's
<ref target="earlsci" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">
early
scientific writings
</ref> with galley proofs, holograph manuscripts by
associates, and miscellaneous notes. Correspondence containing scientific
calculations was written by such prominent physicists as

Library from the
<corpname>
<part>Atomic Energy Commission</part>
</corpname> chiefly concerning the
technical and administrative problems of atomic development from 1941 to 1953.
Scattered throughout the collection are letters of reminiscence and
Oppenheimer's comments on histories of the
<corpname>
<part> Los Alamos project</part>
</corpname> which reflect the spirit and
friendships developed during that period. </p>
<p>At the end of World War II, during Oppenheimer's activities as one of
the chief governmental advisers on atomic questions, he served on almost every
committee, both civilian and military, that dealt with the problems of atomic
energy. There is a considerable amount of correspondence documenting these
activities, but little material pertaining to his chairmanship of the
<corpname>
<part>Atomic Energy Commission's General Advisory
Committee</part>
</corpname> and the
<corpname>
<part>Committee on Atomic Energy of the Research and Development
Board.</part>
</corpname> The gap in this documentation is covered in part by lists and

other professional organizations, including the
<title localtype="simple" render="italic">
<part>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,</part>
</title> and the
reevaluation by universities of the growing role of science and government
within their own operations.</p>
<p>The control of atomic energy and its role in international affairs is
a major theme in these papers. Closely associated with these subjects is
<persname>
<part>Niels Bohr,</part>
</persname> a Danish physicist, whose letters and

<p>Following the revocation of his security clearance in 1954,
Oppenheimer traveled widely and lectured on physics and the interrelationship
of science and culture. The
<ref target="speech" show="replace" actuate="onrequest">

<corpname>
<part>Seven Springs Farm Conference</part>
</corpname> held at
<geogname>
<part>Mt. Kisco, New York,</part>
</geogname> in 1963. </p>
<p>Oppenheimer planned to write a history of theoretical physics in the
