         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The papers of Thomas Lowe Hughes (1925-) span the dates 1918-2018, with the bulk of
                the material dating from 1961 to 1991. The collection documents Hughes's career in
                United States politics and foreign policy, especially as an aide to United States
                politicians, Chester Bowles and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, as director of the
                Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and, later, as the
                president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The collection is
                organized into eight series: <ref target="Congress">United States Congress </ref>,
                    <ref target="State">Department of State</ref>, <ref target="Carnegie">Carnegie
                    Endowment for International Peace</ref>, <ref target="Correspondence">General
                    Correspondence</ref>, <ref target="Speeches">Speeches and Writings</ref>, <ref target="Boards">Boards and Associations </ref>, <ref target="Personal">Personal
                    File</ref>, and <ref target="Classified">National Security Classified
                    Information</ref>.</p>
         <p>The collection documents Hughes's interest and work in federal politics and foreign
                policy, much of which was informed by his early involvement with and leadership in
                the Student Federalists movement as a student at Carleton College and his travels
                throughout Europe as a Rhodes scholar in the immediate postwar period. His papers
                comprehensively cover the trajectory of his career in American foreign policy,
                beginning in the United States Congress as an administrative assistant to Chester
                Bowles and as legislative counsel to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, then moving into
                various leadership roles in the Department of State and, finally, the Carnegie
                Endowment for International Peace. Hughes's professional contacts, associations, and
                affiliations, many of which Hughes worked to foster and maintain for the duration of
                his career and beyond, feature prominently through correspondence and meeting notes,
                filed across several series and found throughout the collection.</p>
         <p>The collection’s series are listed and briefly described below. A fuller description
                of each series and a list of its contents can be accessed in the series descriptions
                within the container list.</p>
         <p>The <ref target="Congress">United States Congress</ref> series contains materials
                documenting Hughes's early career working as legislative counsel to Senator Hubert
                H. Humphrey (1955-1958) and his work as an administrative assistant to Congressman
                Chester Bowles (1959-1960), as well as his continued professional and personal
                associations with both throughout his career. </p>
         <p>The <ref target="State">Department of State</ref> series contains material
                documenting Hughes's positions with the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR)

         <p>The <ref target="Carnegie">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</ref> series
                spans the years 1948-2008, with the bulk of the material reflecting Hughes’s tenure
                as the organization’s president between 1971 and 1991. This series primarily
                contains records of major projects, events, and functions the endowment undertook
                under Hughes's tutelage. </p>
         <p>The <ref target="Correspondence">General Correspondence</ref> series was maintained
                as received and is arranged into three groupings: Alphabetical file, Chronological
                file, and Special signatures. The series primarily documents Hughes’s professional
                career in the Department of State and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
                with the majority reflecting Hughes’s years at the Carnegie Endowment. </p>
         <p>The <ref target="Speeches">Speeches and Writings</ref> series contains transcripts of
                speeches Hughes gave at a variety of professional and personal engagements,
                articles, and an extensive collection of notes pertaining to speech and article
                ideas, meetings, and other professional matters. </p>
         <p>The <ref target="Boards">Boards and Associations</ref> series documents Hughes’s
                involvement with various international affairs think tanks and nongovernmental
                organizations.</p>
         <p>The <ref target="Personal">Personal File</ref> contains material related to Hughes’s
                education, military service, and endeavors outside of his later professional
                career.</p>
         <p>The remaining series contains <ref target="Classified">National Security Classified
                    Information</ref> associated with Hughes's tenure with the Department of State
                and United States Congress as an aide to Hubert Humphrey and Chester Bowles.</p>

               <p>The United States Congress series contains materials documenting Hughes's
                        early career working as legislative counsel to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey
                        (1955-1958) and his work as an administrative assistant to Congressman
                        Chester Bowles (1959-1960), as well as his continued professional and
                        personal associations with both throughout his career. The series also
                        contains a limited amount of material documenting Hughes’s association with
                        Vice President Walter F. Mondale. The Chester Bowles material documents
                        Hughes’s work for Bowles's congressional office and campaigns, including
                        correspondence from constituents, drafts of books and articles Hughes edited
                        for Bowles, files documenting bills Bowles worked on, as well as his
                        platforms and policies. Bowles’s participation in John F. Kennedy’s 1960
                        presidential campaign and subsequent appointment to Kennedy’s administration
                        as undersecretary of state is well represented through copies of letters to
                        Kennedy. Replies from Kennedy are present to a lesser degree. Also featured
                        is material relating to Bowles's two appointments as United States
                        ambassador to India, including drafts of his book, <emph render="italic">Ambassador's Report</emph>, and correspondence to Hughes from his
                        second tenure as ambassador. The Hubert H. Humphrey material documents
                        Hughes’s work with Humphrey as well as his continued association until
                        Humphrey’s death in 1978 and Hughes’s involvement with Humphrey’s legacy
                        after his death. Materials cover Humphrey’s policies in the Senate, his
                        electoral campaigns, the inner workings of his Senate office, and, to a
                        limited degree, his vice presidency. The Walter F. Mondale material is
                        limited and consists of correspondence between Mondale and Hughes and
                        ephemera related to Mondale.</p>
               <p>Material types include correspondence, memoranda, notes, ephemera, writings,
                        drafts, and clippings. </p>

               <p>The Department of State series contains material documenting Hughes's
                        positions with the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and the United
                        States Embassy, London. The material ranging from 1961 to 1969 covers
                        Hughes’s time as the deputy director, then director of INR and includes
                        meeting notes, correspondence, briefings, and reports relating to the Cuban
                        Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and other issues relating to the Cold War.
                        Travel files document a 1963 trip Hughes took to Germany and England in
                        conjunction with John F. Kennedy’s European tour and a 1964 trip to India
                        and Pakistan resulting in a comprehensive debriefing on the Indian
                        subcontinent. Files also include material on departmental politics and
                        business, Senate hearings, and special study groups. The chronological files
                        of George C. Denney within the series document Denney’s time as deputy
                        director of INR (1963-1974), and cover many of the same topics. Material
                        also includes notes and articles written and collected by Hughes after his
                        tenure at INR that primarily reflect on INR’s role in world events. The
                        London Embassy files document Hughes’s professional activities as minister
                        and deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in London, England,
                        from 1969 to1970. During this time, Hughes served as the second in command
                        to Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg. These materials include correspondence,
                        speeches, schedules and guest lists for embassy events, notes, printed
                        matter, and clippings.</p>
               <p> Material types include correspondence, speeches, memoranda, notes, reports,
                        briefings, itineraries, and clippings. </p>

               <p>The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace series spans the years
                        1948-2008, with the bulk of the material reflecting Hughes’s tenure as the
                        organization’s president between 1971-1991. This series primarily contains
                        records of major projects, events, and functions the endowment undertook
                        under Hughes's tutelage. Major topics include the Arms Control Association,
                        Future of Arms Control panel, Face-to-Face communication program events, the
                        Mid-Atlantic Club, Board of Trustees meetings, and publication of <emph render="italic">Foreign Policy</emph> magazine. The bulk of the series
                        is formed by a subject file containing Hughes’s files regarding staff,
                        projects, contractors, and organizations with which the endowment regularly
                        collaborated. Many files contain Hughes’s notes and correspondence with
                        individuals regarding project ideas, statuses, and outcomes. Conferences and
                        meetings on the topics of foreign policy, nuclear arms, and United
                        States-Soviet relations, either sponsored by the endowment or attended by
                        Hughes, also feature prominently in the subject file and throughout the
                        series. Also of particular note are the files documenting the Board of
                        Trustees meetings. These files include planning materials for the
                        endowment’s biannual board meetings, meeting minutes, reports of the
                        president, and documents reflecting an extensive program review in 1987.
                        Also included are letters sent to the board regarding Alger Hiss’s position
                        as president of the organization in the wake of his accusation of espionage
                        in 1948. </p>
               <p>Material types include correspondence, notes, reports, and printed matter.

               <p>The General Correspondence series was maintained as received and is arranged
                        into three groupings: Alphabetical file, Chronological file, and Special
                        signatures. The series primarily documents Hughes’s professional career in
                        the Department of State and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, with
                        the majority reflecting Hughes’s years at the Carnegie Endowment and his
                        contacts with diplomats and dignitaries. Topics across the series largely
                        relate to business matters and include interoffice memos and routine
                        outgoing correspondence. Files regarding named correspondents in the
                        Alphabetical and Special signatures groupings often include contextual and
                        analytical notes supplied by Hughes and, at times, associated clippings,
                        printed matter, and other ephemera. Researchers should note that extensive
                        personal correspondence chronicling Hughes’s undergraduate and graduate
                        education and extracurricular activities is located in the <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="Personal">Personal

               <p>The Speeches and Writing series contains transcripts of speeches Hughes gave
                        at a variety of professional and personal engagements, articles, and an
                        extensive collection of notes pertaining to speech and article ideas,
                        meetings, and other professional matters. The speeches in this series span
                        the years 1954-2007 and represent engagements in which Hughes participated
                        while working for the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research and for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace as president
                        and president emeritus. The majority of the speeches are arranged
                        chronologically, with some arranged topically for specific functions where
                        Hughes spoke regularly, namely Mid-Atlantic Club meetings, Carnegie
                        Endowment Board of Trustees meetings, and gatherings of the Oxford-Cambridge
                        Association. The writings in this series are largely article adaptations of
                        Hughes’s speeches published in <emph render="italic">Foreign Affairs</emph>
                        magazine. Also included is material chronicling a preface Hughes wrote for
                        the Bureau of Intelligence and Research’s Vietnam study after it was
                        declassified in 2004. The notes in this series are extensive and cover a
                        wide variety of topics ranging from personal and professional meetings, to
                        impressions of projects, colleagues, and current events, and ideas for
                        article and speech content. Hughes's notes are filed across the collection
                        in multiple series. Other series with significant notes include the <ref target="State">Department of State</ref>, Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research file and <ref target="Carnegie">Carnegie Endowment for Intentional
                            Peace</ref> Subject file. </p>

               <p>The Boards and Associations series documents Hughes’s involvement with
                        various international affairs think tanks and nongovernmental organizations.
                        Hughes served on the boards of several institutions that aimed to conduct
                        foreign policy research and to strengthen diplomatic relations between the
                        United States and its Western allies. Several of these boards and
                        associations specifically focus on United States-German relations. Major
                        topics include the global economy, German reunification, international
                        security and defense, the recruitment and selection of new board members,
                        fundraising and grants, and logistics for meetings, conferences, and
                        lectures.</p>
               <p>Material types include correspondence, meeting minutes, notes, reports,
                        conference programs, and clippings.</p>

               <p>The Personal File contains material related to Hughes’s education, military
                        service, and endeavors outside of his later professional career.
                        Correspondence written and received by Hughes while an undergraduate at
                        Carleton College (1943-1947), a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College,
                        University of Oxford (1947-1949), law student at Yale Law School
                        (1949-1952), and lieutenant in the Air Force (1953-1954) comprises the
                        majority of the series. Major topics include Hughes’s involvement with the
                        Student Federalists movement, especially as national president from 1944 to
                        1945, travels around Europe in the postwar period, work with the Foundation
                        for World Government in ʻEn ha-Shofeṭ, Israel, in the summer of 1950, and
                        early work as a law student with the Senate Subcommittee on Labor and Labor
                        Management Relations in the summer of 1951. Letters across the series
                        feature Hughes's parents, Evan Raymond Hughes and Alice Lowe Hughes,
                        friends, and contacts from the Student Federalists movement. The
                        correspondence in this series was maintained as received and is organized by

                        at a given time. Researchers should note that many topics and
                        correspondents, namely contacts associated with the Student Federalists
                        movement, are spread across the series. Researchers should also consult
