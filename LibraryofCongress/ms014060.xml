         <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
         <p>The papers of Lewis Varick Frissell (who was known throughout his life as Varick
            Frissell) span the years 1917-1970, with the greatest portion of the material dated
            1925-1931. The diary, correspondence, writings, and business papers of these years
            reflect a short but intense career of arctic exploration, writing, and documentary and
            feature film making. Earlier papers are Frissell's juvenilia (mostly fiction), and later
            papers are those of his family. The collection is organized by type of material. </p>
         <p>Frissell's expedition to the Unknown River region of Labrador in 1925 resulted in his
            discovery of the Lower Twin Falls of that river and in the first photograph of the Grand
            Falls on the Hamilton River (now Churchill River and Falls). The journey is documented
            in the diary, correspondence, and articles in the collection. This and subsequent
            explorations in Labrador earned Frissell election as a Fellow of the Royal Geographic
            Society and as a member of the Explorer's Club. </p>
         <p>Much of the general correspondence and most of the business papers, as well as the
            scripts and related papers in the collection, pertain to the two feature films produced
            by Frissell. <title>

                        </title>(1928), a silent documentary, was
            written, produced, and photographed by Frissell while he worked as a sealer off the
            Labrador coast in 1927. <title>
                           <part>The Viking</part>
                        </title> (1931), the first feature-length sound
            film produced entirely on location, was written and produced by Frissell and was
            directed by George Melford. The writings file in the collection includes synopses for
            both films and scripts, continuity notes, and a negative film record for <title>
                           <part>The
               Viking.</part>
                        </title> Distribution contracts and agreements, schedules of showings for both
            films, and copies of correspondence between third parties about these arrangements are
            included in the business papers. </p>
         <p>In addition to the papers related to motion pictures, the writings contain numerous
            articles on Labrador and the Arctic, reflecting Frissell's interest in the promotion and
            development of the region. Other writings include Frissell's fictional pieces and his
            poetry. </p>
         <p>The largest sequence of general correspondence is between Frissell and Sir Wilfred
            Thomason Grenfell and his philanthropic organization, the International Grenfell
            Association. Grenfell, with whom Frissell had stayed on his first and on many later
            visits to the North, was a well-known medical missionary to the Eskimos of Labrador.
            Other prominent correspondents are Robert Joseph Flaherty, the noted documentarist, and
            George Allan England, whose story "Vikings of the Ice" Frissell adapted for <title>
                           <part>The
               Viking. </part>
                        </title>
                     </p>
         <p>Family correspondence in the papers contains letters to and from Frissell and his
            father, Lewis Fox Frissell, regarding Frissell's plans for and experiences on his
            northern journeys. A large portion of the correspondence of Frissell's father relates to
            the search for Frissell that was instituted during the spring of 1931, after the ship on
            which he was retaking some scenes for <title>
                           <part>The Viking </part>
                        </title>exploded. Frissell was
            never found, but the search for him is closely chronicled in telegrams and letters, as
            well as newspaper clippings in the subject file and in scrapbooks. </p>
         <p>The much later, 1965-1970, correspondence of Toni Frissell in the family correspondence
            reflects her attempts to ascertain and publicize the facts of her brother's career.
            Several of these letters contain enclosures that are copies of Frissell's correspondence
            with his lawyers and with the Royal Geographic Society.</p>
