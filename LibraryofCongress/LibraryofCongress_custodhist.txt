<p>[From <title localtype="simple">
<part>Index to the Chester A. Arthur Papers</part>
</title> (Washington, D.C.: 1961), pp. v-vii]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be sure that I am as interested as you are in having the Arthur papers
finally come to rest in the Library of Congress. The ones that I have in my
possession have travelled a good deal—over to Europe, back to Colorado, California,
and now here [New York]. During his lifetime, my father would never let anyone see
them—not even me. When they finally came into my possession, I was amazed that there
were so few. At my father's funeral in Albany, or rather at the interment of his
ashes which took place several months after his death [July 17, 1934], I enquired of
all the cousins there assembled—the nieces and nephews of my grandfather, as to what
had happened to the bulk of the papers. Charles E. McElroy, the son of Mary Arthur
McElroy who was my grandfather's First Lady, tells me that the day before he died, my
grandfather caused to be burned three large garbage cans, each at least four feet
high, full of papers which I am sure would have thrown much light on history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> So wrote Chester A. Arthur III to Dr. Thomas P. Martin, then Acting Chief of the
Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, on April 15, 1938. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot1">[1]</ref>
</p>
<p>For many years President Arthur was represented in the Manuscript Division by a single
document, a letter he had written during the Civil War and which the Library purchased
in 1902. Beginning in 1910 and continuing to the present, successive chiefs of the
division have done what they could do to assemble surviving Arthur manuscripts. For the
first of these chiefs, Gaillard Hunt, who in that year initiated the search for the main
body of the Arthur Papers, there was little but discouragement as a result of his
inquiries. However, his persistence and what he was able to learn were to encourage his
successors. He wrote first to Col. William G. Rice and learned the address of Mrs. John
E. McElroy, Arthur's sister and official hostess during his administration. Mr. Hunt
wrote to her and learned from her that Chester A. Arthur, Jr., controlled the papers.
After several attempts, Mr. Hunt learned Mr. Arthur's address and wrote to him. The
reply—written on March 13, 1915, five years after the search began—provided the first
concrete but frustrating evidence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I beg you will excuse my tardiness in replying to your letter of November 4th [1914].
The question of my father's papers is a very sore subject with me.</p>
<p>These papers were supposed to be in certain chests which were stored on their receipt
from Washington, in the cellar of 123 Lexington Avenue. After my father's death, they
were removed, I believe, by direction of the executors to a store house recommended
by Mr. McElroy at Albany. Several years ago on making my residence in Colorado, I
sent for these chests of papers and found in them nothing but custom house records of
no particular value or importance. Where the papers they were supposed to contain
have vanished, is a mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Three years later, in 1918, the Library acquired, as a loan, its second Arthur
document, the draft of his veto message of the Fitz-John Porter bill. Arthur H. Masten,
a nephew of the President, had not inherited the document but had received it as a gift
from the widow of Adrian H. Joline, in whose autograph collection it had been found.
Masten's heirs have given the Library of Congress title to this manuscript. </p>
<p>The Library renewed its inquiries in various quarters from time to time with no
significant result until Charles Moore, in 1924, while Acting Chief of the Manuscript
Division, wrote a long letter to John H. Finley of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>New York Times.</part>
</title>
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot2">[2]</ref> As a result, Dr. Finley
published in the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Times</part>
</title> an editorial plea for Arthur manuscripts, but there was no immediate response.
Other inquiries were made to: J. Stanley-Brown, who had been President James A.
Garfield's secretary and who had also served Arthur briefly; Charles M. Hendley, a
former White House executive clerk, who provided some personal recollections; Rudolph
Forster, in 1924 executive clerk at the White House; Elihu Root and Robert T. Lincoln;
and the County Clerk of New York County, N.Y., who provided a copy of Arthur's will; and
various others. </p>
<p>In June 1925 Louise Reed Mitchell, the daughter of Arthur's secretary, James C. Reed,
informed the Librarian of Congress that she had inherited some 50 Arthur manuscripts.
She sold these to the Library. The Librarian's <title localtype="simple">
<part>Annual Report</part>
</title> for 1925, p. 56-57, reviewed the search and the results up to that time and
assessed the collection as "neither extensive nor are the documents themselves of high
historical importance; but a gap in the records of the presidency has been filled in as
satisfactory a manner as is possible." </p>
<p>In 1938 a fresh trail, opened up by a suggestion made by Jeannette P. Nichols, led to
President Arthur's grandson, part of whose reply introduces this essay. In the same
year, as a result of an exchange of letters with the Library, Mr. Arthur deposited 90 of
the more important documents he had in his possession. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot3">[3]</ref> These manuscripts, together with an
additional 470 documents which had remained in his possession, were sold to the Library
in 1958. </p>
<p>It was fortunate that the greatly augmented but still small collection reached its
present size soon after the Congress authorized and directed the Librarian of Congress
to arrange, microfilm, and index the Arthur and 22 other collections of Presidential
Papers. Before the filming and indexing had been completed, further additions were
received. Twelve letters written by Arthur in the 1850's were given by the noted
collector, Charles A. Feinberg. </p>
<p>Another major segment of the Arthur Papers is available because of a friendship that
began during the Civil War. Robert G. Dun and Chester A. Arthur were business associates
and personal friends in New York City for at least a quarter of a century. Both were
members of the Union League Club in New York. Arthur served as counsel for The
Mercantile Agency, as Dun's company was called, for two decades. Fortunately for all who
may interest themselves in the career of Arthur, Owen A. Sheffield, retired Secretary of
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., presented photocopies or typed copies accompanied by
annotations, of all known documents in the files of the company relating to Arthur. The
gift was made in 1959 with the consent and the cooperation of J. Wilson Newman,
president of Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Many of these documents have particular value. A
letter written by Dun to the manager of his Pittsburgh office on June 1, 1870, for
example, contains a spirited description of Arthur's character, written long before
anyone guessed that he would be the 21st President of the United States. </p>
<p>Also in 1959, Robert S. Macfarlane, president of the Northern Pacific Railway, kindly
supplied copies of several telegrams and related material which add to the records
concerning Arthur's trip to Yellowstone Park in 1883. A few other documents and copies
of documents complete one of the smallest of the 23 groups of Presidential Papers in the
Library. The number of items is 1,413 and they are bound in 12 volumes. The microfilm
reproduction of these was released to the public in 1960. </p>
<p>There remains the matter of the large number of lost Arthur manuscripts. Letters written
by Arthur to others and preserved in their papers, together with copies of their letters
to him, offer a sampling of what the Arthur Papers once contained. The photocopies of
letters from the files of Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Series 2) are useful for this purpose
and so, to a lesser degree, are transcripts and references (Series 3) to Arthur papers
in other collections. </p>
<p>An example may be cited of what is known to have existed. Arthur kept journals while on
a trip with Henry D. Gardiner in 1857. The two young men spent 4 months touring the West
as far as Kansas and Minnesota. Ward Burlingame, a Kansas newspaper reporter,
interviewed Arthur 26 years later when he was about to depart for the West again, this
time to Yellowstone Park. The published interview records all that has been found with
reference to the journals: "The travels of the two extended over some four months, and
the president could not recall, without access to his papers, packed away in his New
York house, the names of all the places at which they stopped. By the way, it occurs to
me that the complete journals of this trip, carefully kept by the principal traveler,
would prove a veritable bonanza to the writer fortunate enough to get hold of them."

</p>
<p>Inasmuch as many of President Arthur's papers have been destroyed, searchers may wish to
examine the personal papers of his contemporaries in the Library of Congress and
elsewhere for information about him and his times. The personal papers or autograph
collections in the Library of Congress listed below contain varying numbers of letters
by, to, or relating to President Arthur: </p>

<p>[From <title localtype="simple">
<part>Index to the James Monroe Papers</part>
</title> (Washington, D.C.: 1963), pp. v-xi]</p>
<p>When James Monroe retired from the Presidency on March 4, 1825, he returned to Oak Hill,
his estate in Loudoun County, Va. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot1">[1]</ref> In the years that followed, his attempts to pay his debts and to better
his financial condition must have required the steady use of a great many of the papers
he had accumulated during his long years of public service, particularly those which
could further the investigation of his accounts that he had asked Congress to make.
Annotations on many of the papers give evidence that Monroe made some attempt to
organize them; this was doubtless done during the years of his retirement. </p>
<p>To stimulate action by Congress he wrote a long paper on his "unsettled claims" in the
summer of 1826 and sent it to Gales and Seaton in Washington for publication. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot2">[2]</ref> The following year he
undertook the preparation of two additional papers which he hoped would raise money
through sales. The first of these was a comparison of the Government of the United
States with other, older, republics; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot3">[3]</ref> the second was his autobiography. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot4">[4]</ref>
</p>
<p>Another means of raising money was suggested to him in correspondence with Nicholas P.
Trist, who wrote him on January 27, 1828, from Monticello: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose you have kept copies of all yr. letters to Mr. J[efferson].—There are among
them numerous evid[en]ces of the pure disinterestedness of yr. course, &amp; of the
fact that in taking those steps wh. launched you irrevocably on the sea of public
life, you were actuated solely by devotion to yr. country, to the well understood
disparagemt. of yr. individual interests. That you may reap a reward somewhat
commensurate with these sacrifices is with me more a wish than a hope. Will you
permit me to ask however whether you cd. not at once avail yourself of the value of
yr. papers, by pledging the proceeds of their future public[atio]n, in
consid[eratio]n of a loan? If I mistake not, such a measure would be far from
unexampled; wd. it be impracticable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In Monroe's reply, on February 8, he wrote: "I have examined my papers, and find that I
have, as I believe, all the letters, that were ever written to me by Mr. Jefferson. The
first bears date in 1780, while I was reading the law under him. . . . I have copies,
but I am satisfied, that I have not, of a fifth, of them I wrote him." He offered to
send Jefferson's letters to Thomas Jefferson Randolph if he would be gratified to
possess them, an offer that was apparently not accepted, and he added: "Your suggestion
as to the sale of my papers, or pledge of them, merits attention." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot5">[5]</ref>
</p>
<p>Monroe's study of republics and his autobiography were incomplete, and his claims before
Congress were still unresolved, when Mrs. Monroe died in September 1830. Two months
later financial difficulties and ill health forced him to leave Oak Hill and to make his
home with his younger daughter, Maria, and her husband, Samuel L. Gouverneur, in New
York City. The latter was acting as Monroe's agent in dealing with the several
committees of Congress investigating his claims, and for this purpose Monroe had
supplied his son-in-law with selections from his papers from time to time, as shown in
letters exchanged by the two men. In addition to papers that might already have been in
New York, it is reasonable to suppose that Monroe took with him when he left Virginia
such papers as he would need to continue work on his autobiography. Nevertheless, an
undetermined number of his papers were at Oak Hill when Monroe died in New York City on
July 4, 1831. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot6">[6]</ref>
</p>
<p>In his will, Samuel L. Gouverneur was named "sole and exclusive executor" and was asked
to care for Monroe's older daughter Elizabeth, whose husband, Judge George Hay, had died
the previous autumn. The Monroe papers were mentioned somewhat obliquely in the
following provision: ". . . with respect to the works in which I am engaged and leave
behind, I commit the care and publication of them to my son in law Samuel L. Gouvernieur
[<emph render="italic">sic</emph>], giving to him one third of the profits arising
therefrom for his trouble in preparing them for publication, one third to my daughter
Maria and one third to my daughter Elizabeth." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot7">[7]</ref>
</p>
<p>In the first month of Gouverneur's proprietorship of the papers, he lent a small number
to John Quincy Adams, who was to deliver a eulogy to Monroe in Boston at the invitation
of the city government. On July 19, Gouverneur wrote: "As a means of affording you all
the interesting details of Mr. Monroe's early life, in the most ample form, and with the
greatest precision, I have taken the liberty to enclose you the first 60 or 70 sheets of
a sketch prepared by himself, &amp; which together with all his other interesting
papers, he entrusted to my special charge. . . . With the history of his life for the
later years, you are well acquainted. He has left copious notes &amp; a most extensive
correspondence but he was prevented by death, from completing that portion of his
career, even in the shape, which the present has assumed." Apparently he sent additional
papers a week later, because Adams, in a letter of August 30, wrote that he was
returning "the papers transmitted to me with your letter of the 26th. ulto." and added
that "The manuscript of Mr. Monroe shall be returned in the course of a few days—By a
private hand if an opportunity should present itself. Before the end of the week I hope
to forward a printed Copy of the Eulogy." </p>
<p>Early the following year Richard Rush, writing from York, Pa., asked Gouverneur to
return the personal letters he had written to Monroe while he was minister to England:
"I wrote often to him, and with a freedom that would not have been justifiable in my
public despatches. . . . It is on this account that I should be glad to have them in my
possession, lest by any chances hereafter any portion of them should come to be mixed up
with his manuscripts . . . and in that way run the risk of publicity." The nature of
Gouverneur's reply is suggested by the next letter he received from Rush: "Its obliging
sentiments . . . leave me no anxiety on the score of the private and confidential
letters alluded to. . . . if any parts of them can, in the judgement of others, be made
subsidiary to the better understanding of any of Mr. Monroe's services, there is no
scruple even that I would not forego on my part; so much did I honor him as a statesman,
revere him as a patriot, and love him as a man. At the same time the promise you are so
good as to give that no use will be made of any paper from me without my approbation . .
. is a relief." </p>
<p>Gouverneur was again reminded of his responsibilities as custodian of the Monroe papers
three years later, when he received an anonymous letter written by "A Virginian" in
"Alexandria, District of Columbia," on June 11, 1835: ". . . the character of your
illustrious kinsman is already marked a victim for the sacrifice. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me implore you as you revere his name and reverence his memory—let me intreat you
as patriot and an honorable man—let me caution you as you value your own reputation
hold on to every scrap of writing that may be in your possession in any manner
connected with his private or public life—preserve every paper that concerns him, for
as you life [<emph render="italic">sic</emph>], if you respect his memory you will
have use for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently Gouverneur did some work toward preparing the papers for publication during
the 1830's and a manuscript relating to Monroe, which he started to write, is said to
have survived. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot8">[8]</ref> He was
busy with other pursuits, however—he was Postmaster of New York City from 1828 to 1836
and part owner of the Bowery Theatre there—and he seems not to have found work on the
Monroe papers a congenial occupation. Nevertheless there is no evidence that he was
ready to accept the offer of help he received from Barnabus Bates of New York City, who,
in a letter of February 13, 1839, agreed to prepare and publish a memoir on Monroe "upon
terms which shall be mutually advantageous and satisfactory." Bates had heard through
Commodore Charles Goodwin Ridgely, then in charge of the Navy Yard at New York, that
Gouverneur possessed "a very interesting correspondence between Presdts. Jefferson and
Monroe in relation to the Gun Boat system recommended by the former," and he suggested
that Gouverneur "procure while in Virginia any papers necessary to accomplish the
object."</p>
<p> In contrast Gouverneur took positive action in regard to the papers during the
following decade. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Kortright Hay, Monroe's older daughter, died in 1840 and in the same year
Samuel and Maria Gouverneur moved from New York City to Washington, where they lived in
the De Menou buildings on H Street. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot9">[9]</ref> They also spent periods of each year at Oak Hill. Gouverneur
worked in the Consular Bureau of the Department of State from 1844 to 1849, when he
resigned because of the "afflicted state" of his family and because a promised
advancement had not materialized. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot10">[10]</ref>
</p>
<p>It must have been about the time he entered Government service that Gouverneur became
acquainted with Henry O'Reilly (or O'Rielly, as he later spelled his name), a vigorous
young man who had been editor of the <title localtype="simple">
<part>Rochester Daily Advertiser</part>
</title> in Rochester, N.Y., and who was active in many causes. According to a long,
rather rambling memorandum O'Reilly wrote many years later, Gouverneur first tried to
persuade him to occupy the farm at Oak Hill and to assist in disposing of the property,
and later Gouverneur sought his help in connection with the Monroe papers: "In the
course of our acquaintance Mr. Gouverneur suggested to me, <emph render="italic">without
any solicitation on my part,</emph> that he &amp; others wished me to take charge
&amp; control of the Ex-President's records &amp; other Papers with a view to the
Publication of <emph render="italic">A Selection from those papers along with a memoir
of Mr. Monroe &amp;c</emph> in case it should be found that a sale of the whole mass
could not be made to the Government. . . . <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot11">[11]</ref>
</p>
<p>Gouverneur did indeed turn over to O'Reilly what appears to have been in the major part
of the Monroe papers, probably in 1844 or 1845. In the latter year O'Reilly also entered
into a contract with Samuel F. B. Morse and Amos Kendall to raise capital for telegraph
lines from Eastern Pennsylvania to St. Louis and the Great Lakes, and his work in this
connection must have left him little time to give to the Monroe papers. Even their exact
location during the mid-1840's is uncertain although glancing references in some of his
letters make it likely that O'Reilly deposited them somewhere in New York City while his
work of erecting telegraph lines took him from place to place. Samuel L. Gouverneur
himself seems not to have known where they were being stored. His concern is evident in
a letter he wrote to O'Reilly on May 17, 1847, in which he also outlined terms for the
treatment of the papers: "I should have written you before—but from the uncertainty
where a letter would find you—I see by the papers (notices of arrivals, etc.) that you
are in New York [actually this letter was forwarded to Philadelphia]. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I propose in reply to yours that we should divide the proceeds—first deducting 1/8 to
be allowed to the Estate of Mr. Monroe. This is on the supposition that the Heirs at
law might expect something, &amp; I should agree to fix the sum at that. I also wish
it stipulated that the entire control of published matter in reference to Mr. Monroe
should be vested in me—I mean that no papers should be published without my assent
first had. This I consider just &amp; right, especially as some matter might refer to
questions of a personal or delicate nature. Let me have your reply to the above. </p>
<p>I hope you have the papers all in a place of perfect security as I value them very
highly, &amp; would be unwilling to run the risk of loss or accident to them—when
will you be this way—I should be glad to have a talk with you. . . ." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not having heard from O'Reilly, Gouverneur wrote again nearly five months later, on
October 14, asking him to drop a line and "<emph render="italic">assure me</emph>
respecting which, I feel some anxiety, that all my papers, are safely deposited, where
no accident can befall them." This letter apparently reached O'Reilly in Cincinnati,
Ohio. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot12">[12]</ref>
</p>
<p>The first and apparently only substantial use that was made of the Monroe Papers while
they were in Gouverneur's custody occurred the following year. Gouverneur requested
O'Reilly to make transcripts of a number of papers for Senator James D. Westcott, Jr.,
of Florida, and he himself lent the Senator a parcel of original manuscripts he had
retained. The texts or references to these were incorporated in Westcott's speech of
July 25, 1848, on the territorial government of Oregon. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot13">[13]</ref>

<p>The stalemate on making effective arrangements to publish or sell the Monroe papers
seems finally to have been broken in 1848. Doubtless an important factor in this matter
was the purchase made by the Government that year of papers of James Madison (a second
segment), of Alexander Hamilton, and of Thomas Jefferson. On December 14, Richard Smith,
the executor of Elizabeth K. Hay's estate, agreed to accept one-eighth of the proceeds
of any publication or sale (rather than the one-third share specified in James Monroe's
will) provided the estate was exonerated from any costs connected with the transactions.
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot14">[14]</ref> This was followed
on December 28 by a formal agreement between Samuel L. Gouverneur and Henry O'Reilly, by
which any profits resulting from publication of the papers would be divided so as to
give three-eighths to O'Reilly, one-eighth to the estate of President Monroe, and
four-eighths to Gouverneur. If, however, the papers were sold for not less than $20,000,
O'Reilly was to get thirty percent of the proceeds and to pay one-third of this amount
to Eliab Kingman and others assisting in the sale, while Gouverneur was to get the other
seventy percent and to pay from this sum one-eighth of the entire proceeds to the estate
of James Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot15">[15]</ref>
</p>
<p>Upon completion of these arrangements Gouverneur addressed a petition to Congress on
January 1, 1849, asking aid from the Government in publishing the manuscript papers of
James Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot16">[16]</ref>
Presented by Senator John A. Dix of New York on January 3, the petition was ordered to
be printed and referred to the Committee on the Library. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot17">[17]</ref> Gouverneur apparently learned later
that month that the Congress preferred to purchase the manuscripts rather than subscribe
to their publication, and at this point O'Reilly, through an agent, formally
relinquished his rights under the contract with Gouverneur so that the purchase could
proceed without complication. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot18">[18]</ref> On February 28 the Senate, by a vote of 28 to 20, approved the purchase
of the Monroe papers for $20,000. On March 2 the House concurred in an amendment
proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means that the purchase be limited to papers not
of a private character; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot19">[19]</ref> and on the following day it was enacted, as part of the act making
appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of Government for the year ending
June 30, 1850, that "the manuscript books and papers of the late James Monroe" be
purchased for the above amount and be deposited in the Department of State. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot20">[20]</ref> On March 13 Gouverneur
signed an indenture of bargain and sale of "all the said Manuscript Books &amp; Papers
of the said <emph render="italic">James Monroe,</emph> together with all copyright,
title, interest, property, claim &amp; demand whatsoever of, in, and to the same," and
on the same day the transaction was completed when Secretary of State John M. Clayton
signed a receipt for the material and First Auditor William Collins signed a certificate
that the sum of $20,000 was payable to Samuel L. Gouverneur as executor of the estate of
James Monroe." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot21">[21]</ref>
</p>
<p>Historian James Schouler was perhaps the first person to use the Monroe papers for
historical research while they were in the Department of State. In 1882 he described
them as "a huge mass of interesting matter relative to our earlier national history,
which lies unassorted in the Department of State and for whose editorial supervision and
publication it is to be fervently hoped that Congress will some day make suitable
provision." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot22">[22]</ref>
</p>
<p>This situation was rectified when Congress, by acts approved March 2, 1889, and August
30, 1890, appropriated money for the repair, mounting, and binding of the papers. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot23">[23]</ref> They were arranged in
two chronological series (one comprising manuscripts by Monroe, the other manuscripts
addressed or referred to him) and were bound in 22 volumes. A calendar of the papers,
which reflected the two series but with entries arranged alphabetically by writer of
each manuscript, was prepared and published by the Department of State in preliminary
form in 1889 and in a corrected edition in 1893. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot24">[24]</ref> Seven years later the Librarian of the Department of State
prepared a seven-volume unofficial edition of the writings of Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot25">[25]</ref>
</p>
<p>As a result of an Executive Order of March 9, 1903, the Monroe Papers were transferred
to the Library of Congress. The 22 volumes were received in the Manuscript Division on
November 5, 1903, and were associated with two letterbooks (now designated as Series 3
of the papers), which had been acquired by the Library from an undetermined source some
time before 1898. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot26">[26]</ref>
Less than a year after their receipt, the Library published a chronological list of the
papers which had been received by transfer (slightly more than 2,650 manuscripts), the
items included in the letterbooks, and a few Monroe manuscripts located in other
collections in the Library. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot27">[27]</ref>
</p>
<p>At this point in the story it is necessary to consider the papers which were deemed to
be of a "private character," and which were therefore retained by Samuel L. Gouverneur. </p>
<p>Maria Monroe Gouverneur died on June 20, 1850, at Oak Hill. She was survived by her
husband and three children, a daughter Elizabeth and two sons, Samuel L. Gouverneur,
Jr., and James Monroe Gouverneur. In 1852 Oak Hill, the former Monroe estate, was sold
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot28">[28]</ref> and at some time
during the following year Samuel L. Gouverneur married Mary Digges Lee, a granddaughter
of Governor Thomas Sim Lee. The couple made their home at the Lee estate of Needwood,
near Petersville, Md., and Gouverneur, who was presumably custodian of the remaining
Monroe papers, died there on September 29, 1865. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot29">[29]</ref> His will, filed among records of the Orphan's Court of
Frederick County, Md., shows that he bequeathed his entire estate to the second Mrs.
Gouverneur. </p>
<p>Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., brought an action of replevin against Mrs. Mary Digges Lee
Gouverneur in the Circuit Court of Frederick County in 1866 to recover his mothers'
patrimony. The record of this case, which was decided in his favor in October 1868,
shows that he sought the return of furniture, paintings, and other household ornaments.
The Monroe papers were not mentioned. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot30">[30]</ref> One may assume, moreover, from the preface to his edition
of Monroe's <title localtype="simple">
<part>The People the Sovereigns</part>
</title> (1867) that he had only this one manuscript from his grandfather's papers and
that it had been in his possession for some years. Nevertheless, three years after his
death in 1880, there appeared a published reference to an important segment of Monroe
papers which were then in the possession of his widow, Mrs. Marian Campbell Gouverneur.
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot31">[31]</ref> This lends
credence to the family tradition that several hundred Monroe papers were found in secret
compartments of the desk on which the address that incorporated the Monroe Doctrine was
signed. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot32">[32]</ref>
</p>
<p>Some time before 1889 these papers were deposited in the Department of State, where a
calendar of them was prepared. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot33">[33]</ref> They had evidently been returned to Mrs. Gouverneur by 1892; Acting
Secretary of State William F. Wharton referred to the "Gouverneur collection" as having
been in her possession when he complied with a Senate request of February 3, 1892, for
information about unpublished Monroe papers. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot34">[34]</ref>
</p>
<p>Former President Rutherford B. Hayes called the attention of the Librarian of Congress
to Mrs. Gouverneur's manuscripts in 1888 <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot35">[35]</ref> and on two occasions (in 1902 and from 1922 to 1927) the
entire group was deposited in the Library with a view to purchase and for safekeeping.
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot36">[36]</ref> Purchase was not
effected. </p>
<p>Prior to the death of Mrs. Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., the "Gouverneur collection" of
Monroe papers was given to her three daughters, Maud Campbell Gouverneur, Mrs. Rose
Gouverneur Hoes, and Mrs. Ruth Monroe Johnson. It was kept as a unit until the death of
Mrs. Hoes, after which a division was made. Mrs. Hoes' share was divided between her two
sons, Gouverneur and Laurence Gouverneur Hoes, and the latter also was given the share
inherited by his aunt, Maud C. Gouverneur. Mrs. Johnson gave her share to her son,
Monroe Johnson. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot37">[37]</ref>
</p>
<p>That portion of the "Gouverneur collection" which came into the possession of Laurence
G. Hoes is now in the James Monroe Memorial Library in Fredericksburg, Va. He has
generously allowed the Library to make photocopies of this group and these now comprise
Series 2 of the Library's Monroe papers. The portion which had belonged to Major
Gouverneur Hoes (205 manuscripts) was purchased by the Library from his widow, Mrs.
Gourley Edwards Hoes, in 1950; these papers have been interfiled in the chronologically
arranged Series 1, where they can be identified by the legend "Ac. 9405" on the lower
left corner of the first page of each document. Of the one-third share of the original
"Gouverneur collection" given to Monroe Johnson the Library purchased a total of 184
pieces from him in 1931 ("Ac. 4167A" appears on the first page of each of these
manuscripts, filed in Series 1); and in 1932 Mr. Johnson deposited what was presumably
the remainder of his holding of Monroe papers—95 manuscripts—in the Library of the
College of William and Mary. </p>
<p>The Monroe papers that remained at Needwood when Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., died in 1865
became the property of his widow, Mrs. Mary Digges Lee Gouverneur. It has not been
possible to determine the exact number of manuscripts that composed this segment,
although there is evidence that it was considerably larger than the segment that formed
the "Governeur collection." </p>
<p>Three months after Mrs. Gouverneur died at Needwood on October 4, 1898, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot38">[38]</ref> a part of the Monroe
papers she owned was mentioned in correspondence between her nephew, John Lambert
Cadwalader of New York, and the executor of her estate, Charles O'Donnell Lee of
Baltimore, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot39">[39]</ref> Mrs.
Gouverneur's nephew. On January 11, 1899, the former wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . When the papers to which I referred in a previous letter, were received by me,
now two or three years ago, I intended to have them examined by an expert, and there
was some sort of an understanding that something should be done with them in so far
as they were of a public character. One or two documents were given away with Mrs.
Gouverneur's consent, not of any particular value, and I had it in mind to suggest to
her some distribution of the papers in one or two public places, leaving, as she
expressed it to me, some considerable part for yourself. </p>
<p>However nothing was done, nor were the papers during her lifetime ever entirely
examined by any experts. I have since had the papers examined, through Dr. Billings,
the Director of the New York Public Library, and I enclose his memorandum [in which
the papers were valued at $750]. . . .</p>
<p>Of course, these papers, although a part of the papers of my uncle, Mr. Gouverneur,
and which he received from Mr. Monroe, are, nevertheless, a part of Mrs. Gouverneur's
estate, and I do not know what disposition you propose to make of them. Should you
desire on behalf of Mrs. Gouverneur's estate to sell all of the papers, I would be
glad to take them, so that Mr. Monroe's papers would find a proper resting place. . .
.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Lee decided that as executor he should first examine the papers "in their relation to
many more I have here," and they were returned to him for that purpose. After going over
them, however, he decided to accept Cadwalader's offer and wrote on January 24 that he
was returning the package "contents exactly as rec'd!" The latter presented them that
year to the New York Public Library, of which he was a trustee. The manuscripts in the
gift were estimated to number about 1,200. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot40">[40]</ref>
</p>
<p>The "many more" papers Charles O'Donnell Lee retained are reported to have been divided
into five portions, one going to each of the five Lee children who survived their
parents. Two of the portions have since been acquired by Laurence Gouverneur Hoes, and
the originals, like the other Monroe papers that he received, are now in the James
Monroe Memorial Library and reproductions are in Series 2 of the Monroe Papers in the
Library of Congress. </p>
<p>A number of important manuscripts that once were part of the Monroe Papers have at some
time or times been separated from the segment retained by the family. Among these are
Monroe's diary notes dating from March 1804 to May 1805 and his letterbook for the
period from November 1804 to May 1805, which are now in the New York Public Library.
<ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot41">[41]</ref> In addition to the
two letterbooks mentioned above, the Library of Congress has acquired from various
sources during this century, by purchase and gift, a volume containing Monroe's diary
notes dating from June 1794 to July 1796 (with additional notes for 1801-2) and an
account of his expenses from 1794 to 1802, as well as the recipients' copies of eighteen
letters to Monroe and four brief memoranda in his hand.</p>
<p> The Library modified the arrangement of the Monroe Papers made by the Department of
State by combining the two chronological series into one chronology (which included the
segment acquired from Monroe Johnson in 1931) and the correspondence was rebound, in 37
volumes, in 1941. </p>
<p>As part of the Library's program to ensure safety of its most valuable manuscript
holdings during World War II, the entire body of Monroe Papers was removed from
Washington in December 1941 and stored in the Alderman Library of the University of
Virginia until 1944, when the group was returned to Washington under the direction of
Alvin W. Kremer, then Keeper of the Collections. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot42">[42]</ref>
</p>
<p>During 1958-60 the arrangement of the manuscripts—which now number 3,821—was studied and
perfected and a microfilm of the Monroe Papers in this arrangement was released in
November 1960, so that greater accessibility of the material would be ensured.</p>
