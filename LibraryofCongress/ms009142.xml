         <p>The James Monroe Papers were arranged, indexed, and microfilmed in 1958-1960. Subsequent
            additions were arranged and described in 1979, and a finding aid to the additions was
            revised and expanded in 1985 and 1996. In 2009 the finding aid was expanded by including
            description of the main collection from the published index. The 2014 addition
            incorporated microfilm made in 1952 and an accession from 2001. The finding aid was also
            revised and expanded in 2014. The finding aid was updated in 2023 by Maria Farmer as
            part of a division-wide remediation project by the Inclusive Description Working

               <part>Index to the James Monroe Papers</part>
            </title> (Washington, D.C.: 1963), pp. v-xi]</p>
         <p>When James Monroe retired from the Presidency on March 4, 1825, he returned to Oak Hill,
            his estate in Loudoun County, Va. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot1">[1]</ref> In the years that followed, his attempts to pay his debts and to better
            his financial condition must have required the steady use of a great many of the papers
            he had accumulated during his long years of public service, particularly those which
            could further the investigation of his accounts that he had asked Congress to make.
            Annotations on many of the papers give evidence that Monroe made some attempt to
            organize them; this was doubtless done during the years of his retirement. </p>
         <p>To stimulate action by Congress he wrote a long paper on his "unsettled claims" in the
            summer of 1826 and sent it to Gales and Seaton in Washington for publication. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot2">[2]</ref> The following year he
            undertook the preparation of two additional papers which he hoped would raise money
            through sales. The first of these was a comparison of the Government of the United
            States with other, older, republics; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot3">[3]</ref> the second was his autobiography. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot4">[4]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Another means of raising money was suggested to him in correspondence with Nicholas P.
            Trist, who wrote him on January 27, 1828, from Monticello: </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>I suppose you have kept copies of all yr. letters to Mr. J[efferson].—There are among
               them numerous evid[en]ces of the pure disinterestedness of yr. course, &amp; of the
               fact that in taking those steps wh. launched you irrevocably on the sea of public
               life, you were actuated solely by devotion to yr. country, to the well understood
               disparagemt. of yr. individual interests. That you may reap a reward somewhat
               commensurate with these sacrifices is with me more a wish than a hope. Will you
               permit me to ask however whether you cd. not at once avail yourself of the value of
               yr. papers, by pledging the proceeds of their future public[atio]n, in
               consid[eratio]n of a loan? If I mistake not, such a measure would be far from
               unexampled; wd. it be impracticable?</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p> In Monroe's reply, on February 8, he wrote: "I have examined my papers, and find that I
            have, as I believe, all the letters, that were ever written to me by Mr. Jefferson. The
            first bears date in 1780, while I was reading the law under him. . . . I have copies,
            but I am satisfied, that I have not, of a fifth, of them I wrote him." He offered to
            send Jefferson's letters to Thomas Jefferson Randolph if he would be gratified to
            possess them, an offer that was apparently not accepted, and he added: "Your suggestion
            as to the sale of my papers, or pledge of them, merits attention." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot5">[5]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Monroe's study of republics and his autobiography were incomplete, and his claims before
            Congress were still unresolved, when Mrs. Monroe died in September 1830. Two months
            later financial difficulties and ill health forced him to leave Oak Hill and to make his
            home with his younger daughter, Maria, and her husband, Samuel L. Gouverneur, in New
            York City. The latter was acting as Monroe's agent in dealing with the several
            committees of Congress investigating his claims, and for this purpose Monroe had
            supplied his son-in-law with selections from his papers from time to time, as shown in
            letters exchanged by the two men. In addition to papers that might already have been in
            New York, it is reasonable to suppose that Monroe took with him when he left Virginia
            such papers as he would need to continue work on his autobiography. Nevertheless, an
            undetermined number of his papers were at Oak Hill when Monroe died in New York City on
            July 4, 1831. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot6">[6]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>In his will, Samuel L. Gouverneur was named "sole and exclusive executor" and was asked
            to care for Monroe's older daughter Elizabeth, whose husband, Judge George Hay, had died
            the previous autumn. The Monroe papers were mentioned somewhat obliquely in the
            following provision: ". . . with respect to the works in which I am engaged and leave
            behind, I commit the care and publication of them to my son in law Samuel L. Gouvernieur
               [<emph render="italic">sic</emph>], giving to him one third of the profits arising
            therefrom for his trouble in preparing them for publication, one third to my daughter
            Maria and one third to my daughter Elizabeth." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot7">[7]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>In the first month of Gouverneur's proprietorship of the papers, he lent a small number
            to John Quincy Adams, who was to deliver a eulogy to Monroe in Boston at the invitation
            of the city government. On July 19, Gouverneur wrote: "As a means of affording you all
            the interesting details of Mr. Monroe's early life, in the most ample form, and with the
            greatest precision, I have taken the liberty to enclose you the first 60 or 70 sheets of
            a sketch prepared by himself, &amp; which together with all his other interesting
            papers, he entrusted to my special charge. . . . With the history of his life for the
            later years, you are well acquainted. He has left copious notes &amp; a most extensive
            correspondence but he was prevented by death, from completing that portion of his
            career, even in the shape, which the present has assumed." Apparently he sent additional
            papers a week later, because Adams, in a letter of August 30, wrote that he was
            returning "the papers transmitted to me with your letter of the 26th. ulto." and added
            that "The manuscript of Mr. Monroe shall be returned in the course of a few days—By a
            private hand if an opportunity should present itself. Before the end of the week I hope
            to forward a printed Copy of the Eulogy." </p>
         <p>Early the following year Richard Rush, writing from York, Pa., asked Gouverneur to
            return the personal letters he had written to Monroe while he was minister to England:
            "I wrote often to him, and with a freedom that would not have been justifiable in my
            public despatches. . . . It is on this account that I should be glad to have them in my
            possession, lest by any chances hereafter any portion of them should come to be mixed up
            with his manuscripts . . . and in that way run the risk of publicity." The nature of
            Gouverneur's reply is suggested by the next letter he received from Rush: "Its obliging
            sentiments . . . leave me no anxiety on the score of the private and confidential
            letters alluded to. . . . if any parts of them can, in the judgement of others, be made
            subsidiary to the better understanding of any of Mr. Monroe's services, there is no
            scruple even that I would not forego on my part; so much did I honor him as a statesman,
            revere him as a patriot, and love him as a man. At the same time the promise you are so
            good as to give that no use will be made of any paper from me without my approbation . .
            . is a relief." </p>
         <p>Gouverneur was again reminded of his responsibilities as custodian of the Monroe papers
            three years later, when he received an anonymous letter written by "A Virginian" in
            "Alexandria, District of Columbia," on June 11, 1835: ". . . the character of your
            illustrious kinsman is already marked a victim for the sacrifice. </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>Let me implore you as you revere his name and reverence his memory—let me intreat you
               as patriot and an honorable man—let me caution you as you value your own reputation
               hold on to every scrap of writing that may be in your possession in any manner
               connected with his private or public life—preserve every paper that concerns him, for
               as you life [<emph render="italic">sic</emph>], if you respect his memory you will
               have use for them.</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Apparently Gouverneur did some work toward preparing the papers for publication during
            the 1830's and a manuscript relating to Monroe, which he started to write, is said to
            have survived. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot8">[8]</ref> He was
            busy with other pursuits, however—he was Postmaster of New York City from 1828 to 1836
            and part owner of the Bowery Theatre there—and he seems not to have found work on the
            Monroe papers a congenial occupation. Nevertheless there is no evidence that he was
            ready to accept the offer of help he received from Barnabus Bates of New York City, who,
            in a letter of February 13, 1839, agreed to prepare and publish a memoir on Monroe "upon
            terms which shall be mutually advantageous and satisfactory." Bates had heard through
            Commodore Charles Goodwin Ridgely, then in charge of the Navy Yard at New York, that
            Gouverneur possessed "a very interesting correspondence between Presdts. Jefferson and
            Monroe in relation to the Gun Boat system recommended by the former," and he suggested
            that Gouverneur "procure while in Virginia any papers necessary to accomplish the
            object."</p>
         <p> In contrast Gouverneur took positive action in regard to the papers during the
            following decade. </p>
         <p>Elizabeth Kortright Hay, Monroe's older daughter, died in 1840 and in the same year
            Samuel and Maria Gouverneur moved from New York City to Washington, where they lived in
            the De Menou buildings on H Street. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot9">[9]</ref> They also spent periods of each year at Oak Hill. Gouverneur
            worked in the Consular Bureau of the Department of State from 1844 to 1849, when he
            resigned because of the "afflicted state" of his family and because a promised
            advancement had not materialized. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot10">[10]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>It must have been about the time he entered Government service that Gouverneur became
            acquainted with Henry O'Reilly (or O'Rielly, as he later spelled his name), a vigorous
            young man who had been editor of the <title localtype="simple">
               <part>Rochester Daily Advertiser</part>
            </title> in Rochester, N.Y., and who was active in many causes. According to a long,
            rather rambling memorandum O'Reilly wrote many years later, Gouverneur first tried to
            persuade him to occupy the farm at Oak Hill and to assist in disposing of the property,
            and later Gouverneur sought his help in connection with the Monroe papers: "In the
            course of our acquaintance Mr. Gouverneur suggested to me, <emph render="italic">without
               any solicitation on my part,</emph> that he &amp; others wished me to take charge
            &amp; control of the Ex-President's records &amp; other Papers with a view to the
            Publication of <emph render="italic">A Selection from those papers along with a memoir
               of Mr. Monroe &amp;c</emph> in case it should be found that a sale of the whole mass
            could not be made to the Government. . . . <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot11">[11]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Gouverneur did indeed turn over to O'Reilly what appears to have been in the major part
            of the Monroe papers, probably in 1844 or 1845. In the latter year O'Reilly also entered
            into a contract with Samuel F. B. Morse and Amos Kendall to raise capital for telegraph
            lines from Eastern Pennsylvania to St. Louis and the Great Lakes, and his work in this
            connection must have left him little time to give to the Monroe papers. Even their exact
            location during the mid-1840's is uncertain although glancing references in some of his
            letters make it likely that O'Reilly deposited them somewhere in New York City while his
            work of erecting telegraph lines took him from place to place. Samuel L. Gouverneur
            himself seems not to have known where they were being stored. His concern is evident in
            a letter he wrote to O'Reilly on May 17, 1847, in which he also outlined terms for the
            treatment of the papers: "I should have written you before—but from the uncertainty
            where a letter would find you—I see by the papers (notices of arrivals, etc.) that you
            are in New York [actually this letter was forwarded to Philadelphia]. </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>I propose in reply to yours that we should divide the proceeds—first deducting 1/8 to
               be allowed to the Estate of Mr. Monroe. This is on the supposition that the Heirs at
               law might expect something, &amp; I should agree to fix the sum at that. I also wish
               it stipulated that the entire control of published matter in reference to Mr. Monroe
               should be vested in me—I mean that no papers should be published without my assent
               first had. This I consider just &amp; right, especially as some matter might refer to
               questions of a personal or delicate nature. Let me have your reply to the above. </p>
            <p>I hope you have the papers all in a place of perfect security as I value them very
               highly, &amp; would be unwilling to run the risk of loss or accident to them—when
               will you be this way—I should be glad to have a talk with you. . . ." </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Not having heard from O'Reilly, Gouverneur wrote again nearly five months later, on
            October 14, asking him to drop a line and "<emph render="italic">assure me</emph>
            respecting which, I feel some anxiety, that all my papers, are safely deposited, where
            no accident can befall them." This letter apparently reached O'Reilly in Cincinnati,
            Ohio. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot12">[12]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>The first and apparently only substantial use that was made of the Monroe Papers while
            they were in Gouverneur's custody occurred the following year. Gouverneur requested
            O'Reilly to make transcripts of a number of papers for Senator James D. Westcott, Jr.,
            of Florida, and he himself lent the Senator a parcel of original manuscripts he had
            retained. The texts or references to these were incorporated in Westcott's speech of
            July 25, 1848, on the territorial government of Oregon. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot13">[13]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>The stalemate on making effective arrangements to publish or sell the Monroe papers
            seems finally to have been broken in 1848. Doubtless an important factor in this matter
            was the purchase made by the Government that year of papers of James Madison (a second
            segment), of Alexander Hamilton, and of Thomas Jefferson. On December 14, Richard Smith,
            the executor of Elizabeth K. Hay's estate, agreed to accept one-eighth of the proceeds
            of any publication or sale (rather than the one-third share specified in James Monroe's
            will) provided the estate was exonerated from any costs connected with the transactions.
               <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot14">[14]</ref> This was followed
            on December 28 by a formal agreement between Samuel L. Gouverneur and Henry O'Reilly, by
            which any profits resulting from publication of the papers would be divided so as to
            give three-eighths to O'Reilly, one-eighth to the estate of President Monroe, and
            four-eighths to Gouverneur. If, however, the papers were sold for not less than $20,000,
            O'Reilly was to get thirty percent of the proceeds and to pay one-third of this amount
            to Eliab Kingman and others assisting in the sale, while Gouverneur was to get the other
            seventy percent and to pay from this sum one-eighth of the entire proceeds to the estate
            of James Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot15">[15]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Upon completion of these arrangements Gouverneur addressed a petition to Congress on
            January 1, 1849, asking aid from the Government in publishing the manuscript papers of
            James Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot16">[16]</ref>
            Presented by Senator John A. Dix of New York on January 3, the petition was ordered to
            be printed and referred to the Committee on the Library. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot17">[17]</ref> Gouverneur apparently learned later
            that month that the Congress preferred to purchase the manuscripts rather than subscribe
            to their publication, and at this point O'Reilly, through an agent, formally
            relinquished his rights under the contract with Gouverneur so that the purchase could
            proceed without complication. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot18">[18]</ref> On February 28 the Senate, by a vote of 28 to 20, approved the purchase
            of the Monroe papers for $20,000. On March 2 the House concurred in an amendment
            proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means that the purchase be limited to papers not
            of a private character; <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot19">[19]</ref> and on the following day it was enacted, as part of the act making
            appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of Government for the year ending
            June 30, 1850, that "the manuscript books and papers of the late James Monroe" be
            purchased for the above amount and be deposited in the Department of State. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot20">[20]</ref> On March 13 Gouverneur
            signed an indenture of bargain and sale of "all the said Manuscript Books &amp; Papers
            of the said <emph render="italic">James Monroe,</emph> together with all copyright,
            title, interest, property, claim &amp; demand whatsoever of, in, and to the same," and
            on the same day the transaction was completed when Secretary of State John M. Clayton
            signed a receipt for the material and First Auditor William Collins signed a certificate
            that the sum of $20,000 was payable to Samuel L. Gouverneur as executor of the estate of
            James Monroe." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot21">[21]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Historian James Schouler was perhaps the first person to use the Monroe papers for
            historical research while they were in the Department of State. In 1882 he described
            them as "a huge mass of interesting matter relative to our earlier national history,
            which lies unassorted in the Department of State and for whose editorial supervision and
            publication it is to be fervently hoped that Congress will some day make suitable
            provision." <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot22">[22]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>This situation was rectified when Congress, by acts approved March 2, 1889, and August
            30, 1890, appropriated money for the repair, mounting, and binding of the papers. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot23">[23]</ref> They were arranged in
            two chronological series (one comprising manuscripts by Monroe, the other manuscripts
            addressed or referred to him) and were bound in 22 volumes. A calendar of the papers,
            which reflected the two series but with entries arranged alphabetically by writer of
            each manuscript, was prepared and published by the Department of State in preliminary
            form in 1889 and in a corrected edition in 1893. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot24">[24]</ref> Seven years later the Librarian of the Department of State
            prepared a seven-volume unofficial edition of the writings of Monroe. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot25">[25]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>As a result of an Executive Order of March 9, 1903, the Monroe Papers were transferred
            to the Library of Congress. The 22 volumes were received in the Manuscript Division on
            November 5, 1903, and were associated with two letterbooks (now designated as Series 3
            of the papers), which had been acquired by the Library from an undetermined source some
            time before 1898. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot26">[26]</ref>
            Less than a year after their receipt, the Library published a chronological list of the
            papers which had been received by transfer (slightly more than 2,650 manuscripts), the
            items included in the letterbooks, and a few Monroe manuscripts located in other
            collections in the Library. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot27">[27]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>At this point in the story it is necessary to consider the papers which were deemed to
            be of a "private character," and which were therefore retained by Samuel L. Gouverneur. </p>
         <p>Maria Monroe Gouverneur died on June 20, 1850, at Oak Hill. She was survived by her
            husband and three children, a daughter Elizabeth and two sons, Samuel L. Gouverneur,
            Jr., and James Monroe Gouverneur. In 1852 Oak Hill, the former Monroe estate, was sold
               <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot28">[28]</ref> and at some time
            during the following year Samuel L. Gouverneur married Mary Digges Lee, a granddaughter
            of Governor Thomas Sim Lee. The couple made their home at the Lee estate of Needwood,
            near Petersville, Md., and Gouverneur, who was presumably custodian of the remaining
            Monroe papers, died there on September 29, 1865. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot29">[29]</ref> His will, filed among records of the Orphan's Court of
            Frederick County, Md., shows that he bequeathed his entire estate to the second Mrs.
            Gouverneur. </p>
         <p>Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., brought an action of replevin against Mrs. Mary Digges Lee
            Gouverneur in the Circuit Court of Frederick County in 1866 to recover his mothers'
            patrimony. The record of this case, which was decided in his favor in October 1868,
            shows that he sought the return of furniture, paintings, and other household ornaments.
            The Monroe papers were not mentioned. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot30">[30]</ref> One may assume, moreover, from the preface to his edition
            of Monroe's <title localtype="simple">
               <part>The People the Sovereigns</part>
            </title> (1867) that he had only this one manuscript from his grandfather's papers and
            that it had been in his possession for some years. Nevertheless, three years after his
            death in 1880, there appeared a published reference to an important segment of Monroe
            papers which were then in the possession of his widow, Mrs. Marian Campbell Gouverneur.
               <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot31">[31]</ref> This lends
            credence to the family tradition that several hundred Monroe papers were found in secret
            compartments of the desk on which the address that incorporated the Monroe Doctrine was
            signed. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot32">[32]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Some time before 1889 these papers were deposited in the Department of State, where a
            calendar of them was prepared. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot33">[33]</ref> They had evidently been returned to Mrs. Gouverneur by 1892; Acting
            Secretary of State William F. Wharton referred to the "Gouverneur collection" as having
            been in her possession when he complied with a Senate request of February 3, 1892, for
            information about unpublished Monroe papers. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot34">[34]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>Former President Rutherford B. Hayes called the attention of the Librarian of Congress
            to Mrs. Gouverneur's manuscripts in 1888 <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot35">[35]</ref> and on two occasions (in 1902 and from 1922 to 1927) the
            entire group was deposited in the Library with a view to purchase and for safekeeping.
               <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot36">[36]</ref> Purchase was not
            effected. </p>
         <p>Prior to the death of Mrs. Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., the "Gouverneur collection" of
            Monroe papers was given to her three daughters, Maud Campbell Gouverneur, Mrs. Rose
            Gouverneur Hoes, and Mrs. Ruth Monroe Johnson. It was kept as a unit until the death of
            Mrs. Hoes, after which a division was made. Mrs. Hoes' share was divided between her two
            sons, Gouverneur and Laurence Gouverneur Hoes, and the latter also was given the share
            inherited by his aunt, Maud C. Gouverneur. Mrs. Johnson gave her share to her son,
            Monroe Johnson. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot37">[37]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>That portion of the "Gouverneur collection" which came into the possession of Laurence
            G. Hoes is now in the James Monroe Memorial Library in Fredericksburg, Va. He has
            generously allowed the Library to make photocopies of this group and these now comprise
            Series 2 of the Library's Monroe papers. The portion which had belonged to Major
            Gouverneur Hoes (205 manuscripts) was purchased by the Library from his widow, Mrs.
            Gourley Edwards Hoes, in 1950; these papers have been interfiled in the chronologically
            arranged Series 1, where they can be identified by the legend "Ac. 9405" on the lower
            left corner of the first page of each document. Of the one-third share of the original
            "Gouverneur collection" given to Monroe Johnson the Library purchased a total of 184
            pieces from him in 1931 ("Ac. 4167A" appears on the first page of each of these
            manuscripts, filed in Series 1); and in 1932 Mr. Johnson deposited what was presumably
            the remainder of his holding of Monroe papers—95 manuscripts—in the Library of the
            College of William and Mary. </p>
         <p>The Monroe papers that remained at Needwood when Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr., died in 1865
            became the property of his widow, Mrs. Mary Digges Lee Gouverneur. It has not been
            possible to determine the exact number of manuscripts that composed this segment,
            although there is evidence that it was considerably larger than the segment that formed
            the "Governeur collection." </p>
         <p>Three months after Mrs. Gouverneur died at Needwood on October 4, 1898, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot38">[38]</ref> a part of the Monroe
            papers she owned was mentioned in correspondence between her nephew, John Lambert
            Cadwalader of New York, and the executor of her estate, Charles O'Donnell Lee of
            Baltimore, <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot39">[39]</ref> Mrs.
            Gouverneur's nephew. On January 11, 1899, the former wrote:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>. . . When the papers to which I referred in a previous letter, were received by me,
               now two or three years ago, I intended to have them examined by an expert, and there
               was some sort of an understanding that something should be done with them in so far
               as they were of a public character. One or two documents were given away with Mrs.
               Gouverneur's consent, not of any particular value, and I had it in mind to suggest to
               her some distribution of the papers in one or two public places, leaving, as she
               expressed it to me, some considerable part for yourself. </p>
            <p>However nothing was done, nor were the papers during her lifetime ever entirely
               examined by any experts. I have since had the papers examined, through Dr. Billings,
               the Director of the New York Public Library, and I enclose his memorandum [in which
               the papers were valued at $750]. . . .</p>
            <p>Of course, these papers, although a part of the papers of my uncle, Mr. Gouverneur,
               and which he received from Mr. Monroe, are, nevertheless, a part of Mrs. Gouverneur's
               estate, and I do not know what disposition you propose to make of them. Should you
               desire on behalf of Mrs. Gouverneur's estate to sell all of the papers, I would be
               glad to take them, so that Mr. Monroe's papers would find a proper resting place. . .

         <p> Lee decided that as executor he should first examine the papers "in their relation to
            many more I have here," and they were returned to him for that purpose. After going over
            them, however, he decided to accept Cadwalader's offer and wrote on January 24 that he
            was returning the package "contents exactly as rec'd!" The latter presented them that
            year to the New York Public Library, of which he was a trustee. The manuscripts in the
            gift were estimated to number about 1,200. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot40">[40]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>The "many more" papers Charles O'Donnell Lee retained are reported to have been divided
            into five portions, one going to each of the five Lee children who survived their
            parents. Two of the portions have since been acquired by Laurence Gouverneur Hoes, and
            the originals, like the other Monroe papers that he received, are now in the James
            Monroe Memorial Library and reproductions are in Series 2 of the Monroe Papers in the
            Library of Congress. </p>
         <p>A number of important manuscripts that once were part of the Monroe Papers have at some
            time or times been separated from the segment retained by the family. Among these are
            Monroe's diary notes dating from March 1804 to May 1805 and his letterbook for the
            period from November 1804 to May 1805, which are now in the New York Public Library.
               <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot41">[41]</ref> In addition to the
            two letterbooks mentioned above, the Library of Congress has acquired from various
            sources during this century, by purchase and gift, a volume containing Monroe's diary
            notes dating from June 1794 to July 1796 (with additional notes for 1801-2) and an
            account of his expenses from 1794 to 1802, as well as the recipients' copies of eighteen
            letters to Monroe and four brief memoranda in his hand.</p>
         <p> The Library modified the arrangement of the Monroe Papers made by the Department of
            State by combining the two chronological series into one chronology (which included the
            segment acquired from Monroe Johnson in 1931) and the correspondence was rebound, in 37
            volumes, in 1941. </p>
         <p>As part of the Library's program to ensure safety of its most valuable manuscript
            holdings during World War II, the entire body of Monroe Papers was removed from
            Washington in December 1941 and stored in the Alderman Library of the University of
            Virginia until 1944, when the group was returned to Washington under the direction of
            Alvin W. Kremer, then Keeper of the Collections. <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="foot42">[42]</ref>
         </p>
         <p>During 1958-60 the arrangement of the manuscripts—which now number 3,821—was studied and
            perfected and a microfilm of the Monroe Papers in this arrangement was released in
            November 1960, so that greater accessibility of the material would be ensured.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content Note for Additions to the Collection</head>
         <p> Additions to the papers of James Monroe (1758-1831) are organized as <ref show="replace" actuate="onrequest" target="series4">Series 4, Addenda</ref>. They
            include correspondence, photocopies and typescripts of correspondence, property and
            financial records, and miscellaneous documents dated from 1778 to 1831 and arranged in
            subseries by the year the addition was processed. </p>
         <p>The 1979-1985 addition is arranged in four parts. Part A includes original letters from
            Monroe to William Benton, James Bowdoin, Henry Dearborn, Lord Thomas Erskine, Richard H.
            Henderson, David Humphreys, Thomas Law, John Francis Mercer, Edmund Randolph, Spencer
            Roane, and others. A letter from William Wirt is the only letter written to Monroe in
            this portion. Part B contains photocopies of correspondence, a diary, and miscellaneous
            documents. The bulk of the photocopied correspondence consists of negative copies of
            manuscripts owned by the United States Military Academy at West Point. Part D,
            Miscellany, includes index cards that, in conjunction with a State Department pamphlet,
            form a calendar to the Monroe papers in the collection of Mary Digges Lee
            Gouverneur.</p>
         <p>The 1996 addition includes a letter to Andrew Jackson and property and financial notes
            arranged by type of material.</p>
         <p>The 2014 addition consists of a pardon for Nancy Swann, an African American woman, who
            had been convicted of petty larceny and fined and imprisoned in the District of
            Columbia. She had been in the Washington jail over twelve months because she was unable
            to pay the fine. The pardon is signed by President James Monroe and Secretary of State
            John Quincy Adams. Two microfilms of original manuscripts owned by Laurence Gouverneur
            Hoes have also been placed in the 2014 addition.</p>
