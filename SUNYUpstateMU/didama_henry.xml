         <p>Henry Darwin Didama (1823-1905) was born in Perryville on June 17, 1823. His father and
            grandfather, John and Simon Didama, came from Delft, Holland with the Holland Company to
            settle in Trenton, NY and both worked as doctors. Henry attended Cazenovia Seminary and
            was a teacher during the winter of 1840-1841. He began practicing medicine in the office
            of Doctor David A. Moore of Cazenovia and continued under Doctor Nelson A. Powers of
            Syracuse. He studied at the Geneva College of Medicine and the Albany Medical School,
            the latter of which he graduated from in 1846 at the age of 23. He then settled in
            Romulus, where he remained for 5 years and studied under Enos Smith Vail. At this time,
            he met and married Sarah Miller, the daughter of Honorable Sherman Miller. Henry came to
            Syracuse in 1851, and in 1874 he bought the Wescott homestead on South Salina Street and
            made that his office and home for the remainder of his life. The family had three
            children; Henry Darwin Jr., who died in infancy; Sherman, who died when a medical
            student; and Amelia, who married William M. Niven and completed a medical course at
            Syracuse and assisted her father, but died in 1893 from typhoid fever in Florida.</p>
         <p>With the establishment of the Medical College in 1872, he was elected as Professor of
            Clinical Medicine, and in 1873, he was made Professor of the Principles and Practice of
            Medicine and Clinical Medicine, which he served as until his resignation in 1893. After
            the death of Dean Frederick Hyde in 1888, he was elected Dean of the College of Medicine
            and received the degree of LL.D. from Syracuse University that same year. In 1894, he
            was elected Trustee at Large of Syracuse University, which he served as until his death.
            In addition, he wrote under the nom de plume Amos Cottle about his observations of
            foreign customs and people in letters to the local press. He most notably served as
            president of the Onondaga County Medical Society, the Syracuse City Medical Society, the
            Central New York Medical Association, the Medical Society of the State of New York, the
            New York Medical Association, and the Syracuse Academy of Medicine, and Vice President
            of the American Medical Association before his death on October 4, 1905.</p></bioghist>
