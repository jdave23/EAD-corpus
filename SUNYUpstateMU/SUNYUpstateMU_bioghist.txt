<p>Henry Darwin Didama (1823-1905) was born in Perryville on June 17, 1823. His father and
grandfather, John and Simon Didama, came from Delft, Holland with the Holland Company to
settle in Trenton, NY and both worked as doctors. Henry attended Cazenovia Seminary and
was a teacher during the winter of 1840-1841. He began practicing medicine in the office
of Doctor David A. Moore of Cazenovia and continued under Doctor Nelson A. Powers of
Syracuse. He studied at the Geneva College of Medicine and the Albany Medical School,
the latter of which he graduated from in 1846 at the age of 23. He then settled in
Romulus, where he remained for 5 years and studied under Enos Smith Vail. At this time,
he met and married Sarah Miller, the daughter of Honorable Sherman Miller. Henry came to
Syracuse in 1851, and in 1874 he bought the Wescott homestead on South Salina Street and
made that his office and home for the remainder of his life. The family had three
children; Henry Darwin Jr., who died in infancy; Sherman, who died when a medical
student; and Amelia, who married William M. Niven and completed a medical course at
Syracuse and assisted her father, but died in 1893 from typhoid fever in Florida.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the Medical College in 1872, he was elected as Professor of
Clinical Medicine, and in 1873, he was made Professor of the Principles and Practice of
Medicine and Clinical Medicine, which he served as until his resignation in 1893. After
the death of Dean Frederick Hyde in 1888, he was elected Dean of the College of Medicine
and received the degree of LL.D. from Syracuse University that same year. In 1894, he
was elected Trustee at Large of Syracuse University, which he served as until his death.

degree from Syracuse University and his M.D. from the Syracuse University College of
Medicine in 1926. Shortly after his graduation, Ferguson was appointed as an instructor
of Pathology in 1927, made Assistant Professor in 1929, Professor in 1942, and Chairman
in 1950. He also taught courses in the Medical Jurisprudence Department until it was
absorbed by the Department of Public Health and Preventative Medicine in 1954. In
addition to his teaching contributions, Ferguson played key roles in the future of the
institution. In 1933, he helped to plan and design the Basic Sciences Building. In the
late 1940’s, he compiled a report for a State Committee, persuading them to transform
the Syracuse University College of Medicine to what is now SUNY Upstate Medical
University. He taught at SUNY Upstate Medical University until his retirement in 1968.

<p>Seymour Fisher (1922-1996) was born on May 13, 1922 in Baltimore, MD. He earned his PhD in Psychology in 1948 at the University of
Chicago. In 1961 he became a professor at SUNY Health Science Center in Syracuse, NY (now named SUNY Upstate Medical University) and
taught in the College of Medicine for 34 years. He was a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, and headed
the psychology research program. While at SUNY Upstate Medical University he conducted several research studies on nurses with Rorschach
ink blot tests. His research also included topics of psychology, pharmacology, body image, Freudian analysis, humor, and female sexuality;
the last of which drew a large general audience. His research into psychoactive drugs scrutinized drug companies that released drugs
(like anti-depressants) onto the market before having put them through rigorous, scientific testing. He also worked with colleagues around
the country, including Dr. Sidney E. Cleveland, David Mendell, and Dr. Roger P. Greenberg (a colleague in Syracuse). Dr. Fisher wrote
several books (19 in total published). He also published about 200 research articles.</p>
<p>His wife, Dr. Rhoda Fisher, was a clinical psychologist and had a private practice in child psychology in Manlius, NY. She and Seymour
researched the psychology of humor and wrote at least two books together (<emph render="italic">Pretend the World is Funny and Forever: A Psychological Analysis
of Comedians, Clowns, and Actors</emph>, 1982; and <emph render="italic">The Psychology of Adaptation to Absurdity: Tactics of Make-Believe</emph>, 1993). Their work put
them into contact with comedians like Kaye Ballard, Sid Caesar, and Jackie Mason.</p>
<p>Dr. Fisher died of a heart attack on December 5, 1996 at the age of 74. He was living in Manlius, NY at the time.</p></bioghist>
