<p>This collection contains the papers of John H. Ferguson (1902-1978), who graduated from
Syracuse University College of Medicine in 1926 and later taught at the university,
chairing both the Pathology and Medical Jurisprudence departments. There are five series
in this collection.</p>
<p>Chronological Calendar: This manuscript compiles a history of SUNY Upstate Medical
University, from its origins as Geneva Medical College in 1834 and its assimilation into
the State University of New York system in 1950. Chapters of the manuscript are largely
based on departments (administration, libraries, secretaries, pathology, anatomy,
biochemistry, family medicine, jurisprudence, etc.). Each department is then organized
chronologically, highlighting chairmen, deans, and key administrative figures from the
creation of the department until around 1968. Almost every figure listed and described
by Ferguson is accompanied by a photograph. Individuals may appear in more than one
chapter, as they were the head of multiple departments. Additions and revisions to
selected chapters were added in the 1980s and early 2000s by unknown contributors.</p>
<p>History Report to the Committee to the Board of Trustees: This document argues the case
for the State to purchase Syracuse University Medical College in order to establish
their upstate medical college. Ferguson provides a narrative history of Syracuse
University Medical College, including photographs of floor plans, the campus, and
internal views of classrooms. He also provides information about the library, School of
Public Health Nursing, costs and incomes, local hospitals, relationships to local
industries (such as Bristol Laboratories), and the future of the College. The report is
a total of 51 pages.</p>
<p>Subject files: This file includes newspaper clippings of Ferguson’s obituaries, a copy
of his dedication in the 1965 Auricle, a copy of Ferguson’s curriculum vitae (circa
1950), and a letter from John H. Ferguson Jr.</p>
<p>Memorabilia: This file includes awards Ferguson received upon his retirement.</p>
<p>Photographs: There are sixteen black-and-white portrait photographs and eight negatives
of John H. Ferguson, most likely his faculty portraits.</p>
