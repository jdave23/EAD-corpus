         <p>Donald Smythe Childs (1888-1960) was one of the earliest radiologists in New York State
            and graduated from the Syracuse University College of Medicine in 1909. He interned at
            St. Joseph’s Hospital from 1908 to 1910 before becoming a physician at Waterloo in 1910.
            In 1914, he returned to SU to become a Professor of Radiology, a position he held until
            1948. In addition, he was an Instructor and subsequently a Professor of Osteology at SU
            for 28 years. During World War I, he served in the Medical Corps as a Captain from 1917
            to 1919. In 1915, he married Amy Murray Edwards, with whom he had two sons: Donald S.
            Childs Jr., who also became a renowned radiologist, and Eleaser Edwards Childs. He
            assisted with radiology at many local institutions, including St. Mary's Maternity
            Hospital, Marcy State Hospital, the Syracuse Free Dispensary, the Syracuse Psychopathic
            Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital, Elmcrest Children’s Center, and the House of
            Providence. He was the secretary-treasurer of the Radiological Society of North America
            from 1931 until his death and the business manager of its scientific journal, Radiology.
            Among his many public service positions, he was most notably a Trustee of the American
            Board of Radiology from 1940 until 1958, Chancellor of the American College of Radiology
            beginning in 1949, chairman of the Section of Radiology of the American Medical
            Association in 1956 to 1957, President of the Syracuse Academy of Medicine, and
            President of the American Board of Radiology, which was the official examining and
            certifying body for his medical specialty. Dr. Childs was a member of the American
            Roentgen Ray Society, Century Club Syracuse, and Innominate Club Syracuse and a Fellow
            of the American College of Radiology. He was awarded the Gold Medal Award of the
            Radiological Society of North America in 1949 and died in 1960 at the age of 72.</p></bioghist>
