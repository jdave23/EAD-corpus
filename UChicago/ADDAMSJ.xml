        <p>Jane Addams (September 6, 1860 – May 21, 1935) was a prominent activist in the Progressive Era of American History (1890s – 1920s).  In her roles as social workers, sociologist, author, and reformer, Jane Addams became a role model for many women across the country.  In addition to being the second woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1931), Addams was a co-founder of the ACLU and of the Hull House, a settlement for social reform in Chicago.  </p>
