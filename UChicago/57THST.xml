        <head>Historical Note</head>
        <p>Chicago's 57th Street Art Fair continues its role as one of the country's largest not-for-profit art fairs dedicated to exhibiting original art by artists who sell their own work.  The Art Fair originated in 1948 when Hyde Park gallery owner May Louise Womer saw a need for local artists to network with each other and to their public directly.  Invitations for the outdoor event were sent to galleries, art schools, and artists throughout the city.  Initially the fair was open to all artists, but as the response grew each year, there became a need to limit entrants.  In 1963, the Art Fair Committee was organized.  Composed of critics, collectors, curators and artists, the panel chose which artists would display their work in the fair.  This screening process is still in effect today.  Once an artist is accepted, their exhibit space is held for their return through subsequent fairs; around 500 aspiring exhibitors compete for the 40 to 50 spaces that are vacated each year.  Recently, over 300 artists exhibited in the Fair.  Every year since 1948 there has been a 57th Street Art Fair, usually held the first weekend in June.</p>
