<p>ARCHIVAL BUILDINGS FILE
</p>
<p>The Archival Buildings File was established in order to provide a means of organizing information and ephemeral materials relating to University buildings and making them more readily accessible. Many items are received by the Archives concerning the history, architecture, and use of various buildings and structures on campus, which do not have a place in other record groups.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first part of the file contains materials concerning campus architecture in general, including guides and maps, articles, and souvenir booklets with pictures of buildings and campus scenes. Following these are folders for individual buildings, arranged alphabetically. Among the items that can be found are programs for groundbreaking ceremonies, cornerstone layings, and dedications, as well as promotional brochures, press releases, and articles and reports from various sources. The files sometimes include correspondence and other information concerning the design, construction, remodeling, and architectural decoration of the buildings. Since some buildings have been known by more than one name, patrons should check the listing for all possible headings relating to their subject of inquiry.
</p>
<p>Materials are added to the files as they are received. The listing and file arrangement are provisional and subject to change as additions and updates are made.
</p>
<p>Photographs of University buildings are located in Series II of the Archival Photographic Files. These include not only exterior and interior shots but also photo-reproductions of architects' drawings and photographs of construction sequences. There is a separate Postcard Collection which features images of campus buildings and scenes. The Archives also maintains a substantial collection of architectural drawings and blueprints of many buildings on campus. Other information on buildings can be found in various University publications, and in the records of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, the Presidents' Papers, the Harold Swift Papers, and minutes of the Board of Trustees and its committees. Files on particular buildings can be found in other record groups as well. Please consult a member of the archival staff for more information.

<p>The records of the University of Chicago Department of Anthropology include materials from 1929 when the Department was founded as a distinct entity under the Chairmanship of Fay-Cooper Cole until 1996. Periods in this timeframe are unevenly represented with the bulk of materials from the 1960's to 1996.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I: Fay-Cooper Cole Papers includes the professional papers of Professor Fay-Cooper Cole. This alphabetically ordered series incorporates Cole's professional correspondence with fellow professors, university administrators, professional organizations, anthropological institutions and funding agencies, as well as his graduate students' field reports.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II: Research is divided into four subseries documenting a range of early research activities carried out by the Department of anthropology. Subseries 1 contains the correspondence and research materials of the Committee on the Ethnohistory of the Upper Mississippi River Valley. Subseries 2 incorporates field reports and correspondence relating to summer archeological research conducted primarily at Kincaid Mounds, but also at other sites throughout the region and the country. Subseries 3 contains miscellaneous research materials and correspondence relating to the archaeological research conducted in the department of anthropology.
</p>
<p>Subseries 4 includes correspondence, field materials, interview transcripts, surveys and field notebooks from the Winnebago/Ho-Chunk research of Rachel Commons and Leo Srole. [Commons died of Pneumonia with her Winnebago research incomplete. Srole was later sent to pick up where she left off, the field materials in subseries four are the partial result of that enterprise. Other materials relating to Commons/Srole can be found in Fay-Cooper Cole's correspondence in Series I.]
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III: Alphabetical files incorporates three alphabetically ordered subseries that represent the administrative papers and departmental correspondence from the period following Fay-Cooper Cole's retirement, though it most fully represents the years between 1950 and 1970. This series most likely corresponds to the period in which Robert Redfield and Fred Eggan alternated as chair of the Department, with Sol Tax also periodically holding the position. The series is divided into three subseries.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Correspondence incorporates alphabetically filed departmental correspondence from 1950-1956. Subseries 2: General Alphabetical Files, incorporates the administrative correspondence of the department with various institutions, other universities and funding agencies. Subseries 3: Wenner-Gren Symposium on Graduate PhD Curricula holds the contributions of various anthropology departments from across the country to a 1958 Wenner Gren conference on Anthropological PhD curricula.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV: Microfilm includes a collection of departmental microfilms pertaining to various fields of research. Subseries 1 contains microfilm pertaining to Chiapas and the University of Chicago Chiapas Project. Subseries 2 contains materials on Guatemala.
</p>
<p>Subseries 3 incorporates materials from Sol Tax's Research on the Fox and Sauk native American tribes in Tama, Iowa, and some subsidiary materials. Subseries 4 incorporates materials pertaining to linguistic and socio-cultural research on India. Subseries 5 includes miscellaneous and/or unlabeled microfilm materials.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series V: Buildings and Space incorporates correspondence, surveys, architectural plans and information pertaining to the maintenance of, allocation to and movement from various campus buildings. The bulk of material involves the Walker Museum and Haskell Hall. Also of interest are materials relating to the procurement and installation of the Totem Pole in Haskell Hall.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VI: Teaching incorporates syllabi, teaching statements and curricula for undergraduate and graduate courses in anthropology. Most of these materials pertain to required anthropology courses.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VII: Administration incorporates in a single chronologically-organized series the Department's internal administrative files as well as those concerning the department's connection to the Division of Social Sciences, the College and the central University administration. As these materials are central administrative papers, they are subject to restriction for 30 years from their date of production. Their organization into a single chronological sequence facilitates research by allowing researchers to access earlier files while later files are still subject to restriction. These papers date from 1934 to 1997.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VIII: Faculty and Staff consists of a single chronologically-organized series of files pertaining to faculty and staff recruitment, salary information and correspondence. As these files contain data of a financial and budgetary nature, they are subject to a 50 year financial restriction from the date of their production. This series has been organized chronologically so researchers may access the earlier files while the later files remain under restriction. The dates of these files span from 1938 to 1991.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IX: Finance consists of six subseries that incorporate departmental financial materials. Because of the financial and budgetary nature of the materials in this series, they are subject to a 50-year financial restriction from the date of their production. Subseries 1: Departmental Budgets incorporates departmental budgets and accounting information from 1939-1986. Subseries 2-5 include materials related to various private and government granting agencies. Subseries 6: Miscellaneous Finance incorporates miscellaneous materials relating to departmental expenditures, including departmental luncheon invoices and expense accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series X: Students incorporates five subseries concerning the students in the Department of Anthropology. Subseries 1: Student Files is comprised of student files which may include grades, correspondence, financial information and admission information for students. Subseries 2: Exams includes original copies of official student departmental examinations as well as faculty commentary and grades for the exams. Subseries 3: Grades includes grade sheets and reports from the registrar's office, as well as individual term papers and class rosters that include student evaluative material. Subseries 4: Awards and Aid includes reports and evaluations and allocations of student funding and recommendations and nominations for student awards and membership in honor societies such as Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa. Subseries 5: Jobs and Recommendations includes correspondence and faculty recommendations for department students for jobs at other universities.

<p>The Roman Weil Collection of Boris Artzybasheff works is organized into three Series: Series I: Magazine Illustrations; Series II: The Wickwire Steel Company Illustrations; Series III: The Last Trumpet. The collection contains illustrations by the Russian-American artist Boris Artzybasheff ranging from magazine covers, industrial advertisements, a map, a series of large advertisement poster prints, and a woodblock print. The collection spans from 1929 to the artist's death in 1965, but the bulk of the collection features works were produced during World War II, in the early 1940s. Like the wide-ranging media found in the collection, researchers can expect to find a wide range in subject matters within the collection. The images describe foreign leaders, American political leaders, anthropomorphized machinery, descriptive maps, technological innovations, political satire, and poetic figurations.&#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Series I, Magazine Illustrations, contains items from Time Magazine, Fortune Magazine, Life Magazine, The Golden Book Magazine, The Colophon Quarterly, and Mechanix Illustrated Magazine. The bulk of this series is made up by Time Magazine Issues that range from 1941 to 1965. Because Artzybasheff illustrated advertisements as well as magazine covers, the items included vary in completeness. In some instances, only the magazine cover was collected. For the most part, Weil collected the front and back cover, as well as a selection of pages from the magazines describing foreign news, politics, or the economy. There are a few Time Magazine issues preserved in their entirety. Likewise, the Mechanix issue of 1954 is preserved in its entirety. The series is grouped by publication and each publication is organized chronologically. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Series II, The Wickwire Steel Company Illustrations, contains seven framed advertisement posters and the pamphlet published in 1944 of the "Axis in Agony!" The industrial company commissioned Artzybasheff to produce politically charged advertisements for their industrial products. The collection depicts Axis leaders—Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Fumimaro Konoe--being defeated or ridiculed by anthropomorphized creatures and industrial processes. The accompanying pamphlet contains all the images Artzybasheff created for the Wickwire Steel Company in a small format. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Series III, The Last Trumpet, contains a single frame that contains "The Last Trumpet" woodblock print and a short essay by Carl Carmer. The essay is biographical and interpretive of the accompanying image. Artzybasheff's woodblock print depicts a large angel holding a long trumpet atop a crumbling classical cornice. In the background, a modern city-scape is being consumed by fire. </p>

<p>The records of the ASC have been arranged into four series: I. Subject Files, II. Correspondence, III. Library of the ASC, and IV. Addenda. The collection covers the period 1943-1955 and includes correspondence; financial records, miscellaneous manuscripts; and records of the Chicago Committee for Civilian Control of Atomic Energy, a group of non-scientist Chicagoans affiliated to the National Committee for Civilian Control, supporting the atomic scientists’ fight for civilian control of atomic energy.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In arranging the papers of the ASC the original order has been maintained. In some cases apparent inconsistencies will arise in arrangement, but because of the extent of the collection no major attempt has been made at this time to correct these discrepancies. Researchers are therefore strongly urged to search all possible places where material might be filed when seeking a particular item, e.g., when seeking a specific letter of Harold Urey, his file in Correspondence Files, the Executive Committee’s Files, the subject files, etc., should be searched.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Subject Files have been arranged by subject matter, alphabetically; each subject group is further sub-divided alphabetically; material in each folder is arranged by date. The Correspondence Files are arranged alphabetically as follows: first, under each letter of the alphabet there is a General Correspondence File, containing material and correspondence arranged alphabetically; second, following each General Correspondence File there are Subject Files, arranged alphabetically, each folder arranged by date. In both the Subject Files and the Correspondence Files near-print material and newspaper clippings, and other miscellaneous material will often be found. Generally, the Subject Files contain correspondence, near-print material, and miscellaneous matter relative to a specific subject. However, if the subject did not seem to warrant a separate grouping, the material was often filed in the Correspondence Files.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The third series, Library of the ASC, consists of miscellaneous correspondence and printed material. Series IV, Addenda, has been arranged into four subseries that include Atomic Scientists of Chicago, University Office of Inquiry, Associated Scientific Groups, and Conferences. The addenda comprise the years 1945 to 1954, mostly of the periods 1945 to 1947, and with a scattering of 1954 papers, the bulk of which concern the Oppenheimer Case. Except for amplifying the atomic energy conferences, and the material on the Oppenheimer Case, the addenda appear to add little informational value to that contained in the other three series. A similarity of folder headings should enable the user to correlate Series IV with Series’ I through III.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The addenda series also includes the papers of Lester Guttman, one time chairman of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago and longtime member of its executive committee. Guttman, a physical chemist, was with the Manhattan Project in New Mexico from 1943 to 1946. He was a member of the faculty of the Institute for Metals at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1955. In 1956, he became a senior chemist at Argonne National Laboratories, administered by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Government. The papers include files from his membership in both the ASC and the Federation of American Scientists.

<p>The American Veterans Committee, Chicago Area Council records spans from 1946-1973, with the bulk of the collection from 1946-1958. It is organized into three series, “Convention Material,” “Chicago Area Council” and “American Veterans Committee Publications.” “Chicago Area Council” series is divided into two subseries: “Correspondence” and “Organizational Documents.” Series I is arranged chronologically with a gap between 1952 and 1955. Documents consist of correspondence, memoranda, planning materials, by laws, and booklets regarding both national and Chicago-area conventions. Subseries 1 of Series II consists primarily Stanley A. Kaplan’s incoming and outgoing correspondence in his role as Chairman of the American Veterans Committee. Subseries 2 of Series II documents include correspondence, minutes, publications, memorandums, by-laws, financial documents, and booklets of the Chicago Area Council. Series III include AVC publications: The “AVC Bulletin,” a book and an issue of The Atlantic Monthly (both written by Charles G. Bolte), and other newspaper clippings about the AVC.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Of potential interest are the writings on and about the desegregation of the military and the growing anti-communist sentiments towards the AVC. Researchers interested in union and or Veterans history, especially with regards to Chicago, will find this collection useful.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The files were collected by Stanley A. Kaplan (1910-1981), Professor Law at the University of Chicago and former chairman of the AVC. A majority of the correspondence, memoranda, and AVC National Convention notes were written to or by Kaplan.

<p>The speeches in this collection date from February 10, 1961, shortly after George Beadle's election to the Chancellorship on January 5th of that year, to November 8th, 1976, just before Edward H. Levi was inaugurated as the new President November 14th. In October of 1961 the title of the head of the University was changed from Chancellor to President. The collection thus covers George Beadle's entire formal leadership career at the University.</p>
<p>The speeches pertain both to Mr. Beadle's presidency - to the functioning of the University and its educational aims and processes - and to his work in biology, focussing on genetics and heredity.</p>
<p>The addresses are listed chronologically, with the title (if there was a formal title), and the audience. The list was prepared by Mr. Beadle's secretaries initially, and only checked and updated by the Special Collections staff.</p>
<p>The actual forms of the speeches vary; in some cases only notes have been preserved, although most speeches are represented by typed, final copies. Occasionally some correspondence is present concerning the meetings for which the speeches were presented.</p>
<p>The collection is open for scholarly research, not subject to the 25 year restrictions of the "Regulations Governing Access to Records of the Central Administration in the University Archives" because Mr. Beadle's speeches were public at the time of their delivery.</p>

<p>The organization of the William Benton Papers has followed wherever possible the original divisions made by Benton's staff. The material has accordingly been arranged in seven series.</p>
<p/>
<p>Series I: General Files comprises the greater part of the collection and contains letters to and from Benton, together with supporting documentation such as reports, memoranda, articles, etc. It is divided into six subseries. </p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 1 documents the Benton family from the mid-nineteenth century to 1973. Of special interest are the diaries and letters of William A. and Loanza Goulding Benton, William Benton's grandparents who were missionaries in Lebanon from the 1840s through 1870s. Papers and memorabilia of his mother, Elma Hixson Benton, are preserved together with an extensive mother and son correspondence providing valuable information on Benton's childhood and youth. Letters to, from, and about Benton's immediate family - aunts and uncles, cousins, his wife Helen Hemingway and children Charles, Louise, Helen and John - form an extensive part of subsequent files. Here, too, is correspondence pertaining to Shattuck School, Benton's secondary school; those relating to the places of his higher education, Carleton and Yale, are located in the general correspondence section.</p>
<p/>
<p>Papers relating to Benton's houses and travels, classmates and neighbors, social events and holidays, comprise the second major part of the Personal Life section. Included here is correspondence only with those persons whose relationship to Benton was entirely social, not connected with his business, educational, or political activities.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's lifelong love for the arts produced a large body of correspondence which has been placed in this subseries. A long friendship with and patronage of Reginald Marsh is recorded here; so, too, are Benton's friendships with Carl Sandburg, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Richard Rodgers.</p>
<p/>
<p>The personal correspondence closes with files relating to Benton's travels throughout the world, itemizing the planning, finances, itineraries, equipment, and companions of each expedition. Much of the material gathered here has an importance beyond that of Benton's private life. Several trips, notably those to Russia and Latin America, and the long-sought but never-realized trip to China, were largely or wholly fact-finding missions, and the information gathered was used as the basis for subsequent articles, speeches and policy statements.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 2: General Correspondence, is by far the largest subseries of the William Benton Papers. It is organized alphabetically by subject within the four chronological periods 1930-1940, 1941-1947, 1948-1957, 1958-1973. The bulk of the material and number of correspondents make generalization difficult, but a few comments may illuminate the nature and possible uses of this material.</p>
<p/>
<p>"General correspondence" denotes material which Benton's staff did not include in topical files such as State Department, Senate, etc. This does not imply that letters so classified are unconcerned with specific areas of Benton's career. In some cases individual letters were not put into the topical files because the correspondence of which they form part is concerned with a range of subjects; in other cases, because topical files had not yet been created. For example, Box 69 holds eight folders of Benton's correspondence with Chester Bowles. The letters relate variously to the advertising business, national politics, World War II, business and finance, and purely personal matters. Similarly, the Paul Hoffman correspondence in Box 73, though touching on the Committee for Economic Development, also addresses a multitude of quite different subjects and therefore, in the judgment of Benton's staff, was inappropriate for inclusion in the CED files.</p>
<p/>
<p>The net result is that neither the general correspondence files nor the topical files should be used independently. Much material on the arts, politics, foreign affairs, and the University of Chicago was originally placed in general rather than topical files, and it was deemed best to respect Benton's original ordering. The significant figures of Benton's life - Bowles, Hoffman, Adlai Stevenson, Robert Hutchins, Beardsley Ruml, Anna Rosenberg, Galen van Meter - appear in several places in the general files. The researcher is advised to identify key figures and organizations in the topical files and in Sidney Hyman's biography, The Lives of William Benton (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1969), and use these to locate further material in the general correspondence.</p>
<p/>
<p>While, then, not sharply focused, this section is one of the richest of the William Benton Papers. There is extensive correspondence on national affairs and the media with Henry and Clare Boothe Luce, Harold Lasswell, Norman Cousins, members of the Sulzberger and LaFollette families, and DeWitt Wallace. Benton's study of governmental regulation of the economy is illustrated in correspondence with Cyrus Eaton, Bruce Gould, and John Kenneth Galbraith. International relations are the primary subject of letters to and from Geoffrey Crowther, David Hardman, and Harlan Cleveland. Files relating to many organizations (such as the ACLU, NAACP, and Council on Foreign Relations) and institutions (Columbia University and Connecticut College) are located in this section. Letters to Laird K. Bell, Edward Levi, Robert Hutchins, William McCormick Blair, and Gaylord Donnelley attest to Benton's ongoing ties to the University of Chicago. The Leigh Dannenberg correspondence holds a wealth of information on Connecticut politics. The CED story is told in the Hoffman, Clarence Francis, Marion Folson, and Jay Hormel files. Most of the key figures in Benton's other major commitments-UNESCO, State Department, Britannica, higher education, politics-are represented in the general correspondence. Finally, this section preserves a large body of letters and memoranda on Benton's life, career, and accomplishments filed under names of Benton staff members: John Howe, Anne Cronin, Kay Hart, Catherine Flynn, Bertha Tallman.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 3 documents several phases in Benton's wide-ranging business career. The first group of files covers the years 1935-1945, after Benton's departure from Benton and Bowles when he was looking for new business ventures. Many were in publishing, most notably the unsuccessful PM newspaper produced by Ralph Ingersoll. Benton was also a major investor in his classmate William Joyce's Pasadena Slipper Company (later Joyce Shoes), and in Dehydration, Inc. (later Birdseye). Much later, after he had left the Senate and had put his major business interests (Encyclopaedia Britannica and Muzak) on a firm footing, Benton became interested in buying a Connecticut newspaper. His attempts to acquire the Hartford Times and Hartford Courant are also detailed here.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton was active partner of the agency of Benton and Bowles from its foundation in 1929 until 1935, and a second group of papers here date from that era. There is full documentation not only of the original terms of incorporation, but also of reorganizations after Benton's departure; many of the original ad campaigns-General Foods, General Motors, Alka-Gum, Safeway-are preserved, from initial ideas through market research to final product. Benton continued to monitor the agency after 1935, and there is scattered material on its later history.</p>

<p>After his resignation from Benton and Bowles, Benton's next major business venture was Muzak, which he purchased in 1939. Most of the Muzak correspondence comes from the first six years of Benton's ownership, when he was aggressively restructuring, strengthening, and expanding the company. Until the sale of the company in 1958, he continued to receive reports on Muzak and to correspond with top officers such as John Andrus, Charles Cowley, and Ethel MacLean (Houghton).</p>
<p/>
<p>The final section of subseries 3 is of particular interest for the history of Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. during an extraordinary period of growth and diversification, as Benton guided Britannica into myriad projects, including yearbooks, foreign language editions, and purchase of Compton's, Merriam, and Praeger. Day-to-day operations of Encyclopaedia Britannica are not covered, but there is ample material on Benton's projects for expansion. Benton's acquisition of Encyclopaedia Britannica common stock and the ERPI film company are well documented; so, too, are his close associations with officers in the British subsidiary, especially Hector McNeil, Stanley Morison, and A. E. and E. T. Dolphin. There is a large body of correspondence with editors and managers: Clyde Arnspiger, Miller McClintock, Harry Grubbs, Lou Shoenwald, John Armitage, Walter Yust, Harry Houghton, Paul Seaman, Foster Wygant, and Robert Preble. Protracted research and negotiations for the unconsummated purchase of the Curtis Publishing Company are detailed in Boxes 239-240. Benton's advocacy of English as a world language through the Britannica Institute is documented, as is his promotion of the Great Books series.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 4 collects materials on aspects of Benton's public life. After 1958 Benton and his staff began to assemble files covering possible commitments, memoranda on future positions, courses of action, and consultants' reports on specific projects. The main subjects addressed were business and economics, communications, education, and politics and government. This section is, then, an idea file, containing the preliminary stages of what were in many cases to become the major commitments of Benton's later career. As such, these papers should be consulted along with the topical files, in particular those of the Benton Foundation through which many of the projects outlined here were realized.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 4 also documents Benton's involvement with the America First Committee. He was closely associated with such key Committee members as Robert Bliss, G. A. Borgese, General Robert Wood, and Robert Hutchins, and he was kept closely informed of Committee activities. This attempt to keep the U.S. out of war collapsed with the December 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, but the Committee was significant in stimulating Benton's interest in politics and in bringing him into contact with several figures - notably the LaFollettes - who were important to his later career in public life.</p>
<p/>
<p>Established by business and academic leaders to plan for the peacetime economy, the Committee for Economic Development was a natural field for Benton's expertise in business, higher education and management, and became his most important wartime activity. His role in drafting by-laws, recruiting staff, and writing "The Economics of a Free Society" are described here. Benton's vice-chairmanship of the CED and of its Research Division put him in close touch with government and business leaders who were to be his colleagues in public service and propelled him into the highest levels of American political life. Benton served until his death as a trustee of the CED, and later CED reports and material on trustees' meetings are preserved in Subseries 4.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 4 also documents Benton's political career. Included are materials on his activities in Connecticut Democratic politics, dating from his 1949 appointment to the U. S. Senate. His swift establishment and consolidation of ties to state politicians, ethnic groups, party officers, union officials, and civic leaders is thoroughly documented in correspondence with Anthony Arpaia, John Bailey, Robert Claffey, Mike Cieplinski, Leigh Dannenberg, John Dempsey, Thomas Dodd, Richard Lee, Abraham Ribicoff, and others. The preservation of incoming and outgoing mail, and of strategy memos, publicity, statements, advertisements, reports, and documentation regarding the Democratic Party and state elections make this a rich repository for Connecticut politics in the period 1949-1973. During these years Benton was, if anything, even more involved with national politics. Before his Senatorial term he had worked closely with many statesmen and politicians; afterward, it could fairly be said that he was well acquainted with-and corresponded voluminously with-most important Democrats and many leading Republicans. His attempt to win Dwight Eisenhower over to the Democratic Party is a fascinating chapter in American political life. The correspondence with close friends and political allies such as Paul Douglas, Adlai Stevenson, and Hubert Humphrey is particularly complete, and offers unusual insight into Democratic issues, policies, proposals, reforms, and personalities.</p>
<p/>
<p>Another group of documents political campaigns, not only in Connecticut state politics but also Benton's own political positions and analyses in the 1950-1962 period. Included are his assessments of state and national politics, along with accounts of his pioneering campaign techniques, political polls, lists of supporters and contributors, and financial data. In addition to material pertaining to Benton's 1950 and 1952 Senatorial campaigns and subsequent efforts to win party nomination, there are two boxes of correspondence on the 1968 presidential campaign, particularly useful in regard to Hubert Humphrey's candidacy and Benton's Platform Committee experiences at the Democratic convention.</p>
<p/>
<p>Material in subseries 4 related to the U.S. Senate provides the best documentation of Benton's career from 1949 to 1952. Besides copious correspondence with other Senators concerning legislation and national issues, there are letters and position papers which testify to Benton's efforts to shape national policy. Particularly revealing are John Howe's memos and reports, the "issues and legislation" section, and six boxes of memoranda. Here can be seen not only the evolution of Benton's thought on current issues, but also the process by which he shaped rough ideas into public statements. Although Benton's tenure in the Senate was not long, it was active; recorded here is his work on behalf of the Voice of America and world freedom of the press, service on the Small Business Subcommittee, work on the amendment to the Mutual Security Act, and promotion of the interests of Connecticut residents and businesses.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's pioneering stand against Joseph McCarthy grew out of the latter's violent and unwarranted attacks on State Department personnel and programs. In calling first for McCarthy's resignation and then for his expulsion from the Senate, Benton stood almost alone in the Senate throughout most of 1951. McCarthy in turn launched not only a series of personal attacks but also a lawsuit (later dropped) against Benton. Benton's defense of his position and his orchestration of nationwide campaigns ("Joe Must Go," "I Believe") is fully documented in these papers. Here, too, are copies of depositions, testimony, newspaper clippings, letters, and reports on the early fight against McCarthy and McCarthyism. Although Benton left the Senate before McCarthy's fall, he did not abandon his battle against McCarthy.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 5: Foreign Affairs. Benton's first major involvement in foreign affairs came through his appointment as consultant to the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller. His entry into the highest levels of government, the experience stimulated a lifelong involvement in international relations and diplomacy. Filed here, as well, is correspondence between Benton and world leaders, most notably Harold Wilson. This material testifies not only to the breadth of Benton's associations - Golda Meir, Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Yuri Zhukov - but also to his ceaseless work for international understanding through diplomatic and personal channels.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's 1945 appointment as Assistant Secretary of State came at a crucial and dynamic point in American foreign policy. Placed in charge of the State Department's Information Program, he was able to translate into action his conviction that American ideals and policies had to be promoted through a vigorous campaign of information and persuasion. His work in establishing the Voice of America, educational exchanges, and the Fulbright fellowship program is documented in the State Department files. Correspondence with diplomatic and government officials after his 1947 resignation is ample, as Benton continued to gather information for his own use and to exercise a behind-the-scenes voice in foreign policy.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton had been instrumental in founding UNESCO during his State Department years, and he continued to monitor its growth. His appointment as United States ambassador to UNESCO from 1963 to 1969 was a fitting tribute to his unique talents, combining as he did experience in foreign affairs and diplomacy with expertise in education and cultural issues.</p>
<p/>
<p>The records of his six-year term are among the most complete in the William Benton Papers. Proposals, draft reports, and final papers of Executive Board meetings have been preserved, as well as extensive correspondence with Director-General Rene Maheu and with delegates. The education, issues, and projects files are an important record of the problems which Benton addressed and his proposals for UNESCO action. Other files record his efforts to make UNESCO an efficient, non-politicized body and his attempts to present U.S. policy. His trips to evaluate UNESCO field operations give a detailed picture of the realization of policy decisions. At the same time, Benton knew that American public opinion had to be mobilized in support of UNESCO if the organization were to function effectively and were to act in the American interest; his work for the National Commission is another fine example of his skill and energy in bringing foreign policy issues to the American people.</p>
<p/>
<p>Subseries 6: Education and Philanthropy includes material on the University of Chicago and the Benton Foundation. The University-related material in the William Benton Papers begins after Benton's departure from the University administration, and consists largely of letters to other University trustees such as Laird K. Bell, Harold H. Swift and William McCormick Blair. The triangular relationship between Benton, the Encyclopaedia Britannica and the University is a frequent theme; so, too, are University finances and expansion projects in the post-Hutchins era. Additional material on the University of Chicago can be found in the Benton Foundation subseries.</p>
<p/>
<p>After 1958 most of Benton's ongoing and new institutional commitments were maintained through the Benton Foundation rather than his personal office, making the detailed records in this subseries the most important source for Benton's later career. In its early years, in particular, the Foundation was the direct extension of Benton himself, the funding and supervising mechanism for his interests and projects. The range of topics here reflects the wide variety of Benton's interests; education, politics, foreign affairs, business and trade, and culture. Particularly strong are the files of those educational institutions which Benton served as a trustee; the Aspen Institute, Brandeis, Carleton, the Hampton Institute, the University of Bridgeport, the University of Chicago, and the University of Connecticut. Organizations such as the American Assembly, the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and the Committee for a National Trade Policy reveal Benton's continued devotion to the reform of political institutions and trade laws. The Foundation provided support, too, for more partisan bodies such as the Democratic Advisory Committee. Benton's work for the United Nations, the Institute of International Education, and the U.S. Committee on the Atlantic Congress was carried on through the Foundation. His lifelong interest in and patronage of the arts can be seen in the Foundation's support for the American Shakespeare Festival, which Benton also served as a trustee.</p>
<p/>
<p>Series II: SPEECH FILES</p>
<p/>
<p>In this series are Benton's public statements; articles, speeches, books, reports, form letters, transcripts of radio and television appearances, preliminary research notes, drafts, and revisions.</p>
<p/>
<p>The Speech Files hold some 2345 separate entries, each typically consisting of extensive documentation on Benton's public statements. Here are filed research notes, drafts, photos, and related correspondence as well as record copies of articles, books, reports, and broadcasting transcripts. A large part of the series is devoted to works by Benton's associates - such as a complete set of Adlai Stevenson's campaign speeches - and works supporting Benton's policy positions. A noteworthy feature is the series of detailed memoranda on and transcripts of interviews with business, political, and cultural leaders in Russia and Latin America. Found here, too, are public statements by close associates such as Robert Hutchins, Adlai Stevenson, and Paul Hoffman; source materials for Benton's own writing; background information on major interests; and documents about or referring to Benton. The files are arranged numerically, following the roughly chronological organization originally devised by Benton's staff; access is facilitated by an alphabetical index which was compiled from the exhaustive cross-indexing system used by Benton's office.</p>
<p/>
<p>Series III: AUTOGRAPH CORRESPONDENCE WITH NOTABLE FIGURES </p>
<p/>
<p>Maintained separately by Benton's staff, these are letters received from distinguished public figures, with politicians predominating.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's staff designated items from selected dignitaries for preservation in separate files, and their organization has again been maintained. This correspondence is heavily political, featuring letters from such prominent men as Eisenhower, Truman, Nixon, Marshall, and John and Robert Kennedy. As with other sections of the William Benton Papers, however, researchers will find it advisable to explore other series in conjunction with this material. </p>
<p/>
<p>Series IV: MEMORABILIA </p>
<p/>
<p>This series contains photographs, gifts, awards, and mementos. Oversize items are shelved separately.</p>
<p/>
<p>Series V: RECORDINGS</p>
<p/>
<p>Series V includes record albums from the 1940s and 1950s. The recordings include speeches by Benton, music, productions from the University of Chicago Radio Office.</p>
<p/>
<p>SERIES VI: SCRAPBOOKS </p>
<p/>
<p>These 130 large bound volumes, combining Benton's public statements with photographs and papers relating to his family, chronicle William Benton's life and career up to 1962.</p>
<p/>
<p>The scrapbooks were created under Benton's direction in 1962. Arranged according to the principal divisions of his life (Senate Years, McCarthy, etc.), the scrapbooks display copies of Benton's articles and speeches; original letters from great men of the day; photographs of Benton and associates; and a wide assortment of legal papers, memoranda, transcripts, family papers, newspaper clippings, etc. Some copies of speeches are annotated or edited by Benton; there are also marked article drafts. Many volumes of the scrapbooks also contain notes and explanations written in the margins by Benton; some marginalia of possible interest to researchers has been noted in the inventory section of this guide. The scrapbooks contain information related to nearly all aspects of Benton’s public career.</p>
<p/>
<p>Series VII: ADDENDA</p>
<p/>

<scopecontent>
<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>The collection is divided into two series, the first covering the years 1892 to 1932 and the second 1932 through 1965.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I: Department of Building and Grounds, 1892-1932
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lyman Flook maintained files on every aspect of his work for the Department of Buildings and Grounds: planning and construction reports, financial statements, office organization, and correspondence with individual faculty members, Trustees, committees, architects, contractors, and suppliers. To facilitate access to the records and eliminate redundancy, his files have been reorganized into four series: General Office Files, Landscaping and Maintenance, Individual Buildings, and Catalogues and Letterheads.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subseries 1: General Office Files
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This series contains the internal operational records of the Department of Buildings and Grounds and the Office of the Superintendent of Construction. Although some records antedate Flook’s appointment as Superintendent of Construction, the bulk of the material extends from his initial report to President Judson in 1919 to the termination of the Office of Superintendent of Construction in 1932 (1:5-2:8). Flook’s larger concerns about university architecture are reflected in his collection of articles and brochures on building activities at the University of Chicago and other institutions (1:2). He was in regular contact with fellow building superintendents and occa. onally visited their campuses to consult on the development of construction plans. This series also contains Flook’s personal files, his army record, vita, geneology, college account book, and reading list (3:8-10).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Landscaping and maintenance
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds regarded landscaping as an integral past of the total campus scheme. Walks, drives, walls, and steps, particularly in the central quadrangles, met the practical need for access while enhancing the general impression of a comprehensive design. Correspondence and reports in this series have been arranged chronologically by project, followed by miscellaneous records on general landscape maintenance.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Individual Buildings
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All of Flook’s Departmental records relating to the construction of individual buildings have been consolidated within this series. Existing records for each building are arranged to reflect the typical stages of building construction: specifications, planning, progress reports, arior furnishing and equipment, symboli , and cost. The most complete sequences of records document buildings erected during Flook’s tenure as Superintendent of Construction (1927-1931).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>General specifications are drawn up by the architects and list the conditions governing the execution of the contract: work to be done and materials to be used; regulations and agreements about workmanship; and responsibility, liability, and fees. Mechanical specifications are similar, except that they spell out requirements for heating, ventilation, and electrical work. Planning files include correspondence between Flook, the architects, the Business Manager, the President’s Office, faculty, and members of the Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds concerning the budgeted price of the structure, cost estimates, materials, appearance, spatial arrangements, and relationships with other campus buildings. Progress reports record the weather, working conditions, number of men on the job, kind of work being done, and number of visitors to the site. Furnishing and equipment could be selected by a faculty committee (24:8), by Flook in cooperation with a departmental representative (16:7), or by a professional interior decorator (12:5). After decisions were made on decoration and inscription, final cost statements were prepared detailing breakdowns of payments to architects, contractors, craftsmen, and suppliers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Catalogues and Letterheads
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This series contains a selection of suppliers’ catalogues and business letterheads from Flook’s files. The catalogues provide important information on the building technology of the period. Letterheads from Flook’s correspondence often contain engravings of the supplier’s headquarters and factory, names of officers, illustrations of products, and lists of other buildings served by the firm.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II: Department of Building and Grounds, 1932-1965
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Building records in this series are arranged alphabetically for the most part, one exception being the alterations and new buildings for the hospitals and clinics. These are also listed alphabetically, but under the general heading Hospitals and Clinics. Names and uses of hospital units have changed so frequently over the years that it is sometimes difficult to associate the record of a building with its physical space.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A second large general category is Residences and Facilities for Students. This includes not only completed buildings such as Pierce Tower and Woodward Court but also the plans for an never built women’s residence and some reports of faculty committees on the problems of student housing. The original files for the Center for Continuing Education, now the Graduate Student Residence, are to be found here. At the end of the alphabetical sequence are two boxes (21-22) containing miscellaneous building trades, furniture, and equipment brochures.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For each new building, the records include minutes and correspondence, particularly with architects, faculty, and contractors, relating to planning; lists and costs of furniture and equipment, building estimates, and sources of funding; publicity; and accounts of groundbreakings and dedications. Daily progress reports are available for many of the buildings. Routinely discarded in processing the collection were bills and receipts, their data being available in contractors’ reports and financial statements, change orders that would be reflected on drawings, and letters acknowledging receipt of shop drawings. Absent from this sub-series because they were in use for work on the addition to the Law School Library started in 1984 are the records for the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (Eero Saarinen and Associates, 1959).

<p>The Martin Hayes Bickham Papers contain 3.5 linear feet of material and cover the period from 1911 to 1965. They consist of materials from coursework in the Sociology Department and Divinity School (1912-1922), correspondence relating to his appointment as secretary of the University of Chicago Christian Association (1911), materials related to his dissertation research (1922), and correspondence with Amos Alonzo Stagg (1950s-1960s). The collection also includes 1938-1939 correspondence with the American Sociological Society and “Friends of Comte and his Work,” which refers to his dissertation research on Comte. Finally, the collection contains materials from the First World War in France—maps, tourist guide books, and other memorabilia, as well as photo postcards photographs, printed photographs, and negatives. Some of these photographic materials relate to the work of Y.M.C.A. in France after the War.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The professional papers of Martin Hayes Bickham are located at the University of Illinois Circle Campus Library. The Bickham Family Papers ca. 1760 through the 1950s comprise a separate manuscript collection in the University of Chicago Library.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection has been divided into four series: 1. University of Chicago Course Materials, 2. Correspondence and Papers (arranged chronologically), 3. Photographic Images, and 4. First World War Memorabilia.

<p>This series contains thousands photographs documenting natural environments, ecologies, and plant communities in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Many of the photographs were produced by faculty such as Henry Chandler Cowles and George Damon Fuller during departmental field trips, and were later used for research and teaching. The photographs provide an overview of important representative natural landscapes in the United States. Other photographs in this series represent botanists, including faculty and staff in the department. In addition to locations in the United States, there are images of foreign locations, as well as photographic reproductions of diagrams, graphs and charts.</p>
<p>The items in this series are primarily black and white prints, negatives and slides in small or medium-sized formats. There is some duplication of images.</p>
<p>This series is divided into eight subseries. Subseries 1-7 are organized by format, with each subseries then organized by state. Coded numbers assigned during digitization processing can be used to uniquely identify individual images; however, these numbers do not represent the original organization or classification of the photographs. Subseries 8: Unsorted Photographs, consists of images in a variety of formats; these images have not been organized or described in detail.</p>
<p>Additional descriptive information about some of these photographs is found in Series V. Most of these images have also been digitized, with detailed descriptions, as part of American Environmental Photographs, 1891-1936, an electronic resource available online.</p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of the letters of Mrs. Campbell in this collection are addressed to Mrs. Frank (Harriett) Carolan, later Mrs. Arthur Schermerhorn. In her autobiography, My Life and Some Letters (1922), Mrs. Campbell writes of Mrs. Carolan as "one of my dearest friends." Their friendship was long-standing and Mrs. Campbell often called on Mrs. Carolan for financial aid.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The letters fall mainly into two groups, one series between 1905 and 1918, and a second between 1927 and 1938. All of the letters are chatty and informal. The first series, however, deals mainly with her theatrical career. Of some interest are Mrs. Campbell's frequent pungent remarks about American audiences during her tours. Many famous people are briefly mentioned, such as George Bernard Shaw, Charles Laughton, and Katherine Cornell. Mrs. Campbell writes of the opening nights of many of her plays, of accidents, which befell her, such as when she broke her knee-cap in Philadelphia in 1905, and when her hair caught on fire during a performance. A carbon copy of a letter from her son is included in the papers. He was a British officer in World War I and fought at Gallipoli. His long letter movingly recreates the battle conditions existing on that front. He was later killed in France.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The second series, material after 1927, reveals clearly the decline in Mrs. Campbell's fortunes, her inability to find work, and her constant money difficulties. The collection includes several letters from Hollywood, where she had gone to find work, but had little success.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection also includes correspondence of Mrs. Campbell with others. There are also several letters to Mrs. Carolan from her daughter Stella, her son Alan ("Beo"), and her second husband, George Cornwallis-West. The collection also includes 14 photographs, 8 of Mrs. Campbell, and some playbills, broadsides, and clippings.

<p>The collection of about 1500 pieces includes Henry Castle's personal correspondence, his college essays and other miscellaneous writings and papers, the personal correspondence of Castle's immediate family, miscellaneous family papers, and typed copy and printer's proofs of a volume of Castle's letters which were edited by George and Helen Mead and privately printed for the Castle family and friends in 1902.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is divided into seven series. Series I: Personal, includes records related to Henry Northrup Castle’s education, his diaries, personal ephemera, and information about the sinking of the Elbe and Castle’s death. Series II: Correspondence, contains letters written by Castle, arranged alphabetically by correspondent. The majority of the letters are written to members of Castle’s family. General ingoing and outgoing correspondence between Castle and non-family members is found at the beginning of the series. Series III: Castle Family Correspondence, comprises personal letters from Castle's immediate family, arranged chronologically under the name of each relative, as well as letters received by members of the Castle family. Series IV: Castle Family Papers, includes ephemera related to various members of the Castle family. Series V: Publication of Letters, contains material related to the arrangement, transcription, and publication of Henry Northrup Castle’s correspondence by his sister, Helen Kingsbury Castle Mead, and his brother-in-law, George Herbert Mead. Series VI: Photographs, contains photographs of the Castle family and of Henry Northrup Castle and his daughter, Dorothy. Series VII: Oversize, contains galley proofs for Castle’s published letters.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Most of the original manuscripts of the published letters are included in the collection, as well as many unpublished letters and papers. The decision for or against publication of entire letters seems to have been based on technical problems rather than content, although occasional personal references were deleted. Since George and Helen Mead were responsible for the editing of the correspondence a natural reticence on their part seems to have motivated the withholding of scattered comments about their private lives. The original letters should always be consulted in preference to the published text to make certain that nothing of importance has been deleted. The original edited letters are always marked in blue pencil. Unpublished letters have the symbol "O" at the top of the first page or were not marked by the Meads.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(Persons interested in Mead will find references to him beginning with Castle's letters of the Oberlin period (c.1979-1883). Mead is most often mentioned, or entire letters are most often addressed to him, during the time when Castle was urging him to come to Harvard (c.1886-1887), and when the two friends were in Germany together (c.1893-1894). Letters to and from Helen Castle Mead after 1891 also reveal information about the philosopher(s early career.)
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Fourteen personal letters from Mead, all unpublished, are found in the collection, but much of the correspondence addressed to Castle, other than personal family letters, is not included, and its present whereabouts is unknown. It can be assumed that this correspondence not only would contain more letters of philosophical content from Mead, but revealing letters about Hawaiian political affairs which Castle would have received as an influential newspaper editor.

<p>This series includes letters and personal papers evidently preserved by Mrs. Caroline E. Coulter. They relate mainly to the brief missionary tour of the Coulters at the Presbyterian Mission at Ningbo, China, which was terminated by Moses Coulter's death in 1853. The highlight of this portion of the collection is a small group of letters written to Mrs. Coulter by friends still in Ningbo following her return to the United States in 1854 with her two small sons, John and Stanley (sometimes referred to as "Diddi" in the letters). These letters describe the continuing activities of the mission in the mid- and late 1850's and early 1860's and give some picture of the attitudes of the missionaries themselves.</p>

<p>This is a volume containing student notes on the lectures of Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). The lectures are broken up into general subjects and subsections, and they seem to be of a fairly general nature describing the basic physiological and psychological make-up and processes of human beings. Rush was a well-known doctor in Philadelphia during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He taught at the College of Philadelphia, the University of the State of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was also a signer of the Declaration of Independence, served in the army during the war, helped in the ratification process of the Constitution, and was active in the early abolition and temperance movements. According to the records of the John Crerar Library, this is a notebook of a student who attended and recorded the lectures of Dr. Rush. At the front of the notebook, on the first flyleaf, is written the name and address: “Thomas F. Gibbs, 935 R.I. Ave,” along with the note: “Prof. Rush’s Lectures.” </p>

<p>This series contains materials that the society compiled for research in the history of medicine. Most of the primary materials in this series date from the 1860s-1890s. While the collections mainly document the history of medicine in Chicago and Cook County, this series also includes material relevant to the medical history of Indiana, New York, Philadelphia, and other regions. The society's correspondence and notes about the provenance and acquisition of collections are sometimes included with the primary materials.</p>
<p>This series is divided into subseries by type of collection or format. </p>
<p>Subseries 1: Organizational Records, is arranged alphabetically by organization. This subseries includes administrative records, course material and publications. Represented are Chicago-area hospitals, universities and colleges, private clubs and societies, businesses and committees. Notable in this subseries are records of Cook County Hospital, Rush Medical College, the Chicago Medical Club, and the Medical Relief Committee, which was organized to support medical professionals following the 1871 Chicago Fire. Oversize material, including important records of the Cook County Hospital and the Chicago Retreat for the Insane, has been transferred to Subseries 6.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Biographical Files, is arranged alphabetically by name. This subseries consists of material collected by F.D. DuSouchet from 1911-1913, documenting the biographies of doctors active in Chicago in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. Most of the material in this subseries is correspondence between DuSouchet and the family members of individual doctors. Also included are photographs, biographical sketches, memorial material and clippings. General files contain lists of names, unidentified and partially identified material, and unanswered letters. Related papers of DuSouchet are included in Subseries 3. This subseries is also related to the portrait collection developed by DuSouchet, and included in Subseries 5.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Personal Papers, is also arranged alphabetically. This subseries includes correspondence, manuscripts, personal business records, course material and publications. Most of the individuals represented were physicians or medical students in the Chicago area in the mid- to late-nineteenth century; also included are papers of George Weaver and others involved in the organization of the Society of Medical History of Chicago. Many of the individual collections in this subseries are very small and consist of only a few items. Substantial collections in this subseries include the correspondence of George H. Cleveland; a collection of a variety of personal papers of Edwin R. LeCount; historical research compiled by George C. Weaver; and notes taken by James W. Walker in courses taught by prominent faculty at Chicago Medical College. Oversize </p>
<p>material, including a letterbook of correspondence of Nicholas Senn, and notes taken by Ludvig Hektoen on Senn's lectures, has been transferred to Subseries 6.</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Publications, contains reprints, periodicals, pamphlets and books. Included are works on medical history, medicine, dentistry, temperance, nutrition and public health. Material in this series is arranged alphabetically by title or author; general collections of reprints, periodicals and pamphlets are found at the end of the subseries. An incomplete run of the Bulletin of the Society of Medical History of Chicago is also included. Many of these materials were collected by Nathan S. Davis, who served as president of the American Medical Temperance Association.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Prints and Photographs, contains primarily black and white photographic prints, with a small number of engravings and reproductions from publications. Included in this subseries are photographs from the collection of Dr. Samuel Slaymaker, taken mainly at Rush Medical College and Cook County Hospital during the 1880s. Also included is a collection of portraits of prominent physicians and other medical professionals, organized alphabetically by subject. Biographical summaries are included with some of the portraits. Oversize material from this subseries, including additional photographs from Slaymaker's collection, have been transferred to Subseries 6.</p>
<p>Subseries 6: Oversize Materials, contains items transferred from previous subseries, as well as a framed print and a pair of Perkins's tractors mounted for display. Significant material in this subseries includes a casebook for the Chicago Home for the Insane; record books documenting autopsies and obstetric cases at Cook County Hospital; notes on lectures of Nicholas Senn taken by Ludvig Hektoen; a letterbook of correspondence with Senn; and photographs from the collection of Samuel Slaymaker.</p>

<p>The Allison Davis Papers range from 1932 to 1984 and contain reprints, manuscripts, and annotated drafts, field notes, and various interview data from key projects, correspondence and enclosures, research notes, and associated works by colleagues, including students' theses, abstracts, and proposals. Most of the papers stem from his long association with the University of Chicago and include his work on child-rearing and psychological development, studies of acculturation and the public schools, work on intelligence testing, and his study of young adulthood.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is organized into eight series: Series I: Biographical and Personal Material, Series II: Correspondence, Series III: Student Career, Series IV: Course Material, Series V: Research Files, Series VI: Writings, Series VII: Audio Tapes, and Series VIII: Letters of Recommendation and Nominations.
</p>
<p>

</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains biographical sketches, curriculum vitae, and bibliographies reflecting Davis's professional career and spanning nearly forty years from the early 1940s to the late 1970s. The other materials in this series pertain to family members, financial matters, and academic honors received by Davis.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains correspondence to and from Allison Davis, ranging from 1932 until 1984. The materials are of a predominantly professional nature and arranged alphabetically. Correspondents include Francis S. Chase, John Dollard, and Robert Hess, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and Dillard University. Manuscripts and other pertinent enclosures are also present.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Notes, notebooks, and papers collected and written by Allison Davis as part of his graduate work in Anthropology from 1932 until 1942 are included in Series III. Davis enjoyed a rich and varied student career, studying at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and the University of Chicago. However, it is not always readily apparent at which institution or in what context a given paper was written or notebook compiled. Dates have been provided where available.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series IV has been divided into four subseries: (1) Course Work, (2) M.A. Abstracts and Proposals, (3) Ph.D. Abstracts and Proposals, and (4) M.A. Theses. The first, Course Work, primarily concerns lectures, transcripts and notes from those courses taught by Allison Davis at the University of Chicago. This material dates from the late 1950s through the early 1970s, and focuses on Davis's work on ego development and maintenance. It is worth noting that Davis used the classroom as a proving ground for his own writing, and that one is apt to find striking similarities between his lectures and his more formal writings of the same period.</p>
<p>The remaining three subseries, M.A. Abstracts and Proposals, Ph.D. Abstracts and Proposals, and M.A. Theses, are all materials gathered together by Allison Davis and range from 1942 to 1978. Files are arranged alphabetically by candidate.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series V contains Allison Davis' research files. The files follow, chronologically, the research projects during his career. The series itself has been arranged into eight subseries: (1) Natchez Project; (2) American Council on Education; (3) Carnegie-Myrdal Study; (4) Child-rearing and Psychological Development; (5) Child-rearing in Lower Status Families; (6) Acculturation Project; (7) Intelligence Testing; and (8) Young Adulthood Project.</p>
<p>This series includes original drafts, manuscripts, lectures, research notes, course materials, correspondence, and field notes. Authorship of papers, presentations, and lectures should be attributed to Davis unless otherwise noted. All course numbers and titles refer to University of Chicago course offerings and Davis is assumed to be the course instructor unless some other indication is offered.</p>
<p>Correspondence, notes, and bibliographies are at the beginning of each subseries. These are followed by manuscripts and drafts of Davis' written work and lectures, as well as course and seminar materials. These in turn are succeeded by material pertinent to other authors, institutions, and related subject areas. Miscellaneous items like clippings and reprint sets are found at the end of each subseries.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Natchez Project, and the classic work Deep South, includes field data, notes, and correspondence, as well as working drafts and manuscripts. A bound copy of Davis' Ph.D. dissertation, "Caste and Economic Stratification in the Deep South," is also present. Since Davis collaborated closely with Burleigh and Mary Gardner on all phases of the Natchez project from field work beginning in 1933 to final publication in 1942, it is difficult to determine the relative contributions of each of the authors to the manuscript materials collected here.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: American Council on Education is divided into two sub-subseries: American Youth Commission and the Division on Child Development and Teacher Personnel. Davis's association with the American Youth Commission (1938-1939) was undertaken while teaching at Dillard University in New Orleans, and eventually lead to the publication of Children of Bondage with John Dollard. Included are interview data pertinent to that study, as well as manuscript drafts of Children of Bondage. The material pertinent to the Division on Child Development and Teacher Personnel is composed mainly of work group and seminar papers submitted for discussion by its various members.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Carnegie-Myrdal Study contains materials on another of Davis's projects that studied African American life in the United States. Davis consulted on the project and undertook a specific research task, the investigation of churches, lodges, and other associations among African Americans in Natchez and New Orleans. At the same time, he directed the investigations of St. Clair Drake into similar institutions in Chicago. Present are both Davis's and Drake's research memoranda, as well as correspondence from Gunnar Myrdal, the project director.</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Child-rearing and Psychological Development is mainly concerned with a proposed work on this topic, circa 1962. Book outlines, chapter drafts, research materials, and related interview data are included.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Child-rearing in Lower Status Families, was the early work of Davis and Havighurst, which eventually formed the basis of Father of the Man as well as numerous scholarly articles. A substantial amount of interview data was collected as part of these case studies. The Newbury Center Materials refer to data gathered as a result of contacts initiated through the Newbury Center, a nursery school with outreach programs in the African American community. The primary research occurred from 1942 to 1944. The Hyde Park Neighborhood House Materials refer to data collected among lower status white families loosely connected by their association with this community center. Primary field research extended from 1942 to 1946, but some as late as 1949. </p>
<p>Subseries 6: Acculturation Project, initiated in the early 1940s, proposed to investigate the role of the public schools in the assimilation and acculturation of children from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Three different sites with varying approaches to the issue were selected, California, Hawaii, and Brazil. Manuscripts dealing with the Californian and Hawaiian situations, as well as interview data from California, are included. The Brazil study was delayed and finally dropped though some pertinent notes and correspondence are represented.</p>
<p>Subseries 7: Intelligence Testing materials are organized into three sub-subseries: General, School Studies, and Davis Tests. General contains correspondence, including that from the World Book Company and Kenneth Eells, as well as notes, manuscripts, and reprints. The School Studies include data from specific research conducted in Rockford and Gary schools, and materials from the General Education Board which sponsored much of that research. Davis Tests concerns the development of the test instruments themselves. It should be noted that there were several tests developed in the course of this research which at various times were called by various names--Davis Tests, Davis-Hess Tests, Davis-Eells Tests. This developmental process seems to have been relatively fluid with subsequent tests developing out of previous ones.</p>
<p>Subseries 8: Young Adulthood Project includes manuscripts and reprints which both informed and emerged from the project; research memoranda, containing a series of numbered memoranda written by members of the Project; and interview data, incorporating material from both the early and late phases of the Project spanning a period from 1952-1962. Where possible Davis's groupings of interview data have been followed as, for example, in the entries "Kewpies," and "Negro Cases." The remainder of the material has been arranged alphabetically by informant name.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series brings together a broad spectrum of Davis's professional and non-professional writing, including three book-length efforts undertaken towards the end of his career.</p>
<p>Though neither work seems to have been published, Davis apparently considered both To Seize Life and Sexual Vitality to be extensions of his work on ego development and maintenance, but intended for more popular audiences. The materials are very closely related and, in fact, not easily partitioned. They incorporate much of the same content, but in rather different forms and guises. It should likewise be noted that Davis reworked this material many, many times, and while relatively complete versions of the works are included here, one will also find a substantial amount of partial manuscripts and notes. Similarly, several versions of Leadership, Love, and Aggression, as well as materials pertaining to the development of each chapter, are included here. </p>
<p>The Non-Fiction section is not intended to be inclusive of Davis's work. Rather, it reflects those manuscripts and reprints which he had himself arranged together. These works, published and unpublished, cover an expansive period from 1933 to 1973. Lectures, where distinguishable from Non-Fiction, includes public addresses and speeches delivered between 1949 and 1973.</p>
<p>Finally, a brief Fiction section presents notes and manuscripts for several literary works. It appears that Davis returned to this material throughout his lifetime, as indicated by dates ranging from 1934 to 1983.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The materials contained in this series are restricted due to their physical condition or the need for special equipment.</p>
<p>This series contains tape and cassette recordings of lectures and addresses by Davis. These tapes have been identified using those markings available on the reel or tape box. Most are class lectures, with some public lectures as well, including the Leo Franklin Lecture at Wayne State University. There is also at least one example of a taped interview. Fifteen tapes are unidentified.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series VIII is restricted and will not be open for research until 2024.</p>
<p>This small series primarily contains letters of reference, as well as several folders of nomination materials from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent><head>Scope Note</head><p>The Recorder's Office Records consist of two volumes relating investigations of student misconduct and disciplinary action taken against students between 1908 and 1933; a volume regarding degrees conferred before 1893 by the Old University of Chicago and by the Baptist Union Theological Seminary; and published reports of the Recorder’s Office, 1904-1908.</p></scopecontent>

<p>In 1993 R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company undertook a major initiative to preserve its 130-year history, and to make that history broadly accessible to individuals both inside the company and outside. This effort took form as the Archives Project, to arrange and describe voluminous historical records in the company's possession, and to create a company archives that would be useful immediately and far into the future.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley's role in the development of and impact on mass communication is documented in the company archives. Researchers of printing and technology, Chicago history, advertising and communication, graphic arts, fine binding and conservation, and many other related fields will find the R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company Archives a valuable source.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company Archive contains text materials such as correspondence, manuscripts, legal documents, oral and written histories, advertising, and customer product samples dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. A wealth of visual material includes photographs, artwork, product samples, and artifacts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is organized into twenty series. Series I through XII were the first parts of the collection to be formally processed by RR Donnelley, and contain many textual and visual documents that highlight important developments in the company's history. Series XIII through XX were organized afterwards, are concentrated in the mid- to late-twentieth century, and emphasize routine production and business at the company.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I: Biographical Files, includes material on members of the Donnelley family, as well as employees and other individuals affiliated with the company. The information found in these files tends to be general in nature, and is most useful as a source for basic textual and visual information about an individual. Materials found in this series, which date from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century, include correspondence, publications, photographs, resumes, and work samples

<p>Series II: Business Records, includes administrative and operational documents dating from the founding of the company to the mid-1990s. This series represents an incomplete record of the company's activities, but is a strong source of information on plants and facilities, the company's organizational structure, acquisitions and subsidiary companies, and The Printer, one of the company's magazines. It also contains selected financial records, patents, management documents, guides, personnel records and memorabilia.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III: Company Advertising, contains samples of material created by RR Donnelley to promote its own services. The items in this series date from the company's founding to the late twentieth century, and also include a small number of pieces advertising Richard Robert Donnelley's earlier business partnerships. Because the company used these pieces to highlight its own printing capabilities, the samples in this series tend to exemplify high-end printing and design, while demonstrating the company's marketing strategies.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV: Customers and Products, collects RR Donnelley's files on its clients, including samples of products (usually called "job samples") that it printed for them. These samples number in the thousands, and are found in several subseries of this series. This series also includes business records such as contracts and agreements, correspondence, photographs, and collections of historical background material on individual customers. Material on major clients such as Time-Life, Inc., Sears Roebuck and Company, and Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. are found in this series, as are selected samples. This series is a particularly rich source of material printed by the company in the 1920s-1950s.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VII: Historical Writings and Research, demonstrates RR Donnelley's deliberate efforts to document its past. The foundation of this series is the work of Herbert P. Zimmerman, a former RR Donnelley executive who in the mid-twentieth century undertook an extensive study of the company's history. This series contains drafts and typescripts of historical writings by a variety of researchers, as well as primary and secondary source material such as correspondence, publications and photographs. Personal recollections of employees, including transcripts of oral histories, are also found in this series.
</p>
<p>
</p>

Beezley, Jr., Igor de Lissovoy, Alfred de Sauty, Gaylord Donnelley, Thomas Elliott Donnelley, Carl Doty, Charles C. Haffner, William A. Kittredge, Charles W. Lake, Edward R. Lhotka, and C. Prentiss Smith. This series includes correspondence, publications, design samples, photographs, manuscripts, and memorabilia. As well as providing insight into the individuals represented, this series is also an excellent source of mid-twentieth century material related to management strategy, employee development, and product design processes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IX: General Records, contains materials collected under about seventy specific topics significant to the history of RR Donnelley, or to the history of printing in general. Many of the headings correspond to departments of the company, clients, events, printing processes, types of products, and special projects. Much of the material in this series consists of RR Donnelley advertising pieces and other promotional items; also found are photographs, correspondence, reports, customer job samples, and artwork. When possible, material in this series should also be viewed in conjunction with more detailed files found elsewhere in the collection. However, this series contains the collection's strongest representations of the Century of Progress; Extra Bindery and Graphic Conservation; financial printing operations; the Memorial Library and Training Library; data on printing presses operated in the company's plants; the development of the Indian head printer's mark and logo; the Four American Books; and electronic and digital printing processes developed in the 1970s-1990s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series X: Training Library Collection, consists of print materials drawn from the collections of this company resource. While some of the items in the Training Library were printed by RR Donnelley, many were created by other firms and collected by the library as examples for staff training. The material in this series contains hundreds of samples of fine and specialty print items from the early and mid-twentieth century. The series also contains "everyday" ephemeral pieces such as maps, brochures and travel guides. The Special Collections Research Center also holds books drawn from the Training Library, which are cataloged in the Rare Books Collection.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series XI: Photographs and Audio-Visual Material, spans over 100 years of company history, and represents the richest and most cohesive visual documentation of the company.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series XII: Artifacts, Artwork and Ephemera, contains print materials, visual art pieces, and objects collected for their artifactual value. This series contains samples of paper goods and other supplies used at the company, catalogs and samples of company-branded promotional merchandise, printing artifacts, signs, artwork, customer job samples, and catalog card files. A selected group of customer job samples collected as artifacts, such as boxed and wrapped copies of Four American Books titles, are also included in this series. Many of the items in this series are unidentified and undated.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Because material related to a single topic will usually be found in several different series within the collection, most researchers will find it necessary to browse or keyword-search the inventories to locate all relevant material. For example, while Series V is dedicated to records of the School for Apprentices, important related material is also found in Series VIII and Series XI. In reviewing the inventories, it is important not to overlook oversize materials, artifacts, books, and other unusual items that are often found at the end of series or subseries of the collection.
</p>
<p>

The bulk of this subseries consists of chronological files of editorial photographs of The Printer, dating from 1974-1995. Material in these files includes thousands of editorial photographs, negatives, slides and contact sheets, organized according to the issue of the magazine in which they appeared. Included with these photographs are proofs, dummy copies, and samples of the magazine.

<p>Subseries 3: Financial, contains ledgers, tax forms, reports, leases and other records of the company's financial activities.

<p>This series contains samples of advertising pieces created by RR Donnelley to promote its own services. In many cases, RR Donnelley used a particular customer job as an advertising piece by adding a new cover or insert. In such cases the customer is identified. The particular RR Donnelley service advertised is noted where appropriate. Samples are arranged chronologically within subseries.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: "The Lakeside Press" booklets, contains deluxe printed booklets produced throughout the 1920s to promote a range of the company's services. The booklets exemplify high-end promotional printing of this period, with spectacular illustrations and sophisticated copywriting.</p>

<p>This series collects RR Donnelley's files on its customers, including products (usually called "job samples") that it printed for them. These samples number in the thousands, and are found in several subseries of this series. This series also includes business records such as contracts and agreements, correspondence, photographs, and collections of historical background material on individual customers. This series has been divided into four subseries; while similar types of material can be found across these subseries, each subseries has a distinctly different organizational structure.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Customer Files, includes material on many of RR Donnelley's clients, such as Time-Life, Inc., Sears Roebuck and Company, and Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. Material in this subseries is arranged alphabetically by client name or product title, and includes job samples, contracts and agreements, correspondence, photographs, and historical background material. Samples of mass-market magazines such as Life, Time, People, Business Week, and Fortune are found in this series. Samples of products tend to be selective, rather than comprehensive. Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 5.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Customer Job Samples, collects samples of products printed for an enormous number of clients, from international corporations to small businesses, clubs and individuals. Catalogs, brochures, books, broadsides, periodicals, and packaging are among the more common types of material in this subseries. Library catalog cards, memos, and other supporting material are occasionally found filed with the samples. While the date range of this subseries extends from the late nineteenth to early twenty-first century, most of the samples in this subseries date from the 1920s-1950s. This subseries is arranged alphabetically, usually by the name of the client or the client's product, but occasionally by the title of the product. Material filed under personal names may be found under either the first or last name of the individual (for example, items produced for the Marshall Field department stores are found under both "Marshall Field" and "Field, Marshall." Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 5.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Subject File, contains material similar to that found in the previous two subseries, such as job samples, correspondence, contracts, and historical background material. However, material in this series is arranged alphabetically by subject, rather than by customer or product. Typical subjects include events such as the 1984 Olympic Games; memorial publications for celebrated individuals such as Princess Diana; broad product types such as telephone directories; and units of the company such as the Intervisual Communications group. Material included in this subseries is generally distinguished by its topicality, historical significance or aesthetic quality. Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 5.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Oversize Material and Artifacts, contains job samples, proofs, ledgers, printing plates, and other large-format material transferred from Subseries 1-3. This material can be traced to its original subseries location through the descriptive headings.</p>
<p>Additional samples of products that RR Donnelley printed for clients are found throughout the collection, but particularly in Series IX and XII. Records related to RR Donnelley's business relationships with clients can also be found in Series II, VII, VII, VIII and XI. The photographs in Series XI include images of customer jobs in production, as well as visits of clients to RR Donnelley facilities; this same series also includes oral history recordings that discuss RR Donnelley's relationships to clients.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>A formal program for the training of RR Donnelley's future work force was instituted in the early decades of the 20th century, as the School for Apprentices. Here, boys as young as 12 began their training as skilled workers and craftsmen. Early programs grew into broader orientation, training and professional development curricula, conducted by the Training Department.</p>
<p>This series contains teaching material, work samples, photographs and student records from the original School for Apprentices, and is a particularly rich source of material from the 1910s-1930s. Material from a second apprentice program centered at the company's Crawfordsville, Indiana plant is included in separate files. Also found in this series are course material, certificates, photographs and other records of later training and professional development programs. The final box in this series contains a framed apprenticeship contract. </p>
<p>This part of the archive has little organization below the series level; researchers interested in a particular subject or span of time will need to browse the inventory of the entire series in order to locate all relevant material.</p>
<p>Photographs related to the School for Apprentices are also found in Series XI. Personal papers and memorabilia of RR Donnelley staff who began their careers as apprentices are included in Series VIII and XII.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1930, the Lakeside Press Galleries, located in RR Donnelley's Calumet building, hosted public exhibitions of fine art, book arts and graphic design. Contemporary photography, posters, fine printing and binding, and commercial art were particularly emphasized. Exhibitions were regularly held in this space from 1930 to the 1962, except for a short period during World War II. Additional exhibitions were held in the galleries from November 1974.</p>
<p>This series contains a rich variety of exhibition ephemera and other material related to exhibitions at RR Donnelley, focusing particularly on those held at the Lakeside Press Galleries from 1930 to 1962. The series begins with general files regarding the gallery space, related exhibitions in other galleries, and assorted exhibition ephemera. The following files are arranged chronologically by year, with materials arranged by the titles of individual exhibitions. These items include catalogs, invitations, broadsides, and photographs of galleries and displays. For some exhibitions, there is material related to the organization of the exhibition itself, such as correspondence between curators, company officers and exhibitors; these files include correspondence with artists John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, and collectors such as Mrs. James Ward Thorne.</p>
<p>Oversize material has been transferred to the final two boxes in the collection. This material, which includes several scrapbooks of exhibition ephemera, is arranged chronologically.</p>
<p>Other material related to exhibitions can be found in Series VIII, IX, X, and XI.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series demonstrates RR Donnelley's deliberate efforts to document its own history, and is a rich source of secondary research material and the company's internal analysis of its past. The foundation of this series is the work of Herbert P. Zimmerman, a former RR Donnelley executive who in the mid-twentieth century undertook an extensive study of the company's history. This series contains drafts and typescripts of historical writings by a variety of researchers, as well as primary and secondary source material such as correspondence, publications and photographs. Much of the research and reference material found in this series, particularly in files of the company's early history, consists of photocopies or facsimiles, rather than original material.</p>
<p>To help distinguish among the many research projects and sources that are included, this series is further divided into nine subseries.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Herbert P. Zimmerman, Company History, contains drafts and typescripts of Zimmerman's four-part survey of the company's history from 1864-1927, as well as related correspondence, notes and research material.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, contains material such as correspondence, publications and photographs relating to the town in which Richard Robert Donnelley was born. An oversize publication from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 9.</p>

<p>Subseries 4: Herbert P. Zimmerman, Histories of Customer and Labor Relations, contains drafts, typescripts and research material relating to several of Zimmerman's historical writings.

<p>Subseries 6: Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation, contains publications, photographs, and promotional material related to the company founded by Reuben H. Donnelley, and particularly its work with telephone directories. Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 9.</p>
<p>Subseries 7: Personal Recollections, contains dozens of letters, memos, notes, drafts, oral history transcripts, and other documents composed by employees of RR Donnelley, and other individuals closely associated with the company. In these documents, individuals reflect on their careers at the company, memorable events, business accomplishments, and other personal experiences. Many of these documents were composed in response to personal requests from Zimmerman in the process of compiling source material for his book. While many of the individuals represented were executives of the company, this series also includes the recollections of pressmen, engineers, designers, and many others.</p>
<p>Subseries 8: General Research and Reference Material, includes writings and research files generated through several research projects related to the company's history. This includes additional writings and research files of Herbert P. Zimmerman, as well as material related to an oral history project, undertaken in 1986 at the request of Jack Schwemm. Gaylord Donnelley and Charles Lake worked on this project with Dan Lewis, a graduate student in history at the University of Chicago. </p>
<p>Subseries 9: Oversize Material and Artifacts, includes material transferred from Subseries 2 and Subseries 6. The descriptive folder headings trace the material to its original location in previous subseries.</p>
<p>Additional secondary analyses, historical writings and research files are found in other parts of the collection, particularly Series II, IV and IX. Cassette tapes of oral history recordings are found in Series XI.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains the personal papers of several RR Donnelley executives and prominent employees. This series is further divided into twelve subseries in order to distinguish among the individuals represented.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: C.F. Beezley, Jr. (1882-1947) worked at RR Donnelley for 42 years from 1905-1947, eventually working his way up to become Vice President in Charge of the Catalog Department. Under his leadership, this department became the largest jobbers' catalog compiling organization in the country. Known as the "ambassador of goodwill," Beezley was the official host for many visitors to the plant. Eventually, the Department of State made the RR Donnelley plant a regular stop for important foreign dignitaries who were interested in printing and publishing. Some of the most interesting materials in Subseries 1 are Beezley’s papers from his trip to South America and the party thrown upon his return, as well as his files on racial integration and representation during the Civil Rights era. Also contained in this series are some RR Donnelley publications, as well as photographs taken by Beezley. Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 12.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Igor de Lissovoy (1912-1997) was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and fled with his family to the United States when Lenin rose to power. Igor’s artistic talent landed him a job at RR Donnelley, where he began his career as a pre-apprentice in 1928. He worked his way into the composing department, where he spent 12 years. He moved into production and then design where he worked on the first edition of Life magazine. In 1962 he transferred to the advertising and sales promotion department, where he remained until he retired in 1977. The materials in Subseries 2 consist mainly of examples of de Lissovoy's graphic designs and photography from the time he was a RR Donnelley apprentice to his retirement. </p>
<p>Subseries 3: Alfred de Sauty was born August 26, 1870 in the British Colony of Gibraltar. Following school, de Sauty joined one of the ships of the Eastern Telegraph Company as a junior electrician. During his long periods of time off duty, he became interested in art, and eventually bookbinding. He became a very skilled bookbinder and gained international recognition. In October 1923 he was hired to direct the Extra Bindery at R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company. He remained head of the Extra Bindery until March 1935, when he returned to England. He died there on December 1, 1949 at the age of 79. Subseries 3 contains de Sauty's original binding designs and rubbings from finished bindings. These materials were left behind in the Extra Bindery when he left RR Donnelley. Oversize material from this subseries has been transferred to Subseries 12.</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Gaylord Donnelley (1910-1992) was the grandson of R.R. Donnelley, the founder of the company. Gaylord began his Donnelley career on a part-time basis during school vacations and joined full time upon graduation from Yale University in 1932. He served in a variety of manufacturing jobs in the Chicago division. Shortly after his return from active duty with the Navy in World War II, he was elected Vice President and Secretary of the company. In 1947, he was promoted to Executive Vice President. In 1952 he was named President, and in 1964 Chairman of the Board of Directors. He retired from active management in 1975, after serving the company for 43 years, but continued as a member of the board and chairman of the executive committee. In the early 1980s Gaylord Donnelley systematically reviewed his files. Subseries 4 represents what remains from that review. The majority is correspondence with chairmen of other companies from the 1980s. Many files contain correspondence on important RR Donnelley anniversary events and celebrations. The original order and classification has been retained. </p>
<p>Subseries 5: Thomas Elliot Donnelley entered his father’s printing business after his graduation from Yale University in 1889. Although the printing enterprise was relatively small at the time Thomas Elliot Donnelley came into it, it grew tremendously under his leadership. He became president in 1899 and held that position until 1934 when he became Chairman of the Board. He remained an honorary chairman of the board after his retirement on account of impaired health. He died on February 6, 1955. His genius for planning and executing large printing assignments came into play on many large jobs, including the Montgomery Ward catalog and the original productions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica when it first came to the United States. In 1908, he established one of the earliest schools for apprentice training in this country. The papers in Subseries 5 consist of personal correspondence, mainly with his family.

When he retired, he set up a home studio and continued to design and print stationery, business cards, invitations, and other ephemera until the end of his life. Subseries 11 contains samples of hundreds of his designs (including, in many cases, the entire design sequence from original sketch to final product). This subseries also contains an interesting selection of World War II publications. Oversize material and artifacts from this subseries have been transferred to Subseries 12. The work of C. Prentiss Smith, including many original designs for company products, is often found in other parts of the collection, particularly in Series IX, XI and XII.</p>

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains diverse materials collected under about seventy specific topics significant to the history of RR Donnelley, or to the history of printing in general. These topical headings are organized alphabetically within the series. Many of the headings correspond to departments of the company, clients, events, printing processes, types of products, and special projects. Much of the material in this series consists of RR Donnelley advertising pieces and other promotional items; also found are photographs, correspondence, reports, customer job samples, and artwork. </p>
<p>While material in this series can be used as an introduction to RR Donnelley's involvement with the topics at hand, it should also be viewed in conjunction with related material found elsewhere in the collection. This series contains both content duplicated in other series (for example, there is much duplication of promotional pieces found in Series 1 of this collection) as well as secondary and photocopied material that is mainly supplemental. However, this series also contains important material that is not reflected elsewhere in the collection. In particular, this series contains the collection's strongest representations of the Century of Progress; Extra Bindery and Graphic Conservation; financial printing operations; the Memorial Library and Training Library; data on printing presses operated in the company's plants; the development of the Indian head printer's mark and logo; the Four American Books; and electronic and digital printing processes developed in the 1970s-1990s. </p>
<p>Researchers should note that oversize material is found at the end of this series, forming another alphabetical sequence beginning with Box 505. Topical headings are consistent so that the association of material is clear.</p>
<p>The Special Collections Research Center also holds books drawn from the collection of the Training Library; these are cataloged in the Rare Books Collection.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series consists of print materials drawn from the collections of RR Donnelley's Training Library. While some of the items were printed by RR Donnelley, many were created by other firms, and collected by the library as examples for staff training. The material in this series contains hundreds of samples of fine and specialty printing, much of it influenced by the Art Deco movement. The series also contains "everyday" ephemeral pieces such as maps, brochures and travel guides. Most of the material in the collection dates from the early and mid-twentieth century, with a predominance of material from the 1930s. A large number of items, particularly among the group of calendars, were produced in Germany.</p>
<p>Boxes 523-529 contain samples collected according to subject or format, and mounted for display. Captions on the mounts often include information about the printer and processes used to create the sample piece.</p>
<p>The remaining material in the collection consists of loose material, collected into the same types of categories.</p>
<p>As a collection of representative pieces of twentieth-century printing and design, the material in this series complements the company advertising pieces and customer job samples found in Series III and IV. Other material related to the Training Library, and to company training programs in general, are found throughout the collection, but particularly in Series V, IX, XI and XII.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>While photographs and other visual material are found throughout the collection, this series represents the richest and most cohesive visual documentation of RR Donnelley. Spanning over 100 years of company history, the thousands of images in this series document subjects such as printing technologies and processes, work and leisure activities, plants and facilities, and special events. Audio-visual material, such as sound and video recordings, are also found in this series. A large collection of oral history recordings are included here, as are videos and films on a variety of subjects.</p>
<p>Many of the photographers are not identified, particularly in the case of informal snapshots. However, the company routinely hired professionals to produce formal industrial photographs; in many of these cases, the photographer or studio is identified. Among these, the best-represented is Torkel Korling, a Chicago-based photographer who worked for RR Donnelley on a freelance basis. His work is found throughout this series, and is often identified in folder-level descriptions.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs in this series are black and white prints, though color prints are also found. Corresponding negatives are often found filed with the prints, or in adjacent folders. Other common photographic formats include transparencies and slides.</p>
<p>A variety of audio-visual formats are found in this series. Formats for audio recordings include cassette tapes and 78 rpm records. Audio-visual formats include VHS videocassettes and filmstrips. These materials have not been reviewed for content or recording quality.</p>
<p>To distinguish among the broad types of subjects and formats, this series has been divided into twelve subseries. </p>
<p>Subseries 1-7 consist mainly of black-and-white photographic prints and negatives, and are distinguished by the subjects represented: </p>
<p>Subseries 1: Annual Reports, contains photographs, negatives and transparencies used in RR Donnelley's annual reports. The images often represent personnel, facilities, equipment, products and events. </p>
<p>Some supporting material, such as sample annual reports and editorial correspondence, is also included. This subseries is organized chronologically by year from 1962-1990, though there is little or no material included for many of the years in this date span. Oversize material is located in an additional sequence at the end of this subseries, beginning with Box 553.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Apprentice Schools and Training Programs, contains photographs and negatives showing students, personnel, classrooms, and special events for these programs. Many formal and informal group photographs of apprentices are included in this subseries. Material in this subseries complements the textual and visual material in found in Series V.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Extra Bindery and Graphic Conservation, contains mainly of photographs of jobs produced by these departments; most of the photographs depict leather bound books and are mounted. The subjects of most of these images are not identified. The remaining material in the collection shows staff members, facilities, and binding and conservation techniques in a variety of photographic formats. The photographs in this subseries complement the material on the Extra Bindery and Graphic Conservation departments found in Series IX. </p>
<p>Subseries 4: Industrial Engineering Studies, consists of prints and negatives, most measuring 4" x 5", taken between 1951 and 1966. The images, which were used to analyze work processes, show facilities, equipment, products and personnel in various stages of operations. Though few of the photographs are individually identified, most are roughly sorted according to the process represented. Descriptions of some of these processes are available in earlier inventories of this subseries.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Plants and Facilities, represents several of RR Donnelley's plants in two distinct sequences of material. The first part of this subseries contain prints, negatives and color transparencies, most dating from the mid-twentieth century and organized according to plant location. Including in this part of the subseries are albums and loose photographs showing the construction of the Chicago complex, including the Calumet Avenue plant and auxiliary buildings; other plants in the United States and England are also represented. The second sequence of in this subseries contains slides of similar subjects; the slides date ca. 1960-1980s, and most are also organized according to plant location. The material in this subseries complements other facilities-related material found in Series II.</p>
<p>Subseries 6: Production, includes images of equipment, facilities, products and employees at work. Printing and binding technologies are documented in detail, as are diverse employee occupations. This subseries contains a large number of photographs taken by Torkel Korling, though not all are identified as such. This subseries is further organized into two distinct sequences of photographs: The first includes photographs taken at a variety of plants, particularly in the Chicago complex. The second sequence consists of manufacturing scenes taken entirely at the Crawfordsville plant. Unsorted photographs, some of which are individually indentified, are found at the end of the subseries. </p>
<p>Subseries 7: Personnel, documents the work life and company-sponsored activities of RR Donnelley employees. Some traditional subjects are found, such as individual and group portraits, and scenes of workers on the job; however, most of the photographs in this subseries are informal photographs of leisure activities and events sponsored by the company. These include dinners and parties, sports teams, family-oriented outings, amateur theater productions, and lunch-hour games. Many of these activities were organized by the Lakeside Press Employees Association (LPEA).</p>
<p>Subseries 8: Torkel Korling Matted Photographs, includes a selection of the work of the Chicago freelance photographer who documented many of RR Donnelley's operations during the mid-twentieth century. The photographs in this subseries are black-and-white prints, generally measuring about 12"x10," and supplemented with additional descriptive information on the mats. The images, most of which date from around 1950, show RR Donnelley personnel engaged in day-to-day work, as well as studies of machinery and other equipment. The images are documentary in nature and were often used in company publications; however, many of them are striking in their balance of empathy toward human subjects with clear documentations of work processes. Some additional prints are found interleaved with the matted material. Korling's work is also represented in other subseries of this series, particularly Subseries 6.</p>
<p>Subseries 9-12 are distinguished by format, with various subjects represented in each:</p>
<p>Subseries 9: Slides, contains two broad types of item. The first part of the subseries contains slide presentations, organized chronologically and spanning the years 1969-1990. The slides from these presentations are often supplemented with transcripts and cassette recordings of speeches given with the presentation. The presentations often discuss management topics, strategic goals, company history and culture, and new products. The second part of this subseries is a general collection of thousands of slides, representing subjects similar to those in Subseries 5 and 6. Many of these slides are filed in cards or sheets and are well-identified; however, several boxes of unsorted and unidentified slides are also included. Many of these unsorted slides are individually identified on the boxes or frames.</p>
<p>Subseries 10: Vu-Graph Presentations, contains transparencies with accompanying text, dating to ca. 1950s-1960s. The presentations are on design subjects such as typography and layout, and were likely given in training courses by C. Prentiss Smith, whose personal papers are found in Series VIII.</p>
<p>Subseries 11: Audio Recordings, documents oral histories and company presentations. Most of the items in this subseries are cassette tape recordings of oral histories. Many of the oral histories also include reflections on the Donnelley family, and the individual careers of employees. Recorded between 1992-1995, the tapes are identified according to the dozens of individual employees who participated in the program. As personal recollections of RR Donnelley's development, these oral histories are complementary to material in Series VII, which include transcripts of oral history recordings and interviews. Also found in this subseries are several cassette recordings of presentation material, some of which appears to be related to the slide presentations in Subseries 7. There are also several unidentified cassette tapes. At the end of the subseries are two packaged and sealed 78 rpm records.</p>
<p>Subseries 12: Videotapes and Films, contains VHS videocassette tapes of presentations on management, company history, and Y2K technology compliance. Also included are three filmstrips whose content is not well-identified.</p>

<p>While artifact objects, original artworks, and print ephemera are found throughout the RR Donnelley Archive this series consolidates a wide variety of items collected for their value as visual or physical documents. While some of the items in this series are well-described due to the historical significance they held for the company, other material is unidentified and undated; some ephemeral material lacking direct relationship with the rest of the collection is also included here.</p>
<p>This series has been divided into seven subseries, in order to distinguish among the broad varieties of material included:</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Supply Samples, consists of samples of material, primarily paper goods, used in daily work at RR Donnelley. These include office supplies such as stationery, labels, forms, business cards and checks. Original artwork for some of this material, much of it created by C. Prentiss Smith, is also included. This subseries contains a large sampling of bookplates used at RR Donnelley, and includes correspondence related to the design of Memorial Library bookplates by Rudolph Ruzicka and Stephen Gooden.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Memorabilia and Promotional Items, collects branded promotional objects and merchandise, much of it created to commemorate company achievements, such as the 125th anniversary of the company, or the opening of the headquarters building at 77 West Wacker Drive. A broad range of items is included, from paperweights to golf balls. Also included are historic documents that were framed displayed as commemorative pieces, as well as personal memorabilia significant to company history, such as a framed group of items related to Richard Robert and Naomi Donnelley.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Printing Artifacts, consists mainly of printing plates and printer's cuts. The largest group of items is a set of twenty-three plates of New Yorker cartoons, each with a clipping of the printed version.

<p>Subseries 4: Signage, includes informational broadsides posted on company buildings, a set of aluminum letters that formed a building entrance sign, and a large neon sign representing the RR Donnelley Indian head printer's mark.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Decorative Art, contains paintings, drawings, and reproductions of artworks that represent company buildings, as well as a large number of items whose provenance and significance is not well-identified. Some of these items, including several prints and paintings, appear to have been transferred from the company's Graphic Conservation department.</p>
<p>Subseries 6: Job Samples, includes books that are preserved as artifacts in their original packaging, including shipping boxes and wrappers. These include copies of Moby Dick and Poe's Tales, a variety of Lakeside Classics editions, and Madonna's notorious 1992 book, Sex. Packaging materials for Poe's Tales are also included, as are proofs for several Four American Books illustrations. Reading copies of each of the Four American Books are available in the Special Collections Research Center's collection of rare books.</p>
<p>Subseries 7: Catalog Cards, consists of several distinct sets of catalog card files, as well as unsorted cards. Most, if not all, of the items cataloged were printed by RR Donnelley, and most of the files appear to have originated with the company's Training Library or Memorial Library. The largest and best-organized sets of files are organized according to author and title, publication date, or publisher; there is also a file of jobs printed for University of Chicago. The remaining files are not well identified, and there are several hundred unsorted cards.</p>

<p>This is the largest series in the R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company Archive, and contains samples of thousands of products RR Donnelley printed for its customers, as well as material related to customer relationship management. Material in this series spans the years 1869-2002; however, material is heavily concentrated in the late twentieth century.</p>
<p>Staff of RR Donnelley often collected samples of other printing companies' products for the purposes of research, reference and competitive intelligence; therefore, this series includes samples of items that were not printed by RR Donnelley. Some, but not all of these samples are identified as being printed outside RR Donnelley.</p>
<p>This series is organized into thirteen subseries. Subseries 1-9 primarily contain samples of products printed by RR Donnelley, with a small amount of supporting material such as correspondence and job specifications. Subseries 10-12 document specific aspects of customer relationship management, including sales and product development. Throughout, oversize material has been transferred to Subseries 13. </p>
<p>Subseries 1: Alphabetical Files includes a variety of product samples, filed alphabetically by customer name or product title. While material in this subseries spans the years 1895-2002, the majority of the items are catalog and magazine samples dating from the 1970s-1990s. This subseries also contains smaller numbers of product samples from earlier in the company's history, as well as job specifications, clippings, publicity material, reports, and correspondence with customers.</p>

forms are mass movements and collective behavior, social institutions,
professions, race and ethnic relations, and field work. Much of the earlier
material from McGill or the University of Chicago is found in the later
files reflecting Hughes's continuity of interests.</p>
<p>Subseries 5 and 6 are lectures not tied specifically to a university or
course. These files contain lecture notes and lectures with a few other
course materials such as those outlined above. Both subseries are arranged
chronologically within subject areas. Subseries 7 contains undergraduate and
graduate papers and assignments arranged by students' last names. Titles,
courses, or dates are not consistently identifiable.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series IV, Research and Writings, covers the period 1922-1980 and has been
arranged into eight subseries: (1) Travel Diaries and Memoranda, (2)
Research Materials, (3) Note Cards, ca. 1920s-1930s, (4) Translations, (5)
Book Reviews, (6) Manuscripts, (7) Publishing Correspondence, (8)
Publications. </p>
<p>Subseries 1, Travel Diaries and Memoranda, has been arranged chronologically.
Many of the memoranda are titled and concern places and topics including
Japan and the bombing of Hiroshima, universities and education in the U.S.
and abroad, professional meetings, and current social and political
events.</p>
<p>Subseries 2, Research Materials, is a group of miscellaneous projects with
which Hughes was involved. The general areas in the files reflect Hughes's
areas of study: race relations, occupations, and professions. They are
loosely arranged by date and subject. The first is a student study of
Bridgeport, (Chicago, Illinois) done in 1925-1926. Also included in this
subseries are his work on the German Catholic labor movement and his work
with the Committee on Human Relations in Industry. During his stay in
Germany, Hughes collected German newspapers following the rise of the Nazi
party, which are housed in Oversize Boxes 145-147. A travel diary with notes
from Frankfurt in 1948 is filed in subseries 2, because this travel diary
served as a basis for a lecture and published essay entitled "Good People
and Dirty Work." This subseries also contains material relating to a
National Opinion Research Center study on American priests done in
1970-1971.</p>
<p>The note cards in subseries 3 were generated in his student days at the
University of Chicago. In his memoranda entitled "On My Years in Graduate
School at the University of Chicago, 29 January 1976," Hughes describes the
system: note cards are in the "4 x 6" slips after the W. I. Thomas scheme.
The manuscript being on white, bibliography being on blue and quotations
being on orange colored slips.</p>
<p>There is a small group of translations by Hughes arranged alphabetically by
author in subseries 4. Subseries 5, Book Reviews, is reviews written by
Hughes. The reviews date from 1926 to 1979 and are arranged
chronologically.</p>
<p>Subseries 6, Manuscripts, includes published and unpublished manuscripts,
addresses, and magazine articles. These materials are arranged
chronologically. Included with this subseries are some of the files
generated by the project undertaken by Hughes, Winifred Raushenbush, and
others to publish the papers of Robert Park. Hughes gave most of these files
to the University of Chicago Library where they are now part of the Robert
Park Papers in the Department of Special Collections.</p>
<p>Subseries 7, Publishing Correspondence, has been arranged chronologically and
consists of reviews of his work, requests for reprints, publishing
contracts, and correspondence regarding the publication of some of Hughesís
older titles such as the Chicago Real Estate Board and French Canada in
Transition. Similar letters can be found in Series II.</p>
<p>Subseries 8, Publications, is made up of reprints and smaller books, one of
them a private publication done here at the University of Chicago entitled
Cases on Field Work co-authored by Everett C. Hughes, Buford H. Junker, Ray
L. Gold, and Dorothy Kittel. These are arranged chronologically.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series V, French Canada Studies, has been arranged into two subseries: (1)
General,and (2) Study of the Careers and Career Aspirations of Young
Canadians, 1965. The first subseries consists of notes, memoranda, papers by
and about others in Canada, as well as collections of Canadian newspaper
clippings from the early 1930s to the 1970s documenting topics such as
French Canada during World War II. The arrangement of the files is
chronological. These files were generated during the many visits to Canada
Hughes made after he left in 1938 to teach at the University of Chicago. As
can be seen from the material, Hughes closely watched the many
manifestations of ethnic conflict between French and English speakers in
Canada.</p>
<p>Subseries 2, "Study of the Careers and Career Aspirations of Young Canadians,
Some of French and Some of Other Backgrounds," was a study initiated by
Canada's Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism with the
additional support of McGill University and the UniversitÈ de MontrÈal.
Hughes carried out his study in 1965. Students from both universities were
recruited to assist in the field. The subseries has been subdivided into:
administration and research data. The administrative material consists of
correspondence with both administrators of the project and researchers.
Project proposals, reports, studies of a similar nature, and memoranda by
Hughes and the research team are in this group. The final report to the
Commission, " Career Patterns of Young Montrealers in Certain White-Collar
Occupations," was never published. This research data subseries contains the
interviews done in the field by the project. They include interviews with
individuals working in various professions carried out in 1965. They are
arranged by profession or by corporation that defined profession such as
Bell Telephone.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>The Kansas City and University of Chicago connection was already established
through the Kansas City Study of Adult Life. This work was done under the
direction of Robert J. Havighurst and the University of Chicago's Committee
on Human Development. It was supported by the Carnegie Corporation and
Community Studies, Inc., a research body financed by several local trusts of
Kansas City. Everett Hughes had become affiliated with the Committee on
Human Development in the 1950s and he began talking to Dr. Dimond of the
University of Kansas Medical School about a study of specialization in
medical schools in 1952. The pilot study was underway by the fall of 1955
and was conducted by Howard S. Becker. Most of this team, Becker, Geer, and
Hughes, moved directly into another study of undergraduates at the
University of Kansas, and the final publication for this study was Making
the Grade, 1968. Because the completion of one study was taking place while
the other study was getting underway, and because the records of the two
studies were inter-filed, it seemed appropriate to keep these groups
together.</p>
<p>Subseries VI has been divided into four subseries: (1) Administration, (2)
Articles and Publications, (3) Research Data, and (4) Related Studies. All
these subseries are arranged chronologically. Hughes supervised these
studies for the most part long distance from both the University of Chicago
and Brandeis University, so there is a wealth of reports and memoranda that
fall into the category of correspondence. The correspondence with Community
Studies Inc., which holds correspondence with both Howard S. Becker and
Blanche Geer. Hughes did conduct interviews and manage the projects on site
during some parts of 1959 and 1961. The rest of the field work on record in
this collection was done by Howard S. Becker, Blanche Geer, Marsh Ray, and
Rue Bucher.</p>

<p>Helen MacGill graduated with a double degree in Economics and German from the
University of British Columbia. On hearing a lecture by Winifred Raushenbush
on Chinatown in Vancouver and then speaking with Robert Park, who persuaded
her to come to the University of Chicago and study sociology under a Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Fellowship, Ms. MacGill came to the University in 1925.
Here she met and married Everett Hughes in 1927. Helen was able to complete
her Ph.D. in 1937 under the direction of Robert Park. The next year Helen
and Everett came back to the University of Chicago when Everett received an
assistant professorship.</p>
<p>World War II soon began and with the shortage of the usual male graduate
students to fill the position of editorial assistant at the American Journal
of Sociology, Herbert Blumer offered Helen Hughes the job. She worked as an
editor for the American Journal of Sociology for 17 years from 1944 until
1961, when she and Everett moved to Boston for Everett to take a post at
Brandeis University in 1961.</p>
<p>The only substantive files of her work are from her editorship of a study,
The Status of Women in Sociology, 1968-1972: Report to the American
Sociological Association of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Status of Women in
the Profession.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Audio-Visual series to find a microfilmed manuscript of
The Fantastic Lodge: The Autobiography of a Girl Addict. This monograph was
published in 1961. Helen MacGill edited this work and Howard S. Becker made
the recordings on which the text is based.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series VIII contains reel-to-reel and cassette tapes that consist of
lectures, dictated letters, and memoranda. The single roll of microfilm was
made in 1960 by Helen MacGill Hughes of the manuscript prepared for
Fantastic Lodge: The Autobiography of a Girl Drug Addict (1961). Hughes
dictated many of his letters and memoranda on to dictadisks for
transcription by a secretary. The dictadisk subseries is divided into
dictadisks without transcripts and dictadisks with transcripts. The
arrangement of these sub subseries mirrors the organization of the entire
collection.</p>
<p>The reel-to-reel and cassette tapes as well as the microfilm in this series
are restricted due to their fragile condition or need for special
equipment.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Arranged alphabetically, this series consists of recommendations for students

<p>The Eggan, Fred. Papers consist of professional and personal materials ranging in date from the 1920s to the 1990s. The collection has been arranged into eleven series. The majority of the collection documents Eggan's career as an anthropologist from his years as a graduate student in the 1920s and 1930s until his retirement from the Department of Anthropolgy at the University of Chicago in 1974. The papers provide materials from nearly all phases and aspects of Eggan's academic life. The physical and conceptual core of the collection is Eggan's ethnographic research as consolidated in his Native American and Philippine studies files.</p>
<p>The collection contains numerous types of material including original drafts and manuscripts, reprints, research and lecture notes, course and seminar work, correspondence, and field notes, as well as published and unpublished papers and articles by other scholars. Also present are non-print materials such as photographs, microfilm, sound and video recordings. A restricted series of letters of recommendation written by Eggan on behalf of others has been placed at the end of the collection. Authorship of papers, presentations, and lectures should be attributed to Eggan unless otherwise noted. All course numbers and titles refer to University of Chicago course offerings, and Eggan is assumed to be the course instructor unless other indication is provided.</p>
<p>The arrangement and structural composition of the papers attempt to follow, as nearly as possible, Eggan's own organizational strategies. These strategies tend to be subject or content based. The ethnographic series reflect a geographic ordering of societies which share certain environmental and cultural traits.</p>
<p>The arrangement of each series or subseries moves from the general to the specific within a given subject area. Correspondence, notes, and bibliographies are usually found at the beginning of the series. These are followed by manuscripts and drafts of Eggan's written work, and lectures, as well as course and seminar materials. These are succeeded by material pertaining to other authors, institutions, and related subject areas. Miscellaneous items such as clippings and reprint sets are found at the end of each series.</p>
<p>Series XII is addendum to the main body of the Eggan Papers. The series includes personal and professional materials ranging Eggan’s early academic life in the 1920’s until his death in 1991. It has been divided into 9 subseries. Subseries I contains personal and posthumous materials including memorabilia, calendars, notes and newspaper clippings, and condolence letters and newspaper clippings of Eggan’s obituary. Subseries II contains materials pertaining to Eggan’s activities as an educator, his association with a range of professional institutions and associations, and his role in many anthropological projects during his late career. Subseries III: Correspondence includes both personal and professional correspondence. Notable correspondents include E.E. Evans-Pritchard, Meyer Fortes, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Triloki Pandey and Charles Briggs. Subseries IV incorporates a chronologically organized catalogue of Fred Eggan’s published writings, with some additional drafts and proofs. Subseries V: General Files contains reprinted articles, papers and other writings, some annotated by Eggan. The subseries is arranged alphabetically by author’s last name, or in the case of an unlisted author, by title. Subseries VI: Dorothy Eggan Hopi Dream Research incorporates chronologically-ordered original and photocopied transcriptions of Hopi dreams collected by Dorothy Eggan between 1940 and 1957, and a paper based on her research. Subseries VII: Degrees, Awards and Honors contains the degrees, awards and honors achieved by Fred Eggan during his long career. It incorporates oversize certificates as well as artifacts. Subseries VIII: Photographs, Slides and Negatives incorporates photographic media pertaining primarily to Fred Eggan’s research in the Philippines. It includes oversize photographic prints taken by Eggan and others, including notable Filipino photographer Eduardo Masferré. It also contains glass lantern slides and emulsion negatives that may derive from Fay-Cooper Cole’s research in the Philippines and Indonesia. Subseries IX: Restricted includes personnel and financial materials that are restricted for fifty years.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series holds items ranging in date from 1918 to 1990, and is divided into three subseries.
Subseries 1: Personal Papers, contains notes on the Eggan family history, autobiographical notes, curricula vitae, appointment calendars, and transcripts of interviews and reminiscences. No family correspondence is included in this subseries.
Subseries 2: Appointments, Awards, and Lectureships, preserves correspondence, certificates, speech and lecture notes, photographs, notices and newspaper clippings relating to fellowships, awards, and honors received by Eggan.
Subseries 3: Assessments and Critiques of Eggan's work, provides critical essays and commentaries on Eggan's work by a number of students and colleagues, including Ernest L. Schusky, Raymond D. Fogelson, and Mario Zamora.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This single series is arranged alphabetically by correspondent name. It combines much of Eggan's personal and professional correspondence, dated 1925-1991. Within the personal correspondence, once again there is a gap with respect to family correspondence. Eggan's professional correspondence documents his dialogue with many contemporary social scientists including Ruth Benedict, E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Raymond Firth, Meyer Fortes, Max Gluckman, Alfred L. Kroeber, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Sol Tax, and Leslie White. Significant portions of correspondence are also found in appropriate subject areas throughout the collection.
In addition to correspondence with students and colleagues, much of Eggan's administrative work for various institutions and professional organizations, including the University of Chicago, is represented in the series. This material appears within the alphabetical sequence according to institution or organization name.
</p>
</scopecontent>

<p>This series has been divided into five subseries and contains items spanning the years 1895 to 1990. As a whole, this series focuses on particular individuals and their roles in the development of anthropology.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: General Files, is a collection of correspondence, biographical and autobiographical manuscripts and reprints, bibliographies, memorabilia, media clippings, and obituaries. Most of the individuals represented were personally associated with Eggan as friends, colleagues, students, and teachers. Eggan himself wrote or edited many of the biographies, memoirs, and obituaries and festschriften present in this and the following subseries.</p>
<p>The next four subseries highlight four key figures whose contributions to Eggan's thought and work were significant. Two of these figures, Lewis Henry Morgan (Subseries 2) and H. R. Voth (Subseries 5), were forerunners in the field whose anthropological concerns dovetailed with Eggan's. Morgan made early contributions to the study of Native American kinship and social organization, while Voth provided one of the earliest and most controversial ethnographic accounts of the Hopi. Eggan produced several important articles on Morgan's life and work, including texts for the 1964 Lewis Henry Morgan lectures at Rochester University and the 1977 Smithsonian Institution centennial of Morgan's classic Ancient Society.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: The H. R. Voth Collection, contains approximately 739 photographs of daily and ceremonial Hopi life reprinted from Voth's original 1895 negatives as well as a descriptive catalogue of the prints. By 1964 the original nitrate negatives, housed at Bethel College (North Newton, Kansas), had so severely deteriorated that the Arizona State Museum had five sets of prints reproduced. These sets were distributed to the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Arizona Historical Foundation, the Arizona State Museum, the Bethel College Archives, and Fred Eggan at the University of Chicago. Note: To reproduce any of the images in Subseries 5, permission must be granted by Bethel College, holders of the original negatives.</p>
<p>Subseries 3 and 4 represent A. R. Radcliffe-Brown and Edward Sapir. They are noteworthy, not only for their theoretical contributions to the discipline, but for the formative roles they played in Eggan's life as teachers and mentors. Among the Radcliffe-Brown materials are detailed class notes taken by Eggan which document the courses taught by Radcliffe-Brown during his tenure at the University of Chicago.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>Spanning the years 1924 to 1993, this series is comprised of six subseries: General; Historical Perspectives; Cultural and Ethnological Theory; Research Methodologies; Social Organization; and Development and Change. Throughout these subseries similar types of material predominate, namely manuscripts and reprints of articles by both Eggan and others, course outlines, syllabi, reading lists and notes, bibliographies, lecture and reading notes, correspondence, and conference programs, notes and transcripts.</p>
<p>This series reflects aspects of Eggan's theoretical and methodological interests. The most prominent sections of the series concern social organization and cultural and ethnological theory. Eggan's on-going interests in research methodologies, development, and social change are also well-represented.</p>
<p>Significant within this and the following ethnographic series is the concentration of course work and seminar material represented. These materials include not only those courses taught by Eggan, but likewise certain courses taught by other Chicago anthropologists such as Fay-Cooper Cole, Leslie Spiers, Robert Redfield and Milton Singer.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series has been divided into nine subseries; three of which contain further subdivisions. While Eggan's primary ethnographic interests focused on the Philippines and native North America, Eggan collected an extensive amount of material on other parts and peoples of the world. These secondary interests are represented in subseries on Africa, Asia, Australia and Oceania, Europe, Meso- and South America. The materials in these subseries are course syllabi, notes, and outlines, bibliographies, lecture and research notes, manuscripts and reprints, student papers, project proposals, and dissertations, correspondence, pamphlets, abstracts, and maps and charts. These materials range in date from 1913 to 1978, with the bulk of the series originating from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Europe, contains Robert Pehrson Research Materials. Pehrson was a doctoral student under Eggan and received his Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Chicago. His dissertation concerned the social organization of the Lapps or Saami of northern Scandinavia. After Pehrson's death in 1955, many of his papers, especially his Lappish, northern European, and northern Asian materials, were transferred to Eggan.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series consists of field notes, reading notes, lecture notes, bibliographies, manuscripts, student papers, research proposals, reprints, abstracts, reviews, pamphlets, media clippings, correspondence, and maps and charts. The materials date from 1922-1990 and have been divided by geographical region into 15 subseries.</p>
<p>The structure of the North American Indian Files reflect Eggan's use of the culture area concept to organize his ethnographic materials. Each section begins, where available, with material pertaining to a given culture area. Linguistic groups are next, followed by groups with named cultural or tribal identities. These groups are ordered alphabetically. "Marginal" groups whose ethnic and cultural affinities are debated are placed within particular culture areas according to Eggan's classificatory decisions.</p>
<p>Various field data collected by Eggan and other researchers appear throughout the series. Eggan's field notes on the Choctaw are found in Subseries 6: Southeast, his Cheyenne and Arapaho notes in Subseries 7: Plains, and his Hopi field notes are located in Subseries 13: Pueblos.</p>
<p>Also present in this series are materials pertaining to research projects and court cases in which Eggan was involved or in which he took a special interest. The Foodways Project found in Subseries 12: Southwest, was originally conceived as a pan-American study of native food use, nutrition, and diet from both physio-medical and socio-cultural viewpoints. The Solstice Project, also contained in Subseries 12, concerned on-going archaeological research into the astronomical patterning of the architecture of Chaco Canyon Culture. Eggan played no direct role in the project. Nevertheless, he showed an acute interest in its findings, especially in the years following his retirement, collecting correspondence, manuscripts, reprints, abstracts, and memoranda on the subject until the year of his death.</p>
<p>The Hopi-Navajo land dispute documents, Subseries 14, record the long running territorial battles between the two groups. Eggan served on the American Anthropological Association panel which investigated these disputes. He testified in several court cases on behalf of the Hopi. Similarly, Eggan testified for Zuni plaintiffs in their land claims case against the federal government. (see Subseries 15).</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>This series spans the years 1904 to 1986, and contains field notes, correspondence, manuscripts, student papers, dissertations, research proposals, bibliographies, whole Philippine newspapers, and other media clippings, reports, travel diaries, and photographs. The files are arranged into 13 subseries with general topics such as linguistics, politics, social science research, and also by named cultural identity or tribe. The nucleus of the series is a large amount of field data collected by Eggan and many others concerning peoples of the northern Philippines. Specifically, these field data include maps, climate and language charts, kinship diagrams and genealogies, myth, folktale, and song texts, grammars, and descriptions of rituals. Many of Fay-Cooper Cole's original field notes from 1907-1908 are preserved here as well.
Eggan established long-term connections with colleagues and informants in the Philippines who supplied him with ethnographic information in a variety of forms--correspondence, field notes, manuscripts, and diaries. Among the Ilongot materials is a considerable body of ethnographic and linguistic data originally compiled by ethnologist William Jones in 1908-1909.
Eggan's own field notes concerning the northern Philippines are located in the sections on Bontoc, Nabaloi, Tinguian, Town Field Notes and Photographs, and Sagada.
The final section of the Philippines Files series contains the findings of the American Anthropological Associations' special panel on the "Tasaday Controversy" chaired by Eggan in 1989. The controversy involved debate concerning the extent to which the Tasaday had lived in isolation and technological primitiveness prior to their "discovery" by Westerners in 1971.

<p>The Louis Gottschalk Papers include correspondence, memos, reports, and other material which extensively document his scholarly endeavors as well as his professional activities. Research notes and materials used in Professor Gottschalk's research on the life of Lafayette constitute approximately half of the material. Also included are reprints of Gottschalk's articles, tapes and handwritten copies of his lectures, and the dissertation abstracts and term papers of his students.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is divided into eleven series:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I: General Correspondence
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I contains the bulk of his letters to and from fellow historians. Gottschalk exchanged many memos and letters with colleagues at Chicago. In particular, his relationships with William T. Hutchinson, Bessie Louise Pierce, Avery Craven, and Bernadotte Schmidt are illuminated. Moreover, the ever-widening dialogue among historians regardless of national boundaries is amply recorded here; witness the trans-Atlantic correspondence with Albert Mathiez, Georges Lefebvre, and Gilbert Chinard. And, as Gottschalk became more involved with the development of the historical profession within the United States, his correspondence with American historians such as Merle Curti, Arthur Schlesinger, Sr., William L. Langer, Crane Brinton, and R. R. Palmer multiplied. Several letters from Gottschalk's mentors at Cornell, Carl Becker and Charles Hull, are scattered throughout this chronological series, as are numerous letters from his classmate, Leo Gershoy.
</p>

<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>The Gitel P. Steed papers, dating from 1907 to 1980, have been arranged in eight series. The basic organization of materials in these series conforms closely to the organization of the papers upon their arrival. The main feature of the collection is the material on three Indian villages in Series III to V, where the bulk of the collection is found.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Research notes from the project are found in four basic forms: life histories, general notes, field notebooks, and note extracts. Life histories comprise typed transcriptions of sets of interviews with a select number of informants as well as results and notes taken on psychodiagnostic tests administered by the researchers. General notes are typed notes that the researchers maintained on a daily basis, in which they included the results of participant-observation in the village. Field notebooks are the rough, handwritten primary sources from which both of the former sets of notes were transcribed. Finally, note extracts refer to excerpts cut, sometimes in thin strips of as little as one line of type, from both the general notes and the life history material and then refiled under topical categories such as religion, economics, and caste and kinship. Steed and her team also compiled detailed topical indices to both the general notes and the life histories. The most elaborate indices appear in a subseries of Series III.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Certain conventions adopted by Steed and her research team have been maintained in the collection. These conventions include (1) the use of pseudonyms and informant numbers to protect the anonymity of informants, and (2) the analysis of life history data, psychodiagnostic tests, and general notes, which has led to duplicated material in different parts of the collection. Pseudonyms apply to both villages and individual informants within each village. The village pseudonyms and informant numbers used in this inventory are the same as those used by the research team. Informant lists found at the beginning of Series III, IV and V list basic information (name, age, gender, and caste) on each informant by number. In cases where there was no informant number provided for a particular individual, the procedure was to label these cases "unnumbered informant."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Duplication of materials in the collection occurs primarily in Series III through Series V. Excerpts of life histories are found in the subsequent topical subseries, which include government, politics and Rajputs, caste and kinship, economics, and religion. The psychodiagnostic tests are cross-filed under the life history of a particular informant and under their own subseries. The general notes are excerpted in the topical files. Furthermore, all three types of data--life histories, psychodiagnostic tests, and general notes--are in part transcripts from the field notebooks.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series comprises materials from Steed's research from 1947 to 1949 among Chinese immigrants in New York City. It includes transcripts of several informant life histories collected by Steed as well as a manuscript by Ruth Bunzel. </p>
<p>The project, under the direction of Ruth Bunzel, was funded initially by a grant from the Human Resources Division of the Office of Naval Research, and coincided with the trend in anthropology during and just after WWII to study "culture and personality."</p>
<p>Steed worked with individuals and families who had migrated to New York fromChina's Kwantung Province, and used primarily life histories, community "self-analysis," and projective, psychodiagnostic tests. She collected data on friendship and childhood, among other topics.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains general and preliminary material related to Steed's research work in India. The series is divided into five subseries: General Files, Seminar on Rural India, Urban Life Histories and Tests, Note Cards, and Maps And Charts. (A description of the Field Project follows the subseries description).</p>
<p>Subseries 1: General Files, contains Steed's writings on the India research, including her dissertation as well as a screenplay she wrote based on characters in Kasandra; basic research materials used in the psychodiagnostic tests administered as part of the gathering of life histories; a preliminary research report; newspaper clippings, correspondence, and bibliographies; and a set of detailed inventories of the papers compiled in 1980 by James Silverberg, one of the original project team members. These inventories may be of value to the researcher who wishes to know more about the kind of material located in the files.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Seminar On Rural India, comprises the set of lectures that Steed presented at Columbia University in 1952-1953. These lectures represent her first and perhaps most thorough examination of her fieldwork material. In these lectures she clearly states her theoretical goals and research methods.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Urban Life Histories, contains material which was compiled in urban India prior to the village studies. These interviews and tests functioned in part as trials and in part as points for comparison to the subsequent rural studies.</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Note Cards, includes two card boxes of field data analysis, consisting of cut and paste notes taken from the General Notes and grouped into a set of topical areas. A third box of note cards consists of reading research notes on books and articles about India.</p>
<p>Subseries 5: Maps and Charts, contains maps that range in scale from the Indian sub-continent to state and district maps as well as maps of the villages produced by the research team. The charts consist of large kinship diagrams as well as posters of caste and marriage relations. Some maps from Steed's early fieldwork in Greenland are also to be found here. These latter are, however, the only material from her Inuit research in the collection. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains all of the research materials produced from the study of Kasandra, a village in Gujarat State. These files were divided into eighteen subseries.</p>
<p>Subseries 1, Informant Life Histories and Psychodiagnostic Tests, contains life history material for 25 informants and includes a personal narration as well as a set of psychodiagnostic tests. The personal narration consists of typed transcriptions of interviews that took place in some cases over the course of an entire year. Informants were asked to speak and reflect as freely as possible on the things that they felt affected their life as they grew up and interacted with others. The psychodiagnostic tests include one or more of the following: Rorschach (which asks informants to identify shapes in ink blots), Thematic Apperception Test (which informants are shown a series of illustrations and asked to talk about the situation, people in it, what they might be doing, thinking, or feeling), Horn-Hellersberg (a drawing test), Draw-a-man (which informants are asked to draw and comment on a man, woman and child), and Color Association Test (designed for India, where informants are given a set of words and asked to</p>
<p>associate a color with the idea conveyed by the words). The amount of data varies for each informant.</p>
<p>Subseries 2, Psychodiagnostic Tests, contains the results of all tests categorized not by informant but by the test type. The tests were administered to more informants than were asked to give personal narration's.</p>
<p>Subseries 3 and 4, General Notes, contain notes by Gitel Steed and James Silverberg, respectively. These are typed transcripts from field notebooks that contain daily observations of life and work in Kasandra and have been chronologically arranged.</p>
<p>Subseries 5, Census Data, contains data of the village, including economic information categorized by household and caste. A set of maps of Kasandra is also included. Some of these maps are smaller versions of those found in Series II, subseries 5.</p>
<p>Subseries 6, Indices, contains a set of indices that Steed and her team devised in order to locate data on certain topics within their notes. Indices for demography, caste, politics, economics, religion, child behavior, and social relations are included. These indices reference the dates and page numbers of data to be found in general notes, life histories, and psychodiagnostic tests.</p>
<p>Subseries 7 through 13 are topical. Government, Politics, and Rajputs; Caste and Kinship; Economics; Land Tenure; Land Utilization Survey; Structure of Family and Child Life; and Religion. These subseries include maps, charts, genealogies, survey results, copies of government surveys and reports, a few manuscripts on the specified topics, and many extracted notes. The extracted notes are for the most part cut-and-pasted portions taken from general notes and life histories.</p>
<p>Subseries 14 through 16, Field Notebooks, were kept by Steed, Silverberg, and others, respectively. These are the notebooks that the researchers carried with them to their interviews and on their daily rounds in the village. Most of the notebooks were later typed up and their entries can be found in other places in the collection. It is not always clear which ones have been typed and which ones have not. Aside from the two main researchers, Steed and Silverberg, others also kept notebooks, including both Indian and non-Indian research assistants as well as informants themselves. An account book kept by Robert Steed is also found here. The notebooks are arranged chronologically, and headings correspond to those found on the notebooks themselves.</p>
<p>Subseries 17, Drawings, contains a large number of watercolors and drawings, in pencil, pen, and charcoal, by informants of all ages. Informants drew people, animals, houses, and landscapes as well as other objects of everyday life.</p>
<p>Subseries 18, Interviews, 1970-1971, contains a set of interviews Steed conducted on a return visit to India in 1970-1971. Accompanied by her husband, Steed conducted several interviews, some with her previous informants, to evaluate perceptions of social change in the intervening twenty years.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains eleven subseries and includes similar material to those listed above for Kasandra. Nawabpur was a predominantly Muslim village in Uttar Pradesh where the researchers moved for their second year in India. Steed left halfway through their stay in Nawabpur due to illness, and James Silverberg took over the direction of the project during her absence. Steed's general notebooks were continued, in series, by other researchers after she left the field. There are additionally a series of notes taken by Grace Langley, an American graduate student who joined the project as an assistant this second year.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains five subseries and includes the typewritten notes and data collected by G. Morris Carstairs while in Deoli, the third village included in the India project. Carstairs worked for the most part alone and stayed in the village for approximately six months. A psychiatrist, Carstairs was mostly interested in life history material, and therefore the bulk of his data is on particular individuals.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains 70 photographs by Gitel Steed as well as the artwork of Robert Steed, an artist by profession. Most of Steed's photographs are believed to come from Kasandra, though some from Nawabpur are included as well. These black-and-white photographs portray parents and children, gods and rituals, and a variety of village scenes. Some of her India photographs appeared in Edward Steichen's exhibit on "The Family of Man" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1955 and are reproduced in the book of the same title. Several negatives are also included in the series.</p>
<p>Robert Steed, having accompanied his wife to India, spent a great deal of his time sketching the villagers, their houses, shrines, etc. The collection here includes small pencil sketches on index cards, color and black-and-white xeroxes of other sketches still in the possession of the Steed family, and several watercolors of villagers and of village religious sites.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains manuscripts and publications that were in Steed's possession. These articles are on a wide variety of topics, primarily on India, and date from 1932 to 1977. Some of the manuscripts are early versions of what later became influential publications on India (the works of McKim Marriott and Bernard Cohn, for example). Most of the manuscripts in this series are on India.</p>

<p>The University of Chicago's collection of books from the John Hay library consists of books purchased by William E. Barton from Barker's Art Store of Springfield, IL in 1926. The main focus of Barton's purchase had been a collection of law books from the offices of Abraham Lincoln and William H. Herndon. At this time, however, Barton also acquired 19 volumes from the personal library of John Milton Hay. Twelve of these books are part of this collection. Several of these books are annotated in what is alleged to be Hay's own hand and their publication dates correspond roughly to the period during which Hay served on Lincoln's White House staff.</p>

<p>This collection consists of 17 laboratory notebooks developed by Urey and the students he mentored. Most of the notebooks date from the mid-1930s, immediately following Urey's discovery of deuterium and spanning the award of his Nobel Prize and further research in isotope separation at Columbia University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Many of the students whose notebooks are included here made important contributions to their fields, both in their work with Urey and later in their careers. Represented here are Harry G. Thode, a prominent Canadian nuclear chemist and key figure in the development of McMaster University; Charles A. Bradley, with whom Urey introduced the Urey-Bradley force field; Weldon G. Brown, who went on to serve as a professor of organic chemistry at University of Chicago; and several others who performed significant research in isotope separation under Urey's mentorship.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The notebooks in Box 3 are not identified by the researchers who developed them, but are likely to be Harold Urey's own, or possibly those of his students.

<p>The Leigh Hunt and Craik Family Collection contains nine signed letters from members of the Craik Family to Leigh Hunt. Six of the letters are signed “Geo L Craik,” but it is unclear whether this is George Lillie Craik, the Scottish essayist, or his nephew, Henry Craik’s son, also named George Lillie Craik. Two are signed “Mary Craik.” It is presumed that these letters are from Dinah Maria Craik, the wife of George Lillie Craik, the younger. Also included is one letter signed from Jannette Craik, George Lillie Craik’s (the essayist) wife. Most of the letters are undated, though the dates available place the letters 1849-1889.</p>

<p>Series I, Correspondence Chronological File, 1953-1968 contains general correspondence related to the CCF and IACF. </p>
<p>Series II, Correspondence and Subject Files, 1948-1978 contains correspondence, reports, manuscripts and clippings filed topically by the Paris Office of the CCF and IACF. </p>
<p>Series III, Seminars, 1950-1977 documents the IACF's programs to encourage the work of intellectuals in all parts of the world by bringing together intellectuals, from regional or national areas or internationally, to consider specific issues or problems. The issues considered in the seminars ranged from Twentieth Century Masterpieces (Paris 1952), The Future of Freedom (Milan 1955), The New Metropolis in the Arab World (Cairo 1960), The East-West Music Encounter (Tokyo 1961), Inter-University Cooperation in West Africa (Freetown 1961), The Formation of Elites in Latin America (Montevideo 1965) to The Intellectual and Power (Aspen 1973). Two seminars will be of particular interest to those researching the history of the CCF: The Founding Conference (Berlin 1950) which articulated the organization's goals and a tenth anniversary celebration, Progress in Freedom (Berlin 1960), which produced considerable documentation on the accomplishments of the CCF's first ten years and which reaffirmed its mission for the 1960's.</p>
<p> Series IV, Financial Files, 1951-1968, documents the routine financial transactions of the CCF. It includes bank statements, receipts, royalty notices, memoranda, airline and other travel receipts, and other minor financial records. Most of the material is dated 1951-1966. </p>
<p> Series V, Documentation and Ephemeral Publications, 1950-1972, documents one of the major initiatives of the CCF and IACF and contains record copies of newsletters, pamphlets, photographs, illustrations, scrapbooks and recordings produced by the organizations. The records of the journal Preuves are in Series VII. Records of Der Monat, a German language journal associated at some points in its publication history with the IACF form a separate collection. </p>
<p> Series VI, Latin American Institute of International Relations (ILARI), 1954-1972, contains records associated with the Instituto LatinAmericano de Relaciones Internationales, a partner institute to the CCF, founded in Lima, Peru in 1965 under the directorship of Luis Mercier Vega. Among ILARI's primary goals was distribution of CCF publications in Latin America, and establishment of new centers for study, primarily in South America.</p>
<p>Series VII, Preuves Papers, 1951-1969 includes the records of Preuves, a journal sponsored by the CCF which appeared monthly between 1951 and 1969, had a closer relationship to the CCF than other sponsored journals because it was published in Paris, the Congress' headquarters. Its editorial policy was characterized by three areas of special interest: European intellectuals in relation to emergent European community; the situation and problems of intellectuals in communist states; and colonial wars and the consequences of decolonization.</p>
<p> Series VIII, Edward Shils Papers, 1958-1975, contains correspondence to and from Edward Shils.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series I contains general correspondence related to the CCF and IACF, organized in an alphabetical sequence for each year from 1953 to 1968. Correspondence to and from Edward Shils may be found in Series VIII.</p>

It is divided into two subseries: Subseries I: Correspondence and Subject Files, 1948-1967 and Subseries II: Correspondence and Subject Files, 1967-1978. Subseries I consists of the correspondence and subject files from the founding of the Congress for Cultural Freedom to the reorganization of the CCF into the International Association for Cultural Freedom in 1967. Subseries II consists of the correspondence and subject file of the International Association for Cultural Freedom. Due to the continuity between the two organizations, there is some overlap between the two subseries. Correspondence to and from Edward Shils may be found in Series VIII.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series III comprises files documenting the regional and international seminars held by the IACF to discuss specific issues or problems. Files contain correspondence, minutes, proceedings and reports, press clippings, and other published materials.</p>
<p>The material is arranged chronologically by date of seminar; a small group of administrative papers not related to particular seminars is held at the end of the series. For each seminar material is approximately ordered as follows: 1) correspondence detailing seminar arrangements; 2) planning material and the statement of purpose for the seminar; 3) lists of participants considered, invited and attending each seminar; 4) programs; 5) papers presented (in both original language and translation); 6) reports; 7) press clippings; 8) transcriptions of proceedings and unpublished manuscripts. Since the size and scope of seminars varied widely not every seminar is represented by every category of materials.</p>
<p>This collection does not contain documentation of all seminars held by the CCF and IACF. Photographs and tape recordings relating to seminars are in Series V. (Documentation: Photographs.) Correspondence to and from Edward Shils may be found in Series VIII.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Publication and distribution of printed matter was a major effort of the IACF. Record copies of these publications have been organized in Series V by form.</p>
<p>Subseries 1: Newsletters. IACF newsletters were a service to newspaper and magazine editors throughout the world. Directed to editors they contained information and suggestions on issues of concern to the Association. Some presented general background information (e.g., Informations du Congrès pour la Liberté de la Culture, which appeared in several languages) while others dealt specifically with one issue (e.g., Censure contre les arts et les pensées) or one geographic area (e.g., The Free Spirit, bulletin of the Australian Committee for Cultural Freedom. Newsletters are arranged by language, then alphabetically by title, and finally in order of appearance. Information about a particular newsletter (e.g., title changes, issue numbers, complete or incomplete runs) is recorded in the inventory when known.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Pamphlets. Pamphlets were generally intended to call attention to specific problems or issues and were frequently offered in several languages. They have been sorted alphabetically by country or continent.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Photographs, Illustrations, and Scrapbooks. Most of the photographs relate to seminars. They have been arranged in parallel order to Series III and are identified by the cities and dates on which the seminars were held. Some of the photographs and the scrapbooks relate to exhibitions or other IACF sponsored events and activities and are identified in the inventory. This Subseries has been cross-referenced in Series II and III. Also included in this series are several illustrations and large posters.</p>
<p>Subseries 4: Audio Recordings. The audio recordings relate to seminars. They have been arranged in parallel order to Series III and are identified by the cities and dates on which the seminars were held. This Subseries has been cross-referenced in Series II and III.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>In late 1965, an organizational meeting took place in Lima, Peru to outline the Latin American Institute of International Relations (also known as ILARI, or the Instituto LatinAmericano de Relaciones Internationales). The meeting was led by Luis Mercier Vega, the director of the institute. The separation of the Latin American department of the Congress for Cultural Freedom resulted in ILARI being established as an independent entity. ILARI continued to operate as a partner institute to the CCF. The primary goal of ILARI was to help distribution of CCF publications in Latin America and establish new centers for study, primarily in South America. ILARI was officially incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland in January of 1966. Series VI contains materials specific to ILARI, and is divided into 4 Subseries. Due to the nature of the collection, there is some overlap between Subseries. </p>
<p>Subseries 1: Correspondence. Letters, telegrams, postcards, memoranda, and other general correspondence is contained in Subseries 1. This Subseries is further divided into three Sub-subseries. The first contains correspondence primarily concerned with the administration of ILARI and general correspondence. The second is organized by location, either by country, city, or specific seminar. The third contains correspondence specific to several publications, including Aportes and Mundo Nuevo. </p>
<p>Subseries 2: Manuscripts. The second Subseries contains articles for the numerous publications distributed by ILARI, as well as papers delivered at various conferences and seminars. There are both final and draft copies of these manuscripts, and are arranged alphabetically by author. </p>
<p>Subseries 3: Reports and Projects. Memoranda, forms, and reports exist for numerous projects and seminars.

<p>Preuves, a journal sponsored by the CCF which appeared monthly between 1951 and 1959, had a closer relationship to the CCF than other sponsored journals because it was published in Paris, the Congress' headquarters. Its editorial policy was characterized by three areas of special interest: European intellectuals in relation to emergent European community; the situation and problems of intellectuals in communist states; and colonial wars and the consequences of decolonization.</p>
<p>The Preuves papers consist primarily of correspondence, although they also include a substantial section of manuscript material. The correspondence is arranged alphabetically by subject with folders containing other material so designated, e.g., distribution statistics, newsletters, memoranda, etc. The original order was preserved where possible; hence, some correspondence is arranged alphabetically and some chronologically.</p>
<p>Major correspondents include the Editorial Committee, consisting of François Bondy (political and literary director of Preuves, as well as director of publications for the Congress), Jean Bloch-Michel (literary editor and director-general of Censure, another CCF publication), and Jacques Carat (editor-in-chief and general administrator). Extensive correspondence of Louis Mercier Vega, editorial secretary, is also included. The Preuves papers also contain records of affiliate organizations such as "Amis de Preuves" (a book club), "Amis de la Liberté" (the French CCF group whose name was changed in the 1960's to "Cercles Pour la Liberté de la Culture") and the "Mardis de Preuves" (a Tuesday night debate society). These groups comprised a support network for the journal, contributing financial aid beyond revenues derived from subscriptions.</p>
<p>All manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by author's last name, preserving the original order of a major block of manuscripts. However, some manuscripts were originally ordered by the issue in which they appeared. These groups of manuscripts were broken up and integrated into the alphabetical sequence. Titles of manuscripts where listed indicate the presence of two or more manuscripts by a single author. Corrected galley proofs are filed with the author's manuscripts.</p>

<p>The O'Gorman Mahon Papers comprise some three thousand documents, the personal records of Charles James Patrick Mahon (ca1800-1891), a flamboyant figure in nineteenth-century Irish politics. He styled himself "The O'Gorman Mahon," using his mother's maiden name and his surname in this title reminiscent of the Irish chieftains. The first and largest part of the papers (boxes 1-7) consists largely of correspondence received by Mahon during the years from 1824 to 1891, but includes also several drafts of letters from Mahon. The correspondence is arranged chronologically. The second segment of the collection (boxes 7-9) contains materials from court cases in which Mahon was involved, documents pertaining to various business ventures, a letter-book, diary (1870-1874), passport, election posters (etc.), and two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings, mainly about the Irish political issues in which Mahon was involved.</p>
<p>Some of Mahon's numerous correspondents include: Ellen Courtenay, Daniel O'Connell, Ferdinand de Lesseps, Lord Palmerston, Ann Choquet, John Adams-Acton, Henry Cardinal Manning, Captain William O'Shea, Lord Francis Conyngham, Charles Stewart Parnell, William Gladstone, John Redmond, James O'Kelly, T.P. O'Connor, and G.O. Trevelyan.</p>
<p>The collection also includes a series of letters and a prison diary from Melville White, who appealed to Mahon for help in securing his release while Mahon was visiting Peru. Another large body of documents in the collection pertains to a venture Mahon was involved in to establish the Anglo-Prussian Bank. Letters from Mahon's ward, Ann Choquet, makes up a significant portion of the collections as does correspondence from the sculptor John Adams-Acton and his wife Jeanie, a writer. Adams-Acton was supposedly commissioned by Mahon to execute a bust of Pope Leo XIII. When Mahon collection was first organized it contained one of the largest known bodies of letter of Captain William O'Shea.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy segment of the correspondence is the group of nine letters from Charles Stewart Parnell, dated from 1880 to 1888, including three written from Kilmainham Prison. In addition, there are three drafts of letters from Mahon to Parnell, including one of a reply to a telegram sent by Parnell. It was written after the O'Shea divorce proceedings had been completed and Parnell was attempting to reassert his authority in the party.</p>

<p>The collection contains a detailed personal journal, correspondence, research materials, and drafts of several books. It is divided into 7 Series.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I, Personal, contains personal items, biographical information and curriculum vitae, arranged alphabetically.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II, Correspondence, contains general correspondence, arranged alphabetically by correspondent, and a collection of greeting cards arranged chronologically.

<p>Series III, University of Chicago, contains material from McCaul's time as a professor at the University. It is divided into two subseries. Subseries 1, Administrative, contains memoranda relating to a dean search and other Education Department and general University business. In addition, the series contains collected flyers, newsletters, memoranda, and other material reflecting and discussing the political climate on the U of C campus in the late 1960s. Much of the material has to do with the 1969 student sit-in in the University Administration building, the University's Kalven Report, and subsequent disciplinary actions taken against students. Subseries 2, Teaching, contains course materials – largely reading lists, article photocopies, and bibliographic notes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV, Research, contains notes, photocopies and transcriptions of source material (mostly correspondence of and concerning John Dewey), and other research materials not housed with particular book or article drafts. It also includes articles by others which clearly related to McCaul's research interests, and the typescripts of two autobiographical works by Margaret A. Haley.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series V, Writings and Speeches, contains book and article manuscripts, texts of speeches and talks, notes, correspondence relating to specific works, and some research material. Material is arranged alphabetically by the title of the work, and material for each work is arranged chronologically. One of McCaul's large-scale works, The Black Struggle for Public Schooling in Nineteenth Century Illinois, had several working titles. Material relating to this book is labelled and alphabetized according to the working title on the manuscript, typescript, correspondence, or original folder. The final title is also indicated in the folder headings. In many cases, McCaul's files and correspondence merely referred to the work as [The] Struggle for Schooling; material so labelled retains that labelling here.

<p>The bulk of the material dates from 1940 to 1990. Morgan was a prolific writer and photographer; his journal, correspondence and photographs make up the majority of the collection. He also preserved many of his notes and notebooks, as well as his star charts, star spectra, observation cards and astronomical tables and calculations. The divisions between the series are not strict and the subjects overlap in the series divisions. When possible the original folder names were preserved.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The papers have been divided into ten series: I. Journals, II. Correspondence, III. Research, IV. Symposia, Conferences and Workshops, V. Administration and Organizations, VI. Teaching and Counseling, VII. General, VIII. Photography, IX. Oversize, and X. Restricted.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The series contains more than 250 notebooks. For more than thirty years Morgan wrote regularly, on average, between three or four times a week. The notebooks are in excellent condition and usually contain newspaper clippings, notes, and photographs related to the writings. The main objective of the diary was to provide Morgan with a self-counsel, a kind of self psychoanalysis. Nonetheless, the journal contains numerous entries in which the author relates different astronomical problems, his research concerns, and his research methods. The journals are also rich in artwork, as well as movie and book reviews, and philosophical musings.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains most of the files related to Morgan's research in astronomy. </p>
<p>Subseries 1 and 3 contain Morgan's research and observation notebooks and the tables and calculations he created. Spectra, Observation cards, Sky Maps, and general graphic material are grouped together in Subseries 2, "Graphic Material."</p>
<p>Subseries 4, Research and Scholarly Writings includes research materials collected by Morgan, including papers by other scientists. Subseries 5, Publications contains notes, manuscripts and offprints of his own writings. </p>

<p>The collection, Codex 1445, consists of 96 fascicles written in the early 19th century compiled by an unknown witness to Teresa Bandettini’s productions. The poems are numbered and titled. Fascicle 88 is missing from our collection.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection was assembled, as stated in the first person in the Preface, by one of Bandettini’s patrons and hosts, whose house in Viareggio was a regular venue for the poet’s improvisations in 1794 and 1795. The unnamed compiler relates that on those occasions several identical transcriptions of poems n. 36-40 were taken simultaneously by different copists, evidently eager to capture Bandettini’s famed impromptu creations in the flow of the performance. The compiler endeavours to give as complete a transcription as possible, adding material as later performances occurred in the following years, giving an account of other occasions (in Perugia, Pisa, Livorno, etc) in which other poems where performed and transcribed, redacting a substantial gathering of ‘Frammenti’ (poems for which a complete transcription could not be obtained, not even through Tommaso Trenta with whom the compiler appears to have been acquainted), and regretting that much material escaped transcription - due partly to the absence of scribes at times, and partly to Bandettini’s personal dislike for the process.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As described in the original dealer description the extent of the collection compares favourably with the size of the Bandettini papers in the Lucca Archive and, most significantly, with Ms Vat. Lat. 10218 in the Vatican Library. The Vatican manuscript gathers dozens of Bandettini’s poems in a collection compiled between 1776 and 1800 by the secretary of the literary Academy of Lucca Tommaso Trenta (Artinio Dionisiade in Arcadia).

<p>The Manning work is a rough draft, in the author's hand, with many corrections and erasures. It is very incomplete, with parts out of sequence. Either Manning did not finish these chapters, or we do not have all that he wrote.</p>

The manuscript is assembled in quarto format with 136 paper leaves in a half-vellum binding with marbled boards. Each page is ruled with 24 lines. The text is written by one hand in brown ink. Each item is numbered in a red pencil which has also annotated letter 33 (on fol. 50r). 17 of the items are marked by bookmarks inserted by a later owner, with brief notes in French about the contents of the marked items.
</p>

The text consists of 94 items, mostly copies letters written or received by Jean Marie Cahusac. The items are organized chronologically with dates ranging from August 30, 1806 to July 7, 1836. The contents include accounts of Cahusac's travels throughout Europe, the United States, and the French West Indies; Cahusac's opinions on governance and religion in those regions; personal letters to family members and friends; petitions to political figures, including notably the Marquis de La Fayette; and finally, a letter to King Louis Philippe.

<p>The Robert W. Rietz Papers span the years 1876-1982, with the bulk of materials covering the period from 1950 through 1954. These materials reflect Rietz’s tenure at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and include reports, scholarly papers, and conference proceedings, as well as a large collection of publications from Indian Reservations and other organizations working with American Indians in the 1950s and 1960s. The collection also includes official and personal correspondence and papers that bear testimony to the dynamic social and collective life of an Indian Reservation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is divided in four series. Series I (Fort Berthold Agency) constitutes the bulk of Rietz’s papers and is sub-divided chronologically in two subseries: the first (1876-1949) gathers materials prior to Rietz’s arrival. Subseries 2 (1950-1954) follows his time as community analyst and relocation officer. Common to both sub-series are materials pertaining to Indian Legislation, including petitions and hearings of Senate committees on Indian Affairs; Tribal Council documents, including committee meetings minutes, resolutions, and electoral processes; the education situation at the reservation, including school enrollment figures and training programs; and finally, the Garrison Dam project, from the negotiation leading up to the purchase of Indian land in the late 1940s to various studies conducted by the Missouri River Basin Investigation office. Subseries 2 presents the Agency’s bureaucracy more thoroughly, both within the reservation and in relation to the Bureau more broadly, and offers a number of research possibilities into the civic and community life of the reservation. Also included in this subseries are personal accounts on the shortcomings and successes of the Agency’s national relocation and assistance programs, data on Indian population, as well as the complete collection of the Agency’s News Bulletins and Daily News Sheets for these years.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II (Action Anthropology) contains ethnographic and anthropological material from the Tama/Fox project in Iowa and Forth Berthold, from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Subseries 1 pertains to work led by Sol Tax among the Mesquakies and Fox Indians, conducted among others by Rietz, Fred Gearing, Eugene Fugle, and Lisa Peattie, and includes ethnographic material (field notes, manuscript drafts), publications, research proposals, and financial records. Subseries 2 is more strictly anthropological. Of particular relevance here are field notes by Robert Merrill, Edward Bruner, W. H. Brokaw, Ethel Nurge, and Rietz himself. In addition, this subseries includes genealogical charts of members of the Indian community, as well as Rietz’s professional and personal documents and correspondence from his years in Fort Berthold.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III contains materials pertaining to educational projects in which Rietz was directly involved, including the Summer Workshops on American Indian Affairs for American Indian College Students (1956-1962), the Canadian Indian Workshop at the University of Manitoba (1966), as well as Rietz’s teaching career in Illinois (1967-68). Also included are documents from Rietz’s tenure at the American Indian Center in Chicago directly related to educational projects as well as other community agencies dealing with Native American affairs, including but not limited to, the Clyde Warrior Institute in American studies, the American Friends Service Committee, the Carnegie Corporation for Cross-Cultural Education, the Chicago Indian Ministry, the American Indian Development center, and the University of Chicago Community Service Workshop.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV consists of publications, organized thematically in six sub-series: subseries 1 contains official bulletins and newsletters published by Indian Reservations, including the neighboring agency of Fort Yates (“Standing Rock”) in North Dakota, or the Pine Ridge Bulletin, in South Dakota. These bulletins, collected during Rietz’s tenure at Fort Berthold and later in Chicago, include publications from Indian reservations across the country since the early 1950s to 1970; by itself, this is a valuable compilation of official materials published within the context of Indian reservations. Subseries 2 gathers Rietz’s collection of scientific publications, journals and articles organized alphabetically. Subseries 3 includes conference proceedings on Native American issues from the 1940s the late 1960s, as well as unpublished papers organized alphabetically by author. Subseries 4 consists of Rietz’s newspapers clippings, organized chronologically from the 1930s to 1970, and subseries 5 and 6 include Governmental and non-Governmental publications on Indian affairs, respectively. The bulk of these materials pertain to the Federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, as well as the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior. State publications include for the most part documents issued by North and South Dakota state agencies. Finally, subseries 6 covers the national and local organizations dealing with Native American populations, from the 1940s to 1970, as well as some publications included posthumously.

<p>The records of the Office of the President, Beadle Administration, represent the activities of George Wells Beadle as President, his immediate circle of Central Administration associates (including particularly the work of Edward H. Levi as Vice-President), and personnel in the University of Chicago's divisions, departments, committees, and other administrative units. The collection thus constitutes not only documentation of the Office of the President, but a varied record of the administrative workings of the university.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While most of the documents in the collection date from the years in which Beadle served as President, material dating to earlier administrations can also be found - staff of the office often collected such material for internal research, or to provide historical or biographical context for a current topic.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is divided into seven series, each of which is organized into alphabetical or chronological files. This organization, including the file headings themselves, is generally consistent with the original arrangement of files kept by staff in the Office of the President.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I, General Files, contains a variety of correspondence, publications, reports, minutes and other administrative material. The series is arranged alphabetically by topic. File headings include personal names, administrative units, and topical terms. Headings are sometimes very general ("Germany") while others are quite precise ("United States, House of Representatives Sub-Committee on Public Health and Safety, questionnaire"). Oversize material from this series has been transferred to Series VII: Oversize Material, Box 424
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II, Buildings, contains correspondence, blueprints, reports, publications and administrative documents pertaining to university buildings. Large blueprints from this series have been transferred to Architectural Drawings Collection in the University of Chicago Archives.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III, Development, contains a variety of correspondence, publications, reports, minutes and other administrative material relating to the Development campaign of the University. Oversized materials from this series have been moved to Series VII: Oversize Material, Boxes 420-423. Additional material related to Development is found in Series I, filed under "Development" or the specific names or titles associated with varying development projects.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV, Invitations, is arranged chronologically. This series contains invitations sent to Beadle and other representatives of the university. The invitations are from organizations across the globe range from university anniversaries to installations of new presidents.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series V, Trustees, is arranged alphabetically. This series contains material reporting the activities of the university's trustees and their Board, as well as material generated by trustees' work.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VI, Appointments and Budgets, contains budgets and letters of appointment, arranged alphabetically. Related correspondence, notes and drafts are also filed with appointments and budgets
</p>
<p>Series VII: Oversize Material, contains large files and items transferred from Series I and II.
</p>
<p>Most researchers will find it necessary to browse or keyword-search the inventory in order to identify files relevant to a specific subject. For example, a study of student protests might involve consultation of files headed "Demonstrations," "Selective Service," "Student draft demonstration," "Student government," " Students for a Democratic Society," "Vietnam," and so on.
</p>
<p>Correspondence of key administrators is also distributed across the collection, some of it located under the name of the individual and some under the name of a department, school, or other institutional unit. To search for the correspondence of important administrators such as Edward H. Levi or Fairfax M. Cone, the researcher will need to be aware of which administrative responsibilities each held and locate headings in the inventory related to those roles.</p>

<p>The records of the Office of the President, Kimpton Administration, represent the activities of Lawrence A. Kimpton as Chancellor, his immediate circle of Central Administration associates, and personnel in the University of Chicago's divisions, departments, committees, and other administrative units. The collection thus constitutes not only documentation of the Office of the President, but a varied record of the administrative workings of the university.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II contains budgets and letters of appointment, also arranged alphabetically; headings generally correspond to the name of individual administrative units such as departments, divisions, and schools. Related correspondence, notes and drafts are also filed with appointments and budgets.
</p>

<p>Series III includes invitations sent to Kimpton throughout his tenure. These are arranged chronologically.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV is a small audiovisual series containing a box of slides relating to Hyde Park-Kenwood urban renewal projects throughout the late 1950s. See the Series I, General Files under "Urban Renewal, index of slides," as a guide to this material.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Most researchers will find it necessary to browse or keyword-search the inventory in order to identify files relevant to a specific subject. For example, a study of urban renewal projects in the campus area might involve consultation of Series I files such as "Urban renewal, housing," "Police, campus security," "Buildings, campus, south campus redevelopment project, 1958-1960," and so on.
</p>
<p>

<p>The dolls in this collection appear to date from the mid-19th century. Their exact date and place of origin are unknown.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first Western paper dolls appeared in 18th century Paris during the reign of Louis XV. Several sources assert their existence in 9th century Japan. While the French considered the dolls to be whimsical toys, the British used similar dolls to convey moral messages. Early European paper dolls often depicted actors and actresses and could be used with toy stages. Many of these dolls had permanently printed costumes. Early dressmakers also used a version of a paper doll, eight inches tall with joints made of thread, to design and model clothing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first American paper dolls were much less elaborate. As paper was a prized resource in Pioneer America, it was rarely used for toys. Those children privileged enough to obtain them often stored them between the pages of a book. As paper became more available, the dolls were mass produced on cardboard. McLoughlin Brothers, founded in 1828, was the largest paper doll manufacturer of its day. The dolls were printed from engraved wood blocks. Early American paper dolls were typically colored by hand. During the Civil War, widows often earned money by making and embellishing paper dolls. The first paper dolls did not include tabs for dressing the dolls. Instead, drops of sealing wax attached the clothing.

<p>The Robert S. Platt papers contain student notes, professional correspondence, manuscripts, off-prints, lectures, field notes, teaching materials, postcards, photographs, and movie film; notes and research papers from his Department of Geography field courses in the upper Great Lakes region; and editorial correspondence of the Annals of the Association of American Geographers from 1961 to 1963.</p>
<p>Series I. BIOGRAPHICAL</p>
<p>This series contains a miscellaneous group of materials related to Platt's life, as well as a series of tributes offered by his students and colleagues. Of particular interest are folders devoted to Platt's retirement and the critical appraisals of his career by William Pattison, Richard Hartshorne, and Richard S. Thoman.</p>
<p>Series II. EARLY NOTES AND PAPERS</p>
<p>Except for items in the first folder, this series of student notes and papers represents Platt's work as a graduate student in the Department of Geography from 1915 to 1920. The lectures by Barrows, Tower, and Cowles preserved in Platt's notes are significant for the information they provide on the intellectual climate of the Department during its early years. That these teachers (and others including Rollin D. Salisbury and Albion Small) were having an important effect on Platt's thinking is apparent from a group of undated geographical notes, evidently written ca. 1916; in these notes, Platt compares definitions of geography offered in Departmental courses with those found in standard dictionaries, and counter-poses his own reflections on the nature of the discipline.</p>
<p>Series III. PROFESSIONAL CORRESPONDENCE</p>
<p>Platt's professional correspondence includes a number of important exchanges with such colleagues as Harlan H. Barrows, Richard Hartshorne, Wellington D. Jones, and Derwent Whittlesey. In the case of Hartshorne, Platt considered certain letters to be of such theoretical consequence that they were separated for use in teaching his course on Geographic Thought at Indiana University in 1963. The professional correspondence also contains letters related to Platt's work with the Association of American Geographers, the Library of Congress, the National Research Council, and the U.S. State Department and War Department.</p>
<p>Series IV. WRITINGS</p>
<p>The writings in this series have been divided into three sub-series: Books and Articles and Addresses and Lectures arranged alphabetically by title, followed by Book Reviews organized alphabetically by the last name of the author or editor. Individual folders in the Books and Articles section typically contain manuscripts and offprints, but they may also include outlines and correspondence or notes by Platt such as those found on the manuscript chapters of American Geography: Inventory and Prospect. Several autobiographical writings containing Platt's comments on his career and the development of American geography should also be noted: "Being a Geographer"; "My Unfinishing School" and "My Photogenic Finish;" "Around the World in 47 Years"; "Glimpses of the Decades"; and "A Half-Century of Geography and Geographers."</p>
<p>Series V. FIELD NOTES</p>
<p>Notes in this series record Platt's field observations throughout his career, from a trip to the Fox Valley as a graduate student to travels in Spain and Morocco in the year before his death. The notes have been organized into five general geographical categories (United States and Canada; Bermuda; Latin America and Caribbean; and Europe and North America), and within each category have been arranged chronologically by year. The notes on Bermuda collected in the spring and fall of 1919 served as the basis for his 1920 Ph.D. dissertation, "Resources and Economic Interests of the Bermudas."</p>
<p>Series VI. DEPARTMENTAL AND TEACHING MATERIALS</p>
<p>Apart from a small group of administrative materials, this series is devoted largely to notes and correspondence related to regular geography courses taught by Platt from 1920 to 1963. Included are records of his earliest teaching experiences at Changsha at Yale in China and in the U.S. Army during World War I, and a group of materials from his courses on Geographic Thought and Methodology given at the University of Chicago and Indiana University late in his life.</p>
<p>Letters of recommendation in this series are restricted until 2035.</p>
<p>Series VII. GREAT LAKES FIELD COURSES</p>
<p>Material in this series records the work of Platt and his students in the field from 1920 to 1951. Within the group of folders devoted to each year's trip, Platt's correspondence and notes on travel arrangements and field instructions are followed by printed maps indicating the general area being surveyed, manuscript reports and maps compiled by students in the field, and final research papers prepared by students for course credit.</p>
<p>Series VIII. ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS</p>
<p>This series contains the editorial files accumulated by Platt during his tenure as editor of the Annals of the A.A.G. (1961-1964). General editorial correspondence is followed by letters and referees' reports on individual published articles arranged by issue.</p>
<p>All records in this series are restricted until 2014 and may be consulted only upon application to the University Archivist.</p>
<p>Series IX. POSTCARDS</p>
<p>Platt was an avid collector of postcards with geographical views, particularly in the early years of his career. Besides serving as colorful souvenirs of his travels, postcards also met research needs: those depicting the landforms, flora, and industries of Bermuda, for example, proved useful in the writing of his dissertation.</p>
<p>Series X. PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
<p>Rooted in his early amateur interest in picture taking, Platt's commitment to photography as a research tool was a hallmark of his geographic field technique. Although many of the photographs in this series were intended to appear as illustrations in his published articles, others were taken to serve as permanent records of significant events in his life. Platt recorded student excursions with Rollin Salisbury; his earliest fieldwork at Ellison Bay; the first of the American geographers' spring field conferences; and numerous incidents during annual trips to the upper Great Lakes region. Platt's collection of photographs is also an important source of visual information on the Department of Geography and the varied events at his home in Morgan Park.</p>
<p>Series XI. RESTRICTED</p>
<p>This series contains student evaluative material restricted until 2037.</p>

<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>This collection contains administrative records of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse from its founding in 1912 to 1961. The majority of the files include correspondence, poetry, articles and reviews that were sent to and compiled by each editor of the magazine beginning with its first editor and founder, Harriet Monroe. Though the collection covers the period 1912 to 1961, it includes a small amount of correspondence from the late 1890s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the collection was first archivally organized into three series, based upon the original arrangement in which the papers were received. The preservation and microfilming project conducted in 2001-2002 retained this broad arrangement but also provided enhanced description by identifying subdivisions with each of the series. The Poetry collection has been arranged as follows: Series I: Administrative Files, 1912-1936, Series II: Administrative Files, 1936-1953, Series III: Administrative Files, 1954-1961 and Series IV: Oversize. For more descriptive information see the series descriptions for each series.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection documents not only the administration and growth of Poetry magazine, but also the development of English-language verse in the first half of the twentieth century. Most of the files within each series contain editorial correspondence and poetry, articles and reviews, in manuscript and proof form.
</p>
<p>Each series contains a modest amount of business files having to do with the operation of the magazine including financial, advertising and fund raising records, literary prizes, author biographies and clippings.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Within each series, manuscripts and correspondence have generally been arranged alphabetically by the name of the author. Series I and II are divided into alphabetical subseries distinguished "Major" and "Minor" Poets, a division present in the files upon their receipt.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series I includes correspondence, manuscripts of poetry, articles and reviews sent to Harriet Monroe during her tenure as editor of Poetry: a Magazine of Verse. The manuscripts cover the period from the beginnings of the magazine to her death in 1936. This series has been divided into three subseries, reflecting the organization of the files as used by the editorial staff of the magazine. 1. General Manuscripts, 2. Major Poets, and 3. Addenda.</p>
<p>Subseries 1, General Manuscripts contains alphabetically arranged correspondence and manuscripts submitted to Harriet Monroe, editor of Poetry. There is a limited amount of overlap between the first and second subseries. Cross-references have been added in many instances, but researchers are encouraged to review each series and subseries for related information. </p>
<p>Subseries 2, Major Poets is arranged alphabetically. It includes editorial correspondence, manuscripts of poetry and prose and galleys, some with manuscript corrections. </p>
<p>Subseries 3, Addenda, contains a mix of business records. It includes business correspondence; correspondence between Harriet Monroe and Poetry’s business manager, Mila Straub; biographical information provided by poets; guarantor’s records; circulars, news clippings; and photographs of Harriet Monroe. A small group of letters are identified as Crank Letters. These includes a miscellany, some marked "amusing" or "museum verses not for publication."</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series II contains Poetry files acquired by the University of Chicago in 1953, as an addition to those received upon the death of Harriet Monroe. There is some overlap among the materials in .s Series I and II; related correspondence and manuscripts from the 1930s may appear in both series. .s Series II is arranged in four subseries: 1. 1. Manuscripts - Major Contributors, 2. Manuscripts - Minor Contributors; 3. Editorial Files, and 4. Non-editorial Files.</p>
<p>Subseries 1, Manuscripts - Major Contributors, includes correspondence and manuscripts from those writers considered by the Poetry staff of the time to be "Major" poets. The manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by author in a single sequence with each author’s contributions arranged individually in one or more folders in the following order:</p>
<p>1. poetry in chronological order with undated poems at the end.</p>
<p>2. prose (reviews., essays, etc.) in a single chronology.</p>
<p>3. correspondence to and from the contributor in a single chronological sequence.</p>
<p>4. Miscellaneous material, including corrected proofs., printed publicity, etc.</p>
<p>Subseries 1 also contains business correspondence from Amy Bonner, Eastern Business Representative for Poetry, who was also a poet and contributor.</p>
<p>Subseries 2 contains the correspondence and contributions of "minor" contributors and literary correspondents, arranged alphabetically with the papers of a number of individuals in a single folder. </p>
<p>Subseries 3 contains editorial and production material, such as manuscripts, galley proofs and printers’ instructions., for each issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse from October, 1936 (volume XLIX., number 1) through December, 1953 (volume LXXIII, number 3). Proofs corrected by authors will be found under the name of the author in Subseries 1 or 2. </p>
<p>Subseries 4 includes non-editorial records of the magazine, including records of fundraising, relationships with publishers and advertising agencies, literary prizes and projects, personnel matters, and other business material relating to the operation of the magazine. This material is arranged alphabetically and then chronologically by subject with the exception of the financial reports and miscellaneous business correspondence which are in chronological order.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series III contains Poetry files from the years 1954 to 1961. There is some overlap among the materials in .s Series II and III; related correspondence and manuscripts from the 1950s may appear in both series. .s Series II is arranged in four subseries: 1. Contributors, 2. Business Records and Correspondence, 3. Publication Matter and 4. Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>Subseries 1, Contributors, is an alphabetical file of the correspondence and manuscripts sent to the Poetry editors. There is no division of "major" and "minor" poets in .s Series III. Correspondence with an agent or other individual regarding a poet’s work is generally filed under the poet’s name. Translated manuscripts are generally found under the name of the translator, with whom Poetry editors corresponded.</p>
<p>Subseries 2, Business Records and Correspondence, contains non-editorial correspondence regarding the operation of Poetry. It includes items filed alphabetically by correspondents’ names, as well as subject files. Among the latter are files on special issues of the magazine (such as those on Indian, Israeli and Japanese poetry), material on the Poetry Prize and other awards and records of copyright permissions.</p>
<p>Subseries 3, Publication Matter, comprises folders for each month’s issue, containing editorial manuscripts, galleys, and correspondence with the printer. </p>
<p>Subseries 4, Miscellaneous, contains radio scripts for readings from Poetry on WFMT in 1953 and 1954, news releases, publicity material, announcements, photographs and other items.</p>

<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>The papers of Michael Polanyi are a continuing testament to the richness of the philosopher's life. In order to facilitate an understanding of the evolving nature of Michael Polanyi's career, the papers have been divided into four basic series and organized in a largely chronological framework: Correspondence (Boxes 1-20); Notes (Boxes 21-25, folder 7); Manuscripts (25:8-44:11); and Offprints and Memorabilia (45-60).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When received, correspondence, manuscripts, notes, and memorabilia had already been sorted by Professor Polanyi's secretary. The correspondence had been arranged alphabetically in yearly files from 1950 to 1975. Earlier correspondence had been grouped together in no particular order. Professor Polanyi's manuscripts were likewise ordered chronologically and labeled by the title given a particular document at the time of its composition and not necessarily by its final title at the time of publication or delivery as a lecture. The notes were segregated into files arranged alphabetically by author and there were several folders of notes labeled "miscellaneous." Memorabilia was scattered throughout the collection in folders of clippings, photographs, and unorganized announcements, invitations and the like. In addition to these relatively clear groupings, a good deal of overlap occurred with notes and letters scattered among the manuscripts. Letters and clippings from Polanyi's mother Cecile had been separately filed. These items (Boxes 18-20) have been separated but not further organized.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The original organization has been largely retained. Correspondence is interfiled chronologically with separate categories for certain specific people and organizations. The letters and manuscripts relating to Polanyi's involvement with John R. Baker and the Society for Freedom in Science and Joseph H. Oldham and the Moot are separate as are letters to and from his close friends and colleagues Marjorie Grene and Harry Prosch. Most of the family correspondence has been interfiled, but there is a box of letters from his brother Karl Polanyi and Karl's wife Ilona which covers over fifty years of family history. All the sections of correspondence are filed chronologically with undated and fragmentary letters arranged alphabetically at the end of the series. The correspondence contains letters to Polanyi as well as copies of letters he sent out. An index of selected names has been prepared which lists his correspondence with significant figures in twentieth-century history and scholarship.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During the course of World War II, Polanyi lost contact with many friends and family on the continent. Correspondence during the early war years, 1939 and 1940, is filled with pleas for assistance from loved ones trapped in occupied lands (3:14-4:5). Polanyi was instrumental in bringing his brothers Karl and Adolf and his sisters Laura and Irene to England (17:9).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Correspondence with Dr. Oldham and papers presented at meetings of the Moot have been grouped together in this collection (15:3-10). Polanyi corresponded independently with two significant members of the Moot, T. S. Eliot and Karl Mannheim. Their letters will be found in the correspondence.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of the most significant influences on the development of Polanyi's thought was the correspondence he shared with his friend and colleague, philosopher Marjorie Grene. This material has been grouped together (19:1-9), but it contains only two letters which predate Personal Knowledge.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Manuscripts in the collection are also arranged chronologically by date of composition. Their order has been determined by the dates ascribed to them by Polanyi when they were originally filed. Thus, a revised version of a paper will generally fall under the year of its revision and not the year of its composition. Exceptions to this ordering occur with manuscripts composed at an earlier period and drawn together for a lecture series. Such manuscripts have been filed by the dates of their lectures. Titles and descriptions of manuscripts are taken from the text and have not been matched with any bibliography of Polanyi's published writings. It is hoped that this approach, respecting the integrity of Polanyi's original organization and titles, will help to illuminate the evolving nature of his thought.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The manuscripts series jumps from a solid collection of pre-1952 manuscripts to an equally large group of post-1960 manuscripts. This leaves the researcher with sources for the foundation and later developments of Polanyi's thought, but without sources for the work which culminates in Personal Knowledge.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In spite of this lack of early material relating to Polanyi's philosophical thought, later correspondence with Marjorie Grene and others is abundant. Polanyi's thought ranged over a multitude of ideas and disciplines. His views on the mind led to correspondence with Carl Rogers, Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson; his views on language, with Noam Chomsky and Yehoshua Bar-Hillel; on visual perception, with Maurice Pirenne. Perhaps the most consistently stimulating exchanges in the collection occur with old friends like Grene, Arthur Koestler, and Eugene Wigner.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The range of Polanyi's thought in his later years was enormous. The Logic of Personal Knowledge, a festschrift presented to Polanyi on his seventieth birthday in 1961, contains essays by such prominent thinkers and friends as Arthur Koestler, Raymond Aron, Bertrand de Jouvenel, and C. V. Wedgwood. After 1960, there are a large number of manuscripts in the collection which help to demonstrate the growth of Polanyi's thought. Of particular interest are the sets of lectures delivered between 1960 and 1971. Included in this group are the 1960 Gunning Lectures, Perceptions of Personal Knowledge (34:1-6); the 1962 Terry Lectures (35:6-12); Man in Thought, a 1964 Duke University lecture series (36:4-37:3); Wesleyan lectures of 1965, Man's Place in the Universe (37:15-38:5); and Meaning, lectures and seminars at the University of Chicago in 1969 (39:6-40:1). The majority of philosophical manuscripts are corrected typescripts of lectures and papers delivered between 1960 and 1972. There are no galley proofs in the collection for any of Polanyi's publications.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Research notes have been divided into two groups: subject and author. The subject notes are drawn together from inter-related material in the folders originally marked "miscellaneous." "Author notes" are an alphabetical arrangement of Polanyi's files of quotations by and comments on a variety of scientific, political, philosophical, and literary figures. The memorabilia in the collection has been separated into the following categories: photographs and postcards; general memorabilia including announcements, addresses, and receipts; clippings, dissertations, and interviews with Polanyi; and offprints and other published materials.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Nearly all of the series of research notes are devoted to philosophy. When received, the notes had been divided between "author notes" and "miscellaneous." The miscellaneous notes have been sorted by subject and inventoried. The author notes have been arranged alphabetically by last name of author. Most of this material contains summaries, commentaries, and quotations relating to the work of a specific author. Together these sets of notes formed a reference file which Polanyi could turn to in writing.

<p>This series includes all letters in the collection written to and by Michael Polanyi, Magda Polanyi, and Cecile Polanyi. The correspondence is arranged chronologically with undated letters organized alphabetically by correspondent at the end of the series. There are two folders of unidentified, undated correspondence and fragments following the identified undated correspondence (14:13-14). Letters from John R. Baker, Marjorie Grene, Joseph H. Oldham, Julius and Elsa Hollo, Harry Prosch, Karl and Ilona Polanyi, and Cecile Polanyi have been separately arranged (Boxes 14-20).</p>
<p>The correspondence in the Polanyi Papers amply documents the development of his scientific researches. His early scientific studies of adsorption and reaction kinetics are mentioned in several letters from the 1917-1919 period (1:5). In the autumn of 1920, he joined the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute; until 1933, when Polanyi left Berlin, he corresponded regularly with many of the leading scientists of Germany (1:6-2:15) and the larger European community (including James Franck, Otto Hahn, Werner Heisenberg, Wilfred Heller, and Leo Szilard.)</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The Notes are divided into subject and author sections. The subject notes have been drawn together from materials originally labeled "miscellaneous" by Professor Polanyi's secretary. They have been organized topically and placed in alphabetical order. The author notes are compilations of quotes by and commentaries on authors whose work interested Polanyi. All of the author notes are grouped together and are arranged alphabetically by last name.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series III, Manuscripts contains drafts and final copies of lectures and publications, German scientific manuscripts, speeches of introduction and thanks, patents, records of laboratory financial expenditures, poetry, notebooks, and bibliographic citations.</p>
<p>The drafts and final copies of lectures and publications (25:8-43:2) have been arranged chronologically by order of composition, with undated manuscripts listed alphabetically at the end of the section. Within yearly groups, the manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by the titles given them at the time of composition. All titles are in italics except for chapter headings and untitled manuscripts, identified by first line of text, which are placed in quotation marks. Brief manuscripts of less than five pages are ordered in folders labeled "miscellaneous short manuscripts." The manuscripts have not been matched with any bibliography of Polanyi's published or unpublished writings except as an aid in determining the date of composition. Revised versions of manuscripts are placed under the date of revision and not under the date of original composition. An exception to this rule occurs when a group of manuscripts have been brought together for a specific lecture, such as occurs in 33:1-4. In such an instance, the manuscripts are organized under the date of the lecture with the date of original composition listed parenthetically.</p>
<p>The remaining manuscripts (44:3-44:11) follow the drafts and final copies of lectures and publications. The German scientific manuscripts (43:3-4) are fragmentary and contain little substantive information on the scientific work of Professor Polanyi. The speeches of introduction and thanks (43:5) consist of brief remarks made by Polanyi at banquets and conferences. The patents and records of laboratory expenditures (43:6-7) contain fragmentary evidence for Polanyi's work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute between 1923 and 1933. The small section of poetry (43:8) holds verses by Michael Polanyi as well as poems written for him on special occasions. The nine notebooks in the collection are difficult to categorize because of diverse contents. There are four short and jumbled diaries covering the period 1926-1947 (44:1-4). In addition there are four undated notebooks (44:5) which contain brief thoughts and comments on miscellaneous authors, the English countryside, the weather, and other equally diverse subject matter. The final notebook (44:6) is an obsolete index to Professor Polanyi's correspondence files. The manuscripts series concludes with five folders of bibliographic citations.</p>
<p>The earliest dated manuscripts are from 1936 and deal exclusively with economics and philosophy. There is one small group of scientific manuscripts (43:3-4,7) but they are fragmentary and indicate little about Polanyi's scientific work. The sections on science in the research notes (22:7-12) are philosophical in nature. Manuscripts such as the 1935 lectures on economics (25:9), the 1943 essays on economic planning (28:1-3), and the 1944 Principles of Economic Expansion (29:11-12) are interesting interpretations of Keynesian thought. Other manuscripts from this period like the 1938 Reflections on Marxism (25:16), the 1940 Collectivist Planning (26:3), and the 1947 Soviets and Capitalism (31:4) are criticisms of Soviet economics. By contrast, the notes contain little of relevance to Polanyi's economic thought. There are a few general notes on economic subjects (21:6) as well as material on individual economists like Keynes and von Hayek, but the majority of economic material is found in the correspondence and manuscripts.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Memorabilia in the Polanyi Papers falls into five groups: photographs and postcards; personal materials (addresses, announcements, Christmas cards, invitations, obituaries, programs, receipts, reports, etc.); miscellaneous clippings and multi-media; offprints by Michael Polanyi; and offprints by other authors and other secondary published works, including photocopied records of Polanyi's collection of books.</p>
<p>The photographs are of Michael Polanyi, his family and friends. If known, the name of the subject is indicated on the back of the print. The clippings include letters and articles by Michael Polanyi, as well as reviews of Polanyi's work, dissertations which address Polanyi's thought, and articles by Polanyi's mother Cecile (mostly copies of her fashion column in a Budapest newspaper). Other items include a small group of clippings and other printed materials from the German National Socialist period, as well as taped and filmed interviews with Polanyi. This collection also holds offprints and some privately distributed lecture material by Michael Polanyi. Offprints by other authors which remain in this collection have been annotated by Polanyi, or bear holograph inscriptions by their original authors. Finally, this collection holds six volumes of bound photocopies of the title pages of the books in Polanyi's collection, which were dispersed in 1994.</p>

<p>The Edward Kirby Putnam Notebooks, dating from 1894 to 1896, are of interest chiefly as they afford a glimpse into the nature of graduate study in English at the University of Chicago in the 1890' s. They show in what manner courses were taught, what materials were used, and what critical approaches were taken. Included in the Notebooks are course schedules, outlines, syllabi, bibliographies, class notes, class reports, and drafts of term papers.</p>
<p>In addition to the English notebooks, there are materials from two courses in sociology given by Professor Charles Richmond Henderson. A special feature of these materials is an extensive listing, with addresses, of British and American settlement houses.</p>

Material is divided into five subseries: </p>
<p>Subseries 1: Household Economics, contains material related to Reid's early research and publication on household consumption and production. The bulk of the data and notes in this subseries were drawn from agricultural stations and collected by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and Farmers' Home Administration (FAH); these loan agencies required farm families to keep detailed income and expenditure records during the 1930s and 1940s. These records are of particular note. Also of note are clippings and correspondence on the oleomargarine controversy at Iowa State College during 1943 and 1944, while Reid was faculty there. When faculty recommended wartime use of oleomargarine, the Iowa dairy lobby pressured the administration to change their publication. Some faculty resigned in protest. Material spans the 1930s-1979, primarily covering the period between 1937 and 1951. It is organized alphabetically by topic and title.</p>
<p>Subseries 2: Income and Consumption, covers the middle part of Reid's career and documents her interest in the demographics of income and consumption, particularly in urban areas. This subseries contains data, research notes, and book drafts. It spans 1950-1978 and is organized alphabetically by topic and title.</p>
<p>Subseries 3: Income and Health, contains data, notes, and drafts on the relationship between health, income, and productivity. These topics preoccupied Reid in the final stages of her career. Material spans 1964-1985, primarily covering the 1970s and early 1980s. It is organized alphabetically by topic and title.</p>

The material is broken up into four categories, the Robertson family correspondence arranged chronologically, John Robertson Correspondence, the Loyal Company papers arranged chronologically (1 1/2 boxes), and miscellaneous bound material such as account books, the family register, and books and magazines used by Robertson in his historical researches.</p>
<p>The family papers written before 1815 largely consist of the correspondence of Wyndham Robertson's grandfather, Archibald Robertson, a factor on the James River, to his family in Glasgow. Family affairs were the main subject of the correspondence which was continued by Wyndham's father, William. An eighteenth century commonplace book and two diaries of travel dated 1776 and July, 1797, presumably of Wyndham's father, date from this period.</p>
<p>In 1815 the correspondence of Wyndham, himself, commences. His early letters are principally to his father and to three of his brothers, John Robertson, member of the</p>
<p>Virginia legislature, attorney general of the state in 1823 and congressman, 1834; to Thomas Bolling Robertson, governor of Louisiana; and Powhatan Robertson. After his sojourn at William and Mary College from 1819 to 1821, he wrote to many of the friends he made there. From the time of his marriage to Mary F. Trigg Smith in 1831 until the Civil War, which includes the period of his governorship (1836-1838) there is singularly little in the collection dealing with his political career. The letters are addressed to Wyndham and are largely from his family and are concerned with family affairs, although in the years before 1838 Wyndham was immersed in law and politics and after that date was concerned with several business ventures. The correspondence does, however, give numerous descriptions and insights into Southern ante-bellum society. Particularly interesting in this respect are the letters of Wyndham's nephew, Henry Skipwith, and his niece, Gay Bernard, during the latter's stay in the Washington society ruled by the Calhouns. There are also some letters and accounts concerning Wyndham's estate at Abingdon, part of his wife's dowry, his plantation of Bayou Black in Louisiana, and his land speculations in Arkansas. Although there is little of sustained correspondence on political matters, the following individual letters are of interest: the original of the letter of resignation of Governor Tazewell to Wyndham Robertson, March 30, 1836; over a dozen letters written by Nicholas P. Trist to Wyndham between the years 1830 and 1860; a letter from Nicholas Biddle to Wyndham, February 21, 1839.</p>
<p>Beginning with the convention of 1856 and continuing through the year 1870, the correspondence is rich in political matter of the Civil War both for the state of Virginia and, especially in 1860, at the national level. The tribulations of the family during the years of battle and the struggle to retrieve the family's shattered fortunes after the war are fully recorded in their papers and letters. Noteworthy are letters from Edward Bates and General Winfield Scott during the election crisis of 1860 and from Generals Curtis Lee, Robert E. Lee, and J.E.B. Stuart, and from Samuel J. Tilden during the war.</p>
<p>The papers of Wyndham Robertson from the end of the Civil War until his death in 1888, although containing scattered political correspondence, are principally concerned with his business interest in the Buena Vista Plaster Company managed by himself and his two sons, Frank and Wyndham, and his antiquarian studies in the history of Virginia, particularly work on his book, The Descendants of Pocahontas, which was undertaken even before the outbreak of the Civil War. Wyndham Robertson was particularly proud of his descent from Pocahontas (he named one of his children Pocahontas, and another Powhatan). His genealogical papers contain extensive early documentation of the history of the Boiling family.</p>
<p>During the last years of his life, Wyndham had an active correspondence with other famous Virginia historians of his day such as William Wirt Henry, Alexander Brown, Hugh B. Grigsby, Conway Robinson, and Phillip S. Slaughter. The papers from 1888 to 1925, the date of the sale of the Buena Vista Plaster Company, record the growth of the Company and its problems under Wyndham's sons, Frank and Wyndham. Some reminiscences of the younger Robertsons are also contained in this part of the collection.</p>
<p>Because of its unique political interest the correspondence between Wyndham and his elder brother, John, extending from 1818 to 1872 has been treated as a distinct series within the collection. John Robertson sent lengthy reports of the current Washington scene after his election to Congress in 1834.</p>
<p>The papers of the Loyal Company of Virginia, previously dispersed by date through the collection, comprise a third chronological series, bearing no relationship to the rest of the Robertson papers. Captain Francis Smith, Wyndham's father-in-law, was a leading member of the Loyal Company during its last years. Wyndham apparently acquired the papers when he became executor of Smith's estate in 1840. The papers date from the mid-eighteenth century and contain land surveys, receipts, land grants, accounts, and records of court litigations. Notable are a series of fourteen grants of land on parchment dated between 1785 and 1834 signed by the following governors of Virginia: Patrick Henry, Edmund Randolph, Beverly Randolph, Robert Brooke, James Wood, James Monroe, John Page, James Barbour, and Littleton W. Tazewell.</p>
<p>Three groups of papers comprise the fourth series, Miscellaneous Robertson Papers, at the end of the collection: Robertson's Library of Books and Magazines Used in his Historical Researches; Scrapbooks and Diaries; and Robertson's Research Papers on the Descendants of Pocahontas.</p>

<p>The Earl Rosenthal Papers are arranged into three series: Series I: Personal; Series II: Research; and Series III: Teaching. The collection contains college yearbooks; research notebooks and reading notes in various formats; bibliographies and lecture notes for courses taught. Materials date between 1942 and 1998, with the bulk of the materials being notes taken and revised from about 1990 to 1998. The papers primarily document Rosenthal's early work as an observant art historian in Spain, Italy, and Mexico, his continuously revised notes on the scholarship of his field, and his well-known course lectures on the diffusion of the arts throughout renaissance Europe.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I, Personal, contains two yearbooks from the Milwaukee State Teachers College, 1942 and 1943, now known as the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where Rosenthal obtained his Bachelor's degree in 1943.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II, Research, contains 19 notebooks from Rosenthal's early research trips to Europe and Mexico in the late 1940s and 1950, as well as many loose reading notes on various topics which Rosenthal had kept in shoeboxes. Of particular interest are the field notebooks, which include many on-site sketches of architectural details and monuments. Rosenthal was known to use his own personally-made measurements in his publications on Spanish architecture. One undated and unlabeled notebook of the kind used for documenting research trips to Mexico appears to also contain Rosenthal's personal reflections and includes notes taken on a lecture attended at the University of Chicago. Subsequent reading notes in this series come in all forms and sizes and include recurring subjects and some revising statements. Note subjects include (but are not limited to) German thinkers, Romanticism, the Enlightenment, historiography, nationalism (particularly German), and topics in Christianity.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III, Teaching, consists of material Rosenthal used for his various lectures on the "Diffusion of the Renaissance." These include typed-out lectures with added handwritten notes, various bibliographies, and detailed handwritten, fold-out timelines of renaissance art and architecture in France and Spain. Of note is Rosenthal's typed lecture in Spanish for a course he taught at the University of Granada, Spain.</p>

</p>
<p>Series I: Curie-Kellogg Correspondence and Curie Memorabilia
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When Pierre and Marie Curie first published their work on radium in the 1890s, they decided they would seek no profit from their discovery though even then its great commercial potential was apparent. As a consequence of this decision, they labored under a great financial handicap. When the American journalist, Marie Meloney interviewed Mme. Curie after the First World War, she was astonished to learn that the work of the French scientist was hampered by a shortage of radium (Mme. Curie had about a gram in her laboratory at that time) while in the United States some fifty grams were stockpiled around the country. Out of this meeting and this promise grew the Marie Curie Radium Fund, through which the women of American presented Mme. Curie with a gram of radium. Charlotte Kellogg (Mrs. Vernon Kellogg), an author and friend of Meloney, worked on the fund raising drive, and a warm friendship developed between her and Mme. Curie. During the French scientist’s visit to the United States in 1921 to accept the gram of radium, Curie had been persuaded by Meloney to write on her own life and the life of her deceased husband, Pierre. In 1923 Charlotte Kellogg and her husband translated this autobiographical account into English. Another gram of radium was given in 1929, this time for the establishment of radium therapy services in Mme. Curie’s native Warsaw.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Schaffner Collection includes: ten pieces of correspondence by Marie Curie (nine originals and one typescript copy); typescript copies of Einstein’s eulogy of Curie, her 1921 speech of acceptance for the radium gift, and Charlotte Kellogg’s memoir of Mme. Curie; photographs of Charlotte Kellogg and Marie Meloney; and assorted memorabilia.

</p>
<p>Series III: Albert Einstein - Walther Mayer Correspondence and Einstein Photographs
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The letters from Albert Einstein to Walther Mayer constitute an important body of documentation touching on both the development of the Unified Field Theory and the dramatic personal events experienced by these two men during the years of the Nazi rise to power. The association of Einstein with the talented Austrian mathematician began during the late 1920s in Germany. Though Mayer is often spoken of as Einstein’s assistant and though his role was largely that of providing the mathematical apparatus necessary to the elaboration of the new theory, Einstein himself referred to their joint achievement as “our theory” and praised Mayer in the highest terms: “It is he who produced all my calculations; his skill is fantastic.” During a period of growing political turbulence in Germany when Einstein was traveling and, later, when he had gone into exile, the friendship and collaboration of the two men was carried on largely by mail. The letters give indications of the keenly felt personal turmoil of the two before they both finally settled at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1933.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By letter, during the years 1930 to 1933, Einstein and Mayer collaborated on what has been called Einstein’s “most ambitious theory” and a “triumph of human spirit over the chaos of the universe.” Following the announcement of the Unified Field Theory in 1931, Mayer explained the significance of the joint accomplishment:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The general relativity theory suffered from a dualism: adequate for gravitation, it harbored the electro-magnetic field as a foreign body, and its formulas Professor Einstein had to introduce artificially, as it were.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This dualism is abolished in the new theory, which subsumes both gravitation and electricity under one comprehensive theory of the same architecture throughout.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Joseph Halle Schaffner Collection of Scientific Manuscripts includes some eighty letters, mostly from the crucial 1930-33 period, from Einstein to Mayer and a number of photographs of the two men.
</p>

</p>
<p>Series IV: Sir Isaac Newton, 1642-1727

<p>The records of the Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation comprise minutes, correspondence, and financial records of the Foundation, as well as applications, recommendations, correspondence, reports, newsletters, news clippings, and pamphlets of sixty-five organizations that applied to the Foundation for support. </p>
<p>The Schwarzhaupt records are important documents for studying a major shift in the understanding of democratic participation in the mid-twentieth century. In the Foundation's certificate of incorporation in 1936 Emil Schwarzhaupt wrote of:</p>
<p>the up building and betterment of American citizenship and increasing among all American citizens, and especially among the foreign born, the knowledge of the history of the United States Government and the meaning of the obligations and privileges of citizenship in the United States of America.</p>
<p>This idealistic conception of citizenship and the state was in contrast to the actual practice of the Foundation after 1950 in awarding grants to such organizations as Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation, and the Highlander Folk School, which emphasized a more confrontational understanding of citizenship under the rubric of "community organizing." The career of the Schwarzhaupt Foundation thus embodied a tension between theory and practice that is reflected in the varied approaches adopted by the organizations it funded. It is the records of these diverse organizations and groups that comprise the bulk of this collection.</p>
<p>The records of the Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation have been divided into three series: Series I (Boxes 1-6) contains the administrative records of the Foundation, Series II (Boxes 6-51) contains records of the organizations having dealings with the Foundation, and Series III (Box 52) contains photographs.</p>
<p>Series I: ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS </p>
<p>The first series includes general records of the Foundation relating to its administration and finances. This series is divided into ten subject headings: Organizational and Disbursement of Emil Schwarzhaupt Estate, covering activities before 1952; University of Chicago Committee on Education for American Citizenship: Recommendations; Minutes and Financial Reports; Financial Statements and Tax Returns; Correspondence covering the day-to-day activities of the Foundation; Activity Reports; Grant Application Recommendations, containing many initial recommendations written between 1954 and 1955 by Tjerandsen; Evaluation Report of Highlander Folk School and Industrial Areas Foundation, containing the correspondence and final report of J. Herman Blake, who was commissioned to study two Schwarzhaupt-Funded projects in the Sea Islands of South Carolina and in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago; Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation: Final Report, containing correspondence, notes, and drafts, along with a published copy of the report, Education for Citizenship; and American Indian Background Material Gathered by Carl Tjerandsen, which includes general notes and correspondence of Tjerandsen as well as newsletters and clippings.</p>
<p>Series II. APPLICATIONS FOR FUNDS AND GRANTS</p>
<p>This series contains the applications, recommendations, correspondence and reports of 65 organizations which applied to the Schwarzhaupt Foundation for funds, listed in alphabetical order. Tjerandsen, in his book, grouped the organizations into three types depending on their program's purpose: 1) Organizations preparing aliens for citizenship as well as patriotic organizations fostering allegiance to the country; 2) groups and program promoting awareness of civil liberties, and also groups promoting electoral participation and effective functioning of political parties; and 3) groups and programs developing personal attributes such as courage and personal character considered essential to democracy, as well as groups engaged in active community organizing. Under the heading for each organization the files are arranged in the following order:</p>
<p>Application and Recommendations. Under this heading appear the application and proposal submitted by organizations to the Schwarzhaupt Foundation, along with the recommendations or appraisals written by Tjerandsen for the trustees. On occasion the applying organization also submitted a statement of non-profit status for tax purposes which is included here.</p>
<p>Correspondence. This heading contains letters, telegrams, memoranda, notes of telephone conversations, and Tjerandsen's notes of visits and conversations in the field.</p>
<p>Reports. This heading contains the progress, annual, and final reports made by the grant recipients to the foundation. Not all recipients were required to submit reports at the conclusion of their projects.</p>
<p>Newsletters. Any newsletters published by the project were passed on to the Foundation. The name of the newsletter is given first, followed by the dates of the newsletter represented in the files.</p>
<p>Pamphlets. This includes other published material by the grant recipients. The Foundation requested that such materials be sent on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Article Reprints. If the project or the Schwarzhaupt Foundation was mentioned in an article, the grantee usually passed it along to the Foundation.</p>
<p>News Clippings. Any publicity covering the project or the Schwarzhaupt Foundation was usually forwarded to the Foundation.</p>
<p>When the amount of material for an organization is small, the reports are combined with the applications and recommendations.</p>
<p>Of particular interest might be the files centering on two of the most significant projects funded by the Schwarzhaupt Foundation: the Industrial Areas Foundation, headed by Saul Alinsky; and the Highlander Folk School Project, whose "citizenship classes" in the South were eventually incorporated into the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, headed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>The range of Alinsky's IAF extended from the community organizing work in The Woodlawn Organization to one of the most successful efforts to register Mexican-Americans to vote. The IAF organized groups known as Community Service Organizations (CSO) in towns throughout California. The CSO were eventually able to register over 400,000 voters, and as their support grew, they were able to successfully confront discrimination and to demand better treatment.</p>
<p>Box 29 Folder 18 contains correspondence between Alinsky and the Foundation's president, Adolph Hirsch, and the Foundation's secretary, Carl Tjerandsen, from 1964 to 1968. A number of the letters deal with the Foundation's difficulty in getting Alinsky to file project reports. In one such letter from January 10, 1966, Tjerandsen sought to impress the urgency of the reports upon Alinsky by reminding him that "about one-third of the Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation's funds were committed to the projects sponsored or supervised by the Industrial Areas Foundation," i.e., Alinsky's organization. In addition Box 31, Folder 1 contains the following essays and reports by Alinsky: "Action to Equality of Opportunity," "Citizen Participation and Community Organization in Planning and Urban Renewal" (January 29, 1962), "Civil Rights Housing Hearing: Commission on Civil Rights" (May 5, 1959), and "Seminar on Mass Organization" (August-September, 1965).</p>
<p>The connection with Martin Luther King, Jr. came through the Schwarzhaupt Foundation's support of project sponsoring citizenship classes, the Highlander Folk School. Tjerandsen found this project to be the most influential and far-reaching of all the programs supported by the Foundation.</p>
<p>The idea of citizenship classes grew out of an application written by Myles Horton, a director of Highlander, in 1952. The Highlander project began on John's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina, under the direction of Septima</p>
<p>Clark and Esau Jenkins, and emphasized voter registration and civic education. As Myles Horton once put it: "What is too big for one person to handle can be figured out by all of us together. We will have a new kind of school-not a school for teaching reading, writing and arithmetic, but a school for problems."</p>
<p>Boxes 22-25 contain extensive material on the Highlander Folk School with important documents discussing the shift of the citizenship classes from Highlander to the SCLC. The best general discussion of the transfer of the transfer of the classes occurs in the essay, "A Workshop for Volunteer Teachers in the Citizenship Program of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, 1965" (24:15). As early as 1961, however, a "Memorandum on Citizenship Program" (24:6) emphasized the transition of the classes to the SCLC. Significant to the continuity of the program developed by the SCLC was the retention of Highlander's Director of Education, Septima Clark. By 1967, there were over three thousand citizenship teachers who had helped hundreds of thousands of blacks to register to vote. Although the Schwarzhaupt Foundation did not fund the educational efforts of the SCLC (which was supported by the Field Foundation), its work with Highlander prepared the way for the development of such a program.</p>
<p>Other significant projects assisted by the Schwarzhaupt Foundation include: the American Indian Conference in Chicago in 1962, which drew over 800 Indians from more than 90 tribes-the largest gathering of Indians to that point to discuss problems and concerns; the American Council for Emigres in the Professions (ACEP); the Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference; and the Migrant Citizen Education Project.</p>
<p>Series III. PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
<p>This series contains four folders of black and white photographs of activities from a number of organizations, along with color slides from an additional group. Folder 1 contains photographs emphasizing the people with whom the Highlander Project worked in the rural South. Folder 2 illustrates classroom situations of the Highlander citizenship classes. Folder 3 portrays activities and gatherings of the Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference, and other groups including Migrant Ministry. Folder 4 contains color slides of the Gallup Citizenship Education Program used in class presentations.</p>

<p>During the year 1954-55, these records were removed from storage in the basement of Swift Hall and deposited in the University Archives Their present organization is based on the arrangement at the time of transfer and in general reflects their original arrangement as working files The many relationships of the School and of Shailer Mathews with other organizations are not easily discernable in the present basic chronological arrangement but it should be noted that symbols have been introduced in this guide to indicate the dominant subject matter in otherwise general folders However, these symbols should be used with caution since they are not to be understood as being inclusive of all the correspondence that might exist in a particular folder. Also, the dating assigned to each folder is not necessarily inclusive but should serve as a suggestion to the general location of specific material
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following deposit in the Archives some general weeding was performed on the papers which was limited to a vast amount of routine matters Occasional samplings of this routine correspondence and memoranda were saved and are so marked in the guide below.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The sketch of Mathews' career has been appended to assist users of this collection to gain a minimal understanding of the scope of his varied activities as a University administrator, scholar, and churchman. His autobiography, New Faith for Old (New York, Macmillan, 1936) should be also consulted.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Mathews' papers in the possession of the University Archives are to a large extent administrative records dealing with matters affecting both the Divinity School and the University as a whole. There is also considerable correspondence touching upon the practical matters of American church life, particularly the efforts of the strict fundamentalists to split the churches over the modernism issue; a large group of papers bears upon the development of the Chautaugua Institute, particularly its religious program; and the collection includes miscellaneous correspondence, lecture notes, and manuscripts of published and unpublished articles and books There are no examples of correspondence with leading political figures, but many, of course, of correspondence with educational and religious leaders
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The chief emphases of Dr. Mathews papers will be found in three areas, 1) the history of the University of Chicago and of the Divinity School; 2) the history of the development of the religious and social ideas which came to be known as "Modernism" and of the struggles within Protestantism which resulted from them; and 3) the reconstruction of the general intellectual, social, and spiritual climate which characterized the great era of vast changes in American life from 1890-1930 In addition valuable material on the history of Chautaugua and of a number of other movements and groups is scattered through the whole. The attitude of religious leaders toward the first World War is another example of a secondary topic upon which Dr. Mathews' papers shed some interesting light.

<p>The Sheet Music Collection consists of approximately 4,300 printed songs, folksongs, ballads, and piano music from the late 18th to mid 20th century. The materials are predominately English and American, but the collection includes songs of other countries, some of which are in different languages such as French or German.</p>
<p>The collection is divided into five series. </p>
<p>Series I: English Songs and Ballads consists of approximately 3,500 songs, which were published and performed in England. In most cases, English poets and composers wrote their lyrics and musical scores. The majority of these pieces were printed between 1830-1870, but the section spans 1785 to 1900. Their themes range from political satire to romantic love and are often directly informed by current events. Comic songs are generally associated with public performance in a popular music hall, and with a particular singer. This section also includes piano music without lyrics, the majority of which are dances (polkas and waltzes). Series I is divided into three subseries</p>
<p>Subseries 1, Lyricists, is organized alphabetically according to the name of the lyricist. Lyricists with at least four works in the collection are given a separate folder, located at the end of the corresponding alphabetical group. Many songs represent famous poems set to music, for example the verse of Byron, Keats, and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Subseries 2, Composers, is organized alphabetically according to the name of the composer. Composers with at least four works in the collection are given a separate folder, located at the end of the corresponding alphabetical group. Some songs represent popularizations of operas by Donizetti, Rossini, or Verdi, for example; conversely, some are song arrangements based upon musical compositions by Mozart, Schubert, or Beethoven.</p>
<p>In some cases, the composer and lyricist are the same individual, (for example, "Claribel.") Occasionally, a recognized lyricist composed the music but not the lyrics, and vice versa. In such crossover cases, Parts I and II should both be checked. The same is true when there is frequent collaboration between a prominent lyricist and equally prominent composer: for example, Eliza Cook (lyrics) and Henry Russell (music) are extensively represented in their respective categories, both of which contain examples of their joint efforts.</p>
<p>Piano music (without lyrics) is also included in this group. The majority of these pieces are dances, especially waltzes and polkas, and the majority is identified by composer (Strauss, etc). </p>
<p>Subseries 3, Folk, National, and Anonymous Songs, consists of ballads, folk music, and national songs, most of which are anonymous. They are primarily from England, Scotland, and Ireland, but include France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. Sacred songs and hymns are also included in this group.</p>
<p>In 1974, a detailed inventory was initiated, but not completed. As a result, however, several hundred items (primarily those whose lyricists' last name begins with "B") have been surveyed according to caption title, first line, first chorus line, music medium, pages of music, composer, lyricist, arranger, performer, illustrator, publisher, plate number, and cover description. These sheets are currently located in the Sheet Music Collection file, and may be consulted upon request.</p>
<p>Series II: Early 19th Century American Sheet Music includes 39 songs published in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. These materials are divided into two subseries. Subseries 1, Song Sheets consists of songs published in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Subseries 2, Piano and Harp Music contains piano and harp music (without lyrics) published in the United States. The majority of these items are dances.</p>
<p>Series III: The Lt. Joseph Starshack Collection of American Sheet Music contains 224 pieces of American popular music ranging from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, most from 1900 to 1910. The collection is organized alphabetically by song title. A complete item list is available in the Sheet Music Collection file and may be consulted upon request.</p>
<p>Series IV: Early 20th Century American Sheet Music contains approximately 500 pieces of American popular music from the early 20th century, published primarily between 1910 and 1940. This collection includes songs of a regional character, addressed to the Southern and Western United States (Alabama, Georgia, California), as well as a number of Irish ballads printed in the United States. Some songs address patriotic themes, particularly in relationship to World War I. Movie theme songs (for example, "The Tender Trap") and songs from musicals such as "Guys and Dolls" also appear in this collection. Popular entertainers and recording stars associated with these songs include Perry Como, Guy Lombardo, Patti Page, Frank Sinatra, and Rudy Vallee.</p>
<p>This collection is organized alphabetically by song title. The majority of these items are in poor condition.</p>
<p>Series V: The Midway Minstrel represents the repertoire of a male singing group named after the Midway in Hyde Park, Chicago. 314 popular songs appear in this collection, including a number of drinking songs (such as "Beer, Please," or "Budweiser's a Friend of Mine.")</p>

<p>The James Silverberg Papers contain 14.5 linear feet of material and roughly cover 1941-1994, though the bulk of the materials were generated between the late 1940s and late 1970s. The collection consists largely of Silverberg's research materials, which include: field notebooks, quantitative data, surveys, maps, reports, interview transcriptions, etc. These materials relate exclusively to his work in India, though they do cover several different research trips. Much of the qualitative data should prove useful and interesting to researchers interested in 20th century India and, especially, the Indian caste system.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition, the Papers house a small collection of writings and correspondence. The former contains typescript and reprint copies of Silverberg's work, both published (articles) and unpublished (talks, conference papers), as well as related correspondence. The latter contains a mix of personal and professional correspondence. The James Silverberg Papers also include a series of general files in which materials unrelated to the established taxonomy of the collection can be found.
</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains materials related to Silverberg's research in India. The bulk of these materials were generated as part of the India Field Research Project, headed by Gitel P. Steed. They have been separated according to geographic region and theme: Bakrana, Kasandra, caste system, and unknown or general India. The first two Subseries are named for villages located in the state of Gujarat. Subseries III deals specifically with the caste system, a major theme in Silverberg's research. Finally, the materials whose geographical provenance is unknown or which relate to India generally have been housed together in Subseries IV, though it is probable that they were generated in either Bakrana or Kasandra. Researchers are advised to examine the materials in Subseries IV should they be interested in Subseries I, II or III. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains a miscellany of materials. The first subseries is devoted to </p>
<p>writings written by authors other than Silverberg. Subseries II contains materials </p>
<p>related to Gitel P. Steed. While materials pertaining to Steed can be found </p>
<p>throughout the James Silverberg Papers, the bulk of these materials have been </p>
<p>housed here. Subseries III includes materials that do not fit within the established </p>
<p>taxonomy of the collection: miscellaneous photographs, unidentified writings and </p>
<p>notes, and press items. Of interest in this subseries are the diaries of Silverberg's </p>
<p>wife, Donna. These diaries were written while Mrs. Silverberg was in India, </p>
<p>accompanying her husband on the India Field Research Project. Lastly, </p>
<p>Subseries IV contains several pottery items whose use and provenance are </p>
<p>undetermined.</p>

<scopecontent><head>Scope Note</head><p>The collection consists of two book manuscripts, illustrations to be inserted in the published book, separate copies of certain sections from the manuscripts intended for corrections, a print copy of an article to which Spitzer contributed, and a correspondence between the later possessors of the manuscripts Schwarz, Langendorf, and Lev. They are organized according to an estimated chronological order.</p><p/><p>Folder 2 consists of the complete manuscript of Spitzer's book that presents his theory. He labeled this copy as "f-Original" and as publishable, and noted that a copy of this version (Kopie f) is in the USA but not corrected, thus not ready for publication. Folders 3-7 contain documents related to this book, such as a limited number of the illustrations to be inserted in the book, and separate sections to be used for corrections. Spitzer attached notes to each of these sections as to where they should be used. Folder 8 consists of the second book that was, as Spitzer noted, originally intended as the second part of the first book. Folder 9 contains a copy of the introduction to the second book, intended for "control" and not "publication."</p></scopecontent>

Correspondents often included drafts or offprints of their work for comment; in cases where a collection of letters from an individual includes enclosed articles, those articles are included here. As many of Thompson's colleagues and former students are themselves prominent scholars, the series is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, with general correspondence arranged chronologically at the end. Correspondence regarding and with students at the time of their study is in Series V: Teaching.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III, Professional Activities, contains records, correspondence, and papers relating to Thompson's non-instructional professional activities: his service on the Harvard visiting committee, referee reports for journals and academic presses (older than 25 years), grant materials, etc. It also includes material relating to the Kant Society, the Charles Pierce Society, and the American Philosophical Association. Material is arranged chronologically.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV, Writings, contains notes, manuscripts, typescripts, and offprints of Thompsons's academic writing, including materials related to his book, The Pragmatic Philosophy of C. S. Peirce. Materials are arranged chronologically. Part of the mathematics manuscript was written on the back of papers that are currently restricted, so a partial photocopy is included in this series, with the corresponding part of the original in Series VIII.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series V, Teaching, contains syllabi and course materials, student work (except where restricted), and administrative records. The series is divided into two subseries:
</p>
<p>Subseries 1: General: This subseries contains correspondence with and regarding students, their dissertation bits and other student papers, course notes, rosters and syllabi, and administrative material, arranged chronologically.
</p>
<p> Subseries 2: Notebooks: This subseries contains bound notebooks with course notes from the 1940s-1980s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VI, Writings by Others, contains drafts and offprints of articles and books by others, including some correspondence and scant handwritten comments by Thompson. Material in the series is alphabetized by author. In cases where the work was accompanied by a letter or two, that correspondence is included here.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VII, Oversize, contains complete newspapers and oversize clippings.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series VIII, Restricted, contains material with various restrictions. Folders 1 to 15 of Box 25 are restricted for 25-30 years from the date of creation; Folders 16 to 22 of Box 25 and 1 to 8 of Box 26 are restricted for fifty years from the date of creation; Folders 9 to 18 of Box 26 and all of Box 27 are restricted for eighty years from the date of creation.</p>

<p>The Tufts Papers include professional correspondence (1909-1942);
philosophy outlines, notes and lectures; drafts of Tufts'
memoirs; papers concerning the City Club of Chicago
Committee on Housing Conditions (1908-13); and documents
related to the Illinois Committee on Social Legislation
(1912-17).</p>
<p>Series I: General Correspondence, ranges from 1909-1917, with the
exception of five business letters dating from 1937-1942. A
considerable portion consists of recommendations and advice
to students on various aspects of their academic or
professional careers. Among the letters from students, those
of Matilda Castro are especially interesting; their
correspondence was richer, livelier, and more extensive than
that between Tufts and any other student. Her letters of
1912-1914, while an instructor of Philosophy at Bryn Mawr
College, characterize that institution during the
administration of President Thomas. Cynthia Whitaker Tufts
died in 1920. James Tufts and Matilda Castro were married in
1923. </p>
<p>Many letters recommending women students, or those requesting
prominent applicants for positions, illustrate prevailing
attitudes toward women in academia. The difficulties women
faced in securing teaching positions are shown in Tufts'
correspondence with Dagney Sunne (Box I, Folder 1-2).</p>
<p>There is virtually no correspondence with colleagues of a purely
academic nature, and correspondence between Tufts and
members of the University community is sparse. He wrote to
Marion Talbot of his anger at the Trustees' denial in 1916
of an honorary degree to Jane Addams. Tufts had a long and
close association with John Dewey and George Herbert
Mead-both were with him in the Department of Philosophy at
Ann Arbor, and both were recommended by him to Harper. There
are four letters in the collection from John Dewey. Two of
these concern rewriting Ethics, jointly authored with Tufts
in 1908 (the letters, dated 1909 and 1916, are in Box I,
Folders 1 and 8 respectively); another expresses Dewey's
attitudes about teaching, and his wish to retire after
twenty-five years of it. The fourth letter, dated December
8, 1909, is an invitation to Mrs. Tufts. The only letter
from George Herbert Mead (November 28, 1911) deals at length
with departmental news; Mead mentions in it a discussion
with Josiah Royce of philosophical idealism.</p>
<p>Series II: Academic Papers contains outlines and lecture notes
for his philosophy classes; drafts of sermons and public
addresses; a bibliography of Tufts' works; and a bound
volume of salutary letters presented to Tufts by the
Philosophy Club at his retirement dinner in 1930. There is
also correspondence with Dagobert Runes and Ralph Winn from
1941-42, regarding Tufts' minor collaboration in The
Dictionary of Philosophy, a work never published. A
paper-"Ethics, develops Tufts' interest in social
ethics; there are also drafts on the philosophy of law and
unionization.</p>
<p>Series III: Personal Memoirs, contains texts written after Tufts'
retirement in 1930. They were never completed. Beginning
with a genealogy of the Tufts family, the memoirs describe
Tufts' student years, his experiences at the University of
Chicago, and involvements in social reform organizations.
Two chapters were edited by Matilda Castro Tufts for
inclusion in a commemorative volume published after Tufts'
death.</p>
<p>The style of the memoirs is simple and engaging. He vividly
recounts his experiences in Grand Forks County, North Dakota
as a minister for the Baptist Home Missions Board. These
autobiographical excepts provide a glimpse of the
University's early years: Tufts describes Harper's plans for
the University; contrasts Harper's presidency with that of
his successor, Harry Pratt Judson; and offers biographical
sketches of many contemporaries on the University Faculty.
He outlines the concerns of the Board of Trustees under
President Ernest Dewitt Burton. Tufts was disturbed by the
lack of fraternity between students and professors that he
found at the University of Chicago; early in his Chicago
career, he became Dean of the Senior Colleges (1898-1904)
because he felt that an administrative position might
provide opportunity for interaction with students "along
somewhat different lines from those in the classroom." He
was a member of the faculty committee to elect a new
president after Harry Pratt Judson's retirement in 1922,
served as Vice-President and Dean of the Faculties of the
University from 1924-26, and toured cities across the
country with A. A. Stagg to stimulate alumni contributions
during the University's development campaign of 1924-26.</p>
<p>Series IV documents Tufts social and political
activities. He served the City Club of Chicago Committee on
Housing Conditions as Chairman in 1910, and as keynote
speaker ("Housing in Illinois Cities," Box IV, Folder 2) at
the 14th annual meeting of the Illinois State Conference of
Charities and Correction in 1909. Among his collaborators on
a study of housing congestion in Chicago's suburbs were
Sophonisba Breckenridge and Edith Abbott of the University
of Chicago. The Committee's research culminated in an
exhibit in 1913 detailing housing conditions in Chicago.</p>
<p>In 1915 Tufts was president of the Illinois State Committee on
Social Legislation; composed of 28 independent agencies,
this committee served primarily to lobby for the passage of
social reform legislation and for the enforcement of laws
and ordinances. Drafts of many of the laws which the
Committee supported are contained in Box IV.</p>

<p>Tyler papers contain correspondence, minutes, sample dissertations, examinations, manuscripts of speeches and articles, published works, biographical material, and letters of recommendation. Papers document Tyler's involvement with the United States Department of Agriculture Extension Service workshops, Doane College, the American Council on Education, and the University of Chicago Department of Education and Division of Social Sciences, as well as other organizations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Ralph W. Tyler Papers have been arranged into eight series: I. University of Chicago, II. Biographical and Personal Papers, III. Correspondence, IV. Writings by Tyler, V. Writings by Others, VI. Audio-Visual, VII. Restricted, and VIII. Oversized.
</p>

The majority of the papers in Series I concern Tyler’s administrative work, and therefore the bulk of the series is made up of correspondence and reports arranged in alphabetical order by topic/subject, or occasionally by author.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>SERIES II – BIOGRAPHICAL AND PERSONAL PAPERS
</p>
<p>Consists of standard biographical information and personal materials including awards, honorary degrees, resumes, as well as a number of dissertations written about Tyler.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>SERIES III – CORRESPONDENCE
</p>
<p>The correspondence in this series is of an academic and professional nature. It has been arranged into chronological subseries of 1942-1945, 1946-1982, and 1981-1988. Within each group the folders are alphabetized by subject matter or respondent. The majority of correspondence that Tyler engaged in during the 1981-1988 time period was via his involvement with the System Development Foundation. Within the last subseries of the correspondence, 1981-1988, there is a variety of exchanges between Tyler and Mortimer Adler that are arranged according to topic, including the Institute for Philosophical Research and the Paideia Proposal.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>SERIES IV - WRITINGS BY TYLER
</p>
<p>This series includes reprints, copies, original manuscripts and drafts by Tyler and has been organized into eleven subseries: (1) Bibliography; (2) Periodicals; (3) Books, Pamphlets, &amp; Papers; (4) Theses; (5) Reprinted Materials; (6) Reprints and Drafts; (7) Speeches and Writings; (8) Center for Advanced Study of Behavior Sciences; (9) Publications; (10) Academic &amp; Professional Material; and (11) Speeches 1982-1983.

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>The materials in this collection date from 1977 to 2009 with the majority dating between 1981 and 1985. The bulk of the collection relates to the construction of the library building at the University of Chicago campus. This includes copies of construction contracts, floorplans and construction drawings, technical information relating to the construction materials and products, data from site surveys and reports, and Schedule B's from the construction process. There is also a small amount of meeting minutes and memoranda relating to the planning and execution of the collection merger. Additionally, the collection contains trace sheets and dealer information from 1982 to 1983 for missing Crerar material. The collection is divided into five series.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series I, John Crerar Library Construction, contains materials relating to the planning and construction of the John Crerar Library building on the University of Chicago campus. Materials date from 1977 to 1985 and are arranged topically. Planning documents are first, followed by construction records arranged alphabetically within the groupings of subcontractor, materials and products, reports, meetings, and scheduling. Researchers should refer to Series IV for oversized blueprints and engineering drawings relating to construction.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The majority of files in Series I represent the work product of the primary contractor, Schal Associates, and their exchanges with their various subcontractors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II, Missing Books Information, contains processing paperwork from the John Crerar Library missing book file. The majority of the materials are related to the 1980-1982 collection inventory carried out in connection with the prosecution of Joseph Putnam. Putnam was arrested in January 1983 and sentenced to two years in federal prison for the systematic theft and resale of rare books from the John Crerar Library. The books, sold through John Howell Books to various academic institutions and private collectors, were worth an estimated $330,000. The processing paperwork provides metadata for materials published within the 1828-1984 data range. Series II also contains copies of index cards for missing books and a book plate. Materials are arranged alphabetically by author name.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III, Audio-Visual, contains 2 compact discs from the Kathleen A Zar Symposium at the University of Chicago in 2009.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series IV, Oversized, contains oversized construction drawings, blueprints, and building plans from the planning and construction of the John Crerar Library building at the University of Chicago. Materials are arranged alphabetically within each box, under the categories of subcontractor, materials and products, reports, and plans. Researchers should refer to Series I for related non-oversized materials. This series also contains a plaque from the John Crerar Library Director’s Office and a large scrapbook of photographs of the library.</p>

<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>This is an artificial collection containing scrapbooks compiled and donated by University of Chicago--affiliated individuals and offices. The collection is divided into three series.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The scrapbooks in Series I, New Clippings, contain articles about the university, including its founding and initial funding. Later books contain articles about the death of President Harper, the building of Harper Memorial Library and Rockefeller Chapel, and about the University's early 20th-century scientific discoveries and achievements.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series II, Campus Life, contains scrapbooks of event programs, tickets, official bulletins and announcements, and other ephemera.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Series III, Students, contains scrapbooks and scrapbook pages compiled by university students. Volume grouping indicates scrapbooks believed to be compiled by the same entity, relating to the same subject, and/or received by the library at the same time. Scrapbooks are arranged chronologically within each series, with the exception of Scrapbooks 41 and 42, late additions to the collection.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains scrapbooks of news clippings documenting the University's founding, the hiring of the first faculty members, and the death of President Harper. There are a number of articles about John D. Rockefeller and the University's initial funding. Of particular interest is a book of political cartoons dealing with the relation between John D. Rockefeller and William Rainey Harper, and a large collection of articles about women voters in the 1924 election. The scrapbooks also cover important events in the life of the University, such as the building of Harper Memorial Library, Yerkes Observatory, and Rockefeller Chapel, and the scientific discoveries and scholarly findings of University faculty. There are three scrapbooks of clippings dealing with University athletics, including the end of the football program in 1938.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains scrapbooks of materials relating to campus events and student life. There are invitations to and programs for campus events, university bulletins and reports, and internal memos. Among the other ephemera in the books are tickets, picture postcards, registration cards, and newspaper clippings. Books of clippings exclusively related to athletics or campus groups are included in this series, rather than Series I. </p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This series contains scrapbooks (and excerpts from scrapbooks) compiled by University of Chicago students. Two contain event programs, photographs, clippings, and other ephemera. Scrapbook 39 documents the Student Lecture Service, with information about the speakers brought to campus and lecture-related ephemera.</p>

<p>Series I: FIRST STUDENT-FACULTY COMMITTEE ON RANKING (DUNHAM COMMITTEE)

The first Committee was composed of six faculty members and six students, and was chaired by Professor Allison Dunham of the Law School. The Committee's papers record the methods which they used to carry out their charge. Materials on the draft laws and the Selective Service System were acquired, as were statements on the policies of other schools. The Committee also used the results of a questionnaire survey made of undergraduate male opinion. Minutes of meetings and outlines and drafts show the rapid evolution of the Committee's report, which was submitted in time for the June 7 meeting of the University Senate.

Series II: SECOND STUDENT-FACULTY COMMITTEE ON RANKING (FISKE COMMITTEE)

A second Committee was soon appointed to update the Dunham report, as the work of the First Committee was called, and to consider the ranking question and its implications in greater depth than was possible for the Dunham Committee. The Second Committee included five faculty members and five students, whose chairman was psychology Professor Donald W. Fiske. The greater bulk of the Second Committee's papers reflects the greater thoroughness with which they were able to use the methods of their predecessors. Their report was submitted in January 1967.

<p>These records unevenly document the Extension's history. Little is preserved here about some important units, such as the Lecture-Study Department, while shorter-lived programs, such as the Navy Correspondence Courses Research Project, are heavily documented. There are eight series in the collection:</p>
<p>Series I contains minutes of the Board of the University Extension from 1901 to 1911. Curricular, appointment, and financial matters are discussed. Also of interest are the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Present Status and Prospects of University Extension (1909) and the Report to the President and Trustees of the Committee on the Institute for Popular Adult Education (1910).</p>
<p>Series II: Home Study Department is divided into three subseries. The first focuses on the formative decades of the Home-Study Department. Box 1 holds Correspondence-Study Secretary H. F. Mallory's bound letter book for October 1897 to October 1898, which is the only correspondence preserved from the early years. Thirty volumes of examination results give complete documentation about grades from 1922 through 1961, and ten oversized volumes of Home-Study receipts for tuition, books, and miscellaneous charges provide equally continuous financial information from 1 October 1892 through 30 June 1945. A small amount of correspondence concerns cooperative ventures with particular groups in the 1950s, such as Encyclopedia Britannica and the U. S. Coast Guard. Scattered enrollment reports for the ten years after 1942 are found here as well.</p>
<p>Promotional and informational material, including syllabi, addresses, printed announcements and circulars, comprise the second subseries. As discussed in the final section below, however, more complete collections of syllabi and announcements are located elsewhere in the Archives.</p>
<p>The final subseries is devoted to the Navy Correspondence Courses Research Project. Set up in 1949, this project prepared several hundred general and technical courses for Naval personnel, enlisted men and officers, those on active duty and those in the reserves. There are two principal groups of material in this subseries: correspondence; and summaries, reports, and contracts.</p>
<p>Series III documents the Lecture-Study Department from 1892 to 1902. Virtually all of the material is printed matter, including circulars, syllabi, and lecture announcements.</p>
<p>In Series IV are located general records related to the University College/Downtown Center. The first subseries contains general information dating from roughly 1901 through 1959, including minutes, statistics, survey results, working statements, and annual, general, and quarterly reports. There are folders devoted to the ongoing problems of name and publicity, and several staff manuals dating from 1946 to 1958. Concluding the first subseries are historical overviews of the Extension, among them "The University Extension Services," published in 1932 as volume eight of the University of Chicago Survey series.</p>
<p>The second subseries contains course and conference materials. Highlights are "Automation for Senior Officers," presented in 1955 and 1956, and "Organizing and Managing Information," offered in 1957 and 1958. Of particular note is material from an especially popular offering, the World Politics program, 1958-1960.</p>
<p>Series V: Institutes and Programs is a chronological arrangement of special institutes and programs organized by the Extension from the 1920s through the 1960s. As in the case of the Institute of Meat Packing and Public Lectures, much that has been preserved here is statistical, including budget, attendance, and enrollment figures. An exception is the assorted material-newspaper clippings, correspondence, tickets, sales reports, announcements, and seating charts-saved from the 1939 public lectures given by Dr. Eduard Bene, former president of Czechoslovakia. There is also a great deal of descriptive material in the series, such as course announcements and promotional pieces documenting the Great Books Program and the wartime Engineering, Science and Management Defense Training Program. Little correspondence has survived except for the Institute of Statistics and the Institute of Public Service. Other programs are more scantily documented, among them: the Executive Program, 1945-1958; Art Institute courses, 1953-1956; the Basic Program of Liberal Education for Adults, 1949-1958; and the Economic Education Program at Republic Steel, ca. 1949-1950. More recently the Extension has turned its attention to urban problems, including the future of the Woodlawn community. These records are primarily committee proposals, reports, agenda, budgets, and papers on urban topics.</p>
<p>Series VI documents the Self-Study Project from the mid-1950s through the mid-1960s and underwritten by the Fund for Adult Education. (It should be noted that the 1933 material listed in the inventory is a mimeographed copy of a portion of "The University Extension Services" which was included with self-study files.) The project's goal was to examine, assess, and place within historical context every facet of University College operations: students, faculty, administrative staff, curriculum, and facilities. Series VI houses material about this project, including correspondence, reports, and evaluations. The bulk of the material, specifically the 39 projects undertaken, is filed by project number.</p>
<p>The Union Research and Education Projects/Union Leadership Program, the subject of Series VII, also began in the mid-1950s. Designed for both members and officers of trade unions, the Union Research and Education Projects offered consulting services, advanced education, and research on union problems. This series includes: conference and seminar materials (26:4; 27:6-7, 13-14, 16; 28:3), discussion guides (26:6-27:2), correspondence and other general files. There are also proposals, among them several for the Union Executive Program (28:6-8) and the American Institute for Free Labor Development (25:10-11). Reports constitute a major portion of this series. In addition to the 1960 and 1963 annual reports (28:1-2) and a 1949 progress report for the Carnegie Corporation (26:1), there are reports, correspondence, and memoranda issued by advisory groups, most notably the Faculty Advisory Board, 1957-1963 (27:3) and the Labor Advisory Committee, 1955-1963 (27:9-10). There are as well union membership attitude surveys dating primarily from the mid-1950s (28:9-14).</p>
<p>Series VIII: Promotional and Informational Material comprises 13 boxes of promotional and descriptive material, most of it originally preserved in scrapbooks, while flyers and newspaper clippings constitute the remainder. One of the most complete series of the collection, this material is arranged in rough chronological order.</p>
<p>Subscription lectures were offered under the auspices of the University Open Lectures, Lecture Association, and Public Lectures. Their work from 1899 through 1943 is very well represented in the form of tickets, announcements, programs, newspaper clippings, syllabi, reading lists, and mimeographed letters of solicitation and instruction. Enrollment and attendance figures for many courses are available elsewhere in the Archives.</p>
<p>University College materials from 1908 through 1944 have survived in similar abundance and include printed circulars and announcements, interdepartmental memoranda, promotional mailings, notices, syllabi, reading lists, examinations, and quarterly course schedules.</p>
<p>The University Orchestral Association was formed in 1909 to provide an annual series of orchestral concerts in Mandel Hall. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra was always the season's feature, but other musicians and performers appeared on campus as well. Though there were special rates for students and faculty, attendance fell so sharply in the mid-1930s that the organization folded. Among the materials preserved here are announcements, notices, seating charts, sales and attendance records, and program booklets from 1909 through 1936.</p>
<p>The short-lived Institute for Public Service offered courses designed for public officials and government employees. One folder of scrapbook items-including small posters, correspondence, course descriptions, and alumni lists-documents its work in 1941-1942.</p>
<p>The rest of this series consists of more general groups of newspaper clippings, 1949-1953, and flyers and promotional materials, 1930s-1950s.</p>

<head>Scope Note</head>
<p>Uncle Tom's Cabin: or, Life Among the Lowly was an anti-slavery novel that profoundly affected American attitudes towards African Americans and slavery in the United States. The best-selling novel of the 19th century, Uncle Tom's Cabin is credited both with galvanizing Northern support for the Civil War and with creating a number of durable stereotypes about blacks. Major themes of this sentimental novel are the fundamental incommensurability of slavery and Christianity, the abiding power of Christian love, and the moral power and sanctity of women.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Uncle Tom's Cabin generated great interest in England. Vendors sold 200,000 copies in 1852, its debut year. Critics generally agree that this fascination with the tale stemmed from British antipathy to America. Brits did not necessarily harbor their own national hatred of slavery, but felt vindicated by the play's criticism of Americans' self-professed freedoms.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection contains promptbooks, playbills, posters, programs and other pictorial or printed ephemera, most of which are of British origin and describe or announce theatrical presentations of the tale. The announcements of presentations typically contain specific information about actors, scenes, and the venue. Most of the other documents are critical reviews of performances of various adaptations of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

<p>When the papers were deposited, they included all of the material used by Gunther in preparing his manuscripts. Much of this material was discarded. This included numerous clippings, generally from well-known publications, newspapers such as The New York Times, the New York Herald-Tribune, the Chicago Daily News, The Times (London), the Manchester Guardian, magazines such as the New Statesman, The Nation, Time, Life, Foreign Affairs, The New Republic, Colliers, and Foreign Policy Reports. Also included were government documents and press releases, United Nations documents, pamphlets, both tourist-type and informational issued by official agencies and private organizations, and reprints of articles. The collection also contained numerous bibliographical notes which referred to page or volume in some published work. There were also cryptic notes, apparently reminders to the author to relate some anecdote or to include some point of fact. Also discarded were unmarked copies of manuscripts and unmarked galley proofs. The materials retained in the collection were those manuscripts and notes which showed most clearly Gunther's methods and sources of information. Gunther has described his work methods in two articles published in Harper's Magazine, March and April, 1961, entitled "The Fun of Writing the Inside Books," and in a longer book version of these articles published in 1962 entitled A Fragment of Autobiography.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection includes notes, manuscripts and proofs in various stages and correspondence dealing with Gunther's works. The material in the collection can be subdivided under several headings: manuscripts, correspondence, notes, and miscellaneous materials.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The manuscripts include the original manuscripts for all of Gunther's works. These are generally rough typewritten drafts, done by Gunther himself. They are heavily corrected with both major stylistic and substantive changes. Most of these revisions are in longhand, but Gunther also used the "cut and paste" method to rearrange paragraphs and phrases. Once this first attempt was in reasonably acceptable order, the first formal typing was done by a typist. Gunther then heavily revised this typewritten draft in the same manner described above. This is the First Revision or Second Draft of the manuscript. Occasionally there are three drafts of some chapters. Again the complete manuscript with these new revisions was typed and this clean copy revised. This Third or last Draft, called "the Printer's Copy," was not so heavily revised, but even so, there are usually a dozen cuts and changes, mostly to change "verbal felicities," (Gunther's phrase) on every page. The book was set in type from this copy. (If there had been no time to completely retype the First Revision, only those pages or fragments of pages which were heavily revised were retyped and inserted to make up the Printer's Copy.) Also included are the original manuscripts of Gunther's articles for magazines or newspapers, portions of which were sometimes included in the published books in revised form, and news dispatches which Gunther often wrote while on his various trips.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For several of Gunther's works, carbon copies of the original manuscript were sent to readers for correction or checking. Those sections which were annotated by Gunther's "experts" or specialists also make up part of the collection and are clearly indicated.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Galley proofs could be called the Fourth Draft, since Gunther revised them completely, mostly for stylistic reasons, but also to bring the book up to date by adding new material about persons or events.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The correspondence concerning the "inside" books, which is not an extensive part of the papers thus far deposited, has been divided into two sections. Informational and Post-publication. The "Informational" correspondence concerns questions of fact, answers to Gunther's inquiries, comments on manuscripts sent to "experts," material bringing Gunther up to date, suggestions from friends and acquaintances of people to see, etc. The "Post-publication" correspondence is from readers who commented on Gunther's works. Post-publication letters from well-known persons and from people who had corresponded with Gunther before publication are generally included in the Informational file. The correspondence is filed with the manuscripts and notes for the book with which it is concerned. However, there are two additional boxes of correspondence which include material concerning Gunther's publishers, Harper and Bros, and Hamish Hamilton, and some folders of miscellaneous correspondence which do not deal with specific books.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The notes constitute the major portion of the collection to date. Gunther wrote his notes longhand on small scratch pads. The great majority of these notes are interview notes, some from well-known persons in government, business or the arts, others with the average citizen, such as taxi cab drivers or the like. Others are notes taken at lunches, dinners, or parties. Generally, these notes are identified by the last name of the person interviewed, but sometimes they are simply marked "embassy," or "lunch," indicating that the notes were taken at an embassy meeting or affair, or at a luncheon party, or they are marked with the first name, the initials, or perhaps the nickname of the person interviewed. Gunther clipped all of his interview notes apart into thousand of little "sniblets" which were carefully subdivided into topics. He was generally very careful when cutting the notes apart to indicate the interviewee. In arranging these notes, however, they have been drawn together by the name of the person interviewed. Where possible, from internal evidence, from the published works, from Gunther's agendas of persons to see, they have been identified. Many, however, are not, and are simply listed under the last name on the guide or by Gunther's own designation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The miscellaneous notes include a wide variety of material. Many are unmarked notes, which are generally Gunther's impressions of someone, someplace or some event. These have been filed by topic. Other notes are sentences, phrases, or paragraphs, which Gunther jotted down and which were subsequently used in the manuscript in some form or another. Also included are outlines for his chapters, names of persons to see or interview, itineraries, schedules, and agendas, as well as check sheets, proof sheets, libel sheets, and watch sheets. These latter were made by Gunther to determine the accuracy of his manuscript after rereading.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The miscellaneous materials section is made up of articles, memoranda, news dispatches and notes by other persons. In some countries, Gunther would commission someone on the local scene to prepare information papers. News dispatches, articles, and other memoranda, both published and unpublished, sent to Gunther by his colleagues and some of his contacts are included in this designation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The collection is in 122 boxes. A guide to the material follows. The manuscripts are arranged by book publication date, beginning with INSIDE EUROPE. Preceding the guide to each book, there is a more detailed description of the material in each section. The juvenile books, correspondence, and materials from CHICAGO REVISTED are located at the end of the guide.
</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>INSIDE EUROPE, published in 1936, is the first of the "inside books." The papers are contained in seven boxes. With the exception of the chapters on Germany, there is only one complete revision of this material. The chapters on Germany, however, have two or three drafts. These additional drafts have been included with the original manuscript and have been so marked. The manuscripts, therefore, are as follows-</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, including the additional drafts on Germany;</p>
<p>2. First Revision (Second Draft) which is a typed copy of the original manuscript, and is substantially the same as the published version; and</p>
<p>3. Galley proofs, with the author's corrections and additions.</p>
<p>The Printer's Copy was not included in the original deposit.</p>
<p>There were five editions of INSIDE EUROPE. The second edition (October, 1936) did not necessitate the setting up of new type, but merely required insertions. The manuscript inserts must be used with the pagination of the first edition. New chapters were also added. These manuscripts are found with the "Revised Edition." However, the last two editions, the New 1938 Edition and the 1940 War Edition, were complete reworkings of the book, including new typesetting. The pages of one of the published editions were pasted onto large sheets of paper and Gunther made his corrections on the pages themselves and in the margins. The original manuscripts of inserts and the new chapters are clearly indicated. In October 1938, there was another edition, entitled the Peace Edition, which included mainly a new introduction and one new chapter, entitled "The Fascist Offensive," which was inserted in the book as Chapter 7a. Galley proofs of the revisions are not included in the collection.</p>
<p>Manuscripts of twenty-one articles written by Gunther are also part of the papers. Most appeared in such magazines as Harpers, The Nation, and Foreign Affairs. They deal with a wide variety of subjects and have been listed alphabetically. Most are simply carbon copies of the manuscript. Several of the articles, or portions of them, were used in the published book, but only after being heavily revised. There are also press dispatches from the Balkans written by Gunther, and miscellaneous typewritten notes, mostly on Austria, where Gunther had been stationed for many years.</p>
<p>The correspondence concerning this book is not extensive. One folder contains several letters from U.S. Embassy officials in Rome, London, Prague, and Berlin which answer questions of fact posed by Gunther. There are also several letters from reporters answering certain of Gunther's questions. The post-publication letters came mostly from English readers generally pointing out minor errors of fact.</p>
<p>The research notes for INSIDE EUROPE are not as voluminous as those for some of Gunther's other books. He was, of course, much more intimately informed on European affairs, since he had spent eleven years in Europe as a foreign correspondent. There are some interview notes, particularly those on a talk with Thomas Masaryk, founder and first president of Czechoslovakia, several English politicians, and H. R. Knickerbocker, the well-informed American journalist. Most of the notes, arranged alphabetically by country and topic, are factual notes.</p>
<p>Among miscellaneous materials are articles, memoranda, and copies of dispatches by several of Gunther's colleagues.</p>
</scopecontent>

<p>INSIDE ASIA, published in 1939, is the second of the "inside books." The materials for this work are contained in four boxes. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther</p>
<p>2. Printer's Copy, which is a typed carbon copy of the original manuscript (no. 1, above) with additional corrections, making the manuscript, therefore, the First Revision or the Second Draft.</p>
<p>The galley and page proofs were not included in the original deposit.</p>
<p>The original manuscript of the Second Edition, published in 1942, is a paste-up of the pages of the first edition with marginal corrections, numerous inserts, and a completely new chapter on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>The correspondence numbers about eighty letters, with Gunther's brief answers attached. It comes from all over the world, mostly pointing out errors in fact, or the misspelling of foreign words or names. Several letters, especially those from Sir Sekunder Hyat Khan, prime minister of Punjab in India, and Hendrik Van Loon, are particularly interesting. One letter, from Prince Chula of Siam, discusses political affairs in that country at great length, obviously from personal knowledge.</p>
<p>The research notes for INSIDE ASIA were not among the original deposit. Certain notes which deal with the 1942 Revision, as well as notes for an article in Fortune on the Middle East, are included in the collection.</p>
<p>Among miscellaneous materials are several long research papers on Palestine, Japan and China, apparently done for Gunther by observers on the spot.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>The papers for INSIDE LATIN AMERICA, published in 1941, are contained in seven boxes. As with Gunther's first two "inside" books, there is only one complete revision of the manuscript. The manuscript material is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther</p>
<p>2. Printer's Copy, which is a typed copy of the original manuscript (no. 1, above) with corrections-thus, the First Revision or Second Draft; and</p>
<p>3. Galley proofs, corrected, but incomplete.</p>
<p>During Gunther's fact-finding trip, he wrote several articles for the North American Newspaper Alliance, and made several radio broadcasts. The manuscripts of this material, some of it used, but only after complete revision, is included among the papers.</p>
<p>The correspondence concerning this book is not extensive. The Informational correspondence is, however, of some interest. Gunther corresponded with U. S. State Department officials and embassy officials in the various countries he visited. There are confidential letters about the internal political scene from, among others, Claude Bowers, Ambassador to Chile; Spruille Braden, Ambassador to Colombia; Vernon Fluharty, an embassy official; Laurence Duggan of the State Department; and Overton Ellis, a legation official in El Salvador. There is also correspondence with several American journalists stationed in Latin America. The material is arranged alphabetically by correspondent. The Post-publication correspondence, for the most part, deals with minor corrections of the text.</p>
<p>As in most of Gunther's other books, his major sources of information were his interview notes. Because Gunther did not list in his book, nor completely in his notes, the names of most of the persons whom he interviewed, it has been impossible to identify many of them. However, where possible, the interviewees have been at least tentatively identified. Gunther interviewed most of the Latin American presidents, numerous cabinet officials, politicians, journalists, American officials, and others. Among those interviewed were Getulio Vargas, president of Brazil; Pedro Aguirre Cerda, president of Chile; Eduardo Santos, president of Colombia; Fulgencio Batista, president of Cuba; Lazero Cárdenas, former president of Mexico; Victor Haya de la Torre, APRA leader in Peru; and Luis Munoz Karín, governor of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Among miscellaneous materials are memoranda on individual politicians and political events prepared by newspaper correspondents for Gunther's information. These notes have been included with the material on each country and, where possible, the author has been identified.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>D-DAY, published in 1944, concerns the Allied invasion of Italy and the Mediterranean war in general. The material is contained in two boxes. The two manuscripts deposited are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther; and</p>
<p>2. Printer's copy which is a carbon copy of the original manuscript (no. 1, above) with additional corrections.</p>
<p>Among other manuscripts are carbon copies of Gunther's dispatches, broadcasts, and articles written during his trip. During the D-Day trip he carried three credentials, and was working for three different organizations-the North American Newspaper Alliance, The Blue Network, and Readers' Digest.</p>
<p>The correspondence is not extensive, and is mostly made up of telegrams. One letter, however, from the American legation in Cairo, Egypt, concerns answers to certain questions that Gunther had submitted to the prime minister of Egypt.</p>
<p>The research notes also are not extensive. It would appear that most of the book was written from notes which Gunther kept in a diary during his six months in the Mediterranean area. However, the diary was not included in the original deposit. The majority of the notes concern the Balkan countries and the Middle East. Among the interview notes are those with Laurence Steinhardt, U. S. Ambassador to Turkey, and Sukru Saracoglu, Turkish prime minister. There are also miscellaneous notes on Field Marshal Alexander, Field Marshal Montgomery, and General Eisenhower, among others.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>INSIDE U.S.A., the fourth of the "inside" books, was published in 1947. The materials concerning it are contained in twenty-three boxes. The manuscripts for this work are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther;</p>
<p>2. Specialist Review Copy, which refers to a typed carbon copy of the original manuscripts with Gunther's corrections which was sent to various "experts" around the country for comment. A complete copy of this manuscript has been kept, though many of the pages and chapters were not annotated by the experts. However, included among the Informational Correspondence are letters of comment by these experts which refer to the pagination of this copy of the manuscript. Pages with comments by Gunther's publishers are also included.</p>
<p>3. First Revision or Second Draft, which is only fragmentary. Gunther employed his usual "cut and paste" method and large sections were revised in longhand. However, only those pages which were most heavily corrected were retyped. Some complete chapters were also retyped. These retyped pages and chapters were then further revised and added to the Printer's copy.</p>
<p>4. Printer's copy, which is, for the most part, a corrected copy of the Specialist Review Copy (no. 2, above) with the retyped pages of the First Revision (no. 3, above).</p>
<p>5. Galley proofs, with author's corrections and additions.</p>
<p>The original manuscript of the second edition, published in 1951, was a paste-up of the pages of the first edition with marginal corrections and numerous inserts. However, the paste-up pages were not included in the original deposit. The original manuscripts of the inserts, which were included, are numbered consecutively and must be collated with the pages of the first edition. Some of the manuscript inserts are only a few lines in length, others run to several pages. Galley proofs of the second edition, with the author's corrections, also make up part of this section.</p>
<p>The Informational Correspondence is extensive. This category includes a rough outline and tentative table of contents sent to various people for comment even before Gunther set out on his fact-finding trip. Among those who responded are journalists Louis Fischer of The Nation and Nicholas Roosevelt of The New York Times, Thomas Lamont of the J. P. Morgan Co., and author Mark Van Doren. Gunther corresponded with hundreds of people, including all forty-eight governors, senators, representatives, state office holders, mayors, and numerous other state and local officials, asking certain questions such as "who runs this state or city?" There is also extensive correspondence with newspaper publishers, editors, and reporters whom Gunther met on his trips and who were asked similar questions, or brought Gunther up to date on events since his visit. In addition, Gunther corresponded with many of the people whom he interviewed, asking for clarification of some points of fact or interpretation. The correspondence with Gunther's "experts," who read the various chapters for accuracy, is also included in this section. The informational category contains both pre- and post-publication material. It is arranged by state and alphabetically within each state.</p>
<p>The Post-Publication correspondence is primarily readers' response after publication. It includes one folder from prominent persons and personal friends of Gunther, probably segregated by Gunther or his secretary. Included among the correspondents are Stephen Duggan, Director of the Institute of International Education, radio commentator Quincy Howe, Alf Landon, author Amy Loveman, journalist Anne O'Hare McCormick, H. L. Mencken, historian Allan Nevins, educator Anson Phelps Stokes, commentator Raymond Swing, and State Department official Sumner Welles. Apparently some of these comments were used by Gunther's publishers in their advertisements for the book. Specific correspondence commenting upon or criticizing individual chapters or parts of chapters, suggesting revisions, pointing out errors in fact, spelling or grammar, is arranged alphabetically by state and then by author. General correspondence relating to the book as a whole or a substantial portion is arranged alphabetically by correspondent.</p>
<p>The research notes, which make up the majority of material in this section, are mainly interview notes. Gunther interviewed governors, senators, representatives, politicians on all levels, editors, publishers, reporters, businessmen, labor leaders, educators, clergymen, civic leader, farmers, authors and hundreds of others. Where possible, the interviewees have been identified. A representative sampling of those interviewed would include Jonathan Daniels, editor of the Raleigh, N. C., News &amp; Observer, Senator William Fulbright of Arkansas, motion picture producer Walter Wanger, Robert Hutchins, then Chancellor of the University of Chicago, Mayor Wilson Wyatt of Louisville, Kentucky, labor leader Walter Reuther, Howard Johnson, Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, Harry Truman, then Vice President, Robert Moses, New York state and city official, professor Carl Friedrich of Harvard University, E. H. Crump, political boss of Memphis, Tennessee, David Lilienthal, director of TVA, Speaker Sam Rayburn, President George Albert Smith of the Mormon Church, Richard Neuberger, then an Oregon state senator, and author Lilian Smith, among others.</p>

<scopecontent>
<p>DEATH BE NOT PROUD is a different type of work than any of Gunther's other books. It is a personal memoir and a memorial to Gunther's son, John, Jr., who died in 1947 of a brain tumor after a long and courageous struggle. The original manuscript of DEATH BE NOT PROUD is not a part of the papers deposited with the University of Chicago. Gunther donated the manuscript to the New York Public Library. However, a carbon copy of the original manuscript is included. The printer's copy and galley or page proofs were not a part of the original deposit.</p>
<p>The research notes for this work are, of course, very different from those in the rest of the collection. Included in this section are school and camp reports, medical reports, correspondence with doctors, and numerous longhand notes. These longhand notes, which had been cut into small pieces, record Gunther's own memories, the recollections of Frances Gunther, and of others, including Johnny himself, who kept a diary, of the events which transpired during the long illness. These notes have been arranged chronologically, as they were when deposited.</p>
<p>The correspondence is the most extensive part of the material on this work. There are two folders of personal correspondence, all post-publication, from friends of Gunther commenting on the book. There are also four boxes, containing approximately four thousand letters from the general public. The book obviously evoked strong feelings on the part of the readers. The letters are from people who had suffered similar tragedies, some whose relatives were then suffering from cancer, letters of general sympathy from children and adults from all over the world. The book had been condensed in The Ladies' Home Journal, in the Readers' Digest and its eleven international editions, and later in Coronet, thus having a very wide circulation. The correspondence has been arranged alphabetically within each alphabetical letter. One folder of letters has been segregated. They were used in the introduction to the second edition published in 1953. There is also one folder of letters to Lewis Gannett who wrote a review of the book for the New York Herald-Tribune, and one folder containing letters to Gunther on an article entitled "The Cancer in our Breasts," which was published in McCall's Magazine in 1950.</p>
<p>The material for the book is contained in five boxes.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The papers concerning BEHIND THE CURTAIN, published in 1949, are contained in five boxes. Like several other of Gunther's books, BEHIND THE CURTAIN was first conceived as a series of articles for Look magazine and the New York Herald-Tribune. In arranging the manuscripts, the Look and Herald-Tribune articles are included as the original manuscript. Gunther, in most cases, pasted the published versions onto pieces of paper and then heavily revised them. More than half the book, however, is new material. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript-Look magazine articles-however, only four of the manuscripts of the nine articles are included.</p>
<p>2. Original manuscript-New York Herald-Tribune articles, published under the general title "Inside Europe Today."</p>
<p>3. First Revision or Second Draft, which is the original manuscript for the book version, including revisions of above articles and additions.</p>
<p>4. Printer's copy, with author's corrections.</p>
<p>The correspondence concerning this book is not extensive, but among the more interesting letters are those from M. W. Fodor, a long-time European journalist connected with the American Military Government for Germany, and a letter from Dr. W. C. Weiskopf, Minister Plenipotentiary of Czechoslovakia to the United States.</p>
<p>The interview notes are of special interest. Gunther talked with most of the leaders of Europe during his preparation for the book. Among the many statesmen, journalists, businessmen, and others whom Gunther interviewed are Pope Pius XII, Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi of Italy, Marshal Josip Tito of Yugoslavia, Matyas Rakosi, communist leader of Hungary, American Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Laurence Steinhardt, General Lucius Clay, American Military Governor of Germany, and Jacques Soustelle, Gaullist leader in France.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The material for ROOSEVELT IN RETROSPECT, published in 1950, is contained in six boxes. The manuscripts for this work are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther, however it appears that chapters 5B, 5C and 17 were not written at the same time as the rest of the original manuscript. The First Revision of these three chapters is included in the Printer's copy.</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, with author's additional revisions and corrections;</p>
<p>3. Printer's copy, with author's corrections;</p>
<p>4. Galley proofs, with author's corrections.</p>
<p>The original manuscripts of three magazine articles are also included.</p>
<p>The correspondence, of which there are only four folders, indicates that this book evoked strong sentiments either for or against FDR. Among the more interesting letters are those from several people who knew or had met FDR and wished to relate to Gunther their own reminiscences. There is also a long memorandum by Grace Tully, FDR's personal secretary, on the inaccuracies in the book.</p>
<p>The majority of the notes are interview notes. Gunther interviewed more than eighty persons, and where possible, the interviewees are identified on the guide. Gunther had extensive interviews with Bernard Baruch, Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert Sherwood, Laurence Steinhardt, Summer Welles, and many others. Also included among the notes are those of an interview with FDR in 1941.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The material for THE RIDDLE OF MACARTHUR, published in 1951, is contained in three boxes. The original manuscript and the First Revision were not included in the original deposit, nor were galley proofs, but page proofs, which were not heavily revised as was Gunther's method on galley proofs, are a part of the collection. The manuscripts, therefore, are as follows:</p>
<p> 1. Printer's copy. with author's corrections;</p>
<p> 2. Page proofs.</p>
<p>Also included among the manuscripts are carbon copies of news dispatches cabled by Gunther to Look magazine on the Korean War and the Far East.</p>
<p>The correspondence concerning THE RIDDLE OF MACARTHUR is not extensive. Among the letters of particular interest are those from Frank Rizzo, a high civilian official in the Occupation Government, and a letter from Samuel E. Morison on naval history. The Post-publication correspondence consists mostly of readers' comment, some quite irate over Gunther's interpretation of MacArthur.</p>
<p>The majority of the research notes are interview notes. Among those interviewed by Gunther were Emperor Hirohito, General MacArthur, Prime Minister Yoshida, various high American officers on MacArthur's staff, civilian employees of SCAP, Japanese politicians and businessmen.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>EISENHOWER-THE MAN AND THE SYMBOL was published in 1952. The materials concerning this minor work of Gunther's are contained in two boxes. The book grew out of a series of articles published in Look magazine in December, 1951. Gunther wrote three long articles for Look on Eisenhower and SHAPE, of which two were published. The manuscripts, therefore, for this book are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript-Look magazine articles, typed and corrected by Gunther</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, which is Gunther's original manuscript for the much longer book version. Gunther used an uncorrected carbon copy of the Look manuscript and using the "cut and paste" method, made numerous emendations, inserts, and corrections.</p>
<p>3. Printer's copy, with author's corrections.</p>
<p>The correspondence is not extensive, filling only two folders. Among the Informational heading is a memorandum from a Look official on Eisenhower as president of Columbia University. The post-publication correspondence comes from readers who had minor corrections to suggest.</p>
<p>The majority of the notes are interview notes. Gunther interviewed military officials on Eisenhower's SHAPE staff, journalists, and several European statesmen. Among them are Eisenhower himself, General Alfred M. Grunther, Jean Monnet, and General Lauris Norstad.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>INSIDE AFRICA. published in 1955, is one of Gunther's longest books, running to over 950 pages. The materials concerning this book are contained in twenty-two boxes. The manuscripts for this work are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and corrected by Gunther</p>
<p>2. Specialist Review copy. However, only those pages with comments are included as well as memoranda prepared by Gunther's "experts";</p>
<p>3. First Revision or Second Draft, which is a heavily revised copy of a carbon copy of the corrected original manuscript;</p>
<p>4. Printer's copy, which is essentially the Third Draft because of the heavy revisions, more so than in any other of Gunther's works;</p>
<p>5. Galley proofs, with author's corrections.</p>
<p>While in Africa, Gunther prepared numerous articles for publication in popular magazines. He used portions of these articles, though in a revised form, in his published book. The twenty-one articles are included in the collection, some in original manuscript, some carbon copies, some clippings.</p>
<p>The informational correspondence is extensive and has been arranged by country or area and then alphabetically. Gunther corresponded with numerous American and British diplomatic officials, government officials, United Nations officials, businessmen and many others. Among the letters of interest are those of Edgar Sengier, the head of Union Miniere in the Congo; the U. S. Ambassador to Ethiopia, Joseph Simonson; a memorandum from the Governor of the gold Coast (Ghana), Sir Charles Arden Clarke who read Gunther's chapter on that country in advance of publication; C. L. Simpson, Liberian Ambassador to the United States; Hamilton Fish Armstrong, editor of Foreign Affairs, on Morocco and North Africa; David Stirling, president of the Capricorn Africa Society; South African attorney and novelist Harry Bloom; the Governor of Tanganyika, Sir Edward Twining; and H. V. L. Swanzy, a high official in the Gold Coast Government.</p>
<p>The Post-publication correspondence is also extensive. It is primarily readers, response. Some of the letters, however, invite Gunther to address various groups, ask for additional information, or offer the correspondent's own views. The correspondence, which comes from all over the worlds, is generally favorable to Gunther's work, but many of the letters take exception to his interpretation, especially those from white settlers in Africa, and particularly in the Union of South Africa. Among the letters of interest are two from Dr. Hastings Banda, at present prime minister of Nyasaland, but then living in the Gold Coast; R. R. Knight, a member of the Canadian House of Commons, and Ann Morisett, an American novelist. Specific correspondence, commenting upon or criticizing individual chapters or parts of chapters, suggesting revisions, pointing out errors of fact, spelling or grammar, is arranged alphabetically by country or area and then alphabetically by author. General correspondence relating to the book as a whole or a substantial portion is arranged alphabetically by correspondent.</p>
<p>The research notes are arranged by country or by area. The majority of the notes are interview notes and, where possible, the interviewee has been identified. Gunther states that he interviewed 1503 persons while preparing his African book. Included among them were governors, colonial officials, embassy and consular staffs, journalist, African chieftains, missionaries, businessmen, nationalists, United Nations personnel, and private citizens. A representative list of the many interviewed would include General Mohammed Naguib, then dictator of Egypt; Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast; Edgar Segnier of Union Miniere in the Belgian Congo; the king of Ruanda; U. N. official Ralph Bunche; Zulu Chief Albert Luthuli; author Alan Paton; J. G. Strijdo-, then prime minister of the Union of South Africa; Walter White of the N.A.A. C.P.; the Pasha of Marrakesh; General Augustin Gulliaume, President-General of Morocco; Roy Welenski, white extremist leader of Northern Rhodesia; Sylvanus Olympio, then nationalist leader in Togoland, and Father Trever Huddleston, Anglican missionary in South Africa.</p>
<p>There are also numerous memoranda, articles, and circulars prepared by others for Gunther's use. Included among these notes are a private mimeographed memoranda by Chester Bowles on his 1955 trip to Africa, biographical notes on Various African personalities, and a copy of an article by Santha Rama Rau entitled "The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta," of which only a portion was published in The Reporter.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>INSIDE RUSSIA TODAY, published in 1958, was originally conceived as a series of five long articles for Collier's magazine. However, during Gunther's trip to Russia, Collier's ceased publication and Look magazine took over the contract. Look decided to print one very long article instead of the five previously commissioned. The book version, however, is in no way an extension of the Look article. Portions of the Look article are used in the book, but in a heavily revised version, and the approach to the book is from an entirely different point of view. The material concerning this book is contained in twelve boxes.</p>
<p>The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, First Revision or Second Draft (partial), Third Draft (partial) of Look article;</p>
<p>2. Original manuscript of book version, typed and corrected by author;</p>
<p>3. Specialist review copy, however, only those pages with comments by Theodore Shabad, Gunther's "expert," and by Cass Canfield of Harper and Bros. are includes;</p>
<p>4. First Revision or Second Draft, which is only fragmentary. Gunther employed his usual "cut and paste" method and large sections were revised in longhand. However, only those pages which were most heavily revised were retyped. These retyped pages were then further revised and added to the Printer's copy.</p>
<p>5. Printer's copy, with author's corrections and additions;</p>
<p>6. Galley proofs, with author's corrections and additions.</p>
<p>Gunther dictated several of the chapters; therefore, the original manuscript is the recordings. However, after the first typing, Gunther extensively revised these manuscripts, as was his method, and the typescript copies of the dictated chapters with the author's corrections have been included with the original manuscript. The recordings have been filed separately.</p>
<p>The Informational Correspondence is not extensive. it is arranged alphabetically and much of it concerns Gunther's Plans for his trip. Also included among the Informational Correspondence are some post-publication letters from certain of Gunther's personal friends who received complimentary copies of the book. The Post-publication correspondence, which is somewhat more extensive, concerns readers' comment on various questions of fact. It is arranged alphabetically.</p>
<p>The research notes have been catalogues in a different manner for INSIDE RUSSIA TODAY. Gunther reports that he took careful notes of conversations with about eighty Russians; however, many of his notes do not indicate their names or their positions. Rather than arranging the notes by subject, country, or area (and then by interviewee) as has been done with the notes for Gunther's other books, they have been arranged by chapters, according to the original manuscript designation. Therefore, those interview notes which are marked with the name of the interviewee are dispersed throughout the material. Among some of the non-Russians interviewed by Gunther are Charles Bohlen, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, E. E. Orchard of the British Foreign Office, Isaiah Berlin, Louis Fischer,</p>
<p>K. P. S. Menon, Indian Ambassador to Russia, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Marshall MacDuffie, and numerous embassy and consular officials, journalists and commentators stationed in Moscow or other areas of the Soviet Union. Notes of interviews with directors of universities, museums, institutes, etc., which have been identified are included under the names of their institutions rather than under their personal names. The rest of the notes are arranged by subject within each chapter. However, the designation of the name of a person, Khrushchev for instance, refers to notes about him, not to notes of an interview with him.</p>
<p>Included among miscellaneous materials are a long series of unpublished memoranda written by former Senator William Benton, publisher of Encyclopedia Britannica, on his trip to Russia.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>TAKEN AT THE FLOOD, published in 1960, is Gunther's only full-length biography. It is the story of Albert D. Lasker, president of Lord and Thomas and called the "Father of Modern Advertising." The materials concerning this book are contained in nine boxes. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed and revised by the author;</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, which is heavily revised. Those pages most heavily revised necessitated retyping and were added to the complete manuscript of this draft. The original manuscripts of these pages are filed separately.</p>
<p>3. Printer's Copy, which is also heavily revised by the author. Those pages most heavily revised were retyped and added to the Printer's Copy. The original manuscripts of these pages are filed separately.</p>
<p>4. Galley Proofs, with author's corrections and additions.</p>
<p>The revisions on the various manuscripts are perhaps more extensive for this book than for any other of Gunther's works.</p>
<p>The Informational Correspondence is quite extensive. There is little printed matter on Albert Lasker and Gunther corresponded with Lasker's family, his friends, and former business associates for information and clarification on certain aspects of his life. Included in this section are long memoranda from the Lasker family suggesting revisions of the First Draft, to most of which Gunther agreed. Among the letters of interest are those from former Senator William Benton, a one-time employee in Lasker's firm, Emerson Foote, vice-president of McCann-Brickson and a former vice-president of Lord and Thomas, Alexander de Seversky, the aeronautical engineer, and Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. There are only two folders of Post-Publication correspondence, many of the letters to Gunther relating additional stories about Lasker or different versions of some story in the published work.</p>
<p>The primary source material for the Lasker book is interview notes. All of the interviewees have been identified in the guide. Among them are William Benton, Fairfax Cone, Samuel Goldwyn, Paul Hopkins, Robert Hutchins, Anna Rosenberg, Alexander de Seversky, Herbert Bayard Swope, and David Sarnoff.</p>
<p>There is also one box which might be classified "The Papers of Albert D. Lasker." This box includes correspondence to and from Lasker. copies of correspondence, a copy of Lasker's reminiscences recorded and transcribed by the Oral History Research Office of Columbia University, copies of Lasker's testimony before various congressional committees, and other materials. Of special interest is the correspondence between Lasker and Senator James Murray and his staff concerning congressional action on cancer research and aid to medical education and the correspondence concerning Lasker's resignation as a University of Chicago trustee in 1942.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>INSIDE EUROPE TODAY, published in 1961 was originally conceived as an article for Reader's Digest. Gunther, however, turned out the longest article, some 42,000 words, that the Digest had ever received, and it was never published in its entirety. Gunther then added to the material and extended it into a full-length book, approximately three times longer than the Reader's Digest manuscript. The materials concerning this work are contained in eight boxes. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript: Reader/s Digest, typed and corrected by author;</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft-Reader's Digest, which is heavily revised;</p>
<p>3. Original Manuscript of Additional chapters, which are, in this instance, records of dictation;</p>
<p>4. First Revision or Second Draft of additional chapters, which is a typescript of the dictated chapters heavily revised by author;</p>
<p>5. Printers copy, which is a carbon copy of the material above which has been merged, However, it is heavily revised, with numerous retyped pages and inserts. Gunther employed the "cut and paste" method,</p>
<p>6. Galley proofs, with author's corrections. Several of the chapters have been heavily revised.</p>
<p>No post-publication correspondence was included in the original deposits. The informational correspondence, which is not extensive, concerns mainly factual material. Included among the material are several memoranda by Look officials on, the Polaris missile, interview notes of Louis Duff with Charles Wilson. Secretary of Defense and Admiral Arleigh Burke. Chief of Naval Operations, and a letter from the editorial research Department of Reader's Digest on Harold Macmillan's relationship with the American Macmillan Company.</p>
<p>The majority of the notes are interview notes. Among those interviewed by Gunther were Willy Brandt, Ludwig Erhardt, Georges Bonnet, Jean Monnat, Giovanni Gronchi, Hugh Gaitskell, Selwyn LIoyu, Harold Macmillan, and numerous other European politicians and statesmen, embassy officials, and American journalists and radio commentators.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Included with the Juvenile Books, is the manuscript for DAYS TO REMEMBER-AMERICA 1945-1955, a pictorial book published in 1956, written by Gunther in collaboration with Bernard Quint, the associate art editor of Life. Only the manuscripts for this work are part of the collection. Much of the text was in the form of captions for the 400 or more photographs in the volume. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, in longhand by author, with corrections;</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, typed and heavily revised by author.</p>
<p>Gunther wrote three children's books on historical and mythical characters. They are ALEXANDER THE GREAT. published in 1953, JULIUS CAESAR, and THE GOLDEN FLEECE, the latter two published in 1959, Obviously, there are no interview notes for these works. Only the original manuscript of ALEXANDER THE GREAT, which is very heavily revised, is a part of the collection. Two manuscripts of JULIUS CAESAR are included in the collection:</p>
<p>1. Original manuscript, typed by the author and very heavily revised;</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, which is also very heavily revised.</p>
<p>The manuscripts of THE GOLDEN FLEECE are of special interest. In the original manuscript, Gunther faithfully recounted the gory legend of Jason and Medea, but subsequently toned down the bloodthirstiness in later drafts. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1: Original manuscript, in longhand by the author with corrections:</p>
<p>2. First Revision or Second Draft, typed and heavily revised;</p>
<p>3. Second Revision or Third Draft, which is also heavily revised by author.</p>
<p>Gunther has also written a series of juvenile works on Africa, which are revised versions for younger readers of some of his chapters from INSIDE AFRICA. He has written a revised version of INSIDE RUSSIA TODAY, entitled MEET SOVIET RUSSIA, published in two volumes in 1962. However, only the manuscripts for MEET THE CONGO are included in the collection. The manuscripts are as follows:</p>
<p>1. First Revision or Second Draft, with corrections by author;</p>
<p>2. Printer's copy, with author's corrections.</p>

<p>Included among the Papers of John Gunther are two boxes of correspondence, mostly between Gunther and his publishers, Harper and Brothers and Hamish Hamilton. Gunther said of this correspondence-"My friends at Harper's perhaps exaggerate, but they say that they have no knowledge of any other file which shows so intimately and over such a sustained period the various factors which are constantly at play in the relationship between a publisher and an author-literary, financial, editorial, etc." The correspondence covers the years from 1936 to 1961. However, the material from 1936 to 1949 is more complete, coming from the files of Harper and Brothers. The post-1949 correspondence was extracted from the original deposit and had been scattered throughout the collection with each specific book, but was brought together in this section. The correspondence deals mostly with publishing matters, but several of the letters contain some of Gunther's views on history, economic theory and other matters. The material has been arranged chronologically.</p>
<p>There is also some miscellaneous correspondence concerned with requests for autographs, asking Gunther to speak at meetings or to contribute articles to journals, or simply friendly letters telling Gunther how much the reader has enjoyed all of his books. Some of the Letters refer to articles Gunther has written in popular magazines or are responses to his television show "High Road."</p>

<p>Chicago Revisited was commissioned and masterminded by Fairfax M. Cone, chairman of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees, and Carl Larsen, director for Public Relations. John Gunther, an alumnus, was asked to write an essay capturing his impressions of the University. The work would be based upon Gunther's visit to the Midway in April 1964 and information compiled by Larsen's office, including faculty profiles.</p>
<p>Gunther's first draft, submitted to Larsen in June 1964, was ready by Cone, who made suggestions as to changes. Many of these were incorporated into a "first revision", authored by Larsen's office. This version was then circulated among administrators and faculty, who were solicited for comments. The "second revision", based on these remarks, was subsequently sent to Gunther for reworking. His final manuscript was published by the University in May 1967. Condensed versions of Chicago Revisited also appeared as articles in Chicago Today, Saturday Review, and Midwest magazines</p>

<p>The Lafayette Manuscripts (Codex Ms 303) comprise primarily documents written by or to Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Montier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834). Also
included are letters related to Lafayette's son, George Washington du Motier de Lafayette
(1779-1849) and grandson, Edmond du Motier de Lafayette (1818-1888). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of the earlier letters in the collection bear witness to Lafayette's fortunes and activities
during the revolutionary period in France. Though placed in command of an army that was to attack
the Austrian Netherlands in 1792, he was declared a traitor to the Legislative Assembly, and
captured while trying to flee the country in August 1792. He was held in Prussian and Austrian
prisons until 1797. A letter sent to Lafayette by General Alexis Paul Michel le Veneur (August 11,
1792) documents his military activities, while a fragmentary letter from an American correspondent
to an unidentified newspaper on May 26, 1796 protests the conditions of his imprisonment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Letters dating from 1800 to 1812 document Lafayette's retirement to his country estate during the
Napoleonic era. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon after the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette became a deputy, speaking and voting consistently
on the liberal side. He took an active interest in revolutionary activities abroad, particularly in
South America, Poland, Naples, Spain, Greece and Belgium. The largest group of letters in the
collection document Lafayette's political activities and private life during this period. Of
particular note is an 1825 letter from Lafayette to inventor and artist Samuel F. B. Morse
expressing condolences upon the death of Morse's wife. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final letters in the collection are related to Lafayette's son and grandson, and primarily
document private and family affairs. </p>
<p>Following the main portion of the collection are nine files that were formerly part of the Miscellaneous Manuscripts Collection.</p>

<p>The Luther Lee Bernard Papers include various types of data that Bernard collected for his studies, only part of which apparently was included in his published works. Generally this data can be divided into two general groups: 1) Material, mostly responses to a form letter, relating to the development of the teaching of sociology in American colleges and universities; and 2) the intellectual careers of influential and pioneer sociologists. The collection also includes correspondence relating to these projects.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The material concerning the development of the teaching of sociology is composed of outlines for compiling data; a form letter requesting information from universities and colleges; some correspondence with individuals concerning departmental histories; and several documents, each one relating the history of sociology at a particular university. The material concerning sociologists’ intellectual careers is composed of outlines for compiling data; a form letter requesting information from sociologists; correspondence about autobiographies and biographies of sociologists; and documents, autobiographical and biographical, some of which were written by Bernard. With the miscellaneous correspondence are a few letters from 1938 concerning controversies over affiliation with the International Federation of Sociological Societies, and about the formation of a Sociological Research Association among members of the American Sociological Society, of which Bernard was president in 1932. In a few cases, a single piece of correspondence or a single document is relevant to both groups of data. The article is then filed with the biographical material. A small body of correspondence concerning both groups of data could not be sorted alphabetically, as more than one letter appears on a single sheet of paper. For this correspondence, an alphabetical list of the sociologists addressed appears in the guide.

<p/>
<p>A letter from G.S. Todd of Frankfort, Kentucky to Mary S. Payne (Folder 1) suggests that the Lyne Papers may have come to Durrett through Mrs. Payne. According to this letter, she received the papers from Mr. Todd, who found them among some Harry Innes papers then in his possession.</p>
<p/>
<p>The remaining papers have been arranged in three categories – account books, general estate records, and manumission papers. </p>
<p/>
<p>The account books (Folders 2-6) are bookkeeping records of Lyne's income and during the five-year period from 1786 to 1791.</p>

Most of these papers are records of Innes' reimbursement from the Lyne estate for the expenses he incurred in providing clothing, shelter, medical care, and trade training for slave children. Also included are a judicial note concerning the emancipation process and a record of a chancery court case.</p>
