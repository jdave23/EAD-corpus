      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Amory Howe Bradford was born in 1846.  Bradford was the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Montclair, New Jersey.  In 1897, Bradford delivered the convocation speech at the University of Chicago's Twentieth Convocation, held on October 1 at the University of Chicago Congregational Church.  The speech was titled "The Unity of the World."</p>
      <p>Bradford is mentioned as a key evangelical neoabolitionist spokesman, along with others including Washington Gladden, Charles Cuthbert Hall (president of Union Theological Seminary), and Henry Churchill King. They were all leaders of the American Missionary Association and appealed to "theological personalism" for values in race relations.</p>

      <p>Amory Howe Bradford died in 1911.</p>
