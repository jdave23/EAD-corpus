        <head>Historical Note</head>
        <p>The University of Chicago Chess Club ranks as one of the most successful chess teams in intercollegiate history.  The team captured the Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championship title a record seven times, winning in 1945, 1956, 1958, 1968, 1972, 1973, and 1986.  In addition to their competition schedule, members of the Chess Club dedicated themselves to promoting chess on campus, sponsoring intramural tournaments, educational opportunities, and lectures and demonstrations by visiting Grand Masters.</p>

        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>The University of Chicago Chess Club Records contains extensive documentation of the chess club’s activities from 1965 to 1983.  These materials were collected and compiled by Harold Winston, a former president of the chess club, historian of the Intercollegiate Chess Association, and Chairman/CEO of the World Chess Hall of Fame.  Among the documents contained here are membership lists, official rankings of chess club members, match summaries and results, and financial records.  Members of the club were also active in promoting chess on campus, and many broadsides announcing intramural tournaments and chess-related lectures are collected here. Additionally, the collection includes numerous newspaper clippings relating to the chess club’s back-to-back Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championships in 1972 and 1973.  Also documented is significant information on the founding of the Chicago Intercollegiate Chess League, a citywide conference comprised of teams from the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Loyola University, Roosevelt University, the University of Illinois-Chicago, Southwestern City College, and Loop City College.  Included are the league’s constitution, correspondence, newsletters, and match results from 1969 to 1977.</p>
