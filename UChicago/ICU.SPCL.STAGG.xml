        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>Amos Alonzo Stagg was born in 1862, in West Orange, New Jersey. He was the fifth
                    child of eight and his father was a laborer and cobbler. Early on
                    Stagg's family instilled moral, religious ethics into his already
                    resilient character. Stagg worked and attended public school until 1883.
                    Following his graduation from high school, Stagg, aged twenty-one, enrolled in
                    post-graduate courses at Philips Exeter Academy in order to prepare for Yale
                    University Entrance exams.</p>
        <p>In 1884, Amos Alonzo Stagg entered Yale as a freshman. He intended to study
                    divinity and become a minister. A popular, if not mediocre student, Stagg
                    excelled in numerous sports including baseball and football, sang in the glee
                    club, and was the financial manager of the Yale News. It was Stagg's
                    devotion to athletics, which marked his tenure at Yale. By his senior year in
                    school, Stagg, already a star catcher on the baseball team, joined the football
                    team that provided him with a life-long love of the game and a dedication to
                    amateur sports. In 1889, Stagg enrolled as a full-time student at
                    Yale's Divinity School, but soon left because of his poor ability to
                    preach sermons.</p>
        <p>Stagg soon found work in the athletic department at the new International Young
                    Men's Christian Association training school in Springfield,
                    Massachusetts. His success as a football coach at the college earned him great
                    notoriety throughout intercollegiate athletics. At this time his former Yale
                    Divinity School professor, William Rainey Harper, to head up the Department of
                    Physical Culture at the newly formed University of Chicago, contacted Stagg.
                    Stagg's appointment came with full tenure, an assistant professorship
                    and substantial salary, setting a precedent in selections of athletic directors
                    in American universities. Harper and Stagg soon developed a life-long, intimate
                    friendship that had a significant impact in the development of athletics and
                    football at the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>In 1892, Stagg coached and often played in the first football season at the
                    University of Chicago. A "green" team, Stagg's
                    innovative coaching and personal charisma helped earn the new football players
                    success in the field. The early years of the 1890's marked the rise of
                    Stagg's presence not only in athletics, but also within the
                    administration of "Harper's university."</p>
        <p>1894 brought in another prosperous season for the "Maroons."
                    The addition of a new field donated by the prosperous Chicago retailer Marshall
                    Field and a series of successful games played in the West Coast against schools
                    like Stanford provided Stagg with a tremendous amount of respect and popularity
                    among the faculty and students. Intercollegiate football gave the university a
                    significant measure of prestige.</p>
        <p>It was at this time he met and married Stella Robertson, a young freshman from
                    upstate New York. Their marriage was an extremely happy one and Stella, referred
                    to as Stagg's beloved "assistant coach," often sat in
                    the press stands, offering commentary on the football games. Together they had
                    three children, two of whom followed their father in careers as coaches.</p>
        <p>Under President Harper's administration, Coach Stagg enjoyed a
                    tremendous amount of influence in the policies governing intercollegiate
                    athletics and the Department of Physical Culture at the university. Preferential
                    treatment of players, special athletic scholarships and controversial recruiting
                    tactics were supported by the office of the university president. Football
                    generated a lot of revenue for the school and even more enthusiasm from
                    students, faculty and alumni alike. </p>
        <p>Coach Stagg's enhanced reputation on campus allowed him a great deal of
                    autonomy in dealing with athletics. Affectionately dubbed the "old
                    man," he was bold and impatient with anyone who challenged his manner
                    of leading the Department of Physical Culture and the football team. National
                    and collegiate reforms of the game, coaching, and recruiting had little impact
                    on Stagg's dynamic. Even the loss of Coach Stagg's long time
                    friend and confidant, William Rainey Harper, did little to diminish his
                    authority. The successive president, Harry Pratt Judson continued to encourage
                    and protect Stagg and the game of football. </p>
        <p>During the years of 1906 through 1924, Coach Stagg enjoyed success as an
                    innovator for the game of football. He has been credited with the invention of
                    the modern "bowl" game, the numbered jersey and the use of the
                    forward pass. He was a productive tactician and strategist for football. Not
                    only did Stagg coach several championship seasons; he was also the head athletic
                    trainer for track, baseball, and basketball. From 1906 to 1932, Stagg served as
                    a member of the American Olympic Games Committee. This period also was
                    distinguished by his increasing difficulties with the administration of the
                    University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Following the presidencies of Ernest DeWitt Burton and Max Mason, the
                    "Maroon's" football team showed a decline in the
                    quality of the player and the performance of the game. The university
                    administration sought out more serious and committed students and checked the
                    recruiting tactics of Stagg's department. After the champion season of
                    1924, Stagg's team went downhill. </p>
        <p>The election of Robert Maynard Hutchins in 1929 to the presidency of the
                    University of Chicago marked the end of Stagg's influence on campus.
                    Hutchins' commitment to academics and to the welfare of the student
                    body placed athletics in a lesser position. The reorganization of
                    Stagg's post and the increasing pressures placed upon him to retire
                    left the "old man" with little alternative. Stagg left the
                    University of Chicago in 1933. A few years later, football would be abolished at
                    the school.</p>
        <p>mos Alonzo Stagg took over as athletic director and football coach for the
                    College of the Pacific in California. Coaching well up into his nineties, Stagg
                    continued to enjoy many successful seasons with the football team. He and his
                    beloved wife Stella died in California in 1965.</p>

        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>The Amos Alonzo Stagg Papers covers the period from 1866 until 1964 and consists
                    of correspondence, scrapbooks, notebooks, photographs, ephemera, books and
                    newspaper clippings that illustrate the life and career of the University of
                    Chicago's first football coach and athletic director. The collection
                    has been divided into nine series: I. Correspondence, II. University of Chicago
                    Department of Physical Culture and Athletics, III. Football, IV.

                    concentrates on Stagg's years at the University of Chicago (1892-1933)
                    and his impact on intercollegiate athletics, amateur sports and education. Each
                    series is then broken down into subseries, which provides a more comprehensive
                    and narrow scope of information according to the nature of the materials in the
                    collection. Series I, consists of Stagg's personal and career oriented
                    correspondence. Series II through VII, are reports, correspondence and newspaper
                    clippings that are organized into the following topics: University of Chicago's
                   Department of Physical Culture, Football, Athletics, Athletic
                    Associations, Post-Chicago Coaching Positions and Biographical. Series VIII
                    includes detailed descriptions of athletic, personal and career scrapbooks,
                    football and athletic notebooks and photo albums that span 1876 until 1956.
                    Series IX also includes detailed inventory of Stagg's collection of
                    books and journals. This series also includes various scrapbooks and loose
                    ephemera that cover Stagg's education, career and personal life and
                    date from 1866 until 1933. </p>

          <p>This series of scrapbooks, notebooks and photo albums covers Amos Alonzo Stagg’s career as athletic director, football coach and prominent leader in the world of intercollegiate amateur athletics.  Subseries 1, the University of Chicago Athletic Scrapbooks spans Stagg’s forty-year career as the first athletic director and football coach for the University.  These books consist primarily of newspaper clippings, telegrams, athletic programs, World’s Fair and Olympics programs, letters, ticket stubs, and invitations and cover all University of Chicago sporting teams and clubs, including football, baseball, basketball, women’s athletics, track and field, swimming and tennis. It also includes articles on the growth of the University of Chicago, the effect of Presidents William Rainey Harper through Robert Maynard Hutchins on athletics, and establishment of athletic buildings at the University of Chicago until 1933. National intercollegiate athletics issues such as the debate over amateurism and professionalism, player recruitment, the impact of war on athletics, training, controversies, amateur athletics leaders, football reforms, the Big Ten, and coverage of the Olympics from 1900 to 1928 are topics also contained within the scrapbooks.</p>
          <p>Subseries 2, the College of the Pacific football scrapbooks and Subseries 3, the Personal and Career books focus primarily on Stagg’s prominence as a football coach and leader in amateur athletics at American universities.  The College of the Pacific series deals primarily with Stagg’s career the school’s football coach, and includes features on his family, notably his wife, Stella R. Stagg.  These books also include the impact of war on football, the decline and abolishment of football at the University of Chicago and the prominence of West Coast football, and Stagg’s contributions to the game.  The Personal and Career series spans Stagg’s profession, starting his collegiate life at Yale and ending with his coaching at Susquehanna University and Stockton Junior College.  Both collections of scrapbooks include college memorabilia, awards, career highlights, famous coaches, letters, telegrams, and programs.</p>
          <p>Subseries 4, the Pre-Chicago scrapbooks document Stagg’s athletic accomplishments as a star baseball pitcher and football player at Yale University and his work as football coach at the Young Men’s Christian Association Training School in Springfield Massachusetts.  These volumes span Stagg’s student years up through his appointment to the newly founded University of Chicago and include several pieces of Yale ephemera such as magazines, remnants of baseball caps, and student examinations. The scrapbooks also provide information on Yale athletics, the development of the “star” athlete, and the function and importance of the YMCA on college campuses.  This collection of newspaper articles and memorabilia provides insight into the various Christian leaders and conventions that took place at the turn-of-the-century and their impact on collegiate and amateur athletics.</p>
          <p>Subseries 5, the Football Notebooks and subseries 6, the Duplicate Football Notebooks list the numerous plays, formations, diagrams and reports Stagg accumulated over the course of his career to build his football teams.  Strategies, team rosters, notes, and letters from colleagues and his sons provide additional information for the generation Stagg’s systems of offense and defense.</p>
          <p>Subseries 7, the Scouting Reports and University of Chicago Athletic Notebooks and subseries 8, the Miscellaneous Notebooks are separate volumes that document and record the activities of varsity teams.  The scouting reports provide information on plays, formations and team strengths and weakness for opposing football teams for the University of Chicago and the College of the Pacific. The University of Chicago Athletic notebooks contains records, team rosters, meet or game results, schedules and notes on varsity and freshman baseball, wrestling, fencing, swimming, basketball, tennis, golf, track and gymnastics teams.  Subseries 8, the Miscellaneous Notebooks is a collection that covers varsity letter winners and record holders and notes, letters and newspaper clippings on the career of H.B Conibear, the former University of Chicago athletic trainer and University of Washington Crew coach. </p>
          <p>Subseries 9, the Photo Albums provide a pictorial history of Stagg’s scholastic, athletic and professional coaching career.  The albums begin with 1876 Yale football team photos, and move on to pictures of Stagg at Philips-Exeter Academy, Yale and the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Some albums highlight Stagg’s personal life such as the infancy of his son Amos Alonzo, Jr. and photos of friends and family.  However, the majority of the collection is photos of the various athletic teams at the University of Chicago, specifically the teams Stagg coached: football, baseball and track.  The last remaining albums show Stagg’s coaching career at the College of the Pacific and a luncheon given in his honor after his retirement.</p>
