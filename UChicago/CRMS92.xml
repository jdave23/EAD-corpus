        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>Bayard Taylor Holmes was born in North Hero, Vermont in 1852. He received a BS from the Paw Paw Institute, near Aurora Illinois, in 1874. After teaching for several years in Illinois schools, in 1883, he received an MD from Chicago’s Homeopathic Medical College. Holmes also studied and interned at Cook County Hospital and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and remained associated with both institutions as a physician and educator in later years. </p>
        <p>Holmes was publicly active as an advocate of improved medical education and as a lecturer on public health at Hull House. In 1895, he was the Populist Party candidate for Mayor of Chicago. He retired teaching and medical practice in 1908, to care for his son Ralph, who suffered from “dementia praecox,” the contemporary term for schizophrenia. Holmes also devoted his retirement to research and writing about schizophrenia. He died in 1924 in Fairhope, Alabama.</p>
