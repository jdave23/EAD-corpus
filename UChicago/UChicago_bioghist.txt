<p>Chicago's 57th Street Art Fair continues its role as one of the country's largest not-for-profit art fairs dedicated to exhibiting original art by artists who sell their own work. The Art Fair originated in 1948 when Hyde Park gallery owner May Louise Womer saw a need for local artists to network with each other and to their public directly. Invitations for the outdoor event were sent to galleries, art schools, and artists throughout the city. Initially the fair was open to all artists, but as the response grew each year, there became a need to limit entrants. In 1963, the Art Fair Committee was organized. Composed of critics, collectors, curators and artists, the panel chose which artists would display their work in the fair. This screening process is still in effect today. Once an artist is accepted, their exhibit space is held for their return through subsequent fairs; around 500 aspiring exhibitors compete for the 40 to 50 spaces that are vacated each year. Recently, over 300 artists exhibited in the Fair. Every year since 1948 there has been a 57th Street Art Fair, usually held the first weekend in June.</p>

<p>Sun Ra was born Herman Poole Blount on May 22, 1914 in Birmingham Alabama and was regarded as a skilled pianist and composer by his early teenage years. Although Blount based his musical activities in Birmingham until 1945, his big band toured extensively, playing Chicago in 1934 where he registered with the local musicians union under the name Sonny Blount. Blount read extensively, researching mystical and occult practices, ancient culture, biblical history, and contemporary developments in science and space exploration. During 1942-1943 he was imprisoned for draft resistance prior to being released with a 4-F classification.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the winter of 1946 Blount migrated to Chicago, settling near Washington Park. Although regarded as eccentric by some, Blount was a respected and studied musician and was regularly employed as a pianist, composer, and arranger in the vibrant south side music scene. During the early 1950s he began rehearsing his own groups, ultimately leading to the 1955 creation of the Arkestra, the large ensemble he directed until his death in 1993. In October 1952 Blount legally changed his name to "Le Sony'r Ra" at the Circuit Court of Cook County, with "Sun Ra" serving thereafter as an abbreviated version of his new name.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Alton Abraham was born in Chicago on May 5, 1927. He served in the U.S Military in Okinawa from 1945-1947, and upon returning to Chicago in 1947 graduated from Du Sable High School, followed by Wilson Junior College in 1950. In 1952 he was certified as an x-ray technician at Provident Hospital. Blount and Abraham became acquainted in 1951, sharing interests in mysticism, the occult, science, numerology, and ancient history.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Along with Abraham's brother Artis, the men founded El Saturn Research in 1957, which would record and distribute albums by the Arkestra as well as the vocal and R&amp;B groups rehearsed by Sun Ra during the late 1950s.
</p>
<p>Additionally, Ra and Abraham organized Thmei Research, an organization dedicated to "subjects cosmic, spiritual, philosophical, religious, historical, scientific, economical, etc." Thmei also provided financing for El Saturn's earliest releases and issued a newsletter and book catalog. The earliest El Saturn recordings are singles dating from 1955 and 1956, including the Cosmic Rays "Dreaming" b/w "Daddy's Gonna Tell You No Lie." Some of the Arkestra's earliest studio recordings were released as Jazz By Sun Ra (1956) on Transition Records, and Super Sonic Jazz (1957) on Saturn Records.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1961 Sun Ra left Chicago for Montreal with members of the Arkestra including Marshall Allen and John Gilmore. Lacking sustained employment in Montreal, the group relocated to New York City where further difficulty finding work encouraged communal living arrangements. While Sun Ra would never again reside in Chicago, Abraham continued to manage some of the Arkestra's business engagements and the Saturn Record label in Chicago. By the late 1960s Sun Ra began giving performances on college campuses and appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. During these years, recordings on ESP Records such as The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra Vols. 1 and 2 (1965, 1966), added to the growing catalog of Sun Ra recordings available through Saturn Records such as The Magic City (1966) and Atlantis (1969). In 1967 Abraham, along with Sun Ra, James Bryant, and Almeter Hayden, incorporated Ihnfinity, Inc. in the State of Illinois with the intention of it serving as an umbrella organization for Sun Ra's activities. The following year Sun Ra and members of the Arkestra would move into a large home in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, commuting regularly to New York City for performances. In 1972 Ra and Abraham published two volumes of Sun Ra's poetry, The Immeasurable Equation, and Extensions Out: The Immeasurable Equation Vol. 2, some of which had previously appeared on the back cover of Saturn Records.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Opportunities for international performance expanded significantly during the 1970s and Arkestra recordings became more widely available following a 1972 agreement with Impulse Records, who reissued The Magic City and Atlantis in 1973. While Sun Ra would continue sending recordings to Abraham in Chicago through the late 1970s, such as The Soul Vibrations of Man (1977) and Taking a Chance on Chances (1977), he also began independently pressing Saturn records in Philadelphia, relying on the assistance of Arkestra members. Similarly, as performance opportunities expanded throughout the 1970s Arkestra trumpeter Danny Thompson increasingly took on the responsibilities of de facto business and tour manager.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following Sun Ra's death in Birmingham 1993, Abraham became involved with the reissue and rerelease of out-of-print Sun Ra recordings. In addition to his activities with Sun Ra, Abraham was employed as an x-ray technician, and independently pursued his interests in spirituality, history, science, and technology. Alton Abraham died June 6, 1999 in Chicago.</p>

<p>Establishment and Purpose of the Institute-
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In December of 1880, at the Morgan Park Theological Seminary, one of the first correspondence schools in the country was established by William Rainey Harper. By February 1881, the Correspondence School of Hebrew had an enrollment of three hundred students, mostly ministers and teachers, and a movement which might justly be called a revival in the study of the Old Testament in the original tongue was begun. In 1883 the school was renamed the American Institute of Hebrew; in 1889 Harper, now Professor of Hebrew and Woolsey Professor of the English Bible at Yale University, realized a need for broadening the scope of the Institute's work and it was expanded to include Biblical Hebrew, such as Syriac, Assyrian and Arabic, the Bible in the original tongues, the Bible in the ancient versions, the Old and New Testaments in English, and Biblical literature, history and Theology.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Harper and the Institute-
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From the founding of the Institute until the beginnings of the University of Chicago in 1892, the strong personality of Harper appears in every phase of the Institute's operation. From 1892 until his death in 1906, Harper's influence is seen less in the affairs of the Institute as he devoted himself more and more to the young University. Although the Institute maintained a constant fund raising effort, it is clear that after Harper turned most of his energy toward the University, the Institute began to suffer from a lack of money often sufficient enough to cause a slowing of its work. Beyond the money problem there were the more serious problems of the loss of Harper, with his imagination and drive, and the changing times. Reorganization and adjustment became the normal pattern of the Institute's operation as it attempted to survive after the interest which had called it into being was dead.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The University of Chicago and the Institute-
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The relation between the Institute and the University of Chicago began as soon as the University started to function. Upon the opening of the University and the organization of the University of Chicago Press, the good will of The Old and New Testament Student (published by the Institute) was transferred to the Press and the publication of Hebraica and The Biblical World began. Upon the organization of the Correspondence Department of the University, in the same year (1892), such courses of the Institute as would lead to University credit were transferred to the Department and carried on cooperatively. In the middle of 1905 the University's Board of Trustees carried out Harper's wish to make the Institute a part of the University and it was soon firmly attached to the Divinity School. By 1924 the Institute was handling most of the Divinity School's extension work; by the early 1940s the Institute had reversed its position and was placed under the Divinity School's
</p>
<p>Director of Extension, and by the mid-forties the Institute had ceased to function, except to fill orders for material if a stock still existed. (In Appendix II will be found a rough chronology of the Institute, some material quoted and some cited.)
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Administration of the Institute-
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the early years of the Institute, from 1880 to 1883, the administration rested largely in Harper's hands. However, by 1883, the Institute had grown to such an extent that a stock company was formed to conduct both the Correspondence and the Summer Schools of Hebrew, sponsored by the Institute. The following year a division of responsibility placed the publishing feature of the Institute in the hands of the stock company and the educational work with Dr. Harper. When the American Institute of Hebrew was formed in December of 1883 the organization consisted of seventy professors of Hebrew and the Old Testament subjects in the United States and Canada, and between one and two hundred interested persons, as associate members and patrons providing financial support. In 1889, when the American Institute of Sacred Literature was organized, Harper became principal and a board of twelve directors was appointed. A President, Vice-President, Secretary, Principal, Treasurer and Auditor, together with five instructors administered the work of the reformed Institute and gave instruction to its students. In 1890 Local Boards were organized in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco, and under their auspices Winter Schools for Bible study of from one to twelve weeks each were held. In this year, also, publishing interests were transferred to the Student Publishing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and the magazine The Old Testament Student became The Old and New Testament Student.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1891 the headquarters of the Institute moved with Harper to Chicago. The Secretary and two members of the teaching staff were brought to Chicago, and the eastern interests, chiefly financial, were left with Dr. F. K. Sanders of Yale. In 1896 the Institute was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. In 1905 the Institute was accepted by the University of Chicago with the agreement that the University continue the Institute "as part of the extension work of the University." At this time President Harper placed the immediate administration of the Institute under the control of an executive committee, selected form members of the Divinity School faculty, and an Executive Secretary who were responsible to the President and through him to the Board of Trustees.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Professor Ernest D. Burton, the first Chairman of the Institute's Executive Committee, remained active until his appointment as Director of the University Library. After this Miss Georgia L. Chamberlin, who had been Harper's secretary in the pre-Chicago days, and who remained with the Institute until 1935, carried on the work of the Institute from her post as Executive Secretary. Upon her retirement in 1935, Professor Archibald G. Baker was appointed Director and remained in this position until 1940. Between 1940 and 1943 the Institute was placed under a committee and then Professor Sidney E. Mead was appointed Director. After little more than a year the dying Institute ceased to function actively and was subordinated to the Divinity School's Director of Extension.

<p>Samuel King Allison was born in Chicago on November 13, 1900. In 1917 he entered the University of Chicago and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1921 and his doctorate in 1923. Following his graduation, he became a fellow of the National Research Council at Harvard University (1923-1925); a fellow at the Carnegie Institute (1925-1926); and a member of the faculty at the University of California (1926-1930). In 1930 Allison returned to the University of Chicago, and, from that time until his death in September 1965, continued to be associated with the University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During his career at the University of Chicago, Allison was not only active as a teacher and a research scientist, but also as an administrator and a civil servant. In the 1930s, Allison conducted experiments with X-rays, and published his results in a book, X-rays in Theory and Experiment. In the 1940s he began work on the liberation of nuclear energy, and was a member of the team working under Enrico Fermi which achieved the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction on December 2, 1942. Between 1943 and 1944 Allison served as director of the "Metallurgical Laboratory" which was developing a method for producing plutonium.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In November, 1944 Allison joined the Manhattan Project and was chairman of the Technical and Scheduling Committee at the Los Alamos Laboratory. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1945 to become the first director of the newly-formed Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies. While director of the Institute, Allison encouraged the exchange of scientific information, free from military control. Allison also helped to found The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and visited Spain and South America as guest lecturer and advisor.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In order to devote all of his time to research projects, Allison resigned as director of the Fermi Institute in 1958. He continued to travel, however, and was appointed by the Organization of American States to a "Direct Technical Assistance Field Mission" to the Centro Atomico, San Carlos de Variloche. From 1960 to 1963 Allison also served as Chairman of the Physics Section of the National Academy of Sciences.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When Herbert L. Anderson, Allison's successor at the Fermi Institute, resigned in 1963 to continue his research with a new particle accelerator at Argonne National Laboratory, Allison resumed his duties as director. Two years later, on September 1, 1965, Allison died while attending the Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research Conference held in Culham, England.

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago was founded in 1929 under the chairmanship of Fay-Cooper Cole, but had a longer historical presence at the University. Anthropology was established as a field of early interest at the University of Chicago through William Rainey Harper's appointment in 1892 [the first year that classes were held] of Frederick Starr as the first faculty member in anthropology. This was one of Harper's first acts as the inaugural president of the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Starr was originally appointed into the "scientific department", but with Harper's development of the "social science" (or sociology) department under Albion W. Small, he was quickly reappointed. During the period of his appointment until his retirement in 1923, Professor Starr frequently traveled, conducting research in the United States and Mexico, as well as in Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Africa. Starr was an immensely popular teacher and lecturer, but his frequent travels regularly interrupted instruction in anthropology, necessitating the continued administrative integration of Anthropology with the department of Sociology.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following Starr's retirement, the University offered a part-time appointment to Fay-Cooper Cole, who had done long-term fieldwork in the Philippines in 1906, and was employed at the Field Museum. Cole consolidated his position, lobbied for and achieved the separation between the departments of sociology and anthropology in 1929, and facilitated the recruitment and appointment of the brilliant linguistic anthropologist Edward Sapir, a second-generation student of Franz Boas who helped to shift the intellectual culture of the department away from Starr's museum orientation to the knowledge of the patterns of social behavior, and especially of symbolism. Sapir's influence inspired linguistic anthropological fieldwork by Manuel Andrade, Harry Hoijer and Father Bernard Haile amongst various communities in the United States and Mexico.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sapir's appointment was followed shortly by that of Robert Redfield, whose policy-orientation towards contemporary America and interest and concern with contemporary social issues reveals the influence on the department of anthropology of the Chicago School of Sociology and its chair, Robert E. Park (who was also Redfield's teacher and father in law). Redfield and Tax's early research on rural and urban communities in Yucatan (and subsequently Guatemala) further articulated this influence. In addition to small portions here, larger collections on this research can be found in the papers of Robert Redfield and Sol Tax as well as the papers of the Chiapas Project.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Early research also included the archeological excavation of important sites in Illinois, including the Kincaid Mounds, which for many years served as a summer "field school" for anthropology graduate students and a key site where modern archeological field methods were developed and revolutionized. This research revealed how certain archeological features in these sites established the state of Illinois as central in the understanding of the etho-history of the Mississippi Valley region. The department produced various monographs and a comparative pictorial survey (conducted primarily by Thorne Deuel) of the archeology of the region.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A significant moment in early departmental history was the initially temporary appointment of British social-anthropologist Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown to the faculty to replace Sapir's initially temporary position at Yale. Radcliffe Brown's reworking of Durkheimian themes in his ahistorical approach to social structure and function reoriented the department towards the "social science" from which it had since departed. This perspective contrasted sharply with Sapir's historically particularist Boasian framework, resulting in a revealing schism between the "socially" and "culturally" oriented anthropologists in the department. Both their respective "temporary" appointments became permanent, until Radcliffe-Brown's departure for Oxford in 1937 and Sapir's death in 1939.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the late 1950's the recruitment of Lloyd Fallers, Clifford Geertz and David Schneider from the University of California Berkeley breathed new life into the department following the death of Redfield (of Leukemia in 1958) and the departure of Sherwood Washburn and Lloyd Warner. These former three scholars reoriented the department towards a symbolic approach to anthropology, which had a monumental impact on the field. These young scholars also oriented the department towards the ongoing recruitment of "star" anthropologists who would revolutionize the field. The personal and professional papers of these three scholars are all available for research in the University of Chicago Library, Special Collections Research Center.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Subsequent faculty hires with a significant impact on the culture, research and ongoing influence of the department of anthropology include Marshall Sahlins, Bernard Cohn, Michael Silverstein, Jean and John Comaroff, Terence Turner, Stanley Tambiah, Nancy Munn, Valerio Valeri and George Stocking. These scholars have all further articulated the themes that have long concerned Chicago anthropologists with increased attention to the relationship between anthropology and history, colonialism and imperialism and semiotic approaches to culture. Rooted in these historical and contemporary influences, the University of Chicago's Department of Anthropology has continued to be one of the premier departments in anthropological instruction and research in the world.

<p>Boris Artzybasheff was born in Kharkov, Ukraine in 1899 to Mikhail Petrovich Artsybashev (1878-1927) and Anna Vasilyevna Kobushko. Mikhail Petrovich was a writer, known mostly for his 1904 novel Sanin and his involvement with the anti-Bolshevik newspaper Za Svobodu! ("For Freedom!"). In his early adulthood, Boris Artzybasheff fought in the Ukrainian army. In 1919, he left his homeland and traveled to America, where he arrived at Ellis Island, New York on June 17, 1919. In his early days in the United States, Artzybasheff worked as an illustrator and designed stage sets for Michel Fokine's Russian Ballet and the Ziegfeld Theatre. In 1925, the artist was naturalized as a United States Citizen. In February of 1930, he married Elizabeth Southard Snyder in New York City.&#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>He continued working as an illustrator of books and advertisements in New York City. Fortune Magazine commissioned Artzybasheff to work on the cover of the April 1941 issue. This cover illustration--featured in the Roman Weil Collection--propelled Artzybasheff's career as a magazine illustrator. Throughout the rest of his career, he produced more than 200 covers for Time Magazine, as well as numerous maps and ads for magazines. His illustrations range from portraits of prominent figures to anthropomorphisations of machinery. During his lifetime, Artzybasheff won the John Newberry Award for book illustrations and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Boris Artzybasheff passed away in July 1965 in Connecticut.</p>

<p>The Atomic Scientists of Chicago was founded on September 26, 1945, by the scientific employees of the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, and was made open to any past or present scientific employee of the Manhattan Project. Work on some aspect of the bomb was a requisite for membership. The ASC was established to educate the public and the government in the political, social, and international implications attending the national and international development and exploitation of atomic energy. The constitution, adopted on October 30, 1945, defined the aims of the organization as, “to explore, clarify and formulate the opinion and responsibilities of scientists in regard to the problems brought about by the release of nuclear energy,…and to educate the public to a full understanding of the scientific, technological and social problems arising from the release of nuclear energy.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>ASC’s membership consisted of approximately two hundred, or almost ninety percent, of the University of Chicago’s scientists who had participated in the development of the bomb during the war years--coinciding with the Manhattan Project. Including such noted scientists as Harold Urey, Leo Szilard, Harrison Brown, Thorfin Hogness, and John Simpson. By December 1945 the body had been incorporated in Illinois as a non-profit organization, and had affiliated with the Federation of American Scientists.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On December 10, 1945, the first issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a six-page periodical that was to grow into one of about fifty pages, appeared. The original executive committee was headed by J.A. Simpson, Jr., and the advisory committee was composed of Thorfin Hogness, chairman, Kenneth C. Cole, Farrington Daniels, James Franck, Robert S. Mulliken, Glenn T. Seaborg, Harold C. Urey and Walter H. Zinn. The staff was comprised of H.H. Goldsmith, secretary to the Executive Committee; L.C. Furney, treasurer; and Mrs. R. Adams, secretary.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In November 1945, a University Office of Inquiry into the Social Aspects of Atomic Energy was formed under University auspices as a companion organization to the Atomic Scientists of Chicago. This latter organization embraced the entire University, and its program and methods closely paralleled that of ASC.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The leading members of the Office of Inquiry were Professors E.A. Shils, Robert Redfield, Leo Szilard, T.W. Schultz, Jacob Marschak, Fred Eggan and Jacob Viner. The Office of Inquiry, though technically a separate organization, and open to those not qualified for membership in ASC, co-operated closely with ASC, especially on Bulletin articles and editorials, and on contacts and legislative agitation. As a result, some of its papers and correspondence, especially that of Robert Redfield, are incorporated in this collection.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In April 1949, a reorganization of ASC occurred. The Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science was incorporated under an Illinois charter as a non-profit educational organization with the sole function of publishing the Bulletin, hitherto published by ASC. The ASC continued as a separate organization, engaging in education and propaganda activities, as before, but with increased attention to political action. Its membership, resources and activities achieved a peak in the period of 1946 to 1947, subsequently undergoing a sharp decline, coincident with the decline in public interest over atomic energy problems. Again, in 1954, there was renewed interest in the organization, due to the threat scientist’s saw in “McCarthism” and the Oppenheimer Case. A further decline of ASC membership and activities led the organization, in February 1959, to propose that the Atomic Scientists of Chicago be disbanded. The proposal also suggested that their remaining funds be turned over to a new organization, the Atomic Science Fund, which was to be incorporated as a non-profit, educational body, devoted exclusively to organizing and conducting scientific conferences on atomic energy.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The ASC had conducted three conferences in Chicago (September and December 1945, and February 1946), and three abroad (Pugwash, N.S., 1957; La Beauport, Canada, 1958; and Vienna and Kitzbuhel, Austria, 1958). By re-incorporation, it was hoped that the group might obtain the tax exemption which it was not allowed under its original charter, inasmuch as it was then a political action group. The proposal from February 1959 was abandoned and a meeting was called in June 1959 to decide the future of the ASC.

<p>The American Veterans Committee (AVC) was founded in 1944 as a progressive veteran’s organization and an alternative to groups such as The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. As stated in its newsletter the organization sought, “to achieve a more Democratic and prosperous America and a more stable world.” With the motto of “citizens first, veterans second,” the AVC supported a range of liberal causes; for example, it challenged military segregation and maintained racially integrated chapters in Southern States. Targeted during post-WWII anti-communist campaigns, the AVC purged its Communist members in 1948, justifying the action through their goal to “extend and defend Democracy,” and to “keep the AVC a progressive Veterans’ organization independent of Communist Party-line control.” The AVC disbanded in 2003.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Eleazar Barton, born on June 28, 1861 (d. December 30, 1930) was one of the early twentieth century's most prominent writers and lecturers on the life of Abraham Lincoln. Born in Sublette, Illinois, in the same year Lincoln assumed the presidency, Barton grew up in an environment heavily influenced by reverence for Lincoln. He began undergraduate studies at Berea College in 1881 and graduated in 1885. However, during his senior year Barton decided to join the ministry and was ordained on June 6, 1885. On July 23, 1885 Barton married Esther Treat Bushnell. Together they would have 5 children. Barton returned to school and earned his divinity degree from the Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1890. He served parishes in Tennessee, Ohio, and Massachusetts before becoming the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Oak Park, Illinois, a position he held until his retirement in 1924. In 1928, Barton accepted an appointment as lecturer at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he also organized and served as pastor of the Collegeside Congregational Church.</p>
<p/>
<p>Barton's work as a writer produced a number of denominational manuals and a series of books presenting the wisdom and parables of a character he named Safed the Sage. For the last ten years of his life, however, Barton was best known to the public as a prolific author and lecturer on Abraham Lincoln. His publications about Lincoln included The Soul of Abraham Lincoln (1920), The Paternity of Abraham Lincoln (1920), The Life of Abraham Lincoln (1925), The Great and Good Man (1927), The Women Lincoln Loved (1927), and The Lincoln of the Biographers (1930).</p>
<p/>
<p>In the course of compiling material for his writings and talks, Barton visited Lincoln sites in Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois; interviewed surviving Lincoln relatives and acquaintances; and traveled as far as California and England to collect information and conduct genealogical research on the ancestry of the Lincoln family. While acquiring a large collection of books, periodicals, pamphlets, manuscripts, and ephemera related to Lincoln and the Civil War era, Barton also purchased privately or at auction historical materials amassed by other Lincoln collectors such as John E. Burton and Osborn H. Oldroyd.</p>

<p>Henry Holmes Belfield, educator, was born November 17, 1837, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His family moved west in 1846, living in Iowa and Missouri. Belfield received an A.B. degree from Iowa College in 1858, A.M. degrees from Griswold College in 1861 and Iowa College in 1868, and a Ph.D. from Iowa College in 1878. Before moving to Chicago in 1866, he served as Principal and Superintendent of Public Schools in Dubuque, Iowa, and as an assistant adjutant general in the 8th Iowa Cavalry.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Belfield worked as Principal of Jones School, 1866-1868, Dore School, 1868-1876, and North Division High School, 1876-1883. In 1883 he was appointed as the first Director of the newly-formed Chicago Manual Training School. He and his family moved to Hyde Park the following year.</p>
<p>The Chicago Manual Training School was created by the Commercial Club of Chicago, its trustees included E. W. Blatchford, R. T. Crane, W. A. Fuller, Marshall Field, John Crerar, John W. Doane, W. K. Fairbank, Edson Keith, and George M. Pullman. It was conceived not as a trade school but as a high school that combined training in carpentry, drawing, and machine shopwork with mathematics, science, and language in a program of general education. The first of its kind in Chicago, it served as a model for the R. T. Crane Manual Training School and Armour Institute, as well as similar schools in other cities.</p>
<p>In 1897 the Commercial Club offered the school as a gift to the University of Chicago, and in 1903 it was merged with the South Side Academy to form the University High School. Belfield's title was changed to Dean of the Technological Course of the University High School, since the Manual Training School was technically dissolved. He served in that position until his retirement in 1908. Although he had recommended the acquisition of the school by the University, he felt that it was unfortunate that much of the school's identity and character were lost through the administrative changes. Belfield died June 5, 1912.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>A dynamic man of broad interests and innovative flair, William Burnett Benton achieved distinction in many fields during his seventy-three years. He was blessed with a nearly unerring talent for the marketplace, but he is remembered especially for broad-ranging contributions in education and public affairs.</p>
<p/>
<p>Born in Minneapolis on April 1, 1900, Benton was the first child of Charles William Benton, a Congregationalist clergyman and University of Minnesota professor, and Elma Hixson Benton, a country school superintendent. Benton and his younger brother, Daniel Hixson, grew up in a close-knit family which prized its activist heritage; their paternal grandparents had been missionaries in Lebanon from the 1840s through the 1870s, and the Hixsons were prominent in Democratic reform politics in Minnesota. Particularly through the forceful example of his mother, Benton early was imbued with humanitarian and public service ideals which his later life exemplified.</p>
<p/>
<p>When Benton was thirteen his father died, and the family's situation changed radically. Young William entered Shattuck Academy in Faribault, Minnesota, on a partial scholarship, spending most vacations helping his mother in an ill-fated Montana homesteading venture undertaken with her father and brother. Though Benton disliked the isolated summers and the military regimen of the academic year, he was buoyed by the prospect of following a long line of Yale-educated Bentons who had been ministers, teachers, and professionals. Each year he stood close to the top of his class, but he always found time for extracurricular activities. In addition to sports, he supplemented his meager funds as Shattuck's sole agent for memory books, class pins, stationery, and a binder he invented for the new school paper. Through his schoolboy enterprise he began to discover entrepreneurial and selling talents which were to alter the direction of his ambitions.</p>
<p/>
<p>In June 1917 Benton confidently took his final exams at Shattuck and the entrance exams for Yale. The college's English and mathematics requirements presented no difficulty, but he was shocked when he failed the French and Latin exams. Suddenly his dreams seemed unattainable, forcing the high school graduate to reevaluate the future.</p>
<p/>
<p>In the meantime Elma Benton, seeking to improve her long-range career possibilities in teaching, had decided to earn a master's degree in education at Columbia University's Teachers College. Her solution to her elder son's predicament was to enroll him at Carleton College, where his aunt, Dr. Mary Benton, was dean of women. To his surprise Benton found all aspects of Carleton life congenial, and he weighed the notion of going against his mother's wishes by finishing his undergraduate work there. The dilemma disappeared when Congress passed a draft law covering ages 18 to 45, for Benton immediately left for Yale, where he was inducted into the Student Army Training Corps. Benton's hopes for military service were dashed only two months later with the signing of the armistice.</p>
<p/>
<p>He stayed at Yale to retake the entrance examinations and in 1918 entered as a sophomore. Although quickly recognized as a prize debater and a frequent contributor to the Yale Record, it was a trying year for Benton academically and socially. He felt his Midwestern background and schooling branded him an outsider, and he resented the handicap as he adjusted to the social and intellectual atmosphere of the eastern institution. In early 1919 Benton began to make decisions which pointed him toward a business career. First came involvement in a college-calendar franchise, by which he impressed classmates with his promoting and selling techniques. Soon thereafter Benton was offered a Rhodes scholarship and had to confront the implications of his marketing aptitude. To his mother's dismay, he rejected it, instead accepting a prestigious summer training position in international trading and finance with National City Bank of New York.</p>
<p/>
<p>That year brought major changes in his family situation as well. Elma Benton finished her degree work and was named headmistress at Hosmer Hall, a private girls' school in St. Louis, where she was to remain until her death in 1942. Dan Benton joined her there after spending the summer in New York City with his brother; but within a few months he had contracted an unidentified sleeping sickness, and he died in late December of 1919.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton had been elated to start his second year at Yale as one of the editors of the Yale Record, and soon after Dan's death he was elected chairman of the editorial board. Under his direction the staff solicited more advertising, and the magazine grew to boast the largest newsstand circulation of any college magazine in history. In addition to honing his writing and promotional skills, Benton formed important and long-lasting friendships during his college days. Among these men were Henry Luce, Jr., Robert M. Hutchins, Ralph Ingersoll, Galen Van Meter, and Reginald Marsh.</p>
<p/>
<p>Graduating in 1921, Benton accepted a job with the National Cash Register Company, renowned for the quality of its salesmanship and the leadership of President John H. Patterson, the father of "scientific salesmanship." Within the earlier system, "drummers" had carried samples or catalogues demonstrating a range of products made by various manufacturers. Selling relied not only on the salesman's persuasiveness and personality but also on the customer's loyalty. The salesman had little incentive to improve performance since only novice or incompetent employees sold on commission; any good agent was tied to a set salary. Patterson revamped the system by assigning NCR salesmen specific territories, sales quotas, and a single product to be sold by creating a need for it among prospects. Another novel characteristic of Patterson's system was rewarding salesmen with generous prizes and more lucrative sales territories.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's hiring violated two of Patterson's rules-of-thumb; he was under 25 and a college graduate. At first limited to menial or over-flow office work, Benton won an early chance to develop his selling skills because of his industriousness and aptitude. Despite being saddled with a notoriously unpromising trial territory, he exceeded his quota during his first month in the field. The auspicious beginning was insufficient inducement for company officials to waive minimum age requirements for NCR special training classes compulsory for advancement. Impatient and disenchanted, Benton decided to shift to advertising.</p>
<p/>
<p>He broke into the new field with a $25-a-week job with the New York branch of Lord and Thomas, then the world's largest and most profitable advertising agency. Albert D. Lasker, its head and owner, brought to advertising the same dynamism and creativity that John H. Patterson infused into the world of scientific selling. Benton's dissatisfaction with the agency mounted rapidly, however, as his requests to learn copywriting were repeatedly denied. After a brief period of discontent he moved to the George Batten Company, staying there until fired as a result of policy disagreements a tumultuous five years later. Before returning to Lord and Thomas he married Helen Hemingway, a teacher he had met while at Yale. Their first child, Charles William, was born three years later. Several years later the Bentons adopted two baby girls, Louise Hemingway and Helen Orr, and in 1942 another child, John.</p>
<p/>
<p>In 1929 Benton resigned as assistant general manager and partner at Lord and Thomas, and with former assistant Chester Bowles, from whom he borrowed $5,000 for the purpose, started the Benton and Bowles agency. Despite the Great Depression, Benton and Bowles quickly became the sixth largest single-office advertising firm in the United States. The Depression itself fostered the agency's success, for it encouraged the re-examination of advertising policies and outmoded techniques, facilitating the rise of a new wave of creative executives. The fledgling agency also benefited from Benton's introduction into New York of the consumer research surveys he had devised at Lord and Thomas in Chicago. These surveys gave clients more systematically compiled data for marketing decisions, particularly appealing at a time when consumer purchasing power was drastically reduced. In addition, while other top agencies still were depending almost totally on newspapers and national magazines, Benton and Bowles pioneered in radio advertising. Two shows were especially important;" Amos 'n Andy," which Benton bought for Pepsodent while still at Lord and Thomas; and the "Maxwell House Show Boat." Among the innovations on the latter were the use of the live studio audience, cue signs for laughter and applause, and commercials with sound effects.</p>
<p/>
<p>The partners had agreed verbally from the outset that Benton would be free to leave with fair compensation when he chose, and in 1935 Benton began making arrangements to quit advertising. Newspapers seized the rags-to-riches story: Yale scholarship student reaches goal of earning a million dollars before his thirtieth birthday-and during the Depression. It is true that the eventual value of his stock made him a millionaire; but because his return was pegged to the firm's well-being, only if the agency continued to prosper would his total assets mount. Benton, in fact, was destined for some financially rocky periods before his wealth was assured.</p>
<p/>
<p>When Benton announced his retirement from advertising, President Robert M. Hutchins, his former Yale debating partner, invited him to undertake public relations and fund-raising work for the University of Chicago. After Benton turned down the offer, Hutchins countered by proposing a shorter-term project; surveying University programs and suggesting improvements. As further inducement he stressed opportunities for directing and expanding the University's commitment to radio broadcasting and educational films, both areas which had already whetted Benton's interest.</p>
<p/>
<p>Overcoming his initial hesitation, Benton agreed to spend two to three months assessing the situation and producing a "consumer research" survey for the institution. It was unprecedented for a university to adopt such techniques to measure its "acceptance" or "sales resistance." Indispensable assistance came from John Howe, then part of the University's public relations office and Benton's right-hand man for the ensuing three decades.</p>
<p/>
<p>The University's public relations in the mid-thirties were in a poor state. Though it was outside the purview of his assignment, Benton managed to solve two of the institution's most vexing problems. The University was perceived as a nest of subversion, a situation which had been exacerbated by the publicity surrounding Charles Walgreen's withdrawal of his daughter from classes. Benton could uncover no factual basis for these accusations, so he got permission from Hutchins to approach the drugstore magnate personally. Their meeting laid the groundwork both for the resolution of the immediate problem and for Walgreen's underwriting of the University's Charles R. Walgreen Foundation for the Study of American Institutions. Benton was equally successful in neutralizing the chronic hostility shown the University by Chicago by newspapers, especially Colonel Robert McCormick's Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p/>
<p>Late in 1936 Benton completed The University of Chicago's Public Relations, his analysis of the University's image problems and recommendations for improvement. Pinpointing Hutchins's role in public relations as crucial, he also underlined essential contributions to be made by faculty, students, trustees, and alumni. In line with his own interests and vision, he also emphasized the largely untapped capacity of radio and film to promote the University. Fifty confidential copies of the controversial report were printed for circulation to the trustees, and the University's public relations now so intrigued Benton that he agreed to assume a half-time position as vice-president.</p>
<p/>
<p>He lost no time in implementing the ideas he had outlined in his report. In addition to producing and commissioning scores of promotional articles and pamphlets about the University, Benton lectured widely and urged others in the academic community to do the same. Much of this work was aimed at the Chicago business community, a group whose ties to the University the new vice president sought to strengthen and expand. Benton's greatest interest, however, was in radio and film. He put "The University of Chicago Round Table" on a permanent footing, arranging a grant from the Alfred Sloan Foundation for that purpose. Begun modestly in 1931 as an occasional seminar on current economic, political, and social issues, by the fall of 1936 the "Round Table" had a national following. Under Benton's tutelage it was for twenty years the most popular radio discussion program in the United States, drawing many of its participants from the University faculty. Benton further heightened the University's national visibility when he inaugurated another radio series, "The Human Adventure," which linked faculty research to dramatic advances in human knowledge.</p>
<p/>
<p>Prospects for developing educational films were more complex. In 1932 the University had entered into a five-year contract with an AT&amp;T subsidiary, Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI), under which ERPI provided the financial and technical resources for film-making while the University supplied its faculty and endorsement. In 1936 Benton learned of the conglomerate's desire to sell ERPI and to abandon the educational film business. Despite the trustees' interest and Benton's strong encouragement, the University chose not to acquire ERPI. Benton's faith in the potential of the educational film business remained undiluted, and he was to have another chance to purchase ERPI only five years later.</p>
<p/>
<p>During his years of service to the University, Benton continued to look for personal investment opportunities. In 1939 he bought Muzak, an ailing and obscure company which sent music into restaurants and hotels over leased telephone lines. The company's managers conceived of Muzak as a substitute for live orchestra and band music, but Benton revolutionized the business by envisioning it primarily as background music. Within a few years he had turned Muzak into a thriving concern, but he was stymied in his simultaneous efforts to introduce subscription radio, a scheme in which special FM channels would be made available to citizens on a subscription basis. By the late 1940s Benton was devoting his energies primarily to other concerns, though he retained ownership of the company until 1958.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's association with the University led directly to another and even more profitable investment. Sears, Roebuck and Company had acquired Encyclopaedia Britannica after having been involved in its management during World War I, but the corporation was increasingly anxious to get rid of it. Benton knew General Robert E. Wood, chairman of Sears, from working closely with him on the America First Committee, and he suggested to Wood that Sears give the Britannica company to the University of Chicago as an endowment. The General agreed, but the University trustees balked at accepting the gift, worried about the lack of working capital and the appropriateness of a university's operating an essentially nonacademic book business. After months of negotiating, Hutchins, Benton, and Wood reached a compromise whereby Benton would supply $100,000 of working capital and assume risks of ownership and operation.</p>
<p/>
<p>In early 1943 Benton thus became the owner, publisher, and chairman of the board of Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., and at the insistence of the University trustees he took two-thirds of the common stock. The University retained the option to buy one-half of his stock without interest, which would have given it two-thirds and control; when the time came to take up the option, the trustees were unwilling to tamper with a such a lucrative business arrangement. Benton eventually retired the University's holdings, but the institution continued to receive substantial royalty payments.</p>
<p/>
<p>Shortly after assuming control of Britannica, Benton learned that ERPI was still available. To him it seemed natural for Encyclopaedia Britannica to acquire an educational film company, but it was a business gamble since all Benton's predecessors in that field had failed. The newborn Encyclopaedia Britannica Films, Inc., however, soon occupied an unexpectedly strong position in the field. Not only did its principal competitor, Eastman Kodak, withdraw from the business, but it donated its library of silent films to Encyclopaedia Britannica and the University of Chicago.</p>
<p/>
<p>Another of Benton's projects grew out of his relationship with the University and Britannica. During his vice-presidential years, Benton became involved in Robert Hutchins's Great Books program, and in his enthusiasm he resolved to publish the works as a set. His Britannica associates were skeptical, reminding him of the ready availability of standard editions. Discounting their fears, he subsidized Mortimer Adler and an ever larger group of subeditors to compile the Syntopicon, a thesaurus of ideas within the Great Books of the Western World. Costs skyrocketed and deadlines were postponed again and again, but Benton's belief in the project never wavered. The 54-volume series finally appeared in 1952, its enormous commercial success vindicating Benton's judgment. In 1961 Britannica began publication of The Great Ideas Today, an annual supplement to the Great Books; two years later a companion set, the ten-volume Gateway to the Great Books, was published.</p>
<p/>
<p>During his years at Chicago Benton also embarked on his career as a public servant. In 1939, as advisor to Nelson Rockefeller, then Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, he became engaged in the early U. S. ventures in international cultural exchanges. Three years later he was a founding member of the Committee for Economic Development, an organization of top businessmen devoted to planning postwar employment and production. In 1945 Benton severed his administrative connection with the University of Chicago to become Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. His responsibilities included consolidating the wartime information agencies within the State Department and launching the first major U. S. programs for peacetime international information and educational exchanges. Benton was ideally suited to these tasks, but he knew that success would depend on his ability to educate Congress and the American public.</p>
<p/>
<p>Under his direction the State Department began the Voice of America broadcasts, established the United States information offices, and promoted international visits of professors and students. Benton also led U. S. participation in organizing UNESCO, which he later served as representative under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He was busy on the legislative front as well, guiding through Congress the Foreign Service Act of 1946 and the Fulbright Act for international educational exchange programs.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton resigned from the State Department in 1947 and planned to give his attention to Britannica affairs. Soon thereafter, however, because of his international experience and his years of work with the Commission on the Freedom of the Press, the State Department asked him to lead the American delegation to the 1948 United Nations Conference on Freedom of Press and Information. Until his death twenty-five years later Benton continued his work with American delegations to numerous international conferences.</p>
<p/>
<p>Late in 1949 a new path of service opened up to Benton when his old business partner, Chester Bowles, then governor of Connecticut, appointed him to fill a vacant U. S. Senate seat. The next year Benton ran to win the two years remaining in the term. His energetic and creative promotional skills once again found an appropriate arena; he introduced the helicopter into political campaigning and used radio and television extensively. The new techniques were effective; Benton was elected, while Bowles and the rest of the state ticket were defeated.</p>
<p/>
<p>In the Senate Benton joined other liberal Democrats in supporting Truman's Fair Deal. He became a member of the Banking and Currency Committee, the Rules Committee, the Select Committee on Small Business, and the Joint Committee on the Economic Report. Benton introduced and saw enacted a Mutual Security Act amendment stipulating that the act's administrators when purchasing foreign-made materials give preference to factories with noncommunist leadership. He was especially disappointed to have failed with his "Marshall Plan of Ideas," a six-part program designed to combat communism and promote freedom of information.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's voting record supported civil rights and other liberal policies, with a single exception which was to be a lasting source of regret to him. He had been steadfast in his opposition to the Internal Security Act (also known as the McCarran Immigration Act) on the grounds that it was pointedly restrictive of eastern and southern Europeans. Political considerations within the Senate convinced him to swallow his objections and to cast his vote with the overwhelming majority in its favor. It was vetoed immediately by Truman, only to be overridden by Congress. In early 1952 Benton returned to his original stance, joining Senators Lehman and Humphrey in opposing a more extreme version; however, this bill too was enacted over presidential veto. Benton continued to work on immigration after leaving the Senate, primarily by helping organize and finance the National Committee on Immigration and Citizenship. The committee's efforts were rewarded by the 1965 adoption of an immigration policy it deemed liberal and humane.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton is seldom remembered for his most significant action in the Senate: challenging the nationwide communist paranoia fuelled by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Particularly incensed by charges that the State Department had been infiltrated by disloyal, card-carrying communists, soon after winning election Benton began a careful investigation into McCarthy's own activities. By the late summer of 1951 he had collected enough evidence to introduce a strong resolution demanding McCarthy's expulsion from the Senate. Amidst an atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust, Benton was subjected to attack from all sides. Support for his position slowly grew, particularly after McCarthy's decision in the late spring of 1952 to sue Benton for libel.</p>
<p/>
<p>Many Connecticut Democrats regarded Benton's attack on McCarthy as a grave political mistake. McCarthy retaliated by campaigning against Benton in his home state, but polls suggested Benton was benefited as much as he was hurt by his fight against McCarthy. After his loss in the Eisenhower landslide of 1952, Benton continued his battle against McCarthy from outside the Senate. It was not until three years later that the Senate finally voted to censure McCarthy.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton's defeat marked the end of his service in elected positions, but he remained active in state and national Democratic politics. His concern about campaign methods led him to become a director of the Fair Campaign Practices Committee; he also worked vigorously on behalf of his close friends Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey, and he served on the Platform Committee for the Democratic National Conventions in 1952, 1956, and 1964.</p>
<p/>
<p>In the final three decades of his life, Benton concentrated on Britannica's affairs together with various educational and public projects. The two were often intertwined, as was the case with his frequent trips abroad to study developments in education and communications. Benton's lifelong fascination with the Soviet Union and Latin America was deepened by an acute consciousness of the American public's ignorance on these topics. Determined to educate as large an audience as possible, Benton published widely about his tours abroad and mailed reprints regularly to scores of political and business leaders.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton was particularly intrigued with the Soviet educational system. "The Voice of the Kremlin," which first appeared as a feature in the 1956 Britannica -Britannica Book of the Year, was a comprehensive analysis based on his 1955 trip to the U.S.S.R. It was reissued two years later as This Is the Challenge. The 1965 Britannica Book of the Year contained "The Teachers and the Taught in the U.S.S.R.," which Benton wrote after his fifth trip. The same title was used when the essay was published as a book the following year. A similar tour of Latin America with Adlai Stevenson resulted in "The Voice of Latin America," which appeared in book form soon after being printed in the 1961 Britannica Book of the Year.</p>
<p/>
<p>Under Benton's aggressive leadership, Britannica expanded its foreign and domestic operations. In 1957 the Spanish-language Enciclopedia Barsa was published, to be joined seven years later by a Portuguese translation. Benton also embarked on ambitious plans for Britannica's British subsidiary, focusing on strengthening management and production and more closely integrating its activities with those of its American parent.</p>
<p/>
<p>On the domestic front Benton engineered the 1961 acquisition of Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia. Aimed at the secondary school level, Compton's complemented the Britannica Junior Encyclopedia, a reference set in print since 1934. In 1964 Britannica bought the G. and C. Merriam Company, a leading producer of English-language dictionaries and best known for its Merriam-Webster series. Two years later the company purchased Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., a firm distinguished for its international publications and resources.</p>
<p/>
<p>Also in 1966 Encyclopaedia Britannica Films, Inc. was reorganized and renamed. The new Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation (EBEC) was designed to meet rapidly changing needs in the development, production, and marketing of educational films, instructional materials, and reference books. Other modifications in corporate structure followed. William Benton's son Charles resigned the presidency of EBEC to form an independent, non-profit company, the Fund for Media Research. He next assumed sole ownership of Films, Inc., an EBEC subsidiary which distributed 16-millimeter versions of entertainment motion pictures produced by major Hollywood studios.</p>
<p/>
<p>All of Benton's Britannica stock went in 1958 to establish the Benton Foundation, a vehicle for funding worthwhile projects in communications and education, the areas which he had always consumed his attention. During Benton's lifetime the Foundation supported a broad range of endeavors, including several enterprises in which Benton himself was actively involved. For instance, the Foundation aided a number of policy research organizations with which Benton was closely associated: the American Assembly at Columbia University, the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, and the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Political causes in which Benton believed also received Foundation assistance. These included the Committee for a National Trade Policy, the Commission on the Frame of Government, the American Foreign Service Association, and the Adlai Stevenson Memorial. The Foundation also helped underwrite numerous cultural projects. Most prominent among these was the American Shakespeare Theatre and Festival, to which Benton gave a great deal of time as trustee and patron. Others were the Wadsworth Athenaeum, the Noah Webster House Foundation, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, and the Kennedy Library Corporation.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton earmarked a significant portion of the Foundation's resources for educational endeavors. The Foundation contributed to ongoing seminar and lecture programs such as the Cleveland Conference, the Yale Conference, and the Institute of International Education, while also giving substantial aid to institutions which Benton served as trustee; the University of Chicago, University of Connecticut, University of Bridgeport, Brandeis University, Hampton Institute, and Carleton College.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton received many accolades during his lifetime, including eight honorary degrees. Because of the University of Chicago policy restricting the awarding of honorary degrees to scholars, Benton's contributions were seldom publicly recognized by the University until it conferred on him the first William Benton Medal for Distinguished Service in 1968.</p>
<p/>
<p>Honors continued to accumulate. In 1972 the University of Connecticut renamed its art museum in Benton's honor. Long a benefactor of the school, Benton also prided himself on his valuable private collection of American paintings from the first half of the twentieth century. Works by Yale friend Reginald Marsh, whom Benton largely supported during the Depression, formed the richest part of his collection, but he also boasted numerous works by Ivan Albright, Jack Levine, Bellows Hassam, and Kuniyoshi.</p>
<p/>
<p>Benton died on March 18, 1973. He was survived by his widow, Helen Hemingway Benton, and their four children, Charles Benton, Louise Benton Wagner, Helen Benton Boley, and John Benton.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Before Lyman Flook’s appointment as Superintendent of Construction in 1927, building activities at the University were directed and supervised by the Board of Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds and the University Business Manager. The Trustees’ Committee was among the first standing committees appointed by the President of the Board. Composed of the President of the University, the President and Secretary of the Board, and five Trustees, it held its first meeting in October, 1890. It was authorized to select the architect, designate the first sites and buildings, review specifications, consider bids, and make recommendations to the Board of Trustees. The Committee met regularly until the end of 1893, after which its work was assumed by the newly created Executive Committee of the Board; it was reinstated in 1898 and continued its work until 1932, when it was superseded by the Trustees’ Committee on Business Affairs.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1900, the University Council established a five-member Buildings and Grounds Committee drawn from the faculty and charged with advising the Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds. President Harper named Ernest D. Burton chairman of the group and expressed the hope that “steps be taken in the various departments concerned to formulate as accurately as possible the plans of buildings in which they are generally interested.” The faculty committee, however, was soon replaced by individual departmental committees selected as the need arose.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Business Manager, an officer of the Board of Trustees and after 1923, a Vice-President of the University, was responsible for all expenditures on buildings and grounds. He prepared lists of University needs and estimated costs of physical improvements, and presented them to the Trustees’ Committee for discussion and approval. When funds had already been authorized, and only questions of design were involved, the Committee on Buildings and Grounds assumed full responsibility. If new expenditures were required, however, the Business Manager presented the Committee’s recommendations to the full Board of Trustees for discussion a ratification. Once building proposals were approved, the Business Manager secured the necessary contracts, supervised construction, and paid all bills.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Department of Buildings and Grounds evolved gradually during these years. Although maintenance was originally handled by an Engineer, the growth in size and duties of the maintenance staff during the University’s first decade made the need for an efficient Superintendent apparent. M. H. Maclean was appointed the first Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds in 1903 and served until 1910. He was succeeded by Clyde Douglas (1910-1915) and H. W. Rouse (1916-1919). In 1919, Lyman Russell Flook, an engineer and former Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds at the University of Michigan, was named to the post. Although the administration of the physical plant had always been handled by the Business Office, it was not until 1916 that Buildings and Grounds was considered a separate Department in the auditor’s accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1924, the University began a significant program of physical expansion financed in part by individual benefactors and in part by the remainder of John D. Rockefeller’s $10-million final gift in 1910. As planning proceeded, it became apparent that the variety of problems to be solved and decisions to be made was not only beyond the capacity of the Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds, but would also put a severe strain on the Business Office. In an August, 1924, letter to Business Manager Trevor Arnett, Flook argued that the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds could provide important assistance in the management of the new building program. “It is simply a question,” he said, “as to how far the Building Committee wishes to detail their responsibility to *** some other person. . . . Whoever the person designated, he should be familiar with the needs of the Academic Department occupying the Building, with the drawings and specifications. . . . He should be on the alert to forsee simplifications of plan, defects of planning, improvements of design and detail. . . . He should, for the Owner, inform himself as to the scheduling of the major materials and sub-contractor’s work, to be sure that the date of completion will be achieved. Such operations should clear through the channels having contractual relations with the Architect - the Owner’s usual contact - the Business Manager” (4:1).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In October, 1927, Flook’s proposal for an expanded role was largely realized by his appointment as Superintendent of Construction, a new post giving him direct supervision of the planning and erection of all campus buildings. Architects and engineer undertaking work were instructed to addre’ their correspondence directly to Flook’s office, where Flook would annotate carbon copies and forward them to the Vice-President and Business Manager. As part of this reorganization, Emery Jackson, an employee of the firm of Coolidge and Hodgdon, was apointed University Architect, and Lester Ries became Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds in charge of operations and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For each building constructed during the expansion period, Flook consulted on the design with Jackson, the architects, faculty members, and a Faculty Committee on Symbolism appointed by the President to suggest subjects for ornamentation and approve models. Drawing on Flook’s reports, the Business Manager then made recommendations to the Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds. Ultimate decisions on the selection of architects and contractors, building plans, costs, materials used, equipment, furnishings, decoration, and inscriptions were made by the Trustees’ Committee with the ratification of the full Board of Trustees. Exceptions to this practice were buildings for such institutions as Chicago Lying-In Hospital and Hicks-McElwee Orthopedics Hospital that had come to the University with their own board of trustees.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Lyman Flook remained Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds until his retirement in 1953. The Department of Buildings and Grounds w discontinued in the 1960’s when construction was taken over by the Office of Physical Planning (established in 1967) and maintenance was absorbed by the Plant Department (established in 1969).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Twenty new buildings were constructed on the University campus during the expansion program of 1926-1931. The entire Midway facade was filled in, ranging from International House at the east to the hospital complex on the west, with Rockefeller Chapel, the Social Science Research Building, and Wieboldt Hall in between. The Oriental Institute was built northwest of Rockefeller Chapel as part of a planned but never fully realized Chapel Block. Two new buildings, Judd Hall and Sunny Gymnasium, were added to the School of Education. The inner quadrangles acquired Eckhart Hall and Jones Laboratory, as well as the Theology Group composed of Swift Hall, Bond Chapel, and the Cloister. To the north, a new Botany Laboratory, twelve greenhouses, and an animal research facility were constructed. Stagg Field was remodeled, and the Field House was added to campus recreational facilities. Construction south of the Midway included the Burton-Judson men’s residences and the Blackstone Avenue Power Plant.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The whole campus was dug up, not only in preparation for the new buildings, but also to permit the laying of an intricate network of tunnels emanating from the Power Plant that would bring heat and electricity to every building on the campus. Along with this construction, older buildings were remodeled, including the President’s House, several dormitories, and a group of stores on 61st Street redesigned in the Tudor style to serve students living south of the Midway. Cottages, barns, apartment buildings, and the old Del Prado Hotel were demolished to make room for new buildings. The old Quadrangle Club, converted for use by the School of Commerce, was moved to 58th Street and renamed Ingleside Hall. Professor William Gardner Hale’s house was rolled down University Avenue and relocated south of the new Quadrangle Club to provide a graduate club house and make room for Chicago Theological Seminary to construct its complex on the northeast corner of 58th Street.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The number or architects involved in this expansion program distinguished it from the two earlier phases of University construction. During the first period (1892-1900), Henry Ives Cobb had dominated design as the University’s chief architect. In the second phase (1901-1916), most of the work was done by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. In the third phase (1926-1931), Charles Coolidge continued as a campus architect through a new partnership with Charles Hodgdon, for many veers the firm’s Chicago representative. Other architectural firms participating in the expansion were Goodhue Associates (later Mayers, Murray, and Phillip); Holabird and Roche (later Holabird and Root); Charles z. Klauder; Armstrong, Furst, and Tilton; Zantzinger, Borie, and Medarie; Perkins, Chatten, and Hammond; and Schmidt, Garden, and Erickson.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This was also the final period of reliance on neo-Gothic styles in the University’s architecture. While a complete break with eclecticism would not be made until the construction of the Administration Building in 1948, the technological and financial strains of designing Gothic hospitals, laboratories, or gymnasia were increasingly apparent. Later University buildings would adapt to rather than adopt the Gothic mode.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With the exception of the Charles E. Merriam Center for Public Administration (Public Administration Clearing House), completed in 1937, no new buildings were erected on the University campus between 1932 and 1948. After World War II new buildings were needed to accommodate the radical developments in the physical sciences, house the University’s administrative staff, furnish residences for faculty and students, enlarge University High School, and provide additional facilities for the professional schools. Additions to the hospitals were accompanied by long over-due reconstruction and updating of old facilities. A building program was devised for the south side of the Midway Plaisance that drew in affiliated organizations working with the University on problems of research and education. These included, in addition to the Public Administration Clearing House, the American Bar Center, the Center for Continuing Education, now the Graduate Student Residence, and the Industrial Relations Center (Charles Stewart Mott Building).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After 1948 major changes took place in the University’s architectural style, its methods of financing new buildings, and the ways in which the building program was planned and administered.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Three important factors influenced the University’s architectural style: 1) the decision to abandon neo-Gothic in favor of a more contemporary approach; 2) the determination to preserve campus unity so far as possible by continuing to build in limestone, maintain where appropriate the quadrangular plan, and encourage the architects to integrate the new buildings with the old; and 3) a policy of employing renowned contemporary architects to design individual buildings, rather than giving, as in the past, almost total responsibility for the entire campus to one firm (see guide to Department of Buildings and Grounds Records, Sub-Series 1). Among the firms given commissions were Holabird, Root and Burgee; Eero Saarinen and Associates; Edward Durrell Stone; Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; Perkins and Will; and Harry Weese and Associates. Schmidt, Garden and Erikson, who had designed Chicago Lying-In Hospital in 1931, were architects for the alterations to the old hospitals, the new hospital units, and the Research Institutes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Whereas before World War II University buildings were financed chiefly by the beneficence of individual donors And/or the Rockefellers, the post-War period saw an enormous growth in government, foundation, and corporate funding. For example, the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital (now the Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute) was constructed under the supervision of and with funds from the Atomic Energy Commission; the Research Institutes were financed by the Atomic Energy Commission, the Office of Naval Research, and more than twenty leading corporations; the Center for Continuing Education was given by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation; and the re-modelling of the first women’s dormitories for use by the Department of Psychology was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The administrative mechanisms for planning and supervising the building program were also changed. The Trustees’ Committee on Buildings and Grounds had been terminated in 1932, and its work was assumed by the Committee on Business Affairs. In 1949 the functions of the Committee on Business Affairs were taken over by the Budget Committee and any ad hoc committees it might see fit to appoint. Among these ad hoc committees were the Area Committee, formed in 1949 to address the problems posed by the deterioration in the surrounding neighborhoods, and the Committee on Campus Development. The latter was succeeded in 1958 by the Trustees’ Committee on Campus Planning. Thus there evolved two different but interacting and cooperating Trustees’ committees, one concerned with the building program and the neighborhood, the other with the campus.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Guidance and surveillance of architects for campus buildings had earlier been the responsibility of the Trustees’ Committee on Building and Grounds, working in cooperation with the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. In 1929, in response to the pressure engendered by President Burton’s building program, the office of Consulting Architect was created, and Emery Jackson, who had been with Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and done much of the designing for Ida Noyes Hall, was selected to fill the post. Both Jackson and the Department of Buildings and Grounds had offices in Ingleside Hall. Jackson was succeeded in 1948 by J. Lee Jones, who held the office until he retired in 1964 to be replaced by I. W. Colburn. Jones’s office was in Rosenwald until 1963 when the Office of University Architect was created and located in the Young Building (Chicago Home for Incurables).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A further architectural appointment was made in the mid-fifties. Uneasiness about the conditions of the neighborhoods to the north and south of the University, combined with a sense of the magnitude of the building program, contributed to the Trustees’ determination to select an outside architect to prepare a long-range plan. Consulting Architect J. Lee Jones prepared a list of potential candidates from which the Trustees might choose. Eero Saarinen, who had had extensive experience in campus planning, and was highly recommended by Trustee Walter Paepcke, for whom he had worked in Aspen, was selected to develop a master plan for the University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Saarinen paid his first visit to the University in 1954. In 1955 he presented a master plan at a joint meeting of the Trustees’ Area Committee and the Committee on Campus Development. He was subsequently engaged as a consulting architect to pass on the appropriateness of the work of other architects designing for the University. His firm also designed two University complexes, the Law School Quadrangle and Woodward Court and Commons. In 1958 Saarinen’s preliminary plan was revised and presented to the newly constituted Trustees’ Committee on Campus Planning. Saarinen’s untimely death in 1961 terminated this particular phase of campus planning, but the program for this period was climaxed in 1964 by the successful application to the Ford Foundation for a $25 million challenge grant for extensive additions to the physical facilities and the announcement in 1965 of the opening of the Campaign for Chicago.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1969 the Office of University Architect and a new office of campus planning were combined into the joint Department of Physical Planning and Construction. Problems of maintenance and management were delegated to the newly established Plant Department.

<p>Martin Hayes Bickham was born on October 7, 1880 in Churchtown, Pennsylvania. He received his A.B. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1908. He was a student in the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago from 1912-1922 and received his A.M. in 1919 and his Ph.D. in 1922. His A.M. thesis was titled “The Relations of Sociology and Religion from 1865 to 1915.” His Ph.D. thesis, under the direction of Albion Small, was titled “The Scientific Antecedents of the Sociology of Auguste Comte.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Prior to commencing his academic work at the University of Chicago, Bickham was appointed as secretary of the University of Chicago Christian Association in 1911. During World War I, he served with the Y.M.C.A in Paris. He was also an assistant coach for Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago for several years beginning in 1911.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following his graduation with a Ph.D. in sociology in 1922, Bickham went on to become a practicing sociologist, conducting studies in such subjects as racism, poverty, and social life on American college campuses. He became an influential figure in urban social affairs, especially matters relating to equal opportunity, open housing and civil liberties in the Chicago area.

<p>Jean Friedberg Block, a lifelong Hyde Park resident, was born in 1912. She received a master’s degree from the University of Chicago in 1963 and was awarded the Alumni Association Public Service Citation in 1981. A founding member of the Hyde Park Historical Society, Block also served on the boards of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Architecture Foundation and International House.
</p>
<p>Block was a renowned expert on the architecture of the University and its surrounding neighborhood. Her 1978 book, Hyde Park Houses: An Informal History, 1856-1910, describes the neighborhood’s sociological and architectural transformation from bucolic suburb to urban neighborhood through photographs and text. Block next turned her attention to the aesthetics of the university itself. In 1983, the University of Chicago published her second book, Writing in The Uses of Gothic: Planning and Building the Campus of the University of Chicago 1892–1932. Block was a lead author and coordinator of The Uses of Gothic, a 1985 exhibit in the Special Collections Research Center. At the time of her death, Mrs. Block was writing a history of apartment houses and their effect on Chicago neighborhoods from 1910 to 1950.
</p>
<p>Block died in 1988 at the age of 76. She was survived by two children and five grandchildren. The sunken viewing garden directly north of the Joseph Regenstein Library was named the Jean F. Block Memorial Garden after her death.

<p>This collection includes materials relating to Leonard Bloomfield and Clarence L. Barnhart’s linguistic program to teach children to read. Leonard Bloomfield was an accomplished American linguist who taught at the University of Chicago for many years. Clarence L. Barnhart was a lexicographer who studied at the University of Chicago under Bloomfield’s direction. In a meeting between the two men, Barnhart remarked that he was going to begin teaching his son to read. Bloomfield responded with an outline of a program detailing the way he thought children should be taught to read. While the program was unsuccessful for Barnhart’s son, the two men began working together and further developing the reading program, Let’s Read – a Linguistic Approach. </p>
<p/>
<p>Bloomfield and Barnhart’s program attempts to develop the “alphabetic habit”. By placing similar sounding words together throughout the books, the reader is introduced to patterns within vocabulary. Let’s Read was published in 1961, after the death of Bloomfield in 1949. The work is composed of Bloomfield’s original ideas and illustrations. After Bloomfield’s death, Barnhart continued to work on the program along with the help of his sons. Following its original publication, other members of the Barnhart family continued to work on the program, resulting in a revised edition in 1993 and a second edition in 2010. </p>

<p>In 1894, University of Chicago President William Rainey Harper appointed John Merle Coulter (1851-1928) to lead the newly established Department of Botany. Coulter was a leading American botanist and a friend of Asa Gray (1810-1888), the famed Harvard botanist whose Manual of Botany and other texts dominated plant science in the United States. Coulter had founded the Botanical Gazette nearly twenty years earlier, and he brought the editorship of the professional journal with him to his new position. In 1896, botanical research at the University of Chicago was further enhanced with the erection of the Hull Biological Laboratories. This complex of four buildings included the Botany Building, which housed classrooms, labs, and a rooftop greenhouse, and Botany Pond, an adjacent outdoor plant study facility.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The University of Chicago's Department of Botany quickly grew to become one of modern botany's most influential centers of research and teaching. By the 1930s, the roster of notable researchers serving on the Botany faculty included Henry C. Cowles and George D. Fuller in ecology, Charles J. Chamberlain in plant morphology, Merle C. Coulter in plant genetics, Adolf C. Noe in paleobotany, and Charles Barnes, William Crocker, and Charles A. Shull in plant physiology. The Botanical Gazette, published under the direction of an editorial board drawn from the department's faculty, was American botany's leading journal, and national university evaluations such as the Hughes Report of 1925 ranked the Department of Botany first among its academic peers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>None of the Department of Botany's achievements loomed larger than the new field of plant ecology developed by Henry Chandler Cowles (1869-1939). Cowles was a graduate student of John M. Coulter, a member of the Botany faculty from 1897 onward, and chairman of the department from 1925 until his retirement in 1934.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cowles's formulation of ecology was first expressed in his Ph.D. thesis, "The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan" (1898). Cowles based his thesis on detailed field work he had undertaken in the Indiana Dunes, a wild, unsettled region of beaches, sand dunes, bogs, and woods along the southern shore of Lake Michigan about twenty-five miles from the University of Chicago. Cowles argued that the natural succession of plant forms in time could be traced in physical space as one moved inland from the open lake beach across ancient shorelines through the shifting dunes to the interior forest.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Henry C. Cowles and his theories and methods attracted many students to the Department of Botany, and these students in turn secured positions at other

<p>universities and research institutions. One study of scientific influences by Douglas Sprugel in 1980 concluded that of the seventy-seven recognized American scientists dominant in the field of ecology from 1900 to the early 1950s, no fewer than forty-six were students of Cowles or were directly influenced by professional mentors who had been students of Cowles.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Chicago school of ecology is generally regarded as one of the most influential forces in the development of ecological studies. While Cowles's theories of ecological community and plant succession have been modified and extended by more recent generations of scientists, they continue to be considered among the most significant departures in the modern understanding of the natural environment.

<p>In 1967, the Biological Sciences Division's proposal for a merger of the Departments of Botany and Zoology was approved. The merger, which formed the Department of Biology, responded to the need for flexibility in the use of resources and funding, as well as broader trends in research and teaching in the biological sciences.</p>

<p>Mary Jean Bowman was born in New York City in 1908 and raised in Newton Center, Massachusetts. She received a B.A. in economics from Vassar College in 1930, an M.A. in economics from Radcliffe College in 1932, and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1938. During the 1930s Bowman did casework and research at the Massachusetts Women’s State Prison and began teaching at Iowa State College. In 1943 Bowman, along with her husband C. Arnold Anderson, Theodore Schultz. D. Gale Johnson and others left Iowa State during the “oleomargarine controversy.” (During World War II, Iowa State College faculty published a pamphlet recommending the use of oleomargarine during wartime. Under pressure from the state dairy industry, the college president urged the faculty to revise the pamphlet.) Bowman then worked as a price economist for the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and as a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Chicago with her husband in 1949. Because C. Arnold Anderson was a faculty member in the Education department at the University of Chicago, Bowman was not awarded a faculty appointment in the Economics department until 1958 after the University relaxed nepotism rules. She did, however, teach as an Associate Professor in the Economics department prior to 1958. In 1969 she was awarded a joint appointment in the Economics and Education departments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Bowman was best known for applying human capital theory to the study of education. She published six books and more than seventy five articles over the course of her career. With George Leland Bach, she co-authored the textbook Economic Analysis and Public Policy, which was the most widely used college economics textbook in the 1940s and 1950s. She published influential research on income distribution in the 1950s and produced a major study of the economics of poverty-stricken Eastern Kentucky in the 1960s. She also researched internationally, and published books on the Ivory Coast and Japan as well as numerous articles on economics and education in developing countries. She collaborated with her husband (who directed the University’s Comparative Education Center) to publish work on economics and education based on both domestic and international research.

Brauer pursued advanced training at Union Theological Seminary in New York and earned a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1948. In 1945 Brauer married Muriel (Nelson) Brauer. The couple had two children Christopher Nelson and Marian Ruth. Brauer became an ordained minister in the United Lutheran Church of America in 1951.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Brauer began his teaching career as an instructor in church history and the history of Christianity at the Union Theological Seminary where he also served as assistant to Paul Tillich. In 1950, Brauer moved to Chicago to become Assistant Professor in History of Christianity at the University of Chicago. Associate Professor, 1954-1959.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As Dean, Brauer was known for recruiting top faculty including Paul Tillich, Martin Marty, Don Browning, Clark Gilpin, and David Tracy. As the first Catholic faculty at the Divinity School, Tracy's hiring illustrated Brauer's commitment to increasing ecumenism in the Divinity School.

<p>In August 1863 a group of Baptist leaders met in Chicago and created the Baptist Theological Union. On Feb. 16, 1865, the Illinois legislature granted the Baptist Theological Union a charter for "the founding, endowment, support, and direction of an institution for theological instruction." That same year, Dr. Nathaniel Colver began to give instruction to a few students in his study. The Baptist Union Theological Seminary fully launched in 1866.</p>
<p>The formal work of the Baptist Union Theological Seminary began with the appointment of George W. Northrup as President and Professor of Systematic Theology. In the fall of 1867, courses in that subject as well as Ecclesiastical History and Biblical Literature and Exegesis were given to nineteen students in the Old University of Chicago’s Douglas Hall. On July 1, 1869, the Seminary dedicated its own building directly across the street from the Old University of Chicago. The Seminary provided theological education in English, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish to Old University of Chicago and non-University students. Facing financial hardship in the mid-1870s, the Seminary sold its buildings near the Old University of Chicago and moved to donated land in the Chicago suburb of Morgan Park in 1877.

<p>Henry Northrup Castle (1862-1895) was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of American missionary parents, Samuel and Mary Castle. After spending all of his youth in the islands, where he attended Oahu College, he came to the United States in 1878 to attend Oberlin College. It was at Oberlin that Castle began a close friendship with George Herbert Mead, which lasted the remainder of his short life.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After working two years in his brother Will's law office in Honolulu following graduation from Oberlin in 1883, Castle studied in Germany and for two years at the Harvard Law School. Mead joined Castle at Harvard, and both men continued their studies in Germany. As intellectual companions, they shared a mutual interest in philosophy and literature, and exchanged lively letters extensively on these subjects.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Castle returned to Hawaii after marrying a German girl, Frida Steckner, and became editor and owner of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser and the Hawaiian Gazette, the principal newspapers in the islands. Frida was tragically killed in an accident in 1890, a month after their daughter, Dorothy, was born. After having married his second wife Mabel Wing in 1892, Castle returned, in 1893, to the United States to attend the Hawaiian Commission in Washington, which was investigating American intervention in the Hawaiian revolution to overthrow Queen Lilinokalani, and to visit George and Helen Mead. Mead had married Castle's sister, Helen, in 1891.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1894, Castle, ever in search of knowledge, returned to Germany with Dorothy to continue his studies in Leipzig. When word reached him in December 1894 of a counter revolt by Hawaiian royalists, Castle and his daughter left immediately for the islands on the steamship, Elbe, which collided with a small steamer on January 30, 1895 in the North Sea. Both Castle and his daughter were drowned, and he never was able to see his younger daughter, Elinor, who had been born a month before.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Castle was eulogized as a martyr to the cause of democratic government for Hawaii and a loyal supporter of the new Hawaiian Republic. Additionally, he was a man of unusual intellectual attainments whose friendship was an important influence on the career of George Herbert Mead.</p>

<p>The Contemporary Chamber Players was an art music performance ensemble founded at the University of Chicago by composer and Department of Music faculty member Ralph Shapey (1921-2002). During Shapey's tenure as conductor and director (1964-1993), the ensemble dedicated itself to the performance of compositions by the University of Chicago's doctoral candidates in composition, as well as newer or unknown composers who had not yet achieved national or international attention. Consequently, many of the composers whose works were performed by Contemporary Chamber Players went on to become prominent figures in the world of contemporary art music. Contemporary Chamber Players premiered works by composers such as Mario Davidovsky, George Perle, Shulamit Ran, George Rochberg, Roger Sessions and Ralph Shapey.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Contemporary Chamber Players benefitted greatly from funding from the Fromm Music Foundation, founded by Chicagoan Paul Fromm (1906-1987). The ensemble held an annual concert in his honor, featuring compositions by well-known contemporary art music composers. The ensemble also toured the United States, playing venues such as the Library of Congress and Carnegie Hall, as well as numerous colleges and universities. Locally, Contemporary Chamber Players worked closely with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during the tenure of music director Jean Martinon (1963-1968).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After Ralph Shapey stepped down as Contemporary Chamber Players's director in 1993, the group was led by several resident conductors until Shulamit Ran, a faculty member and former Shapey student, became artistic director in 2002. The ensemble continues performing new art music in Chicago under the name Contempo. </p>

<p>The University of Chicago Central Administration Letterbooks cover the administrations of Max Mason (1925-1928), Robert Maynard Hutchins (1929-1951), and Lawrence A. Kimpton (1951-1960). Mason was the first President to come from outside the University. He oversaw a period of expansion, including the creation of a hundred new faculty positions, the completion of the hospitals, and a new football stadium. Under his successor, however, varsity football was eliminated; Hutchins sought to focus on cementing the University’s reputation for intellectual rigour, particularly at the undergraduate level, where he championed a liberal, non-specialized education. Despite his involvement with government projects on campus during wartime, notably the Manhattan Project, Hutchins was a defender of academic freedom who protected his faculty against post-war charges of communism. Kimpton’s administration was similarly ambitious, presiding over a controversial urban renewal project in Hyde Park to boost declining enrollment.</p>

<p>Caleb Stockton Chambers was born in late 1815 or early 1816 to Arthur and Elainor Chambers. He was baptized at the Presbyterian Church of the Upper West Conogogheaue on February 25, 1816. Nothing is known of his early life, but judging from the letters in this collection, Chambers was raised in a very religious household. He later went on to college in Washington, Pennsylvania. It is unknown which college he was attending when he received these letters, as no direct mention is made, but it may have been Washington &amp; Jefferson College. The school was established in 1781 by John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith, three Presbyterian missionaries. As the most prominent college in the city and with its religious foundations, it is likely Chambers attended. </p>

<p>In 1843 the State of Illinois chartered the Chicago Mechanics' Institute, an organization devoted to providing a means of further education to "mechanics, apprentices" and other workingmen, with a view to "elevating their trade-and consequently the community-by elevating themselves." The organization flourished, building up a large membership and a large library; offered numerous lectures, and was soon expanding into larger quarters. In 1849, past President Azel Peck died, leaving a will in which he bequeathed one half the income of his real estate holdings to the Institute for the period of twenty-one years after his wife's death (Ann Peck died in 1866), following which the whole fee would devolve upon it. The use of the money was specifically directed to "the education of poor apprentices and the support of widows and children of indigent artisans and mechanics in Chicago."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Three events, however, were to set back, and almost destroy the Institute. The great financial crisis of 1857 forced the Institute to retrench; the Civil War scattered its membership; and the great Chicago fire of 1871 completed the destruction of assets and property, and dispersal of membership. Beginning in 1875 the Institute began the task of rebuilding.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Chicago Mechanics’ Institute had seventy-six students in 1890, and continued to grow. That year it also offered ten lectures on electricity and chemistry that were well attended with an average of 142 persons. By 1912, the institute had grown to 1,286 students. In a few years, the CMI offered courses on bookkeeping, shorthand, drawing, mathematics, phonography, grammar, and typewriting. It also had agreements with other schools to allow their pupils to enroll in programs they were not able to offer. In most successful cases, the institute was able to place students in jobs immediately after their training.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Chicago Mechanics’ Institute also came to recognize the importance of having skilled laborers for international competition. In 1913, a CMI pamphlet noted, “The paternal governments of Europe are doing for our competitors across the Atlantic what must be done here by the efforts of our citizens,” they went on to explain, “namely, the establishment of schools of engineering and industrial art and museums, at the industrial centres; the arranging of frequent lectures on subjects of natural science, chemistry and architecture, and placing the standard works on kindred subjects within easy reach” (Box 1, folder 11). Above all, the institute valued providing an industrial education to the people of Chicago.

Orator F. Cook was an American botanist who specialized in cotton and rubber plants, as well as in the classification of palms. Born in 1867 in Clyde, New York, Cook graduated from Syracuse University in 1890, where he stayed on as an instructor for one year. He traveled extensively in many parts of the world collecting botanical specimens, and from 1891 to 1898 he was employed as a special agent of the New York State Colonization Society. He spent much of his time in Liberia, and in 1896, Cook was elected president of Liberia College, a position, which he held until 1898. From 1898 he served as a plant scientist with the U. S. Department of Agriculture, where he became Principal Botanist. He published almost four hundred books and articles during his life, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science by Syracuse University in 1930.

<p>John Merle Coulter (1851-1928), was born in China to Presbyterian missionaries Moses and Caroline Coulter. According to official records at Hanover College and Indiana University, he received an AB (1870) and honorary PhD (1884) from Hanover College and an honorary PhD (1884) from Indiana University.</p>
<p>Coulter served as Professor of Natural Sciences at Hanover College from 1874 to 1879 and Professor of Biology at Wabash College from 1879 to 1891. From 1891 to 1893, he was President of Indiana State University, then of Lake Forest College, from 1893-1896. In 1896, he became Chair of the Botany Department at the University of Chicago, where he remained until his retirement in 1925. In retirement, Coulter worked with the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York.</p>
<p>In addition to his academic appointments, Coulter served as Assistant Geologist and Botanist for the Hayden Survey of what is now Yellowstone National Park (1872) and, in 1875, co-founded the Botanical Bulletin, soon renamed the Botanical Gazette. A staunch evolutionist and Presbyterian, he had a particular interest in the correlation of science and religion.</p>

<p>Edwin Raymond Le Count was born April 1, 1868, in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Le Count studied medicine and pathology at Carroll College in 1886-1887. Following this he attended various universities, including Rush Medical College, John Hopkins University, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and the University of Berlin. While he was raised in Wisconsin, Chicago became the city where he spent the majority of his career. In 1892, Le Count became a resident at Cook County Hospital as well as a professor of Pathology at Rush College. </p>
<p/>
<p>Le Count’s medical career extended to positions as the Attending Pathologist in Cook County Hospital, the Presbyterian Hospital, St. Luke’</p>
<p/>
<p>In 1910, Howard Taylor Ricketts, a friend and colleague of Le Count, died unexpectedly from typhus fever, which Ricketts studied. This tragic event greatly affected Le Count and his fellow academics. Le Count assisted in the organization of the Ricketts Fund meant to assist with memorial costs. </p>
<p/>
<p>In 1934, Le Count received the James E. Stacey Award for his research. Within the same year, his health began to fail. Edwin Raymond Le Count died in 1935. </p>

<p>In 1909, the Society of Medical History of Chicago was founded in "to secure and preserve matters pertaining to the history of medical institutions, organizations and individuals particularly of Chicago and the adjacent country; and to stimulate interest in medical history in general." Original members of the society's council included George H. Cleveland, Henry T. Byford, Nathan S. Davis, John Edwin Rhodes, George H. Weaver, and Ludvig Hektoen.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In its early development, the society's explicit purpose was the collection and preservation of material documenting the history of medicine in Chicago. These historical collections were built during the early 1910s through early 1920s, and included print and manuscript material, primarily related to medicine in Chicago in the mid- to late-nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1930s, the society shifted the focus of its activities to publishing, public programs and social events. The organization sponsored lectures, meetings and other events, including the annual Morris Fishbein Lecture; it published the Bulletin of the Society of Medical History of Chicago and internal newsletters. Key members of the group during the mid- to late-twentieth century included Ilza Veith, Frederick Stenn, Leo M. Zimmerman, Morris Fishbein, Allen G. Debus, James B. Herrick, William A. Pusey, Arthur F. Abt, H.W. Kienast, Joseph H. Kiefer, Walter L. Necker, George H. Coleman and William K. Beatty. In 2005, the organization was renamed the Society of Medical History and Humanities of Chicago to reflect its broader research interests. </p>

<p>William Allison Davis was born on October 14, 1902 to Gabrielle and John Davis, and was raised, along with his brother, John, and his sister, Dorothy, in Washington, D. C. Allison's father worked as an official in the Government Printing Office, and the family owned farmland in Virginia.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After attending segregated Dunbar High School, Allison Davis received his A.B. in 1924 from Williams College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated summa cum laude as class valedictorian. Davis enrolled at Harvard University in English and Comparative Literature and earned his A.M. in 1925.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 1925 to 1931, Davis served as Instructor in English at Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he developed some of his first insights into cultural and social class differences and educational efficacy. Davis concluded that what he needed most was an understanding of the "southern environment and black communities from which my students came." In 1931, Davis returned to Harvard to study social anthropology and its application to contemporary society under W. Lloyd Warner.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During his graduate career, Davis earned a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship for Foreign Study at the London School of Economics. From 1932 to 1933, Davis took part in the seminars of Bronislaw Malinowski and Launcelot Hogben in anthropology and Julian Huxley in evolutionary biology. It was during this period that Davis drafted his first significant article, "The Distribution of the Blood Groups and Its Bearing on the Concept of Race," which saw the notion of race as a predominantly cultural construct and which further undermined the biological legitimacy of the concept as applied to human beings.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Upon his return to the U.S., Davis began research in the deep South. From 1933 to 1935, through the auspices of the Rockefeller Fellowships for Field Work and the Committee of Industrial Physiology of Harvard University, Davis, along with Burleigh and Mary Gardner, conducted a multi-layered study of caste and class in Natchez, Mississippi.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Davis was joined in the field by his wife, Elizabeth Stubbs Davis, and, later, by St. Clair Drake. Elizabeth's strength as an interviewer proved especially helpful among the women of the African-American community, and, in fact, Davis would enlist her skills on several other projects in the years to come.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Field work on the project lasted two years, and another five were required to analyze the data and produce the final text. Deep South was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1941 and is today considered a classic. It argued that southern society, exemplified by the Natchez community, comprised a highly stratified class system, marked by discrete and meaningful social cliques which defined an individual's relative position in the socio-economic hierarchy. Further, Deep South argued that a color-caste system overlaid this pattern of class stratification.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1935, having completed the fieldwork for Deep South, Davis accepted a position in the anthropology department at Dillard University in New Orleans where he would become Head of the Division of Social Studies. During his tenure there, Davis also served as Director of Research (1938-1939) for a project sponsored by the American Youth Commission of the American Council on Education. This project concerned the psychological and personality development of urban black adolescents in New Orleans and Natchez. Davis, along with Yale psychologist John Dollard, sought to combine an anthropological approach with the expanding theoretical techniques of social psychology.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1939, Davis returned with Dollard to Yale as a guest of the Institute of Human Relations, where the research was put into final form. Their acclaimed Children of Bondage was published in 1940.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By this time, Davis's mentor, Lloyd Warner, had left Harvard and taken a post at the University of Chicago. In 1939, Davis decided to follow him in order to complete his doctoral degree. He did so on his second Julius Rosenwald Fellowship and as a Research Associate in the Center on Child Development. In 1942, Davis received his Ph.D. in anthropology. His dissertation, entitled "The Relation Between Color Caste and Economic Stratification in Two 'Black' Plantation Counties," was directed by Warner, Fred Eggan, and Fay-Cooper Cole and derived from his half of the Deep South data.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1937, Gunnar Myrdal had been invited by the Carnegie Corporation to direct a comprehensive, sociological study of African-American life in the United States. The outcome of that research was the authoritative work, The American Dilemma. Davis was consulted on the project and agreed to undertake a specific assignment, the production of a research memorandum on "The Negro Church and Associations in the Lower South." At the same time, he would direct the investigations of St. Clair Drake into similar institutions in Chicago. The findings documented in his 1940 memorandum were incorporated into Myrdal's final product.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During this period, Davis renewed his association with the American Council on Education, serving as a staff member of the Division on Child Development and Teacher Personnel from 1940 to 1942. Davis also briefly became the Head of the Department of Education at Atlanta University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Davis earned the admiration and respect of several key figures at the University of Chicago, Warner, Ralph Tyler, and Robert J. Havighurst among them. Yet, because of his color, Davis's appointment to the Department of Education was not easily won and ultimately required the financial intervention of the Julius Rosenwald Fund. Davis was furthermore denied faculty membership at the private Quadrangle Club until 1948. Nevertheless, in 1942 Allison Davis became the first African American to hold full faculty status with teaching duties in an American university which was not traditionally all black. He would remain at the University of Chicago through the rest of his career, achieving tenure in 1947 and full professorship in 1948, again firsts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1942, Davis, along with Havighurst, launched a study of child-rearing among black and white families from middle and lower class backgrounds in Chicago. This research eventually led Davis and his colleagues to investigate the ways in which color and class differences are reinforced in the processes of socialization and education, and it helped to inaugurate precedent-setting studies on the reliability and validity of standardized intelligence tests. In 1948, Davis delivered the Inglis lecture to the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. In it, he utilized his research to demonstrate the inabilities of such standardized intelligence tests to accurately assess the potential of lower class children.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Davis' efforts in these areas resulted in several major publications including Father of the Man (1947), co-authored with Havighurst, the Inglis lecture Social-Class Influences Upon Learning (1948), and Intelligence and Cultural Differences (1951), written with Kenneth Eells, Havighurst, Virgil Herrick, and Ralph Tyler. Davis, likewise, worked closely with his colleagues in an effort to develop their own non-biased tests. The efforts of the Davis group led many major cities and educational districts to discard their use of traditional intelligence tests.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, Davis and Robert Hess embarked on longitudinal study of adolescence and young adulthood. Working with a team of interviewers, Davis and Hess began with a cross-section of the senior class of a Chicago-area high school and re-investigated those same individuals about seven years later in 1961. Their results, published in 1963 as Achievement in Adolescence and Young Adulthood, contradicted much received knowledge about personality and ego development. Davis and Hess concluded that, while the "identity crisis" begins during adolescence, the resolution of that crisis is not achieved until early adulthood and depends upon the emergence of a strong, self-supporting ego.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1964, Davis, along with Hess and Benjamin Bloom, organized the Research Conference on Education and Cultural Deprivation at the University of Chicago. The conference was convened not only to assess and analyze the problems of education and cultural deprivation, but to conceive practical recommendations for the alleviation of those problems in educational settings.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Davis delivered notable lectures at educational institutions around the nation, including the Billings Memorial Lecture at Smith College, the Horace Mann Lecture at the University of Pittsburgh, and the Frederick Douglas Lecture at the University of Rochester. In 1970 he was appointed the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Education at the University of Chicago. And in 1971 Davis was chosen one of the "Gold Medal Educators of the 1960s" by the journal Education.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1972, Davis was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, becoming the first member chosen from the field of education. He was an active participant in the life of the academy, serving on the Committee on Memberships through 1974.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1978, after thirty-six years on the faculty, and nearly forty years of continuous association, Allison Davis retired from the University of Chicago, becoming Professor Emeritus. Despite retirement he received grants from the Spencer Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for his work on black leadership and the socially constructive use of aggression. In 1983, this work was published as Leadership, Love, and Aggression, a psycho-social study of the lives of four prominent black leaders and intellectuals: Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois, Richard Wright, and Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shortly before his death Davis was honored by a symposium at the University of Chicago, supported by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, "Race, Class, Socialization and the Life Cycle." Davis was honored by the participation of many colleagues and friends, including Robert Hess, Ralph Tyler, Robert Havighurst, John Hope Franklin, Bernice Neugarten, and Edgar Epps.

<p>Allison Davis died on November 21, 1983 at the age of eighty-one.

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Richard Robert Donnelley (1836-1899), born in Hamilton, Ontario, arrived in Chicago in 1864 to apply his trade as a journeyman printer with the firm of Church and Goodman, Steam Printers. He was an ambitious and entrepreneurial young man, and in the next several years he entered into numerous partnerships - and endured more than one bankruptcy - in the city's growing printing industry.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A major turning point in Donnelley's fortunes came in 1871. Several days after losing both his business and his home in the Great Chicago Fire, he boarded a train to New York with only a few dollars and a letter of introduction. His mission was to secure financing and purchase printing equipment to re-establish himself in the printing business.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The outcome of his trip is one of countless success stories that came in the aftermath of the Chicago Fire. In New York, Donnelley was extended credit based solely on his reputation. He purchased the most modern presses available and leased temporary space in Chicago's Loop, which was being rebuilt with unprecedented speed. In taking these steps, Richard Robert Donnelley also helped to ensure that Chicago would become the printing center of the West.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By the 1870s, Donnelley's printing firm established a reputation for quality that quickly made him one of the largest book, directory and periodical printers in the West. Another important person in this story was Donnelley's wife, Naomi Ann Shenstone Donnelley (1845-1934), who was equally determined that the family company would grow into a major force in the printing industry.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1882, Richard Robert Donnelley purchased his partners' interest in the company that was then known as Donnelley, Gassette and Loyd, and renamed it for the last time. On May 19, 1890, the enterprise was reincorporated and became "R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Donnelley added many of Chicago's most prestigious accounts to his customer list. They included the Chicago Telephone Company, Montgomery Ward and Company, Lyon and Healy, The University of Chicago, Deering Harvester Company, American Radiator Company, The Caxton Club, S.C. Griggs and Company, A.C. McClurg and Company, Herbert S. Stone, McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Marshall Field and Company, Carson Pirie Scott and Company, The Chicago Club, and many others.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley published and printed the Lakeside City Directory of Chicago in the 1870s. Richard Robert Donnelley believed, however, that publishing and printing should be managed separately, and in 1881 established the Chicago Directory Company as a distinct enterprise. In 1886, these companies undertook to produce directories for the Chicago Telephone Company. The first Chicago Telephone Directory produced by Donnelley's new firm included a classified section, a new concept in telephone directories and predecessor to what is now the Yellow Pages.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1887, Donnelley's eldest son Reuben Hamilton Donnelley (1864-1929), became manager of this publishing subsidiary, and by 1917 it was incorporated as the Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation, an independent publisher of telephone directories.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As Chicago grew in the last quarter of the 19th century, RR Donnelley grew with it. The company was among the first American printers to consolidate all aspects of the printing process under one roof. In 1897, Donnelley hired the young architect Howard Van Doren Shaw to design a new facility at the corner of Plymouth Court and Polk Street on what is now Chicago's Printing House Row. The new Plymouth Court building was fully outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment: a typesetting machine, Miehle press, perfect binder, Smythe sewing machine, and rotary press with folding delivery. This was to be the first of three manufacturing plants that Shaw would design for the company. Each time the buildings were more modern in concept and design than the printing industry had previously known.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With the death of Richard Robert Donnelley in 1899, his son Thomas E. Donnelley (1867-1955) assumed the presidency of the company. The younger Donnelley's talent as a salesman, commitment to quality craftsmanship, and vision of the future led RR Donnelley into the new century.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Among the early milestones of T.E. Donnelley's presidency was the beginning of the Lakeside Classics series in 1903. This tradition continues as an annual gift to employees, customers, and friends, and demonstrates the premier craftsmanship of the company's typographers, printers, and binders. Appropriately, the first Lakeside Classics title was the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, "patron saint" of American printers. Subsequent titles have been selected from American historical memoirs. Lakeside Classics are now highly collectible.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1908 T. E. Donnelley's quest for quality craftsmanship led to the creation of one of the first apprentice training schools in the country. Boys "of special promise and ability" were admitted to a seven-year apprenticeship consisting of "craftsmanship combined with cultural studies." In creating this school RR Donnelley established an enduring tradition of training its own craftsmen.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The company maintained a leadership role in many areas of printing throughout the first decades of the 20th century. In 1909, RR Donnelley printed architect Daniel Burnham's landmark treatise on urban planning, the Plan of Chicago. And in 1910, RR Donnelley established a long relationship with Encyclopaedia Britannica when it began work on its new Eleventh Edition. By 1912 the company had outgrown its facility on Plymouth Court. Architect Howard Van Doren Shaw was commissioned to design a new plant at Calumet Avenue and 22nd Street. Built in several phases over the course of 17 years and completed in 1929, it was considered the "largest building in the United States devoted to the production of printing." The case bindery could produce 25,000 books a day, while the mail-order bindery had a capacity of several hundred thousand catalogs and telephone books per day.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1921, a new manufacturing facility, also designed by Shaw, was opened in Crawfordsville, Indiana, to print the Indianapolis Telephone Directory. It was the first company facility outside of Chicago, and this expansion foreshadowed a long-time commitment of RR Donnelley to serve its customers better by establishing itself in proximity to them.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley also established itself as the leader in commercial graphic design and typography. In 1922 the company hired William A. Kittredge (1891-1945), one of the leading graphic artists of his time, to direct and develop the Department of Design and Typography. The department set new standards in commercial graphic design, placing RR Donnelley at the center of this important field for more than three decades.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1923 the company hired well-known British bookbinder Alfred de Sauty (1870-1949) to direct the newly formed Extra Bindery. RR Donnelley was one of the first commercial printers in America to employ a staff devoted to this old-world craft. The Extra Bindery distinguished itself in hand binding and also in graphic conservation. Notable commissions included the conservation of J.J. Audubon's folio edition of Birds of America, four of the twenty-three known copies of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence, a leaf from the Gutenberg Bible, the papers of John Quincy Adams, and correspondence of Abraham Lincoln. Fine bindings by RR Donnelley's Extra Bindery continue to be sought by collectors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, RR Donnelley sought to capture the burgeoning mass-readership book market. As part of this effort the company undertook its famous "Four American Books" project, wherein RR Donnelley published and printed limited editions of Poe's Tales, Thoreau's Walden, Dana's Two Years before the Mast, and Melville's Moby Dick. The purpose of this project was promotional - to demonstrate that American books of the highest quality could be produced entirely by an American printer using all American illustrators, typefaces, paper, and machinery. This printing of Moby Dick, illustrated by Rockwell Kent, is recognized as one of the most famous editions of this classic work. Today all four books of the series are coveted by collectors and stand as examples of the highest quality in mass-market printing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley made another indelible mark on the cultural history of Chicago when it won the contract to be the official printer of the Century of Progress Exposition in 1933. Guidebooks, post cards, brochures, programs, and other printed material for the world's fair were integral to one of the most important expositions of modern design.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley pioneered the fields of industrial engineering research and development in the printing industry. An example of the company's emphasis on technology was the development of heat-set printing in 1936, which was essential in the production of a new weekly news magazine, Henry Luce's Life. For the first time a high-quality illustrated weekly periodical could be produced on high-speed web-fed presses. The close relationship between RR Donnelley and Life, whose circulation grew as no magazine before, was demonstrated again in 1946 when the company began construction of a second Chicago manufacturing facility, South Plant, devoted entirely to the production, printing, and distribution of the nation's greatest illustrated magazine.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Charles C. Haffner, Jr., (1895-1979), son-in-law of T.E. Donnelley, was named Chairman of the Board in 1952, and headed the company through its period of post-war growth. Recognizing the need for substantial capitalization, Haffner presided over the company's first public offering in 1956. Haffner discussed the move in terms of a long-time fundamental commitment: "Growth is basic at Donnelley's, for we believe that a business that is not growing is already beginning to decay."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the decades that followed, RR Donnelley experienced expansion that assured its leadership in the world printing market. New manufacturing plants were opened in Willard, Ohio (1956); Warsaw, Indiana (1958); Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with the purchase of Rudisill Printing Company (1959); Old Saybrook, Connecticut (1960); Mattoon, Illinois (1967); Dwight, Illinois (1968); Glasgow, Kentucky (1970); Gallatin, Tennessee (1975); Harrisonburg, Virginia (1979); and Spartanburg, South Carolina (1979).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During these years major contracts were signed or renewed with National Geographic Society; Time, Inc.; Sears, Roebuck and Company; J.C. Penney; New Yorker Magazine, Inc.; Lane Publishing, Inc.; Condé Nast; Cowles Communication, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., and many other important publishing concerns.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gaylord Donnelley (1910-1992), second son of T. E. Donnelley, became Chairman of the Board in 1964. His long career in the family business began in 1927 as an apprentice. Gaylord Donnelley subsequently held many positions with the company, and he chronicled his career with the company upon his retirement as Chairman in 1975 with the publication of a richly personal memoir, To Be A Good Printer. In it he wrote: "It seems abundantly clear that the philosophy, policies, standards, and practices that have evolved during the history of our company have now as much value as ever, possibly more. While we have held to them firmly, we have also adapted them as needed to the ever-changing scene in our industry and society."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s RR Donnelley engineers once again made history when they developed Selectronic ink-jet printing and binding. This technology made it possible for publishers to selectively control the editorial and advertising content of each copy of a periodical edition based on subscriber profile.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1975, Charles W. Lake, Jr. (b.1918) became the first person outside the Donnelley family to be named Chairman of the Board. Charles Lake had been Director of Engineering and Research Development, a position he assumed in 1956, and his focus on technology blended perfectly with the company tradition of excellence. "Our Company has earned its reputation as 'The House that Quality Built' on the strength of the quality we put into every step of every operation," Mr. Lake said in a 1966 speech. "The future success of our business will depend on how well we maintain and improve our reputation for total quality."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1978 RR Donnelley simultaneously became a coast-to-coast and worldwide printing concern when it expanded into Los Angeles, California and York, England. One year later, in 1980, RR Donnelley reached the billion-dollar mark in annual sales. Two years later the company began satellite transmission between the United States and the United Kingdom. RR Donnelley was the first printing company to utilize this technology, and the trans-oceanic link placed the company at the center of the highly competitive financial and legal printing market. In 1983 the Financial Printing Services Group was created in response to this growth, and in 1984 the satellite network was extended to the Far East.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the early 1980s RR Donnelley's Technical Documentation Services began serving the personal computer industry, reproducing software, and printing user manuals. RR Donnelley expanded its range in this international market with a new plant in Singapore to serve the Far East.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>John B. Schwemm (b. 1934) served as Chairman of the Board from 1983-1988. "Quality," said Schwemm, "should characterize our manufacturing methods. Quality should be evident in the people we hire and in the training we give them. And, quality should be exercised at all levels of management. We must use great care so as not to give less attention to the foundation of quality than did our predecessors." In 1987, under Schwemm's leadership, RR Donnelley acquired Metromail Corporation, a provider of list and list enhancement services.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1983 RR Donnelley's Financial Printing Services Group undertook the mammoth printing contract associated with the ATandT divestiture prospectus. It was the largest financial printing, binding, and distribution job of its time, with 3.6 million copies. In the 1980s, the Financial Printing Services Group opened offices in Paris, Seoul, Mexico City, and Hong Kong to serve the financial documentation needs of multinational corporations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The ability to anticipate future needs of its customers always has been an RR Donnelley strength. As the company moved into electronic communication, mailing and distribution, database and list management, and other auxiliary services, it became a leader in diverse aspects of tomorrow's communications technology.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1989 John R. Walter (b. 1947) became the seventh Chairman of the Board. Shortly after assuming the position, he discussed RR Donnelley's future and outlined the company's three key priorities: 1) To establish, communicate and manage the strategic vision, direction and plan; 2) to make decisions on the intelligent investment of our capital for a long-term return; 3) to continue to identify and develop the people who will successfully lead this company into the 21st century.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RR Donnelley expanded to Mexico in 1989 when ground was broken for a new book printing plant in Reynosa. In 1990 RR Donnelley made its largest ($550 million) acquisition to date by purchasing Meredith/Burda, a major catalog and magazine printer with operations throughout the U.S.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1992 the company relocated its corporate headquarters to The RR Donnelley Building at 77 West Wacker Drive. This move consolidated many corporate functions under one roof and placed RR Donnelley in the heart of Chicago's business district.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the early twenty-first century, RR Donnelley is a Fortune 500 company, and among the world's leading providers of printing and print-related services to publishers, manufacturers, retailers, financial institutions and technology companies.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Everett Cherrington Hughes was born on November 30, 1897. He was the son of a
Methodist Episcopal minister who believed firmly in the equality of Black and
white people, advocated for education, and disapproved of drinking, card playing and
dancing. Many members of the Hughes family had attended college at Ohio
Wesleyan, and Everett did as well beginning at the age of 16. Hughes received
his B.A. from Ohio Wesleyan in 1918.</p>
<p>After graduation Hughes taught English to the workers of the Wisconsin Steel Works
at Chicago. It was here as Hughes worked with immigrant factory workers that he
was made aware of the importance of ethnic identity. From there he worked for
Upper Peninsula Industrial Relations Association in Escanaba, Michigan from
1920-1922. Hughes then was awarded a Centenary Fund grant from the Methodist
Church with which he studied the community of Pullman, Illinois, under the
guidance of Garrett Theological Seminary. </p>
<p>In the fall of 1923 Everett Hughes enrolled at the University of Chicago as a
graduate student in sociology and anthropology. Hughes studied under Robert E.
Park, Ernest W. Burgess, Ellsworth Faris, Robert Redfield, Ruth Shonle Cavan,
Nels Anderson, and other noted scholars. He maintained his residence in Pullman
and found a job as the director of Mark White Square Park for the South Park
Commission. This job provided Hughes with a rich location to do sociological
research. He took students there to do field work and produced a study on the
police for Ernest W. Burgess. </p>
<p>In 1925 he met Helen Gregory MacGill and they were married in August of 1927.
Helen became an active partner in many of Hughes's projects. </p>
<p>Just before completing his dissertation in 1927 Hughes was offered a position at
McGill University in Montreal with Carl A. Dawson, another University of Chicago
graduate. At this time McGill University was the only university in Canada to
offer a program in sociology, and Dawson and Hughes became the first two members
of that department. Hughes received his Ph.D. degree in 1928. His dissertation,
The Growth of an Institution: The Chicago Real Estate Board was first published
in 1931 by the Society of Social Research of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Hughes established his research interests in the fields of race and ethnic
relations, industrialization, and occupations. In 1931-1932 Hughes was the
recipient of a Social Science Research Council Fellowship to Germany to study
the Catholic labor movement in the Rhineland. He planned his research in Germany
to complement his work on French Canada. In the late 1930s he and Helen did a
study of the change in a French Canadian town as it industrialized under English
Canadian management. Just as the research on this project was completed, Everett
Hughes was offered an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago in
1938. Hughes accepted the job and French Canada in Transition was eventually
published in 1943.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hughes remained at the University of Chicago until 1961. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1943, and professor in 1949. He served as chairman of the
Department of Sociology between1952 and 1956. During World War II he became a
member of the Committee on Human Relations in Industry along with George Brown,
Allison Davis, Burleigh B. Gardner, Frederick Harbison, Robert J. Havighurst,
Neil Jacoby, W. Lloyd Warner, and William Foote Whyte. The Committee was a
business and academic partnership to study industrial society. A few
corporations supported the Committee to achieve its research. Industry and
Society was published in 1946 and Hughes's contribution was chapter 6, "Race
Relations in Industry." Hughes published other books and articles in the 1940s
and 1950s reflecting his continuing work in the areas of race relations,
professions, and occupations. Some of these publications includes: Where Peoples
Meet: Racial and Ethnic Frontiers, (1952) by Everett C. Hughes and Helen M.
Hughes; Men and Their Work, (1958); and Twenty Thousand Nurses Tell Their Story:
A Report on Studies of Nursing Functions Sponsored by the American Nurses'
Association by Everett C. Hughes, Helen M. Hughes, and Irwin Deutscher,
(1958).</p>
<p>During his tenure at the University of Chicago Hughes's activities show
evidence of his commitment to Robert Park as a mentor and his training at the
University of Chicago as a sociologist. He revived Robert Parks's course on race
relations and transformed it into a course on the African novel that he began to
teach at Brandeis University in 1961. Hughes was also a member of the Committee
on Education, Training, and Research in Race Relations with Louis Wirth, Robert
Redfield, Fred Eggan, Sol Tax, Allison Davis, Ralph W. Tyler, and Frederick
Harbison. He participated in the efforts to aid German universities after the
war through the University of Chicago's Committee for Aid to German and Austrian
Scholars. He held visiting professorships at Frankfurt University through the
exchange program in the years 1948, 1953, and 1958. His article "Good People and
Dirty Work" came from his first tour there in 1948. Hughes also continued to
develop courses in field training for sociologists. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Hughes became a member of the Committee on Human Development and
began to take a more active interest in the sociology of education. Through this
committee he established ties to Kansas City, where the committee had been doing
research. Hughes began working with professors at the University of Kansas
Medical School in 1952. The study of the Medical School developed into a study
of the undergraduate college with the encouragement of Dean George R. Waggoner.
The two monographs that resulted from these studies were Boys in White by Howard
S. Becker, Blanche Geer, Everett Hughes, and Anselm Strauss, (1961), and Making
the Grade by Howard S, Becker, Blanche Geer, and Everett Hughes, (1968). Hughes
carried on his involvement with medical education when he joined the American
Medical Association's Citizens Commission on Graduate Medical Education from
1963 to 1967.</p>
<p>As the studies at the University of Kansas were underway, Hughes moved to Boston
and began teaching at Brandeis University in 1961. During this same academic
year he served as president of the American Sociological Association.</p>
<p>Still in contact with many colleagues in Canada, Hughes received an invitation to
propose a study to the Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and
Biculturalism in 1963. This commission was appointed by the Canadian Government
to study ways in which to cauterize the crises between French and English
Canadians. By this time his book French Canada in Transition had long been a
classic text in Canadian sociology. In 1965 he took leave from Brandeis
University for a year and accepted a joint visiting professorship at McGill
University and the Université de Montréal. During this year he
taught and pursued a project approved by the Royal Commission using students
from both universities to assist in the fieldwork. His final report "Career
Patterns of Young Montrealers in Certain White Collar Occupations," was
completed but never published.</p>
<p>In 1968, Hughes moved his activities to Boston College after becoming an emeritus
at Brandeis. He taught at Boston College until he gained emeritus status there
in 1976. During the 1970s Hughes enjoyed advising students from both Brandeis
University and Boston College. He also participated in another study funded by
the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, Education for the Professions of
Medicine, Law, Theology, and Social Welfare, by Everett C. Hughes, Barrie
Thorne, and Agostino M. De Baggis, (1973).</p>
<p>Everett Cherrington Hughes died in Boston on January 4, 1983, at the age of
86.</p>

<p>Edward Morris was President of Morris &amp; Company, one of the three main meat-packing companies in Chicago at a time when that city was known as the meatpacking capital of the world. Upon his death, Morris was said to have amassed a personal fortune of $40 million.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Morris was born in Chicago on October 1, 1866. His father, Nelson Morris, founded Morris &amp; Co. Edward was educated in Chicago public schools, and his natural aptitude and interest in his father's business led him to begin spending time there at age 14. In 1890, Morris married Helen Swift, a daughter of one of his two main competitors. The couple had four children, Nelson II, Edward, Jr., Ruth, and Muriel. Muriel Morris Gardner later became a renowned psychiatrist.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Edward Morris' professional interests extended beyond meatpacking. He was the largest individual stockholder in several of Chicago's largest financial institutions. He was a director of the First National bank, the National Livestock Bank, and the National Packing Company. He also personally managed the finances of Morris &amp; Company.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A shrewd businessman, Morris cooperated with his two main competitors, Armour and Swift, to their mutual benefit. The three began proceedings around the turn of the century to combine their assets and form the National Packing Company. Muckraker Charles Edward Russell's 1905 book on the existence of a "beef trust," The Greatest Trust in the World, spurred the federal government to begin antitrust proceedings. Morris and his colleagues were not indicted on antitrust charges, but they voluntarily dissolved the National Packing Company in 1912. Morris and his employees clashed on issues of wages and working conditions, but at the time of his funeral, the Morris family hosted a two-hour reception for company employees in their home.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Morris died in 1913 after a prolonged battle with kidney disease. In 1917 his widow Helen married Francis Nielson, a journalist, and in 1920 she helped to fund Nielson’s short-lived publication, The Freeman. Helen also became a significant donor to the University of Chicago Library.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The architect of the Edward Morris House was Howard Van Doren Shaw. Shaw designed twenty-one homes in the Hyde Park and Kenwood areas. A native of Chicago's South Side, Shaw was born in 1869. He returned to his hometown after attending Yale and M.I.T. and traveling to Europe. Many critics believe that Shaw’s exposure to European design inspired his unique interpretation of the Beaux Arts and Arts and Crafts movements that dominated residential design at the turn of the century. Edward Morris represented a typical member of Shaw's client base, which generally consisted of members of Chicago's growing mercantile and industrialist elites. The Morris House was completed in 1913, the year of Edward Morris' death. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Morris House landscape plan is believed to have been designed by Rose Standish Nichols, one of the first American women to become a professional landscape designer. Nichols was a resident of the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. Many of her projects are now recorded in the Archives of American Gardens of the Smithsonian Institution. She wrote three books and numerous articles on European landscape design. One of the founding members of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom, Nichols never married, instead devoting her personal life to the suffragist and international pacifist movements.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. Einstein grew up in Munich, and was educated initially at a Catholic elementary school (though the Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews) and continued his education at the Luitpold Gymnasium until he left Germany seven years later. After failing the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (though receiving exceptional marks in the physics and mathematics portions of the exam), Einstein completed his secondary schooling at the Argovian cantonal school in Switzerland. He went on to gain entrance into the Zurich Polytechnic at the age of seventeen (1896), and graduated with his teaching diploma in 1900. It was there that Einstein also met his future wife, Mileva Maric. </p>
<p/>
<p>After his schooling, Einstein worked in a Swiss patent office until 1908. In 1905 Einstein completed his thesis and was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich, and, that same year, published four groundbreaking papers in the Annalen der Physik journal. As a result, 1905 is often referred to as Einstein’s “annus mirabilis,” or “miracle year.” In 1908, he was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Bern, associated professor in 1909, full professor at the Chrles-Ferdinand University in 1911, professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich from 1912-1914, and finally the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and professor at Humboldt University of Berlin in 1914 in his native Germany. In 1916, he became the president of the German Physical Society. </p>
<p/>
<p>Einstein’s genius earned his great admiration around the world, confirmed by his travels abroad in the early 1920s. In 1921, Einstein delivered a series of lectures on the theory of relativity at the University of Chicago. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the early 1930s, Einstein travelled to the United States. Upon learning of the Nazi’s rise to power in Germany, Einstein knew he would be unable to return to his homeland. After renouncing his German citizenship, he took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His affiliation with the organization would last until his death in 1955. </p>
<p/>
<p>Because of his knowledge of physics, Einstein took a particular political interest in the dangers of nuclear weaponry. It is suggested that it was Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt, warning of the dangers of a nuclear-armed Germany, which urged the U.S. to engage in its own nuclear research. Einstein was also a committed antiracist and joined the NAACP in Princeton. As the years progressed, Einstein became involved in a number of political and social issues, writing papers critical of capitalism and becoming involved in Zionist movements. Einstein was granted U.S. citizenship on 1940. </p>
<p/>
<p>Einstein died on April 17, 1955, from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. </p>

<p>Alfred Edwards Emerson was born in Ithaca, New York on December 31, 1896. He was also educated in Ithaca, receiving his B.S. (1918), M.A. (1920), and Ph.D (1925) from Cornell University. His first teaching appointment was as associate professor of zoology at the University of Pittsburgh (1925-1929). In 1929 he accepted a position as associate professor of zoology at the University of Chicago where he remained until his retirement in 1962; he achieved the rank of full professor in 1934. During his tenure at the University of Chicago, Prof. Emerson also held visiting appointments at the University of California at Berkeley (summer 1949) and Michigan State University (spring 1960), where he was awarded an honorary Sc.D. Emerson had two children by his first wife, Winifred Jelliffe, who died in 1949. His second wife, Eleanor Fish, died in 1971.</p>
<p>At the University of Chicago, Emerson was a central figure in what became known as the "Chicago school" of ecology. Along with Warder Clyde Allee and Thomas Park, with whom he co-authored the groundbreaking Principles of Animal Ecology (1949), Emerson developed a model of biological evolution in which the social group, rather than the individual organism, constitutes a superorganism that is the primary unit of natural selection. This model represents competition, both within and between species, as operative at multiple levels within a total ecological system, generating either cooperation or conflict.</p>
<p>Emerson's contribution to the "Chicago school" of ecology was based on his extensive research on termite physiological morphology and behavior. Using behavior traits, such as geographically specific nest building techniques, as indices of sub-speciation among termites, Emerson not only helped to elaborate termite taxonomy to a high degree of precision, but discovered evidence of a link between social and biological evolution. As a result of his research on termites, Emerson came to view reproductive behavior and division of labor as the fundamental group adaptations responsible for processes of social evolution, analogous in function to physiological adaptations in processes of biological evolution. Emerson further theorized that the social evolution of superorganisms tends toward greater overall efficiency and total ecological homeostasis or equilibrium.</p>
<p>Emerson also sought to interpret the implications of his work on the relationship between social and biological evolution for human social ethics. During World War II, Emerson spoke out against the misuse of Darwin's doctrine of the survival of the fittest as justification for nationalist aggression and totalitarian domination of the weak by the strong. He argued that cooperation more often than struggle is the key to survival and well-being among humans as well as other social animals. He did not idealize cooperation, however, as an end in itself, but formulated a relativistic natural ethics according to which the good and the right are those things and actions that function to promote "efficient homeostasis for all concerned."</p>
<p>In addition to teaching and prolific publication, Emerson conducted extensive field research abroad and participated in many scientific organizations. He traveled widely in search of termite populations for study, visiting Central and South America, numerous Caribbean and Pacific islands, and parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. He was a central figure in the Ecological Society of American, serving as Secretary-Treasurer in 1931, editor of Ecology from 1932 to 1939, and president in 1941. Emerson was also a member of the Society for Systematic Zoology of which he was president in 1958, and a co-organizer of the Society for the Study of Evolution, which he served as president in 1960. Alfred E. Emerson died on October 3, 1976.</p>

<p>The Encyclopaedia Britannica was founded in 1788 by a “Society of Gentlemen in Scotland.” It became the property of Sears, Rosebuck &amp; Co. in 1920 under Julius Rosenwald. Though offered in February 1943 to the University of Chicago, it was instead personally acquired by the University’s vice president, William Benton. The University’s faculty became involved with the production of the Encyclopaedia, including Chancellor Robert M.

<p>Lloyd Ashton Fallers, Jr., generally called Tom, was born in Nebraska City, Nebraska, on August 29, 1925, the son of Lloyd A. Fallers and Fannie Lincoln. He graduated from East High School, Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1943. After spending a year at the University of Utah (1943-1944) and a year at Deep Springs College (1944-1945) Fallers came to the University of Chicago in the fall of 1945 and completed his Ph.B. degree in 1946.</p>
<p>Arriving at the University of Chicago, Fallers had intended to study medicine but found that his interests gravitated towards the study of society. Pursuing these growing interests he began to study anthropology. Fallers conducted anthropological field work under the direction of Sol Tax for four months in Iowa during 1948, and this research formed the basis of his master's thesis on "The Role of Factionalism in Fox Acculturation." He was awarded an A.M. degree in anthropology in 1949.</p>
<p>In 1949 Fallers married Margaret Chave who was also a graduate student teaching in the College. In autumn 1949 Fallers attended the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Scholarship to study with Audrey Richards, Raymond Firth, Daryll Forde, and Edmund Leach. Richards had recruited Fallers for study in Africa on a visit to the University of Chicago. On Richards' recommendation as director of the East African Institute of Social Research, Fallers was awarded a Colonial Social Science Research Council fellowship to help her establish the Institute in Kampala, British Protectorate of Uganda. In 1950 Fallers left for East Africa and, as a fellow of the East African Institute, conducted a study of the Busoga. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1952. During the course of the following year, Fallers, acting as an instructor in the Department of Anthropology, worked on his dissertation with Robert Redfield, Fred Eggan, and Lloyd Warner. Fallers was awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1953.</p>
<p>In his dissertation, entitled "Bantu Bureaucracy: A Study of Role Conflict and Institutional Change in the Soga Political System," Fallers investigated the role of the headman in village life and the ways in which change in the wider colonial political system had influenced this role. In doing so, he addressed how the indigenous Busoga political institutions and the British administrative structure had come to form a single institutional complex.</p>
<p>Later Fallers expanded his thesis, and published it in revised form under the title Bantu Bureaucracy: A Study of Integration and Conflict in the Political System of an East African People (1956). The material which Fallers collected, somewhat incidentally while he was doing research, about Busoga law and</p>
<p> courts was presented much later in his Law without Precedent: Legal Ideas in Action in Courts of Colonial Busoga (1969).</p>
<p>In 1953 Fallers went to Princeton for one year as a lecturer in anthropology. The following year he returned to Uganda. As Uganda was preparing for self rule, Fallers acted as the Senior Research Officer at the East African Institute before being appointed Richards' successor as Director of the Institute at the beginning of 1956. There Fallers worked with, among others, J. La Fontaine, Priscilla Reining, Aidan Southall, Martin Southwold, Derrick Stenning, and J. W. Tyler. It was during this period that Fallers conducted research into the leadership and political institutions of Buganda (1954-1957). Fallers' work formed the core of his edited volume entitled The King's Men: Leadership and Status in Buganda on the Eve of Independence (1964), which was part of a larger project on the study of leadership financed by the Carnegie Corporation.</p>
<p>Fallers, returning to the United States in 1957, was appointed Assistant Professor and subsequently Associate Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He spent 1958-1959 at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto in the company of Clifford Geertz, Fred Eggan, David Apter, Meyer Fortes, Raymond Firth, and Morris Janowitz. In 1960 Fallers returned to the University of Chicago as an Associate Professor of Anthropology. Fallers was appointed Professor at the beginning of 1964 and for the year 1967-1968 was the first recipient of the Henry Schultz Rotating Research Professorship in the Social Sciences. In 1970 Fallers was given a joint appointment to the departments of anthropology and sociology, and in 1972 he was named the A. A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor.</p>
<p>On his arrival at the University in 1960 Fallers played a central role in founding the Committee for the Comparative Study of New Nations, which was established to encourage the comparative analysis of the social, political, administrative, cultural, and economic changes associated with the development of new states in Africa and Asia. On July 1, 1970, Fallers succeeded Clifford Geertz as the chairman of the committee. Fallers was also active in the Committee on African Studies and in the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The various interests Fallers developed while participating in the academic life of the University were used, by him, to thematically draw together a collection of previously published essays in Inequality: Social Stratification Reconsidered (1973). These interests also formed the basis of his edited volume Immigrants and Associations (1967).</p>
<p>Throughout his career Fallers was actively engaged in a large number of projects which extended beyond the immediate University community. In 1958 Fallers participated in the Ford Foundation's Review of African Studies Programs in the United States. Then in 1961 Fallers was appointed Associate Editor for Anthropology for the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, a project in which he was actively engaged throughout the decade. During 1962-1963 Fallers, Kwamena Bentsi-Enchill, Denis Cowen, and Allison Dunham formed the commission on land tenure for the government of Basutoland which was funded by the Ford Foundation. This was a team of University of Chicago professors who were invited to make recommendations to the government regarding land tenure and land law. In recognition of his wide scholarly contributions Fallers was elected to the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences in 1972.</p>
<p>While developing his interests in the problems of modernization Fallers began, in the early 1960s, to conduct preparatory research on Turkey and in 1964 conducted field research in Konya, Turkey. In 1968 Fallers, accompanied by his wife, went to Edremit, Turkey, for one year to analyze the function of a small community in the operation of the larger national society. He returned to Edremit in 1971, but this stint of research was cut short when he had to return to Chicago after fracturing his elbow. Earlier Fallers had been successfully treated for a brain tumor. Now medical examinations revealed his cancer had reappeared. Fallers' condition deteriorated, and he died on July 4, 1974.</p>
<p>Fallers' last book, The Social Anthropology of the Modern Nation-State (1974), was based on the Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures which he gave at the University of Rochester in April 1971. In these lectures he compared the situations of East Africa and Turkey, crystallizing much of what he had learned about modernization and social change. This book was published posthumously.</p>

<p>Shirley Farr was born in 1851. A member of a prominent Chicago family, she received a Ph.B in 1904 from the University of Chicago. While a student Farr lived in Beecher Hall and was a member of the Women Students Christian League. After graduation, Farr served as an associate professor of history and French at Ripon College, where she later accepted a position on the board of trustees and became a major donor. Farr served as an assistant in history (1914-1917), a half-time Instructor in History (1929-1934), and a departmental counselor (1929-1934) at the University of Chicago.
</p>

<p>Fred Eggan was born in Seattle, Washington on September 12, 1906. His parents, Alfred J. and Olive Smith Eggan, later relocated to Lake Forest, Illinois, a north suburb of Chicago.</p>
<p>In 1923 Eggan came to the University of Chicago as an undergraduate and continued on to earn an M.A. in psychology with a minor in anthropology in 1928. His master's thesis was entitled "An Experimental Study of Attitudes toward Race and Nationality." From 1928 to 1930 he taught psychology, sociology, and history at Wentworth Junior College and Military Academy in Missouri. During this interval he maintained his connection with the University of Chicago by working summers with Fay-Cooper Cole at Native American archaeological sites in Illinois.</p>
<p>In 1930 Eggan returned to the University of Chicago as a doctoral student in anthropology, completing his dissertation in 1933. Following post-doctoral field research in the Philippines he assumed an instructorship at the university, part-time for the Extension program and part-time for the Department of Anthropology. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1940 and associate professor in 1948. Not long after his promotion to associate professor he received a full professorship. He chaired the Department of Anthropology from 1948 to 1952 and again from 1961 to 1963. He was appointed the Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology in 1963.</p>
<p>Eggan is credited with having achieved a synthesis between the British and American schools of anthropological study. The British school, as exemplified by Eggan's first mentor A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, was then dominated by the synchronic analysis of the function of cultural institutions. In contrast, American anthropologists, including Eggan's teachers Fay-Cooper Cole and Robert Redfield, focused on processes of diachronic culture change. Eggan united these two perspectives by attending to both structure and history using a method of analysis he called "controlled comparison." Based on results achieved by this method, Eggan's most important publication, Social Organization of the Western Pueblos, hypothesized that variations in the social structures of linguistically and culturally related Native American groups were the result of the varied historical circumstances experienced by each group. By applying this same method in his later work on the impact of modernity and Western culture on indigenous Philippine groups, Eggan formulated an inverse corollary: that differing social structures cause different linguistic and cultural groups to respond differently to the same historical circumstances. These insights concerning the interdependence of social structures and historical processes remain at the forefront of contemporary anthropological theory.</p>
<p>When Eggan enrolled as a graduate student in 1930, the Department of Anthropology had just become independent from the Department of Sociology, with Fay-Cooper Cole, Edward Sapir, and Robert Redfield as the core faculty. Sapir soon left the department and was replaced by A. R. Radcliffe-Brown in 1931. Eggan became Radcliffe-Brown's first research assistant in 1931-1932 and began research on kinship and social organization of northern Native American tribes. Under Radcliffe-Brown, Eggan completed a report on the southeast, plains and southwestern tribes.</p>
<p>Eggan continued field research on native North America in 1932 when he was awarded a Laboratory of Anthropology Field Training Fellowship to support his work on the Hopi Indian reservation in Arizona. There he met Don Talayesva, an informant with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. Eggan based his doctoral dissertation, which he completed in 1933, on research from this field work. Social Organization of the Western Pueblos, published in 1950 by the University of Chicago Press, represents a substantially revised version of this work. Eggan balanced his studies of the southwest with his later work on the Philippines, returning to the Southwest almost every year until he retired.</p>
<p>While waiting for final arrangements for a two-year post-doctoral fellowship in Australia, Eggan resumed field study among the Hopi at Oraibi and Second Mesa, Arizona. It was at this time, in the winter of 1933-1934, that Eggan began an association with John Collier and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Collier invited Eggan to participate in a conference between the Bureau and the Navajo regarding sheep reduction and soil conservation. Later in his career, Eggan continued his involvement with the Bureau, serving as an expert witness in Southwestern Native American land claim cases.</p>
<p>Returning to Chicago in the spring of 1934, Eggan learned that funds he was slated to receive could no longer cover the cost of field research in Australia. As an alternative, he arranged to go to the Philippines. Fay-Cooper Cole had worked there under the auspices of the Field Museum in 1907-1908, and wanted Eggan to record changes in Tinguian culture since the time of his original research.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s Eggan developed his field material from North America and published on the Hopi, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Choctaw. In 1941 he completed his first work on the Philippines, "Some Aspects of Cultural Change in the Northern Philippines." In 1938 he married Dorothy Way who was to become an anthropologist of the Hopi and Eggan's professional partner. A. R. Radcliffe-Brown left the University of Chicago for Oxford in 1937. In honor of his departure, Eggan edited Social Anthropology of North American Tribes.</p>
<p>In 1941-1942 Eggan's earlier acquaintance with John Collier led to participation in a pilot study on food and nutrition in the Southwest among Native American and Spanish-American communities. Graduate students conducted the research for this project under the direction of Eggan and Michael Pijoan, M.D. In October of 1942 Eggan was called to Washington to work for the Board of Economic Warfare. Three months later he was Chief of Research in the Office of Special Services for the Philippine government in exile. While carrying out research requested by President Quezon at the Library of Congress, Eggan again worked with Filipinos he had met on his first trip to the Philippines in the mid 1930s . After six months in this capacity, he attended the School for Military Government at Charlottesville, Virginia in preparation for setting up the Civil Affairs Training Program for the Far East at the University of Chicago. Eggan, as a Captain in the army, then returned to the University of Chicago to direct the Program from August 1943 to August 1945.</p>
<p>During and after World War II, Eggan's interests focused on the Philippines, although he still published on Native American subjects. Financed by a Fulbright grant, Fred and Dorothy Eggan spent the year 1949-1950 at the University of the Philippines. In 1953 Eggan won a Guggenheim Fellowship to further his work on the Sagada Igorots. That same year the Philippine Studies Program at the University of Chicago began operations. Eggan established the Philippine Studies Program with money from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and directed the program until 1977.</p>
<p>In 1958-1959 Eggan was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California. At the Center, among other projects, he prepared a report on the social and ceremonial organization of the Sagada Igorots.</p>
<p>After the early 1960s Eggan concentrated his efforts on teaching. In 1961 he participated in the first Peace Corps training program at Pennsylvania State University for the Bikol region and Bisayas in the Philippines. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1963. In 1965 his wife Dorothy died.</p>
<p>Four years later Eggan married his second wife, Joan Rosenfeld. In 1970 Eggan was a visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He retired from teaching at the University in 1974, but stayed on to manage the final projects of the Philippine Studies Program until 1977. He made his last visit to the Philippines in 1975. Late in 1986 he and his wife, Joan, moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he continued work until his death in 1991.</p>

<p>Henry Gordon Gale was born September 12, 1874 in Aurora, Illinois. His father, Eli Holbrook Gale, was a physician trained at University of Pennsylvania. Henry Gale's mother, Adelaide Parker Gale, died six weeks after his birth. He was then raised by his maternal grandparents in rural Illinois.</p>
<p>Gale received his A.B. degree from the University of Chicago in 1896. He continued on to a Ph.D. in Physics in 1899, joining the Faculty in the Department of Physics that same year. He obtained full professorship in 1916 and retired in 1940.</p>
<p>During his career at the University of Chicago, Gale held a number of administrative offices. He served as Dean of the Colleges from 1908 to1922, Dean of the Ogden Graduate School of Science from 1922 to1930, and Dean of the Division of the Physical Sciences from 1931 to 1940. Gale was Chairman of the Department of Physics from 1925 to 1940 and Editor of the Astrophysical Journal from 1912 to 1940. He held the office of president of the Physics Club of Chicago from 1931 until 1940, and was given honorary lifetime membership in the organization upon his retirement. Gale was widely published in the field of astrophysics; with Robert A. Millikan, he co-authored textbooks for high school and college physics courses.</p>
<p>While his career as an astrophysicist was centered at the University of Chicago, Gale also conducted research at Mount Wilson Solar Observatory in Pasadena, California. While working in Pasadena in 1909, Gale was involved in an electrical accident which left him badly burned; he was hospitalized for two months to undergo skin graft operations.</p>

<p>The Dean of Rockefeller Memorial Chapel and representative of the University of Chicago, Charles W. Gilkey was born in Massachusetts on 3 July 1882. His parents were James H. Gilkey, and Mary Lottie Johnson. Gilkey's brother James Gordon also entered the ministry and became a reverend.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Educated in the United States, Gilkey also pursued graduated studies in Europe:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Harvard, A.B. 1903, A.M. 1904
</p>
<p>Union Theological Seminary, B.D., 1908

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1910 the Hyde Park Baptist Church ordained Gilkey as their pastor and he remained there for 18 years. He married Geraldine Brown, a graduate of the University of Chicago (1911) on 26 July 1915. Together they had a daughter, Mary Jane, and a son, Langdon Brown. The family lived in Hyde Park, Chicago during the school year and summered in Maine.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gilkey acted as a Trustee of the University of Chicago from 1919-1929. In 1928 he accepted the position of Dean of the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel of the University, which he would hold until 1947. Gilkey aimed to make Rockefeller Chapel a place of multi-denominational worship with a strong core of participants. This was a difficult task, he admitted, because the students stayed at the university only four years.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gilkey also served as the Associate Dean of the Divinity School and represented the University in the position of the "Professor of Preaching of the University of Chicago Divinity School" at Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Chicago, Toronto, Wellesley, Stanford, Purdue, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of Washington. The University appointed Gilkey the Barrows Lecturer to India, 1924-1925
</p>

</p>
<p>Geraldine devoted herself to the YWCA as the national president and served as the vice-president of the United Council of Church Women in addition to opening the Gilkey home to students at the University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gilkey announced his retirement in June 1947. The Gilkey's retired to Massachusetts from which they continued to travel and lecture. A student scholarship, the "Charles and Geraldine Gilkey Fund" was established to honor him and his wife. Mr. Gilkey passed away in Massachusetts in March 1968.

<p>Langdon Brown Gilkey (b. 1919 and d. 2004) was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Rev. Charles W. Gilkey (1882-1968), was chaplain of the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel on the campus of the University of Chicago and Associate Dean of the Divinity School. Langdon Gilkey acquired his A.B. from Harvard University in 1940 and a joint Ph.D. from Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary in 1954. Gilkey taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York from 1949 to 1950, Vassar College from 1951 to 1954, and Vanderbilt University from 1954 to 1963. In July 1963 he was appointed to the faculty of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago. After his retirement in 1989, Gilkey taught periodically at the University of Virginia and Georgetown University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 1940 to 1942, Gilkey taught at Yenching University (now part of Peking University) in Beijing, China, which was then occupied by the Japanese. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States and Japan formally entered in to war, and Gilkey was interned along with other Allied civilians by the Japanese in the Weihsien Internment Camp in Shandong, China from 1943 until the end of the war; this act may be seen as a retaliation to the forceful relocation of Japanese Americans by the United States. Gilkey discussed the formative impact of this experience in Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure (1968), and he revisited the compound in 1995.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A prominent American Protestant Theologian, Langdon Gilkey authored fifteen books and several hundred scholarly articles during his career. He systematically outlined his theology in three major works: Naming the Whirlwind: The Renewal of God-Language (1969), Repeating the Whirlwind: A Christian Interpretation of History (1976), and Message and Existence: An Introduction to Christian Theology (1979). He is best known for his writings on science and religion, including Creationism on Trial: God at Little Rock (1985) that builds upon his testimony at McLean v. Arkansas, a landmark case on the teaching of creationism in public schools. Gilkey wrote authoritatively on twentieth-century theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich; both were his teachers at Union Theological Seminary. Gilkey also fostered exchanges between theological traditions. He offered a Protestant perspective on the theological movements of Vatican II in Catholicism Confronts Modernity (1975). He authored articles and reviews on Christian-Buddhist dialogues and taught at Kyoto University in Japan in 1975.</p>

<p>Harold Foote Gosnell (1896-1997) grew up in Rochester, New York, where he attended the University and graduated in 1918. He served briefly in the army, remaining in America, before pursuing graduate studies in political science at the University of Chicago. At Chicago Gosnell worked with Charles E. Merriam, graduating in 1922 and staying on as faculty. By 1932 Gosnell was an Associate Professor and closely associated with Merriam's approach to the discipline, which incorporated methods from economics, sociology, and psychology.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gosnell's work during the 1920s and 1930s used statistical analyses to draw conclusions about voter behavior and political participation. He became known for his research into Chicago politics and the African-American vote; Negro Politicians: The Rise of Negro Politics and Chicago (1935) and Machine Politics: The Chicago Model (1937) were still considered authoritative texts in the 1990s. Gosnell also completed studies of American non-voters and voter turnout in Europe. His work was consistently valued for its "behaviorism" method, which made use of the quantitative models favored by the other social sciences, but modified their tendency towards determinism.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Despite this success, however, the Political Science Department came under increasing criticism from University President Robert Hutchins, who disliked Charles Merriam's political activism. In 1941 Gosnell accepted a job with the Bureau of the Budget. In 1946 he moved to the State Department, where he remained until 1960. He continued to publish on voter motivations, though his case studies of presidential leadership demonstrated a shift away from behaviorism.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During this period Gosnell also served as faculty at American University, where he conducted research on the Soviet Union for their Special Operations Research Office. In 1962 he was invited to teach at Howard University, where his scholarship on African-American politics was particularly admired. Gosnell retired in 1970, but continued to receive accolades for his contribution to the discipline, awarded the Charles E. Merriam Award from the American Political Science Association in 1981. Both APSA and the University of Rochester created fellowships named for him, and by the time of his death in 1997 Gosnell was widely considered to have made quantitative analysis mainstream in political science.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Louis Gottschalk was born in Brooklyn on February 21, 1899, and received his early education at P.S. 43 and Brooklyn High School. A New York state scholarship enabled him to enter Cornell University in the autumn of 1915. Gottschalk ultimately received three advanced degrees from that institution: an A.B. in 1919, A.M. in 1920, and the Ph.D. in 1921. Gottschalk later explained the importance of his years at Cornell, which during the early twentieth century produced a remarkable number of outstanding historians. He noted the flexibility of the graduate program, the splendid library, and a small student body at the graduate level. When Louis Gottschalk arrived at Cornell the faculty included Charles Henry Hull in American history, Wallace Notestein in English history, and Nathaniel Schmidt in Oriental studies. His doctoral committee consisted of Carl Becker, William Lynn Westerman, and George Lincoln Burr, all presidents of the American Historical Association.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When Carl Becker joined the faculty in 1917, Louis Gottschalk attended his first classes on the French Revolution. Becker's influence on Gottschalk's intellectual development and his importance to the young scholar's later career was profound, and Gottschalk acknowledged it often throughout his life. It was Becker who instilled in Gottschalk the conviction that history was not simply a chronicle of events, but could and should encompass the methodology and insights of other disciplines. Furthermore, as one of Gottschalk's students remarked, Gottschalk was trained at a time when “by precept and example Becker was leading a personal crusade for the involvement of ideas in the average historical account.” Given his mentor's example, Gottschalk's willingness to grapple with problems ranging from individual motivation to world culture is understandable.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Personally as well as professionally, the Cornell years were important for Gottschalk. Leo Gershoy, later professor of modern European history at New York University, also entered Cornell in the fall of 1915, and the two freshmen became lifelong friends. By the time they registered for Becker's class in their junior year, Gershoy, Gottschalk, and two classmates (Ernest Hettich, and Barnet Novar) had come to be known collectively as “the Goops,” for reasons unknown to Gottschalk. They remained fast friends long after they had left Ithaca, with Gottschalk and Gershoy closely associated “as personal friends, cooperative colleagues and amicable rivals.” Before leaving Cornell for his first teaching position, Gottschalk married Laura Riding, then a student in English literature, later a poet and critic. They were divorced in 1925.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After completing his dissertation on Jean Paul Marat in 1921, Gottschalk accepted a position as Instructor at the University of Illinois- From there he moved to the University of Louisville where he was assistant and then associate professor from 1923 to 1927. Although Gottschalk was able to research and publish several articles while in Kentucky, the environment became uncongenial when a new President instituted policies which alienated members of the faculty. When the controversy led to the dismissal of a colleague from the History Department, Gottschalk became one of the first members of the American Association of University Professors to request that fledgling organization to investigate policies which, according to Gottschalk, included unfair faculty contracts, lowered standards for students, and administrative pressure on faculty members to attend football games and chapel exercises. By the spring of 1927 the AAUP had begun its investigation, the local press had exacerbated tensions, and Gottschalk had been dismissed as disloyal and disruptive. Gottschalk's position during the affair was ultimately vindicated in the AAUP's publication of events surrounding the case.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By the spring of 1927, when faculty-administration relations were at their lowest point at the University of Louisville, the University of Chicago opened negotiations with Gottschalk. He joined the faculty as associate professor of modern European history in the fall of 1927 and thereby began an association which would last almost half a century. Gottschalk's arrival in Hyde Park coincided with that of the University's new President, Robert Maynard Hutchins.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Prior to Hutchins' taking office at Chicago, the University had begun to formulate reorganization plans. These plans materialized under Hutchins' leadership, and by 1933 the innovative “Chicago Plan” was drawing national attention. The subsequent streamlined divisional structure posed problems for the Department of History, however. Some faculty members believed that Clio's proper domain was the Social Sciences, while others insisted she be classified with the Humanities. Professor Gottschalk, who had no strong feelings on that particular issue, entered the fray only after Ronald S. Crane, Acting Chairman of the Senate Committee on History and Professor of English, suggested that the
</p>
<p>Department be dissolved, with historians joining other more specialized departments such as economics, sociology, etc. Crane's memorandum, “The Organization of History in a University,” sparked a lively debate within the University community on the nature of history and the proper realm of historians. The History Department's response was drafted primarily by Gottschalk, and it comprises a clear statement by a twentieth-century historian on the historian's art at a critical point in its development.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gottschalk's association with the University of Chicago began in the fall of 1927, when he joined the Department of History as an associate professor of modern European history. Although only twenty-eight at the time, Gottschalk, in his publications, had already delineated those subjects which were to engage his attention throughout his career. These topics included the era of the French revolution, the significance of individual motivation in history, and historiography. Gottschalk illuminated these themes in his chef d'oeuvre, a six volume biography of the Marquis de Lafayette. His work on this project began shortly after he arrived at the University of Chicago, and he was working on the seventh volume at the time of his death.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gottschalk's prodigious published work and his excellence in the classroom were soon recognized by his colleagues, and along with numerous honors came increasing responsibilities within the University community and in the rapidly growing historical organizations. His promotion to full professor at the University in 1935 was quickly followed by a term as Chairman of the History Department (1937-42).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 1929 to 1943 he served as assistant editor of the Journal of Modern History, which was followed by three years as acting editor. In 1959 Gottschalk was awarded the Gustavus F. and Ann M. Swift Distinguished Service Professorship of History (Emeritus 1965-75). An active member of the American Historical Association, Gottschalk was elected President of that organization in 1953, and throughout his life he channeled his energies into myriad other professional activities, ranging from lectures throughout the world to a role as one of the founders of the American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Professor Gottschalk's first decade at the University of Chicago also brackets the first phase of activity by the Social Sciences Research Council, which was organized by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1923. Gottschalk received his first grant from the SSRC soon after he accepted the appointment at the University, and that organization financed much of the next fifty years of research on the Lafayette biography. A Guggenheim fellowship for 1928-29 had enabled Gottschalk to gather research material in France, and the first volume of his biography was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1935.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to the administrative and research work which Gottschalk undertook at the University during this period, he established an outstanding reputation for his teaching skills. During the 1930s Gottschalk, William T. Hutchinson and James Cate developed an historical methods course which became known as the “Laboratory Course in History.” Years later, when the Department established a fellowship fund in Gottschalk's name, numerous students recalled this course in letters to Gottschalk, and repeatedly mentioned his “vivid” lecture style. Herman Kogan's letter to his mentor in 1973 perhaps best characterized other comments about Gottschalk as teacher: “I was, in an important sense, educated rather than merely instructed.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Three years after his arrival in Chicago Gottschalk married Fruma Kasden, a concert pianist in Europe prior to her arrival in the United States, and later Professor of Russian Language and Literature at the University of Chicago. Two sons were born during the 1930s; Alexander (March, 1932) and Paul Abo (1939-1977), formerly associate professor of English literature at Cornell.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Perhaps no period better illustrates Gottschalk's ability to integrate his scholarship and activities outside the Department of History than the 1940s. While work on the Lafayette biography progressed, Gottschalk became deeply involved in war-related service, Jewish activities, and the ongoing dialogue within his profession on the nature of historical inquiry.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On October 6, 1943 Professor Gottschalk received a call from Major Frank Monaghan of the War Department. Monaghan had been professor of history at Yale before the United States entered World War II, and he now asked Gottschalk to serve on a “Committee of Historians to Analyze and Appraise Current Conditions and Prospective Developments in Germany,” For the next three months Gottschalk shuttled to and from Washington and consulted with fellow historians Carl Becker, Arthur C. Cole, Henry Steele Commager, Elias A. Lowe, Dumas Malone, Benjamin Schmidt, J. Duane Squires, and Edward Meade Earle. The purpose of the study was to give the army an estimate of probable German reaction to continued Allied pressure. The work of this “Secret Committee of Historians,” as it was called, was not publicized until 1946.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Throughout his life Gottschalk devoted considerable time and energy to public lectures, often on topics relating directly to his scholarly expertise: revolution, Franco-American relations, historiography, and so forth. But during the 1940s he increasingly lectured outside the classroom about post-war international relations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1942, because of his interest in the subject, he accepted the chairmanship of the Chicago branch of the Universities Committee on Postwar International Problems. This committee had begun as a national organization under the auspices of the World Peace Foundation, and was directed by Ralph Barton Perry of Harvard University. Like many organizations established during the war, the purpose of this group was to provide a forum for academicians to discuss problems of the post-war world, with the hope of influencing public opinion. Though not as visible in this internationalist movement as other U of C faculty (such as Quincy Wright or William F. Ogburn), Gottschalk nonetheless kept the Chicago branch alive from March through October of 1943.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Second World War also kindled a vigorous involvement in Jewish questions-both in his addresses from the lectern and in his increasing commitments to Jewish organizations. Essays which he contributed to various Jewish periodicals in the 1940s reveal an awareness of the impact which the American xenophobic reaction of the 1920s had upon the Jewish community. Gottschalk characterized his early teaching career (1920-40) as a period of pronounced anti-Semitism within the United States. In particular, Gottschalk reflected upon the quandary of academic Jews brought up in this environment, and their consequent ambiguous relationship to Jewish culture. Beginning in the 1930s Gottschalk registered his concern through B'nai B'rith, taking special interest in the Hillel program. During the forties he served as chairman of the Conference on Jewish Relations and president of the Board of Jewish Education. His remarks on this topic illustrate the internationalist feelings which motivated many of his activities during and after the Second World War:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So much Jewish money has gone into negative spending -to keep Jews trained in the traditional religion; to counteract anti-Semitism; to carry on charitable enterprises that the state and non-sectarian philanthropic organizations could, would, and should carry on. But that kind of spending adds little or nothing to Jewish life. They are defenses-worthy defenses perhaps, but defenses none the less. We need something to broaden our understanding, to add to our knowledge, to fit Jewish history into world history, to widen our outlook upon others and the outlook of others upon us, to discover not so much what the Jew had done for the Jew as what the Jew has done for the world and the world for the Jew.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The interest in historical inquiry and its methodology which was evident in Gottschalk's defense of the History Department in 1934 persisted throughout his career. When the historical profession went through a period of intense self-examination during the 1940s and ‘50s Gottschalk was again in the midst of the discussion. His presidential address to the American Historical Association in December, 1953 can be read as a sequel to his response to the Crane memo twenty years before. Frankly autobiographical, Gottschalk entitled the speech ‘A Professor of History in a Quandary.” In this address, Gottschalk explained why he ‘found it hard to concede...that the study of history is of interest only to other historians, if to them, unless it contributes to the development of national awareness, satisfies curiosity about recent or local events, or titillates the literary sensibilities.” The same issue enticed Gottschalk into serving as a member of the Social Science Research Council's conference on “Trends in Research in American History” (1942-46), on that same organization's Board of Directors in 1956, and on its Committee on Historical Analysis in 1958. Through his teaching, writing, and participation in such organizations, Gottschalk repeatedly addressed himself to the question of the social responsibility of the historian.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This unflagging interest in historiography, coupled with his decision to do what he could to assist postwar world unity and international harmony prompted Gottschalk to accept a position as one of the editors of the Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind (SCHM)-a project which was truly international in scope. The need for a history of mankind, freed from the “misinformation and national biases” of traditional textbooks, was first articulated at a conference of Ministers of Education held in London during World War II. During the late 1940s the outlines of such a project were sketched out under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). SCHM eventually involved hundreds of scholars from numerous disciplines. Gottschalk joined the project as co-author and editor of Volume IV in 1951. Although the original plan had called for publication of six volumes by 1957, Volume IV was not published until 1969. The difficulties inherent in an experiment of this kind are amply recorded in the Gottschalk papers.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While the writing international history plagued Professor Gottschalk for over fifteen years, this work, coupled with other publications and an extensive teaching and lecture schedule brought him numerous honors and increased his responsibilities within the various professional associations. Professor Gottschalk was twice awarded a Guggenheim Fellow-ship (1928-29 and 1954-55) and, in 1953, the French government named him a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor. In addition, he received a Fulbright award for 1954-55, became a fellow at the Center for Advanced study of the Behavioral Sciences (1957-58), and was awarded a $10,000 prize in 1960 by the American Council of Learned Societies for “outstanding past achievements in the field of humanities.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gottschalk's retirement from the University of Chicago in 1965 was followed by eight more years of teaching as Professor of History at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle Campus and, from 1969 to 1975, service as Associate Director of the Office of the University Honors Program at that institution. In addition, he devoted considerable attention to the formation of a new, interdisciplinary organization -the American Society of Eighteenth Century Studies. And, a “friend of Lafayette” to the end, Gottschalk helped to edit the massive Lafayette: a guide to the letters, documents and manuscript in the United States,15 a project begun in 1970 at Cornell University. Gottschalk was still at work on this project at the time of his death in March, 1975.

<p>Gerim (sometimes spelled Qerim) Panarity was the editor of the first
Albanian-American newspaper in the United States, Dielli ("The Sun").
Taking on the position in the 1940s, he remained there for nearly 25 years,
until his retirement in 1963. Started in 1909 by the Society of Besa-Besen
in Boston, Dielli is now the oldest continuously-published Albanian
language newspaper in the world. In 1912, the Pan-Albanian Federation of
America, Vatra ("The Hearth") was formed, becoming one of the most
influential voices in the movement for Albanian independence. Dielli became
Vatra’s main organ for fostering Albanian nationalism. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Gerim
Panarity was dedicated to the cause of Albanian independence his entire
life. As a young man in 1911, Panarity left the United States for Albania,
to fight with Memet and Faik Konitza for liberation from the Ottoman
Empire. He eventually returned to the United States to complete his
education, attending the Hitchcock Free Academy in Brimfield,
Massachusetts. He graduated from Clark University in Worcester,
Massachusetts in 1926, receiving the Washington Franklin Medal for
excellence in history. During World War II, Panarity broadcast through the
Voice of America in Albania, encouraging Albanian resistance to the Axis
powers. He was also instrumental in post-war efforts to send food, clothing
and medicine to the country. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Throughout his life, Panarity
published numerous articles and books on the subject of Albania. In 1925,
he published an article in Current History entitled, "Albania’s Latest
Revolution." He was also chief author of the WPA Federal Writers’ Project
book The Albanian Struggle in the Old World and the New. In 1957, he
published and edited the collection Albania: The Rock Garden of
Southeastern Europe and Other Essays. He published a work on Metropolitan
Fan Noli, a prominent Albanian-American leader with whom he was in active
partnership through Vatra. He also contributed to such publications as The
Globe and The Christian Science Monitor. </p>

<p>Gitel P. Steed was born Gertrude Poznanski in 1914, in Columbus, Ohio, to Sara Auerbach and Jakob Poznanski. Her mother was a native of Columbus and her father, a businessman, immigrated from Poland. Shortly after her birth, Steed family moved to the Bronx, New York. She eventually attended Waleigh High School, and as a teenager adopted the Yiddish name Gitel.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1932 Gitel entered New York University (NYU), majoring in banking and finance, but dropped out after her first year. She later returned to NYU and in 1938 received her B.A. degree with honors in sociology and anthropology. While attending NYU Gitel lived in Greenwich Village where she developed friendships with many including the painter Rafael Soyer. She is the subject of at least two paintings by Soyer, "Girl in a White Blouse," 1932, which now hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and "Two Girls," 1933, which is in the collections of the Smart Museum of Art, on the campus of the University of Chicago. It was at this same time that Gitel met her future husband, the artist Robert Steed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1938, with financial support arranged by Ruth Benedict, she entered graduate school in anthropology at Columbia University, where she studied under Benedict for three years. During this time Gitel undertook the first two of four ethnological projects that marked her career in anthropology. The first of these projects, under the direction of Ruth Benedict, she conducted among the Blackfoot Indians in Montana. Then, from 1939 to 1941 she worked with Vilhjalmur Stefannsson on Inuit in Greenland, studying hunter-gatherer diet and subsistence patterns. This was to be the basis of her dissertation, but she never completed the Greenland project and only much later (1969) completed her dissertation, basing it on her India research. In 1941 she left Columbia and worked until 1943 as the senior editor of information at Yale University's Institute of Human Relations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1944 she was invited to join the Jewish Black Book Committee. A group of writers and researchers supported by the World Jewish Congress and other anti-fascist Jewish organizations, this committee documented in detail the Nazi death campaign against Jews in Europe during World War II. The committee compiled papers subsequently published as The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People (1946). Gitel contributed a 130-page section called "Strategies of Decimation" in which she documented Nazi Germany's policies and techniques of extermination.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1945 and again in 1947 she taught at Hunter College in New York. In 1946 she taught at Fisk University and there edited the journal Race Relations. In 1947 she married Robert Steed, and in 1953 gave birth to their only child, Andrew Hart Steed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She began her third ethnological project in 1947 when she was invited to join the Columbia University Research in Contemporary Cultures Project. In this project, co-directed by Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead, Steed's assignment was to work among Chinese immigrants in New York City. Some of the results of Steed's work were published in Mead and Metraux, The Study of Culture at a Distance (1953).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After a similar China project had to be canceled, Steed formulated her fourth ethnographic project, a field study in India. Funding was received through a grant from the Department of the Navy and Steed was appointed Director of the Columbia University Research in Contemporary India Project. Upon her return to the U.S. from India in 1951, Steed presented her findings in several seminars. The most in-depth of these seminars was a lecture series, run by Abram Kardiner, that she gave at Columbia University in 1953-1954. Due to a disagreement between Steed and Kardiner, the funding for the India project was discontinued.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Steed joined the faculty of Hofstra College in New York in 1962. While teaching at Hofstra, she completed her dissertation at Columbia University, "Caste and Kinship in Gujarat: The Social Use of Space" (1969). In 1970 she returned to Kasandra for four months, with her husband, at which time she interviewed many of her old informants about social change in the village. Steed remained on the faculty of Hofstra University until she died in 1977, at the age of 63.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>INDIA FIELD PROJECT
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The India field project was a team effort carried out between 1949 and 1951 in three different villages in northwestern and north central India. The primary research team included Steed, as Project Director; an anthropology graduate student, James Silverberg; a British psychiatrist, G. Morris Carstairs; and Steed's husband, Robert Steed. Silverberg's wife Donna also joined the team for some time, as did an assistant researcher, Cecil B. Massey. They were joined in India by a team of Indian interpreters and researchers. These included Bhagvati Masher and Kantilal Mehta, who worked as interpreters; Nandlal Dosajh, a psychologist; N. Prabhudas, an economist who conducted the land utilization survey; and Jerome D'Souza as cook. In the second year of research, the team also included an Indian assistant, Tahera, as well as Americans Grace Langley and John Koos. The three villages were "Kasandra" in Gujarat state, "Nawabpur" in Uttar Pradesh, and "Deoli" in Rajasthan. The villages were referred to by these pseudonyms throughout the project. Steed worked primarily in Kasandra for one year (1950). She started work in Nawabpur as well but had to cut her stay there short because of illness. James Silverberg worked in both Kasandra (1950) and in Nawabpur (1951), staying in each place for one year. Carstairs worked in Sujarupa village for Steed, 1949-1950. (Carstairs did separate research in Deoli in 1951-1952 and wrote "The Twice-Born" (1957) about it.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Steed and her team of researchers made use of a variety of fieldwork methods, gathering data both on individual psychology and on social institutions. Most of their data on individual psychology they derived from detailed life histories collected from a sample of informants. These life histories comprised long sets of free-ranging interviews that were designated "personal narration," a battery
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>of psychodiagnostic tests (whose validity they subsequently questioned and dismissed), as well as watercolors and drawings by both adults and children. Data on social institutions were collected through survey methods as well as participant observation. They completed thorough surveys on land tenure and economic relations, and collected data on economic, political, religious, kinship, and caste organization.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Steed formulated the project within the broader agenda of culture and personality studies in anthropology. The theoretical and methodological agenda of culture and personality studies was to study the relation between individual personality and the socio-cultural context of their enculturation. Steed was interested in studying the extent to which Indian social institutions determined individual behavior and personality. Conversely, she also asked if innate psychological or personal aspects influenced institutions. She analyzed both the cultural and the psychological aspects of character formation and was interested in where these two aspects met.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In order to judge the relation of social institutions to personality formation, the researchers required a basis for comparison, and thus they chose three villages with different institutional frameworks. Kasandra and Deoli were predominantly Hindu villages, while Nawabpur was predominantly Muslim. Each of the three villages had a different land tenure system and political history as well as being linguistically distinct.

<p>Emil J. Gumbel, (1891-1966), a mathematical statistician, was one of the many German intellectuals who opposed the Nazi regime and fled their homeland with the hope that democratic government in Germany could be restored through their efforts abroad. The Gumbel papers reflect his associations with fellow anti-Nazis, and their activities to help their homeland recover from the devastation wrought by the Third Reich. Gumbel's early life was spent in Munich where he studied economics, engineering, and actuarial science as well as mathematics and statistics. He joined the faculty of Heidelberg University in 1922 and during the next decade became widely known for his political writings as well as his scientific work. His political views were largely the result of a determined pacifism acquired during his service in the First World War. Through the 1920's he wrote several books and articles which exposed the militaristic goals and political intimidation of right-wing elements whose influence was then growing in Germany, especially the Freikorps and the young National Socialist Party. As a result of his investigations Gumbel was dismissed from the Heidelberg faculty when the Nazis came to power in 1933. He spent the next several years in France, teaching at the Universities of Paris and Lyons, then, upon the German invasion of France in 1940, Gumbel emigrated to New York City, where he obtained a position at the New School for Social Research.</p>
<p>Gumbel's knowledge of German political affairs enabled him to take an active part in the struggle against the Nazis. The papers record that he was frequently consulted by students, scholars, and government agencies, especially the Office of Strategic Services. Most of the correspondence in the collection is from the 1940's, during which period Gumbel continued to maintain his ties with former colleagues in Europe, North and South America. The papers include correspondence with several friends whom he helped escape the Nazis, and with such associates as Otto Lehmann-Russbuldt, president of the Deutsche Liga für Menschenrechte, and Paul von Schoenaich of the Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft. Gumbel's postwar concern for the reconstruction of Germany, the welfare of his countrymen, and his opposition to German rearmament are also documented in the papers by correspondence and such public statements as his "Erklärung gegen Deutsche Aufrüstung."</p>
<p>Gumbel continued to teach at the New School and other New York institutions until his death in 1966.</p>

<p>Eleanor Prescott Hammond (b. April 26, 1866, d. February 21, 1933) was an English professor and Chaucer expert who taught at the University of Chicago and Wellesley College before spending the majority of her career as an independent scholar. Hammond, known as Nellie to her family, was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Andrew Hill Hammond, an organ reed manufacturer, and Rhoda Maria (Barber) Hammond, a homemaker. Raised in Worcester, Hammond left the United States in her early twenties to study at the University of Leipzig. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Hammond graduated from Leipzig in 1891 and entered Oxford University, where she earned a B.A. with First-Class Honors in 1894. At Oxford, Hammond studied under English professor Arthur Sampson Napier, who served as a mentor through her early career. Hammond returned to the United States and completed a Ph.D. as a Graduate Fellow in English at the University of Chicago in 1898. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Hammond taught in the University of Chicago English Department as a Docent in English Literature from 1898 to 1904, beginning her post in the same year as her colleague and lifelong research collaborator, English professor John Matthews Manly. During this period, she published several articles on Chaucer and textual analysis, and was one of two women, out of forty-three contributors, to publish in the first edition of Chicago-based journal Modern Philology in 1903. Hammond resigned from her position at the University of Chicago in 1904, and published her first book, Chaucer: A Bibliographical Manual, in 1908. Hammond continued to live in Chicago, working as a school teacher, until the late 1910s, when she moved to Boston. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>In Boston, Hammond taught intermittently at Wellesley College, working primarily as an independent scholar of Late Medieval Period English, French, and Italian poetry. Hammond published extensively through the 1920s. In addition to numerous articles, she authored a translation of Dante’s Inferno and a survey of Chaucer’s influence on English poetry. Hammond conducted multiple research trips to England to examine manuscripts in the 1910s and 1920s and corresponded frequently with fellow scholars, including University of Chicago English professors John Manly and Edith Rickert and French professor Thomas Atkinson Jenkins. She served as a contributor to the University of Chicago’s Chaucer Project, providing notes, manuscript transcriptions, and drafts of her writing. At the time of her death, Hammond was a member of the Modern Language Association and the Société des Anciens Textes Français. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Described by the sixth President of Wellesley College, Ellen Fitz Pendleton, as a scholar of national reputation, Hammond is considered a foundational figure in Chaucer scholarship. Her 1908 Bibliographical Manual was one of the first attempts to record everything known about Chaucer, blending an organized and detailed bibliography with summaries of contemporary scholarly opinion, her own critiques, and reprints of difficult to access texts. The first to identify and link a set of manuscripts transcribed by the same copyist, Hammond lends her name to the “Hammond scribe” and also to the “Hammond group,” which she led in identifying key networks in a series of 15th-century manuscripts during her time at Oxford. Her last book, English Verse Between Chaucer and Surrey, is an early application of socio-cultural theory to late medieval period English literature. Hammond’s engagement with theorists like Thorstein Veblen and ideas of the role of social ferment influenced later Chaucer scholars. Much of Hammond’s innovative approach has been credited to her decision to work outside the academy, which allowed her the independence to explore fresh avenues of analysis and critique. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>Hammond died in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 66 on February 21, 1933. </p>

<p>Winfield Scott Hancock was an officer in the US army and the Democratic nominee for the 1880 presidential race. Hancock was born on February 14, 1824 in Montgomery Square, Pennsylvania, to Benjamin Franklin Hancock, a public school teacher and lawyer, and Elizabeth Hoxworth Hancock. Hancock also had a twin brother, Hilary Baker Hancock. </p>
<p>Hancock began his education at Norristown Academy, a private preparatory school, but was moved to public schools when they arrived in Norristown in the 1830s. In 1840, Hancock was nominated by a local Congressman, Joseph Fornance, to attend the US Military Academy at West Point. Despite his eventual reaching of the rank of Major General, Hancock was an average student and graduated 18th out of his class of 25. </p>
<p>His role in the military spanned the majority of Hancock’s life. From his graduation from West Point in 1844 until his death in 1886, military service defined, in large part, Hancock’s activities and contributions to the nation. He participated, as a member of the infantry, or led, in his roles as officer of various rank, ten battles, which took place during both the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War. Of note, Hancock served as a corps commander at the Battle of Gettysburg. In a famous strategic move, Hancock sacrificed the 1st Minnesota regiment by sending it against a Confederate brigade. While the 1st Minnesota lost 87% of its men, the move bought time to organize the Union defensive line and secure a victory for the day. </p>
<p>During his military service, Hancock met a woman named Almira (Allie) Russell and married her on January 24, 1850, in St. Louis. Allie gave birth to two children: Russell, in 1850, and Ada, in 1857. Unfortunately, both children died before their parents. </p>
<p>After his wartime service in the military, Hancock continued his path of public service, carrying out the orders of President Johnson, followed by President Grant. Hancock’s political interest grew during his posting in New York, encouraging him to focus his ambition on the 1880 presidential election. Hancock received the democratic nomination, but lost to Republican candidate James A. Garfield. </p>
<p>Hancock continued his service both in the military, leading the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a veteran organization, and in private life, becoming president of the NRA. Hancock’s service and participation in these groups continued until his death in 1886 in New York. </p>

<p>In 1902 the University of Chicago saw the need to construct a permanent central library. Plans for the new library were underway when the university’s first President, William Rainey Harper, passed away in 1906. To honor his service to the university, it was decided that the new library would be dedicated to his memory. Construction began in 1910 when the first cornerstone was laid. The building was completed in June of 1912, when the first dedication ceremony took place. Harper Memorial Library served as the main library for the university until the Regestein Library opened in September of 1970. At this time, Harper Library and Wiebolt Hall (originally constructed in 1928) were renovated to preserve their unique architecture and make them better able to meet the university’s growing needs. The rededication ceremony in 1973 marked the completion of these renovations and the transformation of the Harper Memorial Library from the university’s main library to the new College Center, designed to be the distinctive home for the undergraduate College.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Eleazar Barton (1861-1930) was one of the early twentieth century's most prominent writers and lecturers on the life of Abraham Lincoln. Born in Sublette, Illinois, in the same year Lincoln assumed the presidency, Barton grew up in an environment heavily influenced by reverence for Lincoln. After pursuing undergraduate studies at Berea College in Kentucky, Barton earned his divinity degree from the Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1890. He served parishes in Tennessee, Ohio, and Massachusetts before becoming the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Oak Park, Illinois, a position he held until his retirement in 1924. Four years later, Barton accepted an appointment as lecturer at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, where he also organized and served as pastor of the Collegeside Congregational Church.
</p>
<p>

<p>John Milton Hay was born in Salem, Indiana in 1838. While clerking in his uncle's Springfield, IL law office in 1859, Hay met Abraham Lincoln. At the urging of John Nicolay, Lincoln's private secretary, Hay was appointed to the personal staff of the President-Elect and accompanied him to Washington, D.C. in 1860. Hay served as a secretary to Lincoln until the President's death in 1865. Following Lincoln's assassination, Hay remained in diplomatic service, serving in lower level posts throughout Europe between 1865 and 1870. From 1879 until 1881, he served as Assistant Secretary of State under President Rutherford B. Hayes. In 1897, Hay was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain by President William McKinley. His tenure coincided with the Spanish-American War, and Hay was instrumental in negotiating the Treaty of Paris (1898), which concluded the hostilities and eventually led to U.S. control of the Philippines. Hay served as Secretary of State from 1898 until his death in 1905, under Presidents McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. During this time, he articulated the Open Door policy toward China, by which the great powers agreed not to partition the country and to compete freely for trade. He was also instrumental in guiding government policy during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Later, Hay negotiated the Hay-Pauncefote treaties with Great Britain (1901), which ultimately paved the way for the construction of the Panama Canal by the United States. Hay died on July 1, 1905 in Newbury, New Hampshire.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to his diplomatic work, Hay was also a journalist and an author of poetry and prose. He wrote, with John Nicolay, the 10 volume biography of Lincoln: Abraham Lincoln: A History (1890). Additionally, he edited Lincoln's Complete Works (1894).

<p>Robert Herrick (1868-1938), novelist and professor of composition and literature, was born into the post-Civil War gentility of Cambridge, Massachusetts and died in the Virgin Islands, a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal government. Of old New England stock, he was also educated in New England. He attended the Cambridge High School and in 1885 entered Harvard, where his mother's cousin George Herbert Palmer was Professor of Philosophy. At Harvard he studied under such men as Francis James Child, George Lyman Kittredge, William James, and Barrett Wendell, and while still an undergraduate published his first stories in the Harvard Advocate and Harvard Monthly. He was associated, either in friendship or through participation in the Monthly or the Mermaid Club, with such men as Philip Abbot, George Rice Carpenter, Jefferson Fletcher (who was to be his brother-in-law), Norman and Hutchins Hapgood, Bernard Berenson, George Pierce Baker, George Santayana, William Vaughn Moody, and Robert Morss Lovett.</p>
<p>After graduation from Harvard in 1890, Herrick taught composition and literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1893, he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago, where his cousin by marriage, Alice Freeman Palmer, was already established as the University's first Dean of Women. Here he developed a writing program similar to that taught at Harvard by A. S. Hill and Barrett Wendell, and was instrumental in persuading Robert Morss Lovett and William Vaughn Moody to join the English faculty.</p>
<p>In 1894, Herrick married his first cousin, Harriet Peabody Emery. The marriage was dissolved in 1916; and one son, Philip Herrick, survived his parents. In 1899, the Herricks acquired a lot at 5735 Lexington (now University) Avenue and in 1900, engaged Hugh M. Garden to design a home for them. The local press, chafing over Herrick's realistic descriptions of Chicago in The Web of Life (1900), ridiculed the project as intended to educate the taste of those accustomed to Chicago's "vulgarity;" but the house (now Calvert House) has come to be regarded as an important precursor of the "Prairie School" of architecture. In 1913, Herrick purchased a house and land in York Village, Maine; and this he regarded as his permanent home.</p>
<p>From 1909 to 1923, when he resigned his professorship, Herrick spent only part of each year at the University, the other part writing and traveling. In 1935, he was appointed Government Secretary for the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, he published three collections of short stories and twenty-one novels, several textbooks, and a study of World War I. He also wrote frequently for periodicals: short stories (several early ones published under the pseudonym of Austin Smith), literary and political essays, book reviews and editorials. In addition, during the period of World War I, he wrote a regular column for the Chicago Tribune. </p>

<p>Before European settlement, the Chicago area functioned as a trade center for various Native American nations, such as the Potawatomi, Myaamia (Miami), and Illiniwek Confederacy nations. Other nations that lived in this region were the Ottawa, Sauk, Ojibwe, Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo), Mascouten, Wea, Delaware, Winnebago, Menominee, and Mesquakie (Fox) nations. The first non-native settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a Haitian from the French colony of Saint-Domingue, who by 1790 had established a trading settlement near the Chicago River. After several wars and raids between Myaamia and Iroquois nations, in the late 18th century the Ojibwe and Potawatomi nations took control over the Chicago area. It was ultimately the Potawatomi nation that, with the Treaty of Chicago in 1833, ceded their remaining lands in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan to the American government.</p>
<p/>
<p>Twenty years later, Paul Cornell, a lawyer, real estate spectator, and cousin of the founder of Cornell University, purchased 300 acres of land between 51st and 55th street. Cornell had envisioned creating a residential neighborhood for Chicago businessmen and their families and quickly Hyde Park became that suburban retreat. In 1861, Hyde Park was incorporated as an independent township, called Hyde Park Township, and its boundaries were extended south from 39th to 63rd Streets to 138th Street and west to State Street. </p>
<p/>
<p>Woodlawn, previous a part of the Hyde Park Township, is a neighborhood south of Hyde Park extending north to 60th Street, south to 67 Street, and west to King Drive. The first non-native settlers of Woodlawn were Dutch farmers who arrived in the 1850s. These farmers were able to sell their produce to merchants via the Illinois Central Railroad, which in 1862 opened a station on 63rd Street. </p>
<p/>
<p>Kenwood, also a former Hyde Park Township neighborhood, was settled in the 1850s by Chicago individuals who sought a respite from the city. The first of these residents was Dr. John A. Kennicott, who built a home near the Illinois Central Railroad tracks at 48th Street. Dr. Kennicott named his home Kenwood after his ancestral land in Scotland, and eventually the name Kenwood came to be applied to the land between 43rd Street and 51st Street, and west to Cottage Grove Avenue. </p>
<p/>
<p>In 1889, Hyde Park Township, including the neighborhoods of Kenwood and Woodlawn, was annexed to the city of Chicago.</p>
<p/>
<p>Though the University of Chicago was originally was located in the Bronzeville neighborhood, on the northwest corner of 35th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, through the efforts of the American Baptist Education Society and billionaire John D. Rockefeller, the university was moved to Hyde Park in 1890 </p>
<p/>
<p>In 1893, The World’s Columbian Exposition was hosted in Hyde Park-Kenwood and Woodlawn, which, alongside an influx of residents, brought increased attention and development to the neighborhoods. During this period, Hyde Park was an affluent white neighborhood governed by racially segregating covenants that prevented African Americans from purchasing or occupying property. </p>
<p/>
<p>In the 1950s, Both Hyde Park-Kenwood and Woodlawn experienced racial tensions and declining housing conditions, which led to a “white flight” as middle class white families left the area. In response to deteriorating housing conditions and economic decline, during the 1950s and 1960s the University of Chicago sponsored an urban renewal plan. This plan involved demolishing and redeveloping entire blocks of buildings in disrepair. Significantly, substandard housing primarily populated by low-income African Americans was demolished and replaced, but these former residents could not afford to live in these newly developed areas. The goal of this renewal plan was to create an affluent but diverse community, and after this plan, the average income of Hyde Park increased sharply by 70 percent, but the population of African Americans decreased by 40 percent. </p>

<p>At the age of thirty, Robert Maynard Hutchins was inaugurated as the fifth President of the University of Chicago. From 1929 until his retirement from the University in 1951, Hutchins remained the chief executive officer of the University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Robert Maynard Hutchins was born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York, to Anna Laura Murch and William James Hutchins, a Presbyterian minister, professor of theology, and eventual President of Berea College (Kentucky). Hutchins enrolled at Oberlin (where his father taught) in 1915 but discontinued his undergraduate studies in 1917 to serve with the Ambulance Corps of the U. S. Army. For his conduct, he was awarded the Croce di Guerra by the Italian government. He resumed his education at Yale in 1919, graduating in 1921. Following graduation, Hutchins married artist and writer Maude Phelps McVeigh. The couple moved to upstate New York where Hutchins taught at the Lake Placid School until 1923. Together, they had three children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1948. Hutchins was remarried in 1949 to Vesta Sutton Orlick, and adopted her daughter.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hutchins' career at Yale was nothing less than meteoric. He graduated from the Yale Law School in 1925 while also serving as Secretary of the University since 1923. He joined the faculty of the Law School in 1925, becoming a full professor in 1927. Hutchins' vitality and intellectual agility led to his appointment first as Acting Dean (1927) and then as Dean (1928) of the Law School. While at Yale, he was instrumental in creating the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary center for the legal, medical, and sociological study of contemporary social problems.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hutchins' youth made his appointment as President of the University of Chicago something of a surprise, but according to Harold Swift, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the search committee was concerned with finding an individual with the personality and the intellectual drive to fill the position. Hutchins' gregarious nature and his commitment to curriculum reform, evident at Yale, seemed to make him an ideal candidate to provide the kind of leadership and vision that the University had not had since President William Rainey Harper.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The initial years of Hutchins' administration were dramatic ones. He accepted and implemented plans for a general reorganization of the University that had been in the works since the administration of Ernest D. Burton (1923-25). These reforms were intended to simplify the administrative structure of the University, to promote interdisciplinary work among the faculty, and to redefine the undergraduate curriculum. The so-called "New Plan" or "Chicago Plan" created four graduate divisions—Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Biological Sciences—and established a consolidated College as a separate division of the University. Additionally, Hutchins eliminated the University's varsity football program. Hutchins' major interest, however, was in the nature and goals of undergraduate education in general and the College in particular. Curricular reforms, with which his name has become more or less synonymous, emphasized the role of the College in providing general education grounded in philosophy and philosophical analysis. Impatient with the increasingly fine division of academic labor and the intensification of research specialization, Hutchins became an outspoken advocate of the value of general education. He lectured tirelessly on the meaning of college and seemed to relish his self-assumed role as a leading American educator.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hutchins' candor and glibness, his self-confidence and (to some) his dogmatism were mixed blessings. The Walgreen investigations (1935) into possible subversive activities on the part of certain faculty at the University put Hutchins in the public eye as an eloquent defender of academic freedom against the claims of naive xenophobes. On the other hand, his style and opinions antagonized parts of the faculty who came to resent what they interpreted as arrogance and a sort of "party line" within the University. Their fears of Hutchins' power and their perception of the declining role of faculty governance at the University stood behind the Senate Memorial (1944) to the Board of Trustees. Protesting some of Hutchins' assertions about the role of the University in contemporary society, the Memorial coincided with widespread administrative reforms designed at least in part to more clearly define the respective roles of the President and the University Senate in the making of educational policy. Hutchins was appointed Chancellor of the University in 1945.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a public figure, Hutchins championed a variety of issues and causes. Although he opposed America's entry into World War II, he cooperated with the government in the establishment of the Metallurgical Laboratory (1942) on campus as part of the Manhattan Project. Following the war, Hutchins was in the forefront of groups seeking to control the destructive potential of nuclear energy and to evaluate the broader implications of scientific research. He was sympathetic to the idea of a single world order (which he could trace to Thomas Aquinas) and in 1945 established, at the request of G. A. Borgese and Richard McKeon, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution. One year earlier he had been appointed chairman of the Commission on the Freedom of the Press. Funded by grants from Time, Inc. and the Encyclopædia Britannica (of which Hutchins had been a director since 1943), the Commission inquired into the nature, function, duties, and responsibilities of the press in America. It was particularly sensitive to the constraints on a free press in the contemporary world.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Controversial and opinionated, Hutchins served as President (and then as Chancellor) of the University longer than any other individual. He retired from the University in 1951 to assume an associate directorship of the Ford Foundation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hutchins tenure at the Ford Foundation underwent several metamorphoses. In 1954 he was appointed director of the Foundation's semi-independent fund, the Fund for the Republic. He reorganized the Fund in 1959 as the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and moved its headquarters from New York City to Santa Barbara, California. He served as its chairman until 1974.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 1943 to 1974, Hutchins was also chairman of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica and a director for Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hutchins spoke and published frequently. He authored numerous books including No Friendly Voice (1936), The Higher Learning in America (1936), Education for Freedom (1943), The University of Utopia (1953), Some Observations on American Education (1956), and The Learning Society (1968).

<p>Hutchins died in Santa Barbara, California on May 14, 1977.

<p>The Congress for Cultural Freedom was founded in 1950 as an anti-communist advocacy organization whose primary intention was to influence left leaning intellectuals and cultural leaders. Based in Paris, the CCF fielded dozens of offices across the world, and supported anti-communist cultural activities through publications, conferences, seminars, and funding of researchers, authors, poets, and artists. It included famous public intellectuals and artists such as Bertrand Russell, Karl Jaspers, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Tennessee Williams. </p>
<p>In the 1960s, it became publicly known that the Congress for Cultural Freedom received funds from the CIA and that some members were CIA operatives. In response to this controversy, the Congress for Cultural Freedom was reorganized as the International Association for Cultural Freedom. Nicolas Nabokov, president, and John C. Hunt, executive director of the CCF, both resigned and Shepard Stone was named president of the IACF.</p>
<p>The IACF retained the mission and organizational structure of CCF under its new leadership. However, as funding for the IACF decreased during the 1970s and the nature of the Cold War changed, the scope of the organization decreased and by 1978 the last offices of the IACF had closed.</p>

<p>James Patrick Mahon, also known as "The O'Gorman Mahon," entered Irish politics in 1821, while still a student at Trinity College, Dublin. becoming (upon the death of his father) a J.P. for his native county, Clare. Around the time of his graduation from Trinity in 1826, he joined then newly-formed Catholic Association, headed by Daniel O'Connell. Mahon was one of the first to urge O'Connell to stand for Parliament from County Clare in the election of 1828. O'Connell's election marked the first time since the Glorious Revolution that a Catholic was elected to Parliament and ultimately seated.</p>
<p>The success of this undertaking inspired Mahon to try his luck as a candidate. He was elected in 1830, along with Major W. N. MacNamara, but was charged with bribery and unseated. (He was subsequently cleared of the charge.) When he again became a candidate in 1831, it was without the important support of O'Connell. O'Connell backed MacNamara; a rift between Mahon and O'Connell resulted, which was never to be mended. Mahon did, however, win the seat. </p>
<p>In 1835, Mahon began an extensive sojourn abroad. He traveled in a number of European countries, Africa, the East, and South America, before returning to Ireland in 1846. From 1847 to 1852, he again represented Clare. When he stood for re-election in 1852, Lord Fitzgerald defeated him. He thereupon resumed his foreign travels, becoming for a time a lieutenant in the Czar's army. From Russia, he wandered across China, India, Arabia, Turkey, and Austria; in the latter two countries, he served in military capacities. He returned to England in 1858, but soon left for South America, where he became involved in one of the many plans to construct a canal across Central America. </p>
<p>Mahon also spent several months in Peru. During his time there, he took an active interest in investigating the mysterious disappearance of Captain Lionel Lambert, commander of the British ship Vixen, on which Mahon had traveled. Mahon compelled the Peruvian government to investigate, and it was found that Lambert had been murdered. Mahon reported the findings to Lord Palmerston, whose acquaintance Mahon had cultivated during his second term in Parliament. </p>
<p>Mahon served in a number of military capacities while in South America, most of them honorary appointments. Legend has it that he was even made an archbishop in Brazil. Upon learning of the outbreak of civil war in the United States, Mahon went to fight on the side of the North. In 1866, he returned to Europe and was granted a colonelcy in a regiment of chasseurs by Louis Napoleon. Although Mahon's escapades have taken on a legendary quality, it is nonetheless clear that his foreign travels constitute one of the most interesting--if, unfortunately, not always well documented periods of his life.</p>
<p>In 1867, he proceeded to Berlin, where he became acquainted with Bismarck and the crown prince. He petitioned Bismarck for a concession to establish a joint-stock bank in Berlin, to be called the Anglo-Prussian Bank. Negotiations had begun in the autumn of 1863, while Mahon was still in South America. </p>
<p>Mahon returned to Ireland in 1871, and two years later took part in the Home Rule Conference founded by Isaac Butt. Through his association with the Home Rule Party during this period, Mahon became friends with Mitchell Henry and his family. Henry was a wealthy manufacturer from Manchester, who settled in County Galway and represented this county in Parliament as an advocate of Home Rule. </p>
<p>During this same period Mahon formed a friendship with Arthur Richard Wellesley, the second Duke of Wellington. Wellington's father, ironically, had strongly disapproved of the young O'Gorman Mahon's actions fifty years earlier during the campaign for O'Connell's election. Both Wellington and Mahon were in their seventies by the time they became friends. Wellington, in the spirit of his father, strongly disapproved of Mahon's Home Rule stand. Despite this difference, their friendship grew.</p>
<p>In 1879, Mahon was elected to Parliament from Clare as a Home Ruler. By this time, Isaac Butt's leadership of the Home Rule Party had become ineffective. As a result, Charles Stewart Parnell superceded Butt in the leadership of the party, though Butt remained nominal head. Butt died in the autumn of 1879, and was temporarily succeeded by William Shaw. The following year, when Disraeli dissolved Parliament and called for new elections, Mahon was returned. At a party meeting before Parliament met, Mahon proposed the election of Parnell as head of the party. Parnell defeated Shaw.</p>
<p>After Parliament was dissolved, Mahon had proposed to Shaw that Captain William O'Shea succeed Lord Francis Conyngham as the other representative from Clare. O'Shea was elected along with Mahon and a deep friendship developed between the two men. </p>
<p>In 1885, Mahon failed to obtain renomination in Clare. Many in his constituency felt the need for a younger representative in Parliament. Mahon succeeded, however, in a bid for office in 1887 as representative of Carlow. During this time also Mahon found himself distracted by a personal matter-a lengthy and unpleasant court case contesting the will of his son, St. John, who had died in 1884.</p>
<p>Mahon's health began to fail as he approached his ninetieth year. When his attendance in Parliament became irregular, Parnell and Justin McCarthy (leader of the party in Parnell's absence) requested that Mahon try to attend more frequently, especially when the party was to vote on an important issue. Mahon died in London on June 15, 1891. Shortly before his death, he publicly repudiated Parnell, with whom he had broken over the issue of the O'Shea divorce. Mahon was buried in the O'Connell circle in Glasnevin Cemetery on June 21, 1891.</p>

He was an excellent student in English and planned to become a teacher of literature. However, he was also a particularly good student in Physics and Mathematics. He impressed Professor of Physics and Astronomy Benjamin A. Wooten. Wooten had obtained a small, professional-quality refracting telescope for the university and Morgan soon began observing the sky.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1926, on Wooten's recommendation, Morgan started his graduate work at the Yerkes Observatory. Two years later he married Helen Barrett, daughter of astronomer Storrs B. Barrett, who was the secretary of the observatory. In June 1930, under the supervision of Otto Struve, he began a Ph.D. thesis on the spectra of A stars. Morgan completed his thesis and received his doctoral degree in December 1931. Despite the onset of the Great Depression and dark economic times, he was kept on the staff at Yerkes Observatory, though he remained in the same assistantship he had held as a graduate student. In the summer of 1932 he was promoted to instructor and in 1936 to assistant professor.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Morgan lived and worked at Yerkes Observatory for almost seventy years. An accomplished teacher and, for a period, editor of The Astrophysical Journal, Morgan's greatest achievements came from research. From the beginning of his work at Yerkes, Morgan's methods were grounded in the systematic organization of concrete data. Eschewing the then new field of theoretical astrophysics, he built his reputation as one of the greatest astronomers of the twentieth century with the morphological classification of stars based on stellar spectra. With Phillip Keenan and Edith Kellman, he created the MKK system for stellar classification, later refined to the MK system that remains in use today.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> Morgan's work, though rigorous, was eclectic and improvisational, relying on his ability to wring significance from spectra that others could not interpret. In 1951, Morgan proved that the Milky Way Galaxy had spiral arms - a hypothesis proposed one hundred years before by Alexander. For this he received an unprecedented standing ovation from a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. His work was celebrated with many awards and honorary degrees, including membership in the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In late 1951 or early 1952, Morgan suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for several months. Soon afterwards, he began to keep a journal recording his private thoughts and experiences. The collection contains almost 250 volumes of this journal, which Morgan wrote in regularly until 1990, when he seems to have begun to experience the effects of Alzheimer's Disease. In these journals, Morgan tries to psychoanalyze himself by following closely Freud's works as well as the works of other psychoanalysts and philosophers of the twentieth century. Also, the reader can find Morgan's own reflections, critiques and foundations to his corpus of work. For the astronomer the dividing line between science and art was blurry, and as proof of this he gives his own research.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1963, his wife Helen died. Morgan, his son and daughter, survived her. The emotional and professional implications for Morgan's life were devastating. In 1966, he married Jean Morgan, a teacher at the Rochester College in Chicago. He remained with Jean until his death in 1994. Jean strongly encouraged Morgan's artistic endeavors. In addition to his scientific work, Morgan never stopped taking photographs or writing about art in his journals. In one of his writings, Morgan states that his most important life works were his photography and journal. Morgan died in Chicago in 1994.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Thomas John Morgan was born in Birmingham, England, October 27, 1847, the son of Thomas John and Hannah (Simcox) Morgan. Educated at Sunday and evening schools, Morgan worked at the machinist trade during and after his schooling. On January 26, 1868, he married Elizabeth Chambers of Birmingham and in 1869 he and his bride migrated to the United States, where they settled in Chicago. Morgan continued to work as a machinist. Rising quickly in the ranks of the labor movement in his trade, Morgan became President of the Machinists’ Union of Chicago in 1874, the same year that he became a member of the Socialist (Workingman’s) Party. In 1875 Morgan was a delegate to the Chicago Trades Assembly, and four years later he represented the Chicago Trades Assembly before the Legislative Committee of Inquiry into the Conditions of Labor. In the same year (1879) Morgan represented the Socialists of Chicago before a Congressional Committee of Inquiry.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the years 1877 to 1880 Morgan was active in organizing the Socialist Labor Party. During the same period he prepared Workshop and Factory laws, which he had presented before the Chicago City Council in 1879 and which were adopted by the Council and made a part of the Municipal Code of Chicago. In 1888 Morgan organized the Woman’s Alliance for Protection of Women and Child Workers. In the same year he became editor of the journal Trades Assembly. In conjunction with Mrs. Morgan he prepared a twenty-four page pamphlet concerning Chicago sweat shops, which was published by Trades Assembly in 1891. By that year, Morgan had risen to be chairman of the joint committee of all the labor organizations of Chicago. This position undoubtedly was influential in Morgan’s receiving the Socialist Labor nomination for mayor of Chicago in 1891.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thomas Morgan was a member of a committee that was instrumental in securing the location of the 1893 World’s Fair at Chicago. After the site had been settled on, he represented the labor organizations of the United States before a Congressional committee at Washington, requesting that the Fair be open on Sundays.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After graduating from the Chicago Law College in 1895, Morgan was examined by the Superior Court of Illinois and admitted to the legal profession. He was chosen to be one of a committee of one hundred selected by the Civic Federation to recommend reforms in Chicago public schools. He became secretary of the National Campaign Committee, Social Democratic Party in 1900, the same year in which he was run as the Party’s nominee for State’s Attorney for Cook County, Illinois.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Morgan was a lecturer at the National Sociologists Convocation held at Lake Bluff, Illinois in 1900, and a delegate to the Socialist National conventions at Indianapolis in 1901 and Chicago in 1904 and 1908. In 1903 he was the Party’s nominee for City Attorney of Chicago, in 1903 and 1907 for judge of the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, and in 1909 for United States Senator from Illinois.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Morgan’s offices within the Party itself included Chairman of the Illinois State Campaign Committee, 1904; member of the State Committee and Cook County Executive Committee, 1905; Chairman of the Cook County Central and Executive Committees, 1906; member of the Central and Executive Committees, 1907.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 1909 until his death, Morgan was editor and publisher of The Provoker, a pocket-sized Socialist weekly. Morgan's other activities included being a member of the Grand Lounge and Deputy Grand Master of the Order of Sons of St. George, Illinois chapter, in 1904. Morgan died December 10, 1912.

<p>Teresa Bandettini, often known by her Arcadian name, Amarilli Etrusca, was born in Lucca in 1763. Her parents, Benedetto Bandettini and Maria Alba Micheli, died when she was seven. Bandettini quickly achieved fame as a dancer in the theatrical world, but would gain more lasting fame as a composer of extemporaneous verse. While in Imola in 1789 she met the Lucchese Pietro Landucci, whom she would marry. After her marriage, she abandoned her dancing career for that of an improvisatrix, and held "Accademie d'improvvisazione" in which paying members of the audience proposed themes that she then elaborated extemporaneously in verse. Bandettini achieved fame throughout Italy and was so well-respected as to draw words of praise from Parini, Monti, Mascheroni, and Alfieri. Bandettini had four children, three girls who died young and a son, Francesco. She died in Lucca in 1837.
</p>
<p>Bandettini was reportedly a learned woman who was known to read Dante backstage when she was not dancing. Sources cite her as an "improvisatrice commossa," capable of simultaneously moving her audience and becoming emotional herself. She resisted the idea of publishing her extemporaneous verse, preferring instead to publish poems that had been subject to a more lengthy elaboration (although a volume of her Rime estemporanee would eventually come out in 1801 and another in 1807). She published a two volume collection of Rime varie in 1786, followed by the 1788 publication of her Poesie diverse. She also published poemetti (La morte d'Adone, 1790) and tragedies (La Teseide, 1805; La caduta de' giganti, 1814; Rosmunda in Ravenna, 1827), and left behind fragments of Romantic tales.
</p>
<p>Bandettini's name resurfaced in 2002 with the discovery of six lost sonatas dedicated to her by the young Niccolò Paganini.

<bioghist><head>Historical Note</head><p>Prior to the establishment of a Music Department in 1931, the University had formed its band, chorus, and orchestra and housed multiple music clubs. Numerous music performances had been organized and staged at the University of Chicago since the earliest years of its existence. These events include performances by the University’s own band and chorus, student-led music clubs, or prominent guest musicians and groups, local and international. &#13;</p><p>&#13;</p><p>In 1903, Leon Mandel Assembly Hall (Mandel Hall) opened its door to listeners for the first time with a concert by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and since became one of the most important historic spaces for music performances at the University. Bond Chapel and Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, built in 1926 and 1928 respectively, became other major venues for the University’s music programs. Recitals, chamber concerts, and operas performed in these spaces are well documented in the collection. Of special note is the frequent appearance of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which had formerly been named after its founder Theodore Thomas, in Mandel Hall from 1904-1934.&#13;</p><p>&#13;</p><p>The Department of Music was established in 1931 as part of the Division of Humanities through a special gift from an anonymous donor. Following the department’s establishment, a University symphony orchestra was created during the academic year 1931-1932. The department’s first chair as well as the symphony orchestra director was the music scholar and composer Carl Bricken. In the following years and decades, the Department recruited such leading scholars and composers as Leonard B. Meyer, Edward Lowinsky, Ralph Shapey, and Howard Mayer Brown, and came to prominence in the 1960s as a major center of musical research and composition. &#13;</p><p>&#13;</p><p>The Department’s Performance Program involves choirs, orchestras, and ensembles, and aims at providing the students with opportunities to participate in a variety of music performances. Since the establishment of the University Symphony Orchestra, several other ensembles were formed within the Department’s Performance Program. They include the Collegium Musicum, Rockefeller Chapel Choir, Motet Choir, Contemporary Chamber Players (later to be named “Contempo”), and New Music Ensemble. The collection contains documents about the musical performances of these ensembles over the decades. Moreover, the Department of Music hosted many other programs featuring visiting musicians and orchestras, as well as lectures and conferences.&#13;</p><p>&#13;</p><p>The University of Chicago Chamber Music Series, founded in 1943, later grew into “The University of Chicago Presents” concert series with the mission of sharing world-class music through concerts and educational programs with audiences across Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. In the 1960s, the series came under the stewardship of the Department of Music at the University, where it has since resided. The University of Chicago Presents is also represented in the collection.</p></bioghist>

<p>The American Indian Press Association was a news-gathering organization devoted to increasing the participation of Native Americans in the creation and consumption of newspapers. Notable staff members included Rose Robinson, Charles Trimble, and Richard LaCourse. The AIPA was in operation from 1970 until 1976.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The AIPA records were held by the Native American Education Service (NAES) until 2008. Established in Chicago in 1974, NAES College aimed to improve the leadership of Native communities and to ensure that tribal knowledge, traditions and values play a major role in the higher education of Native students. Before closing its doors in 2007, NAES College offered a single degree, a Bachelor's of Arts in General Studies with an emphasis in Public Policy, and tribal knowledge, community service, community development and leadership.

<p>The Native American Educational Services (NAES) College began the Community Board Training Project (CBTP) as a 2 ½ year program in 1979. The CBTP continued through 1983. During that time, the CBTP was structured to help organizations serving the Native American community to function more efficiently. With Louis Delgado as its director, CBTP sponsored workshops which focused on training in the concepts behind community service agencies, including effective management and technical skills such as planning fiscal management, improving public relations, filing, hiring and using computer technology. During the course of its existence, the program expanded and sought to provide resource materials to community organizations and to offer them technical assistance.</p>

<p>Robert W. Rietz (1914-1971) was an anthropologist known for his work among Native American populations in Iowa and North Dakota, as well as the highly-esteemed Director of the American Indian Center in Chicago, where he served from 1958 until his death. Rietz was a veteran of World War II and pursued graduate studies at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Sol Tax without having attended High School. In the summer of 1948, Rietz was one of the original six members of the “Fox Project” to be sent to Tama, Iowa, alongside Lloyd Fallers, Grace Gredys, Walter Miller, Davida Wolffson, and Lisa Redfield Peattie. In his mid-thirties and as one of the most experienced members in the group, Rietz left a long-lasting impression amongst his peers and the population he worked with. Gredys recalled Rietz as lacking “respect for authority, age, and all those great things,” but as a “serious person” that nurtured with his colleague Miller a “persona of wise-cracking.” Years after he left Tama, students from the University of Chicago sent to work on the Fox field school still registered inquiries about Rietz from people he had met years earlier.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After finishing his Master’s thesis at the University of Chicago in 1950, he moved with Robert Merrill to the Indian Reservation at Fort Berthold, North Dakota. The new Fort Berthold research project, devised as part of the “action anthropology” project, was meant to assist the members of the Three Affiliated Tribes (Hidatsa, Mandan, Arikara) in relocating from their lands following the construction of the Garrison Dam, approved in the late 1940s and concluded in 1953. While Merrill pursued a strict research project and left only a few months later, Rietz remained in the Reservation as the Agency’s “community analyst.” Two years later, he was designated the Agency’s “relocation officer.” Over the course of these four years, Rietz gained the respect of the different parties of the reservation, from the Indian community to the officers of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1952, he refused to be transferred to the Sioux Cheyenne River reservation in South Dakota to start a new relocation project, stating that it was not his intention to help implement official policy on Indian Affairs that clashed with his own beliefs. Despite some reservations from fellow anthropologists, Rietz managed to strike a balance between his work as a researcher and his responsibilities as a federal agent. According to Sol Tax, Rietz’s “greatest problem turned out to be avoiding moving ‘up’ to higher positions in the B.I.A.!”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Upon his resignation from Fort Berthold, effective October 1954, Rietz returned to Chicago and the “Action Anthropology” group, taking up a research affiliation at the University of Chicago. Over the next three years he pursued a close working relationship with Native American populations in the Tama Indian Project and its summer field training school. Until becoming the Director of the American Indian Center in 1958, Rietz would remain engaged in a number of other educational and health care projects meant to provide for Native American populations, including an arts and crafts cooperative (Tamacraft), and the Summer Workshops for Native American Indian College Students, of which he was a founder, both in Colorado and in Canada. In the late 1960s, Rietz was also responsible for a course on the “History and Culture of the American Indian” at Northeastern Illinois State College.

<p>Sol Tax (1907-1996) was a prominent cultural anthropologist. He completed a Bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1931, a M.A. and Ph.D. at the University of Chicago (1932 and 1935). He took a faculty position at University of Chicago in 1940 and remained there until 1977. Tax founded the academic journal Current Anthropology (1959), served on the National Research Council Committee on Latin American Anthropology (1946-1954), served on the President's Task Force on Indian Affairs (1965-1969), was Director of the Smithsonian Institute's Center for the Study of Man (1969-1977), served as President of the American Anthropological Association (1958-1959) and edited that Association's Journal, American Anthropologist (1953-1956). He was a pioneer in the field of action anthropology, published many academic articles and corresponded with researchers and activists.

<p>
</p>
<p>Tax was an active organizer of the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference (AICC, also called the American Indian Charter Convention or Conference), which produced the path-breaking Declaration of Indian Purpose, and worked to coordinate pan-tribal research on education.

<p>The first meeting of what was to become the Northwestern Baptist Education Society was held on September 14, 1891, at 7 Custom House Place, Chicago. "The Joint Committee of the Trustees of the University of Chicago and the Theological Union" met "in response to a communication of the Ladies' Baptist Education Society." The purpose of the meeting was stated to be to form "one ministerial society, to take the place of the different organizations now working for the same end in this field," and to harmonize "interests now to some extent conflicting," and to afford "the necessary aid to students for the ministry in the Northwestern States."</p>
<p>Before the Society was fairly in working order, however, the Great Fire disorganized every plan that had been made and for the time put out of sight the work and needs of the Society. During the next few years the Executive Committee met more or less regularly and handled the business of the Society. </p>
<p>The Society had, since its founding, received the sum of $14,326.89 from fifteen states. The state conventions of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin had by this time taken official action guaranteeing cooperation with the Society and on November 18, 1876 the Society was incorporated under the general laws of Illinois. Thomas W. Goodspeed was secretary from 1876 until he resigned in 1889 to raise funds for the new University of Chicago.</p>
<p>The last meeting of the Society was held in the office of Dean Mathews on May 8, 1925.</p>

<p>Ida Elizabeth Smith Noyes was born on April 16, 1853 in Croton, Delaware County, New York to Joel W. and Susan M. Wheat Smith. The family of seven moved to Iowa in 1857. In 1870 Noyes began attending Iowa State College, then spent a term at the State University of Iowa City, finally completing college at the State University at Ames in 1874.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Noyes returned home and became a teacher in the Charles City High School. She married La Verne Noyes, an inventor and manufacturer whom she had met in college, on May 24, 1877. The couple moved to Chicago in 1879, where Noyes followed her ambition to become an artist by enrolling at the Art Institute. This interest in art led her to make a two-year trip to Europe in 1886. In a volume of the University Record from 1919, Thomas W. Goodspeed writes that driven by her artistic instinct, Noyes was “a devotee of the camera” during her years in Europe.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Noyes made other trips, including an 1892 journey to the Pacific Coast where she visited Oregon, Washington, and California. She returned to Europe in 1894, and again in 1895. In the summer of 1897, Noyes and her husband took a trip throughout the West and Northwest of the United States, eventually ending up in Alaska. Later that same year, Noyes and a friend left to spend six months traveling around the world, having been inspired by a similar journey described in East, West-Home’s Best, by Sarah A. Pope. During this trip, Noyes took almost two thousand photographs. Other travels followed, and in 1910 Noyes made her last trip abroad to London.

<p>George Wells Beadle (1903-1989) was the son of Chauncey Elmer Beadle, a farmer, and Hattie Albro. Beadle was educated at the Wahoo High School in Nebraska and may have become a farmer if one of his teachers at school had not directed him towards science and persuaded him to go to the College of Agriculture at Lincoln, Nebraska. There he took up the new field of genetics and continued on to receive his Ph.D. from Cornell University.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Beadle taught biology at Harvard, Stanford and the California Institute of Technology before coming to the University of Chicago. During his time at Stanford, Beadle began his collaboration with Edward L. Tatum. Beadle and Tatum worked to establish the relationship between genes and enzymes in the bread mold Neurospora, which would earn them the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1960, Beadle was elected Chancellor of the University of Chicago and, in autumn of the same year, President of the University. Beadle served as President and Professor of biology from 1961-1968. These were turbulent years of growth and change for universities across the country. Despite calls for universities to become centers for social and political action, Beadle held the University of Chicago steady to its traditional values of research and intellectual excellence. Beadle increased the size of the faculty, raised the average salary, and doubled campus expenditures. The three year development campaign reached its goal of $160 million and many new buildings were erected on campus. Beadle led the university through student protests concerning racial segregation in university housing policy as well as Vietnam protests against university compliance with government regulations requiring reports on the academic ranking of male students for draft purposes.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While president of the University of Chicago, Beadle continued his interest in genetics and grew corn behind his house and in other plots near campus, occasionally being mistaken for a University gardener. Beadle retired from the Presidency on his 65th birthday. He accepted the directorship of the Institute for Biomedical Research of the American Medical Association which he moved to campus, where he remained to teach and continue experiments with corn for some years. He was named William E. Wrather Professor of Biology from 1969-1975 and retired to Pomona, California with his wife Muriel in 1982.</p>

<p>Lawrence A. Kimpton (1910-1977) was raised in Kansas City, Missouri, attended college at Stanford, and completed a Ph.D. in philosophy at Cornell University in 1935. He worked in California and Nevada throughout the late 1930s, teaching at the experimental Deep Springs College and working as a cattle rancher. He came to Chicago in 1943 to work as Chief Administrative Officer of the Metallurgical Laboratory, associated with the Manhattan Project.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>University Chancellor Robert Maynard Hutchins hired Kimpton as Dean of Students in 1944. Kimpton later recalled that in his brief interview, Hutchins asked, "Don’t you think the University is lousy? Don’t you think great books are great? And isn’t the function of an educational institution to educate?" Kimpton agreed, and after also admitting he knew absolutely nothing about student matters, Hutchins immediately offered him the job. In 1947, Kimpton returned to Stanford, where he served as Dean of Students for three years. In 1950, he was re-hired by the University of Chicago as Vice-President of Development. When Hutchins resigned in 1951, Kimpton was named as his successor.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In his first years as Chancellor, Kimpton imposed significant University-wide budget cuts, balancing the university’s budget for the first time since the Depression. In 1955, he instigated a large development campaign which raised funds for expansion and endowments. Through the last five years of his tenure, Kimpton oversaw the construction of 15 new campus buildings and a 30 percent increase in faculty salaries.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While improving the university’s financial situation, Kimpton also worked to improve the Hyde Park area. Many neighborhood buildings had been poorly maintained since the Depression, and overcrowding had caused problems in infrastructure and security. Kimpton assisted in the creation of the South East Chicago Commission (SECC), a group which coordinated broad-based urban renewal projects throughout Hyde Park-Kenwood. More than 20 percent of buildings in the neighborhood were removed and rehabilitated through renewal projects. Kimpton, serving as president of the SECC, oversaw the allocation of federal, state, local, and private funds to projects aimed at improving housing, infrastructure, and safety in the Hyde Park area. Reflecting on this work, Kimpton "acknowledged that the urban renewal program did not solve the problems of the city’s slums – only that it had saved the university."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Within the academic sphere, Kimpton brought the undergraduate curriculum back into alignment with national standards and expectations. Under Hutchins, the College had accepted students after completing tenth grade, granting a bachelor’s degree after the college sophomore year. Kimpton reinstated a traditional College program, with a four-year sequence beginning after twelfth grade.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After fulfilling his three major goals of financial stability, neighborhood security, and curricular standardization, Kimpton resigned in 1960. He worked as an executive for Standard Oil of Indiana until his 1971 retirement.

<p>Originally an advertising executive and broadcasting entrepreneur, William Benton retired from the advertising world in 1935 and accepted an offer from the University of Chicago's president, Robert M. Hutchins, to undertake a short term study of the university's public relations. After completing the study, Benton assumed the post of part-time vice-president in 1937, overseeing the university's public affairs and broadcasting initiatives until 1945.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As part of Benton's plan to improve the University of Chicago's public image in the wake of accusations that it was a haven for left-wing radicalism, as well as to increase its visibility and prestige, both Benton and Hutchins gave a great number of public talks, especially to the business community. Moreover, Benton's office arranged for Hutchins and prominent faculty members to write articles and be interviewed as experts for various media.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of Benton's most successful projects was the University of Chicago's Round Table radio program, which was launched as a local broadcast in 1931 and was picked up by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1933. It was thereafter aired as a national broadcast until 1955. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a private trust providing grants for projects related to science, technology, and economic performance, began sponsoring the weekly broadcasts in 1938.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The standard Round Table format involved three speakers, usually two university faculty members and one guest speaker, and dealt with contemporary – often controversial – social, political and economic issues. Though it quickly emerged as one of the most popular radio programs of the time, it was also criticized for having a leftist bias, especially by NBC. The latter pushed for more network control over its content and sought to impose commercial standards on its scholarly approach. Alfred P. Sloan, himself, criticized the program after a 1945 broadcast in which the liberal economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek faced off with two faculty members, Charles E. Merriam and Maynard C. Krueger. Sloan viewed the program as unfairly harsh in its treatment of Hayek, and this temporarily jeopardized the program's relationship with the Foundation. During the Second World War, most of the Round Table's programming was related to developments in the war and the American military effort.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Benton also successfully launched the radio program The Human Adventure, which aired 1939-1945. The program showcased faculty research on a wide range of topics, including scientific, historical and cultural phenomena; however, it was less successful than the Round Table at attracting a broad audience. Aside from radio, Benton was keen to develop the University of Chicago's capacity for producing educational films, but his efforts in this realm were not as fruitful as his radio endeavors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In early 1942, Benton was appointed by the U.S. War Department as Coordinator of the Orientation Courses of the Bureau of Public Relations for the Sixth Corps Area (comprising Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan). This position involved organizing lectures on different regions of the world, political developments, and international relations for the officer orientation courses held by the various Midwestern military camps of this area. In 1945, Benton officially left the university, accepting the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, which involved consolidating wartime information agencies and creating new information bodies for the post-war era.</p>

<p>Off- Off Campus is the second oldest continuously running student improvisation theater troupe in the country, with the first generation of actors dating back to 1986. Improvisational and sketch comedy first started at the University of Chicago in the 1950’s as a group of students formed the Compass players on campus, which in 1959 became The Second City. In 1986, U of C Alum and Second City co-founder Bernie Sahlins (A.B. ’43) returned the University campus in order to begin a south side group to rival his north side creation. Sahlins trained the first generation of Off-Off Campus in the art of sketch and improve comedy, using the same technique he had developed and taught 27 year prior within his classroom. The group has continued to use this same regiment of training since.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The troupe is set to the rhythm of the University of Chicago quarter system, casting a new “generation” each fall, who regularly produce a theater revue in the autumn, winter, and spring. The group also brought comedy to the orientation week (O-Week) of the University of Chicago and many other Midwest schools as they used sketch comedy as a means of transmitting messages and mirth to incoming freshman. For a period of time, the group also participated in the international Fringe Theater festival.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Some of the groups alumni have gone on to further success in theater and comedy including David Auburn, winner of the Pulitzer prize for his show (and now film) Proof, Greg Kotis, best known for penning the Tony award winning musical Urinetown, and Tami Sagher, writer on the television series “30 Rock.” Early comedic sketches written by David Auburn and Tami Sagher can be found within the collection.

<p>The "Origin of Man" symposium was held April 2-4, 1965, at the Center for Continuing Education. It was organized and convened by Sol Tax, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago, and sponsored by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The symposium was a working conference of anthropologists, designed to assist the participants in re-thinking and reformulating their views on the origin of man in the light of new information on the subject.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The symposium was occasioned by Louis S.B. Leakey's visit to the United States. L.S.B. Leakey was the principal anthropologist involved with the archeological work at the Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika, where the partial remains of several early men were discovered. It was Leakey's theory that three types of early man-like beings, habilis, Pithecanthropis, and Australopithecus, were living in the gorge simultaneously. This view of man's origin in opposed to the view traditionally held by anthropologists that of a single line of descent for man.

<p>Melchior Palyi was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1892. He received his Doctorate in Economics from the University of Munich in 1915. From 1918 to 1933 Palyi taught at the University of Munich, the University of Goettingen and the University of Kiel. In 1927, he first came to the United States as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago. 1928 saw Palyi as an economist at the Deutsche Bank. Until 1931, Palyi was also a Professor of Finance at the Graduate School of Commerce in Berlin. For the next three years he held two posts important in the financial reconstruction of the German economy: he was the principal economic advisor to the Reichsbank and the Managing Director of the Institute for Currency Research, Berlin.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By 1933, Palyi had immigrated to the United States. He became a visiting professor and research economist at the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin. During the years 1943-1944, Palyi gave a series of radio talks on WIND, dealing with economic and social problems caused by the war in Europe. In 1945, he became a war correspondent and wrote articles for the Chicago Tribune and the Jackson Citizen Patriot newspapers. After the war, Palyi returned to Chicago and continued teaching and lecturing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The 1950s saw Palyi producing such works as Compulsory Medical Care and the Welfare State (1950), The Dollar Dilemma: Perpetual Aid to Europe, and Managed Money at the Crossroads (1958). Palyi, as seen through his books and articles, represented the "conservative" faction of American economists during the middle of the 20th century.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1960, Melchior Palyi became a visiting professor and research economist at Northwestern University. From 1961 to 1968 Palyi wrote a weekly column for the Chicago Tribune entitled, "Comment," which dealt with various economic problems in the United States and the world as well as local problems. Also in 1961, Palyi produced a small but foresighted book that he entitled An Inflation Primer. This book attempted to get at the various causes for spiraling inflation and the accompanying recessionary periods. From 1962 to 1970, Palyi also wrote a regular column for the Chicago Commercial and Financial Chronicle which was entitled "Point of View."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Melchior Palyi, after 78 years of studying, advising, and teaching about world economics, died on July 29, 1970. In 1971 one of his greatest works was published posthumously. The Twilight of Gold dealt with a subject that fascinated Palyi all of his life: the gold standard. In this book he talks about the classical gold standard, the post-World War I monetary climate and its relationship to gold stabilization (which includes an interesting section entitled "Social Justice vs. Gold") and the New Gold Standard. "Prelude to Catastrophe" is a section which discusses flaws in the international credit structure and the American debt behemoth and the speculative euphoria. "Destabilization (1931-1936)" deals with the demise of the "Gold Bloc." The final section of the text proper deals with the demise of the gold standard. Additionally, there is a postscript entitled "Does History Repeat Itself?"

<p>Francis W. Parker [1837-1902], leading American educator, was called by John Dewey "more than any other person... the father of the progressive education movement." His teaching career, begun ca. 1857 was interrupted by the Civil War; by the end of the war Parker had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and for the remainder of his life was known as "Colonel Parker." A $5,000 legacy enabled him to study at the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin and to travel in Holland, Switzerland, Italy, and France, from 1872 to 1875 where he encountered the educational theories of Pestalozzi, Herbart, and Froebel. After returning to the United States, he was appointed superintendent of schools in Quincy, Massachusetts; here his educational innovations, labelled the "Quincy movement," made him a national reputation. In 1883, after several frustrating years in the Boston school system, Parker became principal of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago--an institution devoted to the training of elementary school teachers. Among the supporters of Parker's work in Chicago were Jane Addams, Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, and Anita McCormack Blaine [Mrs. Emmons Blaine].</p>
<p>In 1899, Mrs. Blaine, in order to free Parker from the continual harassment of politicians and the school board, offered to endow a private school for Parker and his faculty; accordingly, in that year, the Chicago Institute was established. Land was purchased, architectual drawings for the proposed Institute were prepared, and temporary classes begun when William Rainey Harper proposed that the Chicago Institute join with the Department of Education to form the School of Education of the University of Chicago. The merger was to become official on July 1, 1901, and, at the June, 1901 Convocation, ground was broken for the School of Education Building, "Emmons Blaine Hall." At the same time, an elementary school "extension"--known as the Francis W. Parker School--was established on the North Side of the city for the benefit of the sizeable contingent of Chicago Institute pupils who resided there. Parker became Director of the School of Education, while John Dewey (at the University since 1894) remained Head Professor in the Department of Education in the Graduate Schools of Art, Literature, and Science. However, on March 2, 1902, Parker, who had been in ill-health since the beginning of the year, died at the age of 64. The trustees of the Chicago Institute recommended to the Board of Trustees of the University of Chicago that John Dewey be appointed as Parker's successor, and this was accordingly done.</p>

<p>Pi Lambda Theta is an honor society for educators which was founded in 1910 by the Dean of Education at the University of Missouri, Dr. W.W. Charters. As a member of Phi Beta Kappa, an honor society who admitted only men at the time, Dr. Charters sought to create a similar honor and professional society for women educators. Six other Midwestern institutions had joined the University of Missouri in creating local charters by 1916. In 1917, the society increased its regional scope to a national one, and by the 2000s, it had sixty-three regional, national, and international charters and 15,000 men and women members.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The mission of the Pi Lambda Theta is to honor academic excellence, promote leadership among educators, encourage educational research, and make available to members activities and resources for pursuing these goals.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pi Lambda Theta installed the Lambda Chapter at the University of Chicago in June, 1921. Its meetings were held on campus in Judd Hall where the Department of Education was housed. Different members of the Education Faculty served as Faculty Advisers to the Chapter. It appears that the Lambda Chapter was dissolved in the mid 1990s when the University of Chicago closed the Department of Education.

<p>Robert Swanton Platt (1891-1964) was born in Columbus, Ohio, studied at St. George's School and the Hotchkiss School, and graduated from Yale in 1914. After teaching for a year at Yale in China at Changsha, he returned to the United States to enter the Department of Geography of the University of Chicago in 1915. Despite the interruption of military service during World War I, he completed his Ph.D. and was appointed an instructor in the Department in 1920. For the next thirty-seven years, Platt remained at the University of Chicago as assistant professor (1921-1927), associate professor (1927-1939), professor (1939-1957), and chairman (1949-1957) of the Department of Geography.</p>
<p>The central concern of Platt's work as a geographer was the intensive field study of small geographical areas that could provide data to support broader theoretical generalizations on the interrelation of landforms and human occupancy. Beginning in 1920 and continuing for more than thirty years, Platt led graduate students in his field courses on annual summer trips to Ellison Bay, Wisconsin, the upper Great Lakes region, and along the U.S.-Canadian border from Manitoba to Quebec. Conclusions drawn from these studies were distilled for presentation at the annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers and subsequently published as a regular series of articles in professional journals.</p>
<p>Platt followed a similar procedure in surveying Central and South American geography. On seven trips to the Caribbean and Latin America between 1922 and 1941 (each lasting from two to six months), Platt and his wife, Harriet, alternated lengthy traverses of continental regions with careful micro-studies of specific villages and farms. These studies, which eventually numbered nearly one hundred, formed the basis for Platt's monographic text, Latin America: Countrysides and United Regions (1942). In later years, Platt utilized the field methods developed in the 1920's and 1930's to examine a variety of other geographic settings: Tierra del Fuego (1948); the Dutch-German border (1952-1954); the Saarland (1958-1959); volcanic activity in Mexico, Hawaii, and Italy (1958-1960); and Pakistan (1961). In each of these projects, as in the edited collection of essays published as Field Study in American Geography (1958), Platt stressed the spatial complexity of human social and cultural patterns and warned against the conceptual dangers of environmental determinism.</p>
<p>While fieldwork formed the foundation of his reputation, Platt was equally well known for his interest in general geographical theory and the development of geography as a professional discipline. From 1923 to 1940, he was a regular participant in the spring field conference of American geographers first organized by Wellington Jones and Carl Sauer. He served the Association of American Geographers for many years as its treasurer (1929-1934), vice-president (1943), president (1945), and as editor of the Annals of the A.A.G. from 1961 to 1964. Outside the discipline, Platt advanced the interests of professional geography as vice-chairman of the Division of Geology and Geography of the National Research Council (1937-1939); as adviser to the Geographer of the U.S. State Department (1943); and most notably as chief of the Division of Maps at the Library of Congress (1944-1945) during Federal wartime mobilization. Even after his retirement in 1957, Platt's interest in professionalism and methodology was reflected in his organization of the Pakistan Field Geographers while a Fulbright Scholar in 1962 and his course on Geographic Thought given as a visiting professor at Indiana University in 1963.</p>
<p>Platt's skill as a teacher and his generous encouragement of the work of others contributed to the high regard in which he was held by both students and colleagues. Together with Harriet, he opened his home at 10820 S. Drew to successive generations of foreign and American students in geography and other fields, many of who lived with the Platts for more than a year and came to style themselves "Plattaches." The Platt home was also the scene of frequent gatherings of Department of Geography faculty, staff, students, and alumni, and of meetings with geographers from other universities. Following Platt's death in 1964, several of these friends and colleagues joined in erecting a monument in his memory in Ellison Bay, Wisconsin, on the site of his earliest contributions to field methodology and in tribute to the teacher and scholar who represented "in remarkable degree," as Richard Hartshorne has noted, "the development of American geography during his lifetime."</p>

<p>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse was founded in 1912 by Chicago poet Harriet Monroe. Taking Whitman's line, "To have great poets there must be great audiences too" as her motto, Monroe sought to cultivate a wide readership for new writing and ideas. By insisting on paying all contributors and establishing an annual prize, Poetry magazine raised the visibility and status of poetry. The journal published and promoted the careers of a galaxy of poets who came to define twentieth century modernism, including T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost, and Langston Hughes, among many others. Poetry transformed the way that poetry and poets are recognized and read worldwide, and it continues to flourish as a major cultural influence.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Monroe funded the early publication of Poetry with subscriptions and contributions from wealthy Chicago patrons. As editor, she shepherded the magazine through into its third decade. Following Monroe's death in 1936, editorship passed to Morton Dauwen Zabel (1936-1937), followed by George Dillon (1937-1949), Hayden Carruth (acting editor, 1949), Karl Shapiro (1950-1954) and Henry Rago (1955-1969).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1931, Harriet Monroe presented her poetry library, her personal papers, and the editorial files of Poetry magazine to the University of Chicago. Following her death, the Monroe library and Poetry archives were received as a bequest and installed in a specially designated room in Wieboldt Hall, the modern languages building on the campus of the University of Chicago. The Modern Poetry Library room provided book shelves for the poetry collection, display cases for the letters and manuscripts of notable poets in the Poetry archives, and equipment for listening to recordings of poets reading their works.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The formal opening of the Harriet Monroe Library of Modern Poetry was marked by a festive dinner of the University of Chicago Friends of the Library on May 24, 1938. Guest speakers paying tribute to Harriet Monroe's achievements included Carl Sandburg, Archibald MacLeish, Ford Maddox Ford, George Dillon, and Sterling North. Messages lauding Monroe's remarkable influence were received from many of the poets she had encouraged and promoted, including Ezra Pound, Walter De La Mare, William Rose Benet, Witter Bynner, John Gould Fletcher, Edgar Lee Masters, Lew Sarett, Jean Starr Untermeyer, and John Hall Wheelock, among others.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to the gift of her library and archives, Harriet Monroe's will provided $5,000 to establish a fund for the advancement and encouragement of poetry through the award of a $500 prize for distinction in poetry. Monroe stipulated that the committee of award for the prize should give preference to "poets of progressive rather than academic tendencies." The inaugural Harriet Monroe Poetry Award, given at the University of Chicago in June 1941, was presented to twenty-eight-year-old Muriel Rukeyser. Among those receiving the award in later years were Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, and Robert Lowell.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1953, the Harriet Monroe Modern Poetry Library was incorporated within the newly established Department of Special Collections of the University of Chicago Library. In 2002, this department became the Special Collections Research Center. The Modern Poetry book collection, enlarged continuously on an annual basis with the support of an endowed acquisition fund, is divided between a poetry collection in the general stacks of Regenstein Library and the Modern Poetry rare books and serials in the Special Collections Research Center. The editorial archives of Poetry magazine, the personal papers of Harriet Monroe, and the papers of other modern poets, editors and publishers of poetry are held as part of the manuscript collections in the Special Collections Research Center.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The editorial archives of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse acquired by bequest from Harriet Monroe included extensive files of correspondence and poetry manuscripts from the time of her founding of the journal in 1912 until her death in 1936. Subsequently, the University of Chicago Library acquired two additional series of editorial files documenting Poetry and its authors during the years 1936-1953 and 1954-1961. Together, these three series of files preserve the letters and writings of a significant and remarkably diverse group of modern poets of the first half of the twentieth century. Eliot, Pound, Williams, Moore, Yeats, Sandburg, Thomas, and Frost are represented, along with Vachel Lindsay, Conrad Aiken, Wallace Stevens, Yvor Winters, Sara Teasdale, James Joyce, Edgar Lee Masters, Alfred Kreymborg, Ford Maddox Ford, Louis Zukofsky, Hart Crane, Witter Bynner, and Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wilbur, and many others.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Michael Polanyi was born in Budapest in 1891, and though his career as a scientist and philosopher led him far from his native Hungary, the intellectual milieu of his childhood remained a life-long influence on his work. His father was an engineer and businessman and his Russian mother, Cecile, wrote a fashion column for the German-language newspaper in Budapest. Throughout the early years of Polanyi's childhood, the family was financially successful, but most of their resources were lost before the first World War, leaving the children largely dependent on Polanyi's brother Karl for support. Despite this poor financial situation, Cecile Polanyi maintained a salon for Hungarian literary figures.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Polanyi grew up in a literate, political world. With his brother Karl and friend Oscar Jászi, a young Polanyi helped to found the Galilei Circle, a Hungarian nationalist group which promoted Hungarian cultural traditions and worked for an independent Hungarian state. Polanyi became a Doctor of Medicine at Budapest University in 1913 and served as a medical officer in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. His earliest scientific paper, "Chemistry of Hydrocephalic Liquid," was published at age 19. Throughout the war, he worked on the application of quantum theory to the third law of thermodynamics and on the thermodynamics of adsorption. In 1916, he published his work on adsorption, one of the first of over two hundred scientific papers he was to publish before his move into philosophy in 1948. His theory of adsorption was accepted by the chemistry faculty of Budapest University which awarded him a Ph.D. in 1917.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following the war, in the autumn of 1920, Polanyi received an appointment to the new Institute of Fibre Chemistry in Berlin, part of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. His early years in Berlin are recounted in the 1962 essay, My Time with X-Rays and Crystals. Fritz Haber, the Director of the prestigious Institute of Physical Chemistry, sent Polanyi off to expand his laboratory skills in order to achieve full acceptance by the German scientific community. He succeeded in this with a study of x-ray diffraction of cellulose fibers, and in 1923 he was appointed to the Institute of Physical Chemistry to work under Haber. During the following ten years in Berlin, Polanyi established himself as one of Germany's leading physical chemists. He worked with some of the most prominent scientists of the age, including Eugene Wigner with whom he was to share a life-long friendship.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For Polanyi, who was a Jew, the coming to power of Hitler and the National Socialist Party marked the end of his career in Germany. In 1933, prompted by repeated attacks on Jewish intellectuals, Polanyi accepted a chair in physical chemistry created for him at the University of Manchester. He continued with the chemical studies begun in Berlin, and his laboratory at Manchester attracted students and established scientists from all over the world. His contacts with non-refugee German scientists decreased, but from 1933 to 1948 (the year Polanyi accepted the chair of Social Studies at Manchester), his contacts with British scientists increased, and eventually included William H. Bragg and his son William L. Bragg, Arthur Allmand, Patrick Blackett, Christopher Ingold, Cyril Hinshelwood, and Eric Rideal. There are a number of exchanges from this period with Max Born and Erwin Schrödinger, but perhaps his most important associate during this period was Japanese chemist Juro Horiuchi.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During these first years in England, Polanyi turned his interest to the philosophical attack presented free societies by the totalitarian governments of Germany and Russia. In 1935, he published his first non-scientific work, "U.S.S.R. Economics—Fundamental Data System and Spirit." This was accompanied by a film which criticized the system of Soviet economics as an attack on liberty. While devoting most of his time to scientific pursuits, Polanyi spent part of the next five years in work on The Contempt of Freedom (1940), his large-scale critique of totalitarian government. In the early 1930s, Polanyi had visited the Soviet Union and had become friends with two Soviet chemists, Alexander Frumkin and Nicolai Semenoff. Both were to write him asking that he stop his attacks on Soviet economic policies.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A devoted Keynesian, Polanyi's writings on economic subjects are divided between attacks on the Soviet system and lucid commentaries on the work of Lord Keynes. Between 1935 and c1950, Polanyi corresponded with a number of important economists including Friedrich A. Hayek, David Caradog Jones, Wolfe Mays, and John Maynard Keynes. His position as a scientist and a social thinker led him to become involved with a group of intellectuals in England concerned with social problems. This group, the Moot, was convened by Joseph H. Oldham, editor of the Christian Newsletter.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The war was passed in divided intellectual pursuits. Polanyi continued his scientific studies and tried to obtain military projects through Sir William Lawrence Bragg. At the same time he wrote on economic subjects. It was during these years that he helped to found, with John R. Baker, the Society for Freedom in Science which he used as a forum for developing his ideas on scientific liberty.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The philosophic ideas of Michael Polanyi first took characteristic shape during the war years. His opposition of planning in science led to an epistemology of science grounded in a belief in an individual nature of discovery, unhindered by official or dogmatic interference. In 1945, Polanyi published Science, Faith and Society, his first large-scale philosophic work and the foundation for his theory of knowledge. The evolution of Polanyi's thought is traceable in the Papers through a number of manuscripts, beginning with his 1936 On Truth, On Reason and Science and Liberty and continuing with his studies of scientific planning throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1950, the date of the first of his University of Chicago lecture series, The Logic of Liberty, his interest in philosophy dominated all other intellectual concerns.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1951, Polanyi was offered a position at the University of Chicago on the Committee on Social Thought and was awarded a large grant by the Rockefeller Foundation. The State Department, however, held up his immigrant visa under the McCarran Act until Polanyi withdrew it, consequently remaining in Manchester. He was suspected of past involvement in a subversive organization, the Galilei Circle of his Hungarian youth. Ironically, he was involved with the most significant intellectual anti-Communist force in post-war Europe, the Congress for Cultural Freedom. When Princeton University made Polanyi an honorary Doctor of Science during its 1949 bicentennial celebration, he was cited as "a veteran campaigner against those who would take from science the freedom she requires for the pursuit of truth." His book, The Logic of Liberty, 1950, would continue his attack on Soviet infringement of personal liberty begun nearly twenty years before.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following this debacle, Polanyi became a regular visitor to the United States and the University of Chicago. Two of his lecture series here were ultimately published as The Logic of Liberty (1950) and Meaning (1936). Between 1951 and 1958, when he retired from Manchester to accept a position of senior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford, Polanyi wrote his central philosophical work, Personal Knowledge. Personal Knowledge grew out of Polanyi's 1951 Gifford lectures.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Another aspect of Michael Polanyi's life, political involvement, can be traced throughout the collection. Prominence as a scientist and anti-Communist social thinker led Polanyi to recognition as an important commentator on current affairs. Throughout World War II, his letters, articles, and reviews appeared in various British journals, particularly the Manchester Guardian.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Polanyi was a major figure in the debate over intellectual liberty and most particularly the issue of planning in science. He was co-founder with John R. Baker of the Society for Freedom in Science in 1941. In the post-war period, Polanyi was an active participant in the organization of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and its English affiliate, the Committee on Science and Freedom. His close involvement with these organizations is best illustrated in the correspondence through exchanges with such figures as Raymond Aron, Konstantin A. Jelenski, Shepard Stone, and Michael Josselson.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By 1972, age and infirmity had slowed Professor Polanyi's work. His final years were spent at home in Oxford and in a Northampton nursing home. During this period, Polanyi's wife of fifty-six years, Magda Kemeney Polanyi, managed his affairs. She supervised the translation of Personal Knowledge into German and was responsible for decisions concerning the disposition of Professor Polanyi's papers and library. Michael Polanyi died in the hospital at Northampton on February 22, 1976. He was eighty-four.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Primavera was a feminist literary magazine founded at the University of Chicago in 1975. It was conceived of by Janet Ruth Heller, Celia Josephson, and Deborah Gordon Fisher, and was proposed at the first meeting of the University of Chicago Feminist Organization. The intention was to give women an outlet for their creative work and also to counterbalance another campus publication, Wild Onions, which at the time published work mainly by men. The magazine had several unique attributes from its inception, particularly the invitation extended to all contributing authors and artists to sit on its editorial board, and the commitment to providing feedback for manuscripts that were not selected for publication. These practices could not be sustained for the life of the magazine, however, and by Issue 8 it was operating with a 6-person editorial board. In the mid-1980s the policy of returning all manuscripts with feedback was modified and authors given the option to request comments on their work.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Initially a student organization, the magazine received funding from the University, though that had to be supplemented by grants and loans to cover printing costs. In the 1980s Primavera began to have difficulty in continuing to secure University funding due to their women-only acceptance policy, though it remained affiliated with the University of Chicago until 1990. When the magazine went its own way, a nonprofit corporation was established (Moveable Type, Inc.), under whose auspices operations continued. It was around this time that Primavera began accepting submissions from men, though the focus remained on the lives and experiences of women.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Primavera came into being among many similar publications, among them Black Maria, Calyx, and Sing, Heavenly Muse! While these were all in some sense women's literary journals, they varied in focus. Primavera is notable for its lack of political content; very few essays were published, and the editorial focus was on the artistic merit of the pieces selected. The magazine was more concerned with reflecting the experiences of women than with encouraging activism or overt political messaging. The women reflected in its pages were often older than the demographic reflected by many feminist magazines, were more likely to come from the Midwest (or other areas besides the Northeast and West Coast, which were well represented in the mainstream feminist movement and its associated publications), and there was less of an emphasis on lesbian issues or experiences in Primavera than in some journals.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Issues for the feminist movement at large were also issues for Primavera. That Primavera was a Midwestern magazine placed it somewhat outside the (largely coastal) mainstream of the feminist movement. There was some initial difficulty in getting the magazine reviewed in Ms., which the editors may have felt had to do with the differing values, experiences, and needs of women in large coastal cities and women in the Midwest and south.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The magazine was the recipient of multiple Illinois Arts Council grants and literary awards, awards from Chicago Women in Publishing, and a Puffin Foundation grant used to translate poems by women from around the world. Notable authors who appeared in its pages include Louise Erdrich, 1997 Pulitzer Prize winner Lisel Mueller, Pamela Gemin, Michael Lee West, Diane Seuss, Lori Ostlund, and Chitra Divakaruni.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Members of Primavera's editorial board undertook other publishing-related work as well. In 1986 designer Lisa Grayson and editor Ruth Young worked on a side project preparing and publishing a booklet of early poems by Margaret Pearce Rummel, entitled The Other Side of the Hill. Grayson also work as a designer for other periodicals.</p>

<p>Eugene I. Rabinowitch was born in St. Petersburg in April 1898. In 1918, he fled the Red Terror in Soviet Russia with his parents. They went first to Kiev where Eugene briefly enrolled at the University of Kiev, thento Warsaw where Rabinowitch continued his studies. In 1920, the family moved to Berlin.</p>
<p/>
<p>Rabinowitch studied at the University of Berlin, receiving a PhD in in Chemistry 1925 with a thesis entitled “Über die Darstellung des Zinnwasserstoffs und die Eigenschaften der flüchtigen Hydride” (“Tin Hydrides and Volatile Hydrides”). As a former Russian citizen, he found it difficult to gain an academic position, but following the publication of his book Rare Gases, he became a research fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He later moved to the University of Gottingen, joining Professor James Franck.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>When his fellowship was suspended in 1933, Rabinowitch joined the stream of eminent refugees fleeing Germany. At the invitation of Niels Bohr, he spent a year in Copenhagen, before moving to University College, London, where he worked as a research associate to chemist Frederick G. Donnan. He remained in England for four years.</p>


<p>
</p>
<p>While lecturing in the United States in 1938, Rabinowitch accepted a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the Cabot Solar Energy Research Project. In the spring of 1944 he took a leave of absence from M. I. T. to join the Manhattan Project, serving as the chief chemist and section chief in the information division at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. "My work there," Rabinowitch wrote in 1959,"had to do with the exchange and coordination of information between Chicago, Oak Ridge, Hanford and Los Alamos."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rabinowitch was concerned about the repercussions of the use of nuclear weapons. In June 1945, with a group of scientists led by James Franck, and including Szilard, Seaborg, and Nickson, Rabinowitch helped to draft what has become known as the "Franck Report," addressed to Secretary of War Henry Stimson, warning of an impending nuclear arms race without effective international control.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The same year, with fellow alumni of the Chicago Laboratory Hyman Goldsmith and John Simpson, Rabinowitch founded the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. After Goldsmith's death in 1949, Rabinowitch became the Bulletin's editor-in-chief.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rabinowitch's status as a molder of opinion among American scientists, his numerous European contacts, and his fluency in Russian made inevitable his role as a leader of the"Pugwash" movement. The call for an international conference of scientists to discuss the perils of the nuclear age was raised by India's Prime Minister Nehru in 1954. The suggestion was taken up in an exchange of letters between Rabinowitch, as representative of the Federation of Atomic Scientists, and the representative of the Atomic Scientists Association of Great Britain, Joseph Rotblat. The Soviets entered the discussions indirectly through an organization of non-scientists, the Association of Parliamentarians for World Government, which held its conference in London in August 1955; Rabinowitch and Rotblat were among the conferees. Subsequently Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell's joint"appeal" for an international conference of scientists gave impetus to these preliminary organizational attempts. The"appeal" plus the financial assistance of Cyrus Eaton enabled the first Pugwash Conference to convene in 1957 at Eaton's estate, Pugwash, Nova Scotia. Rabinowitch, a founder of the organization, served as a member of the International Continuing Committee of Pugwash from 1957 to 1973 and was president of the movement from 1969 to 1970.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After the first conference the scientists met many more times. Originally, the talks centered upon the scientific implications of atomic energy such as the dangers of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere and the effect of strontium 90 upon the genetic future of humanity. In later meetings the discussions probed the problems of underdeveloped nations and the cooperative roles that science and government should play to increase the food supply, check the population growth, and raise industrial production in these critical parts of the world.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> Rabinowitch served as professor of of botany and biophysics at the University of Illinois in Urbana from 1947 to 1968, when became professor of biology and chemistry and as senior advisor to the newly-established Center for Science and the Future of Human Affairs (later called the Center for the Study of Science and Society) at the State University of New York at Albany. Rabinowitch's son, Victor, was director of the Center from 1968 to 1970. Following Victor's resignation, Eugene Rabinowitch served as acting director from March to September 1970. Rabinowitch retired from SUNY Albany on August 31, 1972 and was reappointed as a visiting professor for the 1972-1973 school year. At this time Rabinowitch was given a leave of absence from the University in order to accept a fellowship with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institute. While in Washington, he continued to write, edit the Bulletin, and participate in Pugwash. </p>

<p>Rabinowitch married Anya Mejerson on March 12, 1932. Their twin sons, Alexander and Victor, were born in London in 1934. Eugene I. Rabinowitch died on May 15, 1973 in Washington, D.C.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Margaret Gilpin Reid (1896-1991) was an economist whose research interests centered on household production and consumption, and later on the relationships between health, income, and productivity. Her work on the importance of non-market activities such as housework is considered to have anticipated "New Home Economics" in the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Reid was born in Canada and completed a degree in Home Economics at the University of Manitoba in 1921. She received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1931. She taught briefly at Connecticut College, moving on to Iowa State College (Iowa State University) where she taught and researched until 1945. Her first book, Economics of Household Production, was published in 1934. Reid, like her PhD advisor Hazel Kyrk, sought to theorize the productive contribution made by domestic activities within the household. She drew much of her data from experimental agricultural stations in the Midwest. Her attention to labour skills and technologies applied in the home led her to conclude that the household was not only a site of consumption, but of production. Feminist economists would later argue that this work was underappreciated and even ignored, pointing out its similarity to Gary Becker's 1965 Nobel-prize winning theory of time allocation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Reid served as an economic advisor to the Division of Statistical Standards during 1943 and 1944. She moved permanently to Washington the following year, where she served as the Head of Family Economics for the Department of Agriculture. She returned to academia in 1948, taking up a position in economics at the University of Chicago, Urbana-Champaign. She was also a member of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, reporting on price inflation and family budgets to its Committee on Postwar Agricultural Policy. Reid's tenure at Iowa State and at UIUC involved her in controversies about academic freedom: in Iowa, faculty chafed at the dairy lobby's control over the administration, while in Illinois a series of resignations protested the administration's removal of a popular Dean.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1951 Reid returned to the University of Chicago as a Professor of Home Economics and Economics. Although she became emeritus in 1961, she continued to research and write until her death in 1991. Her work at Chicago brought her in contact with economists such as Theodore W. Schultz (a colleague from Iowa) and Milton Friedman. She was an active member of Gary Becker's Applications of Economics Workshop. In later years her work was preoccupied with the relationship between demographic factors such as age, race, health, and income, and productivity and consumption.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The American Economic Association named Reid a Distinguished Fellow in 1980, recognizing her as a "truly tireless colleague" whose contributions to the field were complemented by a "felicitous sense of humour." In 1996 Feminist Economics devoted an issue to recognizing her research, and scholarship continues to try to restore her status as a pioneering economist.</p>

<p>Rachel Marshall Goetz was born in 1904 in Delaware, Ohio. The daughter of University of Chicago Business School founder and dean, Leon Carroll Marshall, she attended the University’s Laboratory School, the College and the Graduate School of Business, earning a master’s degree in business in 1927. She lived in Hyde Park for 65 years and maintained close ties to the community throughout her life.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Early in her career, Goetz worked with her friend Ursula Batchelder Stone, the first woman to be granted a Ph. D. in business at the University of Chicago. They formed the Batchelder and Marshall Research Organization, authoring several studies including "Chicago’s Stake in International Trade." She also worked closely with the Illinois League of Women Voters.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1949, after the death of her husband, Roger Goetz, she undertook significant work on the use of new media by state and local governments. Rachel Goetz wrote several pamphlets and articles on the use of visual aids in public service and developed a course on educational television, which she taught at the University of Chicago during the 1954-1955 academic year. Goetz also won the competition to name Chicago’s public television station’s call letters with her entry, "WTTW, Chicago’s Window to the World."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1955, Goetz joined the presidential campaign staff of Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson. She worked as a speechwriter, helping to craft Stevenson’s statements on a variety of issues, with special focus on the female vote. She maintained a close relationship with Stevenson through the late 1950s and early 1960s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Goetz focused considerable time and energy on the Hyde Park-Kenwood urban renewal project. She was a founding member of the Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference, and she sat on the board of the South East Chicago Commission. Goetz was influential in the establishment of the Hyde Park Co-op grocery store, and she helped in the planning of the Kenwood Shopping Center on 53rd street.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1972, Goetz moved to Alexandria, Virginia and focused her energy on creating ornamental eggs, a decorative art form exemplified by the work of Carl Peter Fabergé. Her work has been widely praised within the egg artist community, and has been displayed at the Smithsonian Institution, Mount Vernon, the Illinois state capitol, the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Goetz funded a fellowship in her father’s name at the Graduate School of Business. Later, this fellowship’s funding enabled the establishment of the Leon Carroll Marshall and Mary Keen Marshall Scholarship and the Roger L. and Rachel M. Goetz Professorship in Creative Management. Goetz died on November 15, 1994

<p>David Riesman (born September 22, 1909, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 10, 2002, Binghamton, New York) was an American sociologist, attorney, writer, and educator. He is best known as the author of The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character (with Reuel Denney and Nathan Glazer, 1950), an examination of post-WWII American society. The book struck a chord with readers and became a bestseller, contributing the terms "inner-directed," "outer-directed," and "tradition-directed" to discourse on the social character of modern Americans in an age of burgeoning prosperity and consumerism.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Riesman was educated at Harvard University, receiving an A.B. in biochemistry in 1931 and a law degree in 1934. Following law school, he clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis for a year, then taught law at the University of Buffalo from 1937 to 1941 (now the State University of New York at Buffalo). He also served as a deputy assistant district attorney in Manhattan in 1940, where he contributed to the state legislature's anti-Communist Rapp-Coudert committee hearings. Riesman spent World War II working as an executive at the Sperry Gyroscope Company.

<p>Earl Edgar Rosenthal (b. August 26, 1921, d. September 13, 2007) was an art history professor at the University of Chicago for over forty years, scholar of Spanish renaissance art and architecture, and War World II veteran. After receiving his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee in 1943, he served with the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He pursued further studies in art history at New York University and completed a dissertation on the Cathedral of Granada in 1953 (published by Princeton, 1961). After brief work for the Milwaukee Art Institute and Layton Art Gallery, he was appointed assistant professor of art at the University of Chicago in 1954, where he developed his entire professorial career, becoming full professor in art history by the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1963, Rosenthal received a Guggenheim grant, and a year later, he published a highly influential article in the Art Bulletin entitled "Michelangelo's Moses, dal di sotto in su" (December 1964). In his careful study of this work, already vastly examined, Rosenthal nonetheless observed that the extremes in proportion of the Moses statue only made sense in the context of its original purpose, to be placed high on Julius II's tomb. Thus, Rosenthal's postulation that the Moses only made sense when seen "looking up from below" demonstrates his astute examinations and original thinking.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rosenthal was known for teaching courses on the diffusion of the renaissance arts throughout Europe and for highlighting Spain's important contributions to this period of art history. He published a monograph in 1985 entitled The Palace of Charles V in Granada. In 1995, Professor Rosenthal retired to Santa Barbara, where he died at the age of 86.</p>

<p>Jean-Baptiste Say was born on January 5, 1767, in Lyon, France, to Jean-Etienne Say and Fraçoise Brun de Castanet. He had three siblings, Denis Say, Jean Henri Say, and Lous Auguste Horace Say (who was also an economist). In 1785, Say traveled to England with his brother, Horace, to complete his education at a private school in Croydon. Say returned to France in 1787 and began work at a life assurance company.</p>
<p/>
<p>Say published his first work, on the liberty of the press, in 1789. By 1793, he had become the secretary to Clavière, the finance minister. In 1793, he married Julie Gourdel-Deloches. Together they had two children, Horace Emile Say and Adrienne Say. </p>
<p/>
<p>From 1794 to 1800, Say worked as the editor of La Decade philosophique, litteraire, et politique, a periodical in which he refined his own economic views as well. The periodical established his reputation as a publicist, and he was selected as one of the members of the tribunate for the consulate government estbalished in 1799. He continued publishing in the following years, and in 1803, published his principal work, the Traité d'économie politique ou simple exposition de la manière dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses. A second and third edition of this work was published in 1814 and 1817, respectively. </p>
<p/>
<p>In 1819, Say co-founded the ESCP Europe, which became the first business school in the world. In 1826, he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1831, he was made a professor of political economy at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. Late in his life, at this point, Say was subjected to attacks of nervous apoplexy, particularly after the death of his wife in 1830. Say later died in Paris on November 15, 1832. He is buried in Les Invalides, the resting place of many of France’s most influential figures, including Napolean Bonaparte. </p>

<p>Joseph Halle Schaffner (1897-1972) spent most of his life in his native Chicago as director of the clothing-manufacturing firm Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. He formed several collections reflecting both literary and historical interests. His greatest collecting passion was the history of science, and he bequeathed to the University of Chicago an extraordinary collection of several hundred scientific and medical rare books and manuscripts.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Schaffner acquired fine copies of great books, many in contemporary or presentation bindings or from the libraries of great scientists. He relished the excitement of competing for a particularly rare item, especially since he was so often successful; and he exemplifies the zealous, generous bibliophile whose high standards and discriminating taste have enriched the holdings of American research libraries. Schaffner's passion for collecting also resulted in the acquisition of some important manuscripts and correspondence of notable scientists.

<p>Eva Watson-Schütze was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1867. At the age of sixteen she enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she studied under Thomas Eakins. She eventually became a founding member of the Photo-Secession movement and contributed both images and articles to Stieglitz's Camera Work, while being an active participant in Steiglitz's circle of followers and artists. Like many late-19th-century photographers, Eva Watson-Schütze originally had her work exhibited at Alfred Stieglitz's influential New York Gallery.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Watson-Schütze established a new studio in Chicago and soon attracted a large and appreciative clientele for her romantic, yet powerfully composed portraits and figure studies. Beginning in 1902, she and her husband spent their summers in Woodstock, New York. Eventually, Watson-Schütze lived there six months out of the year, working on photography and painting.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In Woodstock, she became associated with Byrdcliffe, a distinctly American arts and crafts colony. Founded by Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, his wife Jane Byrd McCall, Hervey White (associated with Jane Addams's Hull House) and painter Bolton Brown, Byrdcliffe was conceived under the precept set forth by John Ruskin and William Morris: a movement resistant to the rapid urbanization and industrialization during the latter part of the nineteenth century. They had the vision of developing a utopian community that would foster the education and collaboration of like-minded artists; the mission: producing handmade objects to finance the colony and concurrently holding classes to lend its aesthetic traditions to future generations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additionally, in 1929 Watson-Schütze became the director of the Renaissance Society, a non-collecting museum founded in 1915 at the University of Chicago and is Chicago's oldest contemporary art museum. Named for the spirit of rebirth, the society sought to provide university students with a well-rounded education in the arts. Although located on the university campus, the museum has remained an independent institution.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Despite the controversies surrounding modern art following the Armory Show of 1913, the society, from its inception, was quick to embrace modernism. Under Watson-Schütze's direction, from 1929 to 1935, the society presented groundbreaking exhibitions of early modernists such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Jean Arp, Joan Miró, Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Henri Matisse, and Constantin Brancusi, as well as pivotal one-person shows of Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder, Fernand Léger, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Emil Schwarzhaupt Foundation was established in New York on July 21, 1936 by Emil Schwarzhaupt, a German immigrant who came to the United States in 1910 at the age of seventeen. Schwarzhaupt first worked as a salesman for several distilling firms in Chicago. In 1927 he helped to organize the American Medicinal Spirits Company and served on its board of directors until it was purchased by the National Distillers Products Corporation in 1930, when he became director and vice president of that corporation.</p>
<p>In 1933 Schwarzhaupt and Leo Gerngross acquired the Bernheimer Distilling Company in Louisville, KY. Schwarzhaupt became president of the firm and remained in that position after the company was purchased by Schenly Industries, Inc. Emil Schwarzhaupt retired in 1948 and died March 30, 1950.</p>
<p>Schwarzhaupt's interest in promoting an intelligent understanding of American citizenship among the foreign born led him to create the Foundation that bears his name and to bequeath a substantial share of his estate to its work. The bequest in his will resulted in the sale of 113,000 shares of the Bernheimer Company to Schenly Industries for about $3.6 million.</p>
<p>Schwarzhaupt had no intention of making a permanent institution of the Schwarzhaupt Foundation. He stated in his will:</p>
<p>"any moneys, securities, other assets or propertyall be expended within the period of 25 years from and after the date of my death. My reason for imposing the restriction and conditionsbecause of my conviction that in the long run society is benefited by having each generation solve its own problems and provide the necessary funds for so doing."</p>
<p>The initial group of trustees consisted of four friends of Schwarzhaupt: Leo Gerngross (first president), Adolph Hirsch, Hugo Sonnenschein and Frederick Lee. Schwarzhaupt's will stipulated that three years after his death three additional trustees were to be added to the board, "to be selected by the then presiding head of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the then acting head of the Federal Council of Churches of New York, and the then acting Rabbi of Temple Emanu-el of New York City."</p>
<p>After the bequests specifically stipulated in his will to family, friends, and a sizeable number of public and private institutions had been disbursed, the trustees of the Foundation were unsure how to proceed with the allocation of the remainder of the funds. Schwarzhaupt, as noted earlier, had suggested in his will that the Foundation's funds could be used to distribute materials on American citizenship to immigrants, to endow a university chair devoted to the study of American citizenship. But Schwarzhaupt did not make these suggestions binding upon the trustees. Adolph Hirsch, who became president of the Foundation after Gerngross's death in 1958, commented on this lack of direction by saying that he and Gerngross had asked Schwarzhaupt for more specific guidance. Schwarzhaupt replied that "if he had known, he would have set it down."</p>
<p>With the purpose of the Foundation unresolved, the trustees decided to meet with Professor Louis Wirth of the University of Chicago in 1951. Wirth was a professor of sociology who was interested in problems of civic leadership and training, especially as it related to urban areas. It was decided that Wirth and others in the department would apply to the Schwarzhaupt Foundation for funds to create a committee to study the theoretical problems of education and citizenship. The Foundation provided $25,300 to establish the Committee on Education for American Citizenship. Louis Wirth became chairman, and other committee members were Daniel Boorstin, Kermit Eby, Walter Johnson, Avery Leiserson, Bessie Louise Pierce, Kenneth J. Rehage, and Ralph W. Tyler.</p>
<p>The final recommendations of the Committee suggested that an advisory group "representing a diversity of backgrounds" be formed to review and evaluate grant applications. Instead, the trustees hired Carl Tjerandsen on a consulting basis in 1953 to review applications submitted to the Foundation and to make recommendations based on the Foundation's statement of purpose. Tjerandsen had helped organize an "Institute on Citizenship" at Kansas State College in the mid-1940s prior to attending graduate school at the University of Chicago where he worked with Professor Louis Wirth. It was as a graduate student that he worked with the Committee on Education for American Citizenship, and after the death of Professor Wirth was appointed by Dean Ralph Tyler as Executive Secretary to the Committee. Based on his analysis of the initial applications to the Foundation, and his previous experience at Kansas State College, Tjerandsen was hired in 1953. It was Tjerandsen who essentially performed the work of the Foundation for its entire duration.</p>
<p>An important feature of the Committee's report was the recommendation that grant-making activities be divided among three discrete areas. The first was defined as the "improvement of citizenship participation on a community basis," the second as support for research on the "process of becoming an American citizen," and the third as funding worthwhile groups related to the Foundation's statement of purpose which did not fall under the first two categories.</p>
<p>The Committee developed five criteria which were adopted by the trustees in evaluating the merits of the applications: 1) Did the application fall within the established guidelines of education and citizenship participation? 2) Were the proposed activities consistent with the aims of the proposals? Did the applicants show how the activities might be expected to change citizen behavior? 3) Did the applicants have the understanding, interest, and skills to complete the project? 4) Was the program practical? Would the resources be adequate to deal with the particular situation? 5) Was the probable cost sufficiently small in relation to expected benefits to warrant the support from the foundation's modest resources?</p>
<p>In addition to the five criteria mentioned above, institutions and groups applying for funding from the Foundation had to meet three further requirements: they had to be tax-exempt organizations; they could not be on the U.S. Attorney General's list of subversive organizations; and they were to be engaged in either research or education to improve citizen participation.</p>
<p>In the course of its existence, the Schwarzhaupt Foundation disbursed $3,361,973 in grants. The kinds of projects receiving Foundation support included: cooperative nursery care in an interracial community (South Chicago Community Center); research projects to identify problems in citizenship organizations (the University of Michigan survey of the League of Women Voters); neighborhood improvement organizations (United Community Fund of San Francisco, Citizens Planning and Housing Association of Baltimore, Hyde Park-Kenwood Community Conference); and organizations to improve the citizen participation of minority groups (Highlander Folk School, Industrial Areas Foundation, Migrant Ministry, American Indian Development, and Unitarian Service Committee). A significant if not disproportionate number of projects from the Chicago area were funded, causing occasional concern among the board members. In fact, Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation in Chicago received so much money from Schwarzhaupt that at least one author assumed the Schwarzhaupt Foundation was located in Chicago (see Saul Alinsky's humorous letter of April 14, 1966 in Box 29 Folder 18).</p>
<p>In the 1950s, during the Foundation's greatest period of activity, the trustees met twice a year, later reducing this to one meeting a year (usually held in New York). Before each meeting of the Foundation, Tjerandsen prepared a 1-3 page report on each grant application received along with recommendations for approval or denial. The trustees received these summaries in advance of the board meetings, and then came to a conclusion regarding the project.</p>
<p>In addition to the recommendations (or appraisals) of grant applications that Tjerandsen supplied to the trustees, he also submitted monthly reports. These reports introduced new applications received, results of meetings held with grant recipients, and summaries of reports submitted by the recipients. Then, at the board meeting, Tjerandsen summarized the appraisal and contributed to the discussion that followed. Application was not made unless it reflected a consensus. If any trustee had significant reservations about an application, the proposal was rejected.</p>
<p>The terms of Schwarzhaupt's bequest to the Foundation required that all funds were to be disbursed and the Foundation dissolved within 25 years of Emil Schwarzhaupt's death (March 30, 1950). Accordingly, the trustees met on March 31, 1975 to discuss a course of action. Adolph Hirsch reported that "substantially all the assets of the foundation, both principal and income, had been distributed." The trustees noted that the only project not yet completed was the writing, publication, and distribution of the final report. The trustees concluded that it was premature to adopt a plan of dissolution since activities in connection with the report would require "new contractual relations for the publication and distribution of the report."</p>
<p>The trustees did not meet again until April 15, 1979, when they again considered dissolution of the Foundation. Tjerandsen, who prepared the final report, explained that a draft was being written but that it would take an "extended time" before the report would be ready. The trustees decided to wait until after the report was published before considering dissolution.</p>
<p>The final report, Education for Citizenship: A Foundation's Experience, was published in 1980. Promotional circulars were mailed to individuals and institutions likely to benefit from the report's findings, and copies of the book were distributed without charge to those who returned a postal card.</p>
<p>By late 1981 about 1500 copies of a press run of about 200 had been distributed, and the trustees met in November to consider termination of the Foundation. While the actual date of dissolution is not found in the records, the trustees in their final actions granted some of the remaining funds of the Foundation to the Highlander Center, Resources for Just Communities, Santa Cruz, California, to cover the costs of distributing the final reports, and the remainder to the University of Chicago Library to process the records of the Foundation.</p>

<p>Shailer Mathews was born in Portland, Maine on May 26, 1863. He received an A.B. from Colby College in 1884, and an M.A. in 1887 In the latter year, he also graduated from Newton Theological Seminary, after which he spent a number of years as a professor at Colby. He was on leave during the year 1890-1891, studying at the University of Berlin, and returned with an enthusiasm for research and the historical-scientific approach to all knowledge that became a life-long characteristic.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1894, at the invitation of William Rainey Harper, he came to the newly reorganized University of Chicago, where he was to play an influential role until his retirement in 1933. He held a number of positions in the Divinity School of the University; Assistant Professor of New Testament Interpretation, 1894-97; Professor in the same field, 1897-1905; Professor of Systematic Theology, 1905-1906; Professor of Historical and Comparative Theology, 1906-1933; junior Dean, 1899-1908; Dean, 1908-1933. At the same time he played a very active part as a member of the administrative council of the University as a whole and as a participant in countless faculty and administrative activities He found time to write or to edit more than a score of books, many of which were extremely influential and widely read, particularly those dealing with the new approach to religious knowledge then widely disparaged as "Modernism" and with the social application of the Christian Gospel. He edited a journal of general observation and comment on world affairs, "The World Today", from 1903 to 1911; he also was editor of "The Biblical World", 1913-20 For a long period he was an editorial adviser on religious books for Harpers
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Mathews did not believe that real scholarship could prosper in an "ivory-tower" and he was always active in a great variety of organizations and associations outside the University. He was a member of the Chicago Co-operative Council of City Missions (the forerunner of the Council of Churches), 1908-1915; of the Chicago Baptist Executive Council, 1910-1919; and of many other similar groups. His abilities as a leader and parliamentary officer were drawn upon in many ways within these groups He was the first president of the Federal Council of Churches, 1912-1916, and had much to do with the formulation of its policies and procedures. In 1915 he served at a very critical juncture as president of the Northern Baptist Convention and is credited with being largely responsible for saving that body from splitting in two over the question of Modernism versus Fundamentalism. From 1929 to 1932 he was president of the Chicago Church Federation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The breadth of Mathews' interests is indicated by his association with a number of other activities not officially related to the churches or directly to theology. He was, for example, director of religious work for the Chautauqua Institute from 1912-1934, most of which time he was also a trustee of the association and a major figure in Chautauqua's development. In 1920 he served as a member of the Kobe College Foundation and made a trip to Japan which made him a national spokesman for Japanese and American friendship. His interest in politics and social welfare is indicated by his membership on the board of trustees of the Church Peace Union in 1914, as well as his participation and encouragement in the work of Jane Addams' Hull House. However, he strongly supported the cause of the Allies once the United States entered the first World War and from 1917 to 1918 served at the appointment of Illinois' governor as State Director of War Savings. He co-operated and supported progressive movements in politics led by men like Charles Merriam in Chicago and Theodore Roosevelt on the national scene.

<p>David Lee Shillinglaw (b. June 6, 1889, d. February 13, 1976) was a World War I-veteran, American Legionnaire, investment banker, and a Chicago civic leader. Born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Shillinglaw was raised in Independence, Iowa and later Rowley, Iowa following the death of his father in 1900. He attended a country school until the age of thirteen, and then worked on the family farm until age eighteen.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shillinglaw attended the Iowa State Teachers College for four years, majoring in History and Economics, and teaching courses in both subjects during the summer months. In 1911 he entered the University of Iowa as a Senior and completed his Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to earn his L.L.D. from the University of Iowa Law School in 1915. Following graduation, Shillinglaw practiced law in Waterloo, Iowa and organized several businesses.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When the United States declared war in 1917, Shillinglaw immediately applied for active service. He was rejected from the first training camp, but eventually found his way to Europe in September 1917 as a member of the YMCA American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). He was put in charge of the YMCA AEF's construction work in Europe, organizing the design, manufacture, and erection of all buildings used by the YMCA throughout France. He entered direct army service in July 1918 under the command of General Dawes in the engineer corps. Here, Shillinglaw was in charge of lumber supplies not produced in French forests. After the Armistice, he was asked to return to the YMCA AEF in January 1919 to lead the salvage and liquidation of YMCA properties throughout Europe. He secured 48,000,000 francs for the Perkins Commission, and returned to the United States in 1920.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shillinglaw held various positions following the war. Returning first to Iowa he was founder of the First Radio Corporation in Iowa. He was an assistant sales manager of the Chicago branch of the Liquid Carbonic Company in 1922. He began work for investment bankers Forgan, Gray and Company in 1923 and was eventually made Vice President. In 1933 he founded his own investment firm, the David L. Shillinglaw Company, later Shillinglaw, Bolger and Company, Inc.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to his leadership in numerous corporations throughout Chicago, Shillinglaw served in the American Legion. He joined the Legion in 1919, and was commander of the Advertising Men's Post in Chicago. He was President of the Cook County Council, and later a member of the National Defense Committee. Shillinglaw was elected the Illinois State Commander of the American Legion in 1928, and was made a member of the National Executive Committee in 1929.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shillinglaw married Marie Schmidt of Chicago in 1930.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to his business ventures and service in the American Legion, Shillinglaw was active in politics. He was a Republican precinct captain for twenty-five years, Chief Doorkeeper at the Republican Convention in Philadelphia in 1940, and Assistant State Director of Finance for Illinois from 1940 to 1944. He was active in many local and state campaigns. In 1953 Shillinglaw was sponsored by Everett Dirksen for an appointment to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. His appointment stalled, however, in the federal security check. At the height of the McCarthy era, the FBI questioned Shillinglaw's membership in the Institute of Pacific Relations. Shillinglaw was never appointed to the U.N.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Shillinglaw lectured widely on finance, foreign relations, democracy, and civil liberties. A number of his addresses and articles were published in The New York Times, The Economist, and other leading newspapers. He was active in numerous educational and philanthropic organizations, including the board of governors of the International House at the University of Chicago, and the board of the Fulbright Scholarship. He established the David Lee Shillinglaw Distinguished Service Professorship at the University of Chicago in 1972. In 1971, the University of Chicago published Shillinglaw's book about his experience in World War I: An American in the Army and YMCA, 1917-1920: The Diary of David Lee Shillinglaw.

<p>Harrington Shortall was born to a wealthy Chicago family in 1895. He attended the Thatcher School in Ojai, California and Harvard University. Like many young American composers, Shortall studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. During World War I he served in the U.S. Navy, and afterwards began a life of music composition.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During the 1930s, Shortall’s work was included as part of the Federal Music Project Composer’s Forum, an event sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. In 1939 his "The Night is Well-Nigh Spent," was conducted by Nadia Boulanger at The Library of Congress Coolidge Theater.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shortall was a composer for most of his adult life, although he rarely had his works published or performed after the 1940s. His work is characterized by its clarity, directness, and an embrace of pre-romantic compositional models. Simultaneously, it is music grounded in the everyday life and holiday celebrations of wealthy Chicagoans.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shortall’s work as a music educator took two forms. He produced (although never published) a piano method book, and served as a lecturer at The Chicago Theological Seminary and Rosary College (now Dominican University) in River Forest, Illinois. Additionally, Shortall copied music from the collection of Chicago’s Newberry Library and produced his own treatises on music composition and theory.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During the 1940s, Shortall briefly taught courses at the Chicago Theological Seminary, Rosary College, and the Latin School. He died in Evanston in 1984. </p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Maud Slye was born in Minneapolis in 1869. Many published sources give her birth date as February 8, 1879, but U.S. Census records indicate that she was born in 1869; it may be that claimed the later birth date to avoid mandatory retirement. In 1895, Slye entered the University of Chicago as an undergraduate student and worked as secretary for President William Rainey Harper to support herself. Following a breakdown brought on by the strain of full-time work and study, Slye relocated to the East Coast and received her A.B. degree from Brown University in 1899. She taught at Rhode Island State Normal School until 1905, and in 1908 returned to the University of Chicago as a graduate assistant to Professor Charles Otis Whitman.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Slye began her pioneering research on cancer heredity in mice soon after her arrival in Chicago, and in 1911 joined the University's newly opened Sprague Memorial Institute. In 1919 she was appointed director of the Cancer Laboratory at the University of Chicago, and in 1926 was promoted to associate professor of pathology, a position she held until her retirement in 1944. Slye performed her research with only minimal financial support from the University, often paying for mouse food and other supplies out of her personal stipend. Her first research assistant, Harriet Holmes, worked without pay.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Slye faced criticism from other pathologists and researchers for her contention that heredity played a key role in susceptibility to cancer; her research challenged prevailing notions of cancer as being at least partly caused by contagions. Although her hypotheses about heredity were later shown to be a simplification of the complex role genetics play in cancer susceptibility, her studies were crucial in establishing heredity as a key area for cancer research.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Slye sometimes had to battle gender-based stereotypes and criticism, including questions from the press about whether she was “afraid” of her mice and a cruel rumor that circulated for a time in the cancer research field, charging that she had refused to share her research results with scientists from the New York Institute for Cancer Research and had cried when questioned about her findings. Nevertheless, Slye was recognized for her work, receiving a gold medal from the American Medical Society in 1914 and another from the American Radiological Association in 1922. She was also awarded the Ricketts Prize from the University of Chicago in 1915 and an honorary doctorate from Brown University in 1937.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to her scientific work, Slye published two volumes of poetry, Songs and Solaces (1934) and I in the Wind (1936). She died in Chicago in 1954.

<bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Dr. Alexander Spitzer was born on October 22, 1868 in Miskolc, Hungary. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and graduated in 1892 with a doctor of medicine degree. Following graduation, he worked in affiliation to Richard von Krafft-Ebing's psychiatry clinic, H. Obersteiner's Neurology Institute, and S. Exner's Physiology Institute. While he preferred to pursue his scientific investigations independently, relying on a moderate inherited fortune, the inflation of World War I forced him to assume teaching positions. In 1914, Spitzer became an assistant to Julius Tandler at the University of Vienna's Anatomy Institute. In 1919, he earned his habilitation in anatomy and became an assistant under Otto Marburg at the Neurology Institute of the University of Vienna, which he continued until 1933. During this position, in 1924, he was named Extraordinary Professor for the Anatomy and Pathology of the Nervous System.</p><p/><p>In the early stages of his career, Spitzer's interests were focused on neurology and psychiatry. After the time he spent with Tandler, he developed an interest in circulation, which guided him towards investigating the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of the human heart. From there, Spitzer researched in more detail the abnormal development of the heart in transposition of the arterial trunks. He published numerous articles on the subject throughout his later career. </p><p/><p>He was persecuted by the Nazis and in 1938 expelled from his position at the University of Vienna. It must be around this time and under difficult conditions that he completed the manuscript of the monograph "Die Transposition und Inversion des Herzens im Lichte der phylogenetischen Theorie (The Transposition and Inversion of Hearts in Light of the Phylogenetic Theory)," presenting his whole theory, together with a separate manuscript that responds to his critics, "Beiträge zur Kritik der phylogenetischen und ontogenetischen Transpositonstheorie (Articles on the Critique of the Phylogenetic and Ontogenetic Transposition Theory)."</p><p/><p>In 1942, Spitzer was deported by the Nazis to the concentration camp in Theresienstadt (Terezín, in today's Czechia). He had already been suffering from heart disease at that advanced age. He died on January 16, 1943. The cause of his death is identified by the physicians in the concentration camp as myocardial degeneration.</p><p/><p>Spitzer's manuscript presents the fullest version of his theory and includes numerous illustrations (of which only a few are in the collection). The latest work he cites in the book is from 1937, thus enabling the dating of the manuscript from 1937-1942. The second part of the book responds to the critics of Spitzer's theory. Spitzer later decided to develop this part as a separate book, which is also included in the collection.</p><p/><p>Spitzer's notes on the documents show that he created multiple copies of both books, prepared them for publication by adding guiding notes to typesetters, and associated the copies with certain places (such as USA and Switzerland). It is likely that he intended to send the works to different places for publication. The manuscripts seem to have entered the possession of Dr. Emil Schwarz (1865-1955) who had been a physician at the University of Vienna and later immigrated to the U.S. to escape Nazi persecution. In Schwarz's words, the manuscript was committed to his care "after a complicated journey." Schwarz then entrusted the manuscript to the custody of Dr. Richard Langendorf, who also escaped Nazi persecution, immigrated to the U.S., and worked at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago together with Schwarz. Eventually, in 1969, Langendorf handed the manuscript to Dr. Maurice Lev (1909-1994), a prominent heart disease specialist. </p><p/><p>Already in 1951, Maurice Lev, together with Dr. Aloysius Vass, had published a book that consists of an English translation of Spitzer's 1923 article on the phylogenetic theory of malformed hearts and an analysis of the theory (under the title "The Architecture of Normal and Malformed Hearts: a Phylogenetic Theory of Their Development"). In the introduction, Lev reveals the existence of "an unpublished manuscript summarizing [Spitzer's] whole theory" and informs that "[t]his is now being translated by the authors and will be published […] in the near future." Apparently, this was not accomplished and Spitzer's final work remained in manuscript form.</p></bioghist>

<p>The Work Incentive Program (WIN) was established by the U.S. Department of Labor in 1967-1968. WIN was designed to increase employability and employment among those receiving welfare under Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). It required states to offer job training and job-seeking assistance. A voluntary program until 1971, incentives for participation ranged from exemptions in calculating AFDC need to actual incentive payments. WIN programs were federally funded and locally administered by employment services and social services.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a research institution and public service provider, the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration (SSA) was involved with local administration of the WIN program. Working closely with the University of Michigan's School of Social Work and Case Western University's School of Applied Social Science, SSA produced a number of reports on the program's administration and its efficacy on the ground.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The WIN Program met with widespread criticism and was generally recognized as having failed to accomplish its intended goals. By the early 1970s it was clear that many enrollees were not finding jobs. Amendments to the Social Security Act in 1971, 1980, 1982, and 1984 attempted to improve program administration. By 1990 it had been phased out by a new program, Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS).</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Amos Alonzo Stagg was born in 1862, in West Orange, New Jersey. He was the fifth
child of eight and his father was a laborer and cobbler. Early on
Stagg's family instilled moral, religious ethics into his already
resilient character. Stagg worked and attended public school until 1883.
Following his graduation from high school, Stagg, aged twenty-one, enrolled in
post-graduate courses at Philips Exeter Academy in order to prepare for Yale
University Entrance exams.</p>
<p>In 1884, Amos Alonzo Stagg entered Yale as a freshman. He intended to study
divinity and become a minister. A popular, if not mediocre student, Stagg
excelled in numerous sports including baseball and football, sang in the glee
club, and was the financial manager of the Yale News. It was Stagg's
devotion to athletics, which marked his tenure at Yale. By his senior year in
school, Stagg, already a star catcher on the baseball team, joined the football
team that provided him with a life-long love of the game and a dedication to
amateur sports. In 1889, Stagg enrolled as a full-time student at
Yale's Divinity School, but soon left because of his poor ability to
preach sermons.</p>
<p>Stagg soon found work in the athletic department at the new International Young
Men's Christian Association training school in Springfield,
Massachusetts. His success as a football coach at the college earned him great
notoriety throughout intercollegiate athletics. At this time his former Yale
Divinity School professor, William Rainey Harper, to head up the Department of
Physical Culture at the newly formed University of Chicago, contacted Stagg.
Stagg's appointment came with full tenure, an assistant professorship
and substantial salary, setting a precedent in selections of athletic directors
in American universities. Harper and Stagg soon developed a life-long, intimate
friendship that had a significant impact in the development of athletics and
football at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>In 1892, Stagg coached and often played in the first football season at the
University of Chicago. A "green" team, Stagg's
innovative coaching and personal charisma helped earn the new football players
success in the field. The early years of the 1890's marked the rise of
Stagg's presence not only in athletics, but also within the
administration of "Harper's university."</p>
<p>1894 brought in another prosperous season for the "Maroons."
The addition of a new field donated by the prosperous Chicago retailer Marshall
Field and a series of successful games played in the West Coast against schools
like Stanford provided Stagg with a tremendous amount of respect and popularity
among the faculty and students. Intercollegiate football gave the university a
significant measure of prestige.</p>
<p>It was at this time he met and married Stella Robertson, a young freshman from
upstate New York. Their marriage was an extremely happy one and Stella, referred
to as Stagg's beloved "assistant coach," often sat in
the press stands, offering commentary on the football games. Together they had
three children, two of whom followed their father in careers as coaches.</p>
<p>Under President Harper's administration, Coach Stagg enjoyed a
tremendous amount of influence in the policies governing intercollegiate
athletics and the Department of Physical Culture at the university. Preferential
treatment of players, special athletic scholarships and controversial recruiting
tactics were supported by the office of the university president. Football
generated a lot of revenue for the school and even more enthusiasm from
students, faculty and alumni alike. </p>
<p>Coach Stagg's enhanced reputation on campus allowed him a great deal of
autonomy in dealing with athletics. Affectionately dubbed the "old
man," he was bold and impatient with anyone who challenged his manner
of leading the Department of Physical Culture and the football team. National
and collegiate reforms of the game, coaching, and recruiting had little impact
on Stagg's dynamic. Even the loss of Coach Stagg's long time
friend and confidant, William Rainey Harper, did little to diminish his
authority. The successive president, Harry Pratt Judson continued to encourage
and protect Stagg and the game of football. </p>
<p>During the years of 1906 through 1924, Coach Stagg enjoyed success as an
innovator for the game of football. He has been credited with the invention of
the modern "bowl" game, the numbered jersey and the use of the
forward pass. He was a productive tactician and strategist for football. Not
only did Stagg coach several championship seasons; he was also the head athletic
trainer for track, baseball, and basketball. From 1906 to 1932, Stagg served as
a member of the American Olympic Games Committee. This period also was
distinguished by his increasing difficulties with the administration of the
University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Following the presidencies of Ernest DeWitt Burton and Max Mason, the
"Maroon's" football team showed a decline in the
quality of the player and the performance of the game. The university
administration sought out more serious and committed students and checked the
recruiting tactics of Stagg's department. After the champion season of
1924, Stagg's team went downhill. </p>
<p>The election of Robert Maynard Hutchins in 1929 to the presidency of the
University of Chicago marked the end of Stagg's influence on campus.
Hutchins' commitment to academics and to the welfare of the student
body placed athletics in a lesser position. The reorganization of
Stagg's post and the increasing pressures placed upon him to retire
left the "old man" with little alternative. Stagg left the
University of Chicago in 1933. A few years later, football would be abolished at
the school.</p>
<p>mos Alonzo Stagg took over as athletic director and football coach for the
College of the Pacific in California. Coaching well up into his nineties, Stagg
continued to enjoy many successful seasons with the football team. He and his
beloved wife Stella died in California in 1965.</p>

<p>Zena Sutherland was born in Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1915 and raised in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937 and in 1958 earned a master's degree in library science from the University, intending to pursue a career as a medical librarian. Her experience as a mother of three children inspired her to take several courses in children's literature.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sutherland was among the world's most influential and prolific scholars of young people's literature. She was associated with the University of Chicago Graduate Library School throughout her career, and served as a faculty member there from 1972 to 1986. She wrote 19 books and reviewed more than 30,000 children's books during more than 40 years as a critic of children's literature. From 1958 until her retirement in 1985, she served as reviewer and editor of the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, a comprehensive guide to all the latest literature published for children. She wrote monthly columns as children's books reviewer for the Saturday Review from 1966 to 1972 and also served as children's book editor for the Chicago Tribune. In 1972, she succeeded May Hill Arbuthnot as author of Children and Books, a classic textbook in the field of library science and children's literature for which she produced the fourth through ninth editions.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She served on numerous book award juries including the National Book Award, the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the Jane Addams Book Award, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the Caldecott Award, and the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction of which she was the permanent chair. As a member of the American Library Association, she was a jurist and member of the Newberry and Caldecott award committees. Sutherland also served on the United States Board of Books for Young People, acting as a children's literary ambassador in South Africa, China, and other countries.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1983, two former students used the royalties from a Festschrift in her honor to establish the Zena Sutherland Lecture Series, and the Lab Schools at the University of Chicago also recently established the Zena Sutherland Prize in Children's Literature, which is awarded by children of the School. In 1998 she was awarded the Norman MacLean Faculty Award, and named professor emeritus Zena Sutherland.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sutherland married Roland Bailey in 1937. They had three children before divorcing in 1961. In 1964, she was remarried to Alec Sutherland, director of broadcasting and head of the Center for Continuing Education at the University of Chicago. Zena B. Sutherland died in Chicago on June 12, 2002.

<p>Manley Hawn Thompson was born in Zanesville, Ohio on April 12, 1917. He received both his A.B. and A.M. from the University of Chicago in 1938, and a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1942. Upon completing school, Thompson joined the U.S. Naval reserves, and remained until 1946. After the war, he taught for three years at the University of Toronto before returning to the University of Chicago in 1949 as an Assistant professor in philosophy. With the exception of visiting lectureships and other temporary associations with other universities, Thompson spent the remainder of his career at the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thompson married Margaret Phyllis MacKenzie and the couple had three children: Katherine, Roderick, and Clark.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thompson's early interests centered on C. S. Peirce and, to a lesser extent, American pragmatism more generally. His only book-length work, The Pragmatic Philosophy of C. S. Peirce, was based on his dissertation and published in 1953. Thompson had a general interest in metaphysics and epistemology, particularly that of Immanuel Kant. He was a leading authority on Kant's theory of categories, and at the time of his death, was working on a manuscript dealing with Kant's account of our understanding of mathematical concepts. Thompson also published articles on Aristotle and W. V. O. Quine, semantics and logic. He authored the Metaphysics monograph for the Princeton Studies in Philosophy.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thompson's professional career included serving on the Harvard philosophy department's visiting committee and as a member of Princeton's Associate Council on the Humanities from 1960 through 1965. He was active in the Aristotelian Society, the C. S. Peirce Society, the North American Kant Society, and was president of the American Philosophical Association in 1983.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thompson retired from the University of Chicago in 1987. In 1991 he was diagnosed with a form of Parkinson's disease that gradually affected his ability to read and write, though he continued to correspond as much as possible with colleagues and former students. Thompson died in 1994.</p>

<p>George Townshend was born on February 28, 1724, in London. His parents were Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend, and Audrey Ethelreda Townshend (née Harrison). After his education at Eton College and St. John’s College in Cambridge, Townshend joined the army in the summer of 1743 and was swiftly involved in the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743. Townshend rose to the rank of captain in the 7th Regiment of Dragoons in April 1745. </p>
<p>While in Belgium in 1747, Townshend ran unopposed for a position as Member of Parliament in Norfolk. He become captain of the 1st Regiment of Footguards and lieutenant colonel In the Army on February 25, 1748. As an MP, he was personally responsible for ensuring the passage of the Militia Act of 1757. On May 6, 1758, Townshend was promoted to colonel and took control of the 64th Regiment of Foot. </p>
<p>Townshend assumed command of a brigade in Quebec during the Seven Years’ War under General James Wolfe. When Wolfe died in 1759 and his second-in-command was wounded, Townshend took command of the British forces and received Quebec City’s surrender on September 18, 1759. Townshend was promoted to the rank of major general on March 6, 1761, and went on to command a division of the Anglo-Portuguese army to protect Portugal during the Spanish Invasion. </p>
<p>After the Seven Years’ War, Townshend became the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance in the Greenville Ministry in 1763 and succeeded his father as Viscount Townshend in 1764. He went on to become Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and introduced measures to increase the general standing of Ireland’s military and economy. Along with Prime Minister Lord North, he also succeeded in imposing much greater British control over Ireland. </p>
<p>In 1773, Townshend married Anne Montgomery, his second wife (his first, Charlotte Compton, had died in 1770). Together they had six children, one of whom was the Lady Charlotte Townshend, born on March 16, 1776. Unfortunately, little is known of the life of his children, besides his youngest son, James Nugent Boyle Bernard Townshend, a British naval commander. Later in life, Townshend continued his rise through the ranks of the military, eventually being promoted to the position of field marshal, the highest rank in the British Army, in 1796. Townshend died and was buried in his family home in Norfolk on September 14, 1807.</p>

<p>The Tuesday Club, an organization of University of Chicago faculty members, came into being as a result of a series of preliminary luncheon meetings among interested parties at the Quadrangle Club during December of 1943. The planning group at this initial stage consisted of professors Gertrude Smith (Greek), Henri Frankfort (Oriental Languages and Literature), Ralph Marcus (Greek; Oriental Languages and Literature), John Wilson (Egyptology), Thorkild Jacobson (Oriental Institute), Jakob Larsen (History), Frank Knight (Economics), Edwin Aubrey (Divinity School), Ralph Gerard (Physiology), and Edgar Wind (Art). The planners invited selected colleagues to join them for what they described as "an interdepartmental circle" interested in "the history of science and culture and in methodology." The first regular meeting of the club was held on January 18, 1944 at 8:00 p.m. in the office of John Wilson, Director of the Oriental Institute. Those attending enjoyed light refreshments and heard Thorkild Jacobsen speak on "The Validity of the Ethnical Approach to the Study of Culture." It was not until April 27, 1944, however, that members outlined informal rules and officially designated the new faculty club the Tuesday Club. These informal rules mandated that the club would be limited to eighteen members and that a nominating committee of two or three members plus a secretary would be chosen to maintain membership. It was also decided to appoint a chairman who would facilitate discussions after program presentations. Dues were collected from members, apparently to cover expenses for refreshments.</p>
<p>From its inception the club included faculty from the humanities, the social sciences, the physical sciences, and also the professional schools. Unlike similar faculty clubs such as the Innominates or the X-Club, the Tuesday Club was not a dinner club, although it did hold an annual dinner at the Quandrangle Cub to which members' spouses were invited. At regular meetings, members were also permitted to bring guests. By the early 1950s the club grew to embrace over thirty University of Chicago faculty members, including many nationally and internationally known scholars. Illustrative of the caliber and diversity of Tuesday Club participants is the 1958 member roster which includes Mircea Eliade (Divinity School), Eric Hamp (Linguistics), Frank Knight (Economics), Robert S. Mulliken (Physics), and Sol Tax (Anthropology). In 1962 participation had dwindled enough to precipitate the circulation of a questionnaire to remaining members designed to ascertain whether sufficient interest remained to keep the club alive. Although many expressed continued interest, there is no evidence of activity beyond 1965. The records of the Tuesday Club remained in the possession of one of its final officers, Robert M. Grant, until 1988, when they were given to the Special Collections Research Center.</p>

<p>James Hayden Tufts (1862-1942) was on the faculty of the
Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago from
1892-1930. In 1905 he was appointed Chairman of the
Philosophy Department, a position he held until his
retirement from the University in 1930. In addition to
departmental duties, he was Dean of the Senior Colleges
(1898-1904), Dean of Faculties and Vice-President of the
University (1924-26), Acting President of the University
(1925-26), and editor of the International Journal of Ethics
(1914-1930).</p>
<p>Born in Monson, Massachusetts, James Tufts was educated at his
father's grammar school and subsequently at Amherst College
(B.A., 1883), Yale Divinity School (B.D., 1889), and the
University of Freiburg (Ph.D., 1892). After graduating from
Yale, he accepted a teaching position in the Department of
Philosophy at the University of Michigan. During a holiday
visit to his home in Massachusetts, he received an
invitation to call on his former professor, William Rainey
Harper, at Yale. Sharing with Tufts his plans for a new
university in Chicago, Harper invited him to join the
faculty. Tufts resigned from the University of Michigan,
married Cynthia Whitaker, and set sail for Germany to begin
one year of study at the University of Freiburg, with the
agreement that he would be in Chicago, prepared to teach, by
August, 1892. While in Germany, Tufts and Harper
corresponded frequently [Tufts' letters to Harper, dating
from 1890-92, are in Box XV, Folder 12 of the William Rainey
Harper Personal Papers]. At Harper's request, Tufts provided

<p>Ralph W. Tyler was born in Chicago, IL on April 22, 1902, the son of Reverend William A. Tyler. He earned his BA at Doane University in Nebraska and his Master's degree in 1923 at the University of Nebraska. Tyler's Ph.D. was granted by the University of Chicago in 1927. After teaching at the University of Nebraska (1922-1927) and the University of North Carolina (1927-1929), Tyler moved to Ohio State University as Professor of Education and Research Associate of the Bureau of Educational Research (1929-1938).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tyler specialized in measuring the application of education. Before arriving at the University of Chicago he led "the eight year study" which measured to what degree students absorbed information given to them by their teachers. The study showed that children learned best at their own pace and students best retained information compounded by experience. This program led to national testing for pre-college students.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When Tyler met with the President of the University of Chicago to recommend methods for testing applicants, the thirty five year old professor held a reputation as a progressive educator who smoked cigars constantly and raced cars against trains. Although University of Chicago president Robert Hutchins believed in classical education, in 1938 he risked hiring Tyler as the Chief Examiner and Director of the Board of Examinations, Professor of Education, and Chair of the Department of Education. Tyler accepted and moved to Chicago with his entire testing staff.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tyler became acting Dean of Social Sciences when Dean Robert Redfield took a leave of absence in 1946. Tyler was officially appointed as dean in 1948. He streamlined the committees between the departments and promoted interdisciplinary studies. Additionally, Tyler participated in University life by contributing to the Great Books Program and to the Chicago Roundtable radio discussions. Additionally, Tyler continuously published the results of his work.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through the course of his tenure at the University of Chicago his positions included: Chairman, Department of Education, University of Chicago (1938-48); University Examiner, University of Chicago (1938-53); Dean, Division of the Social Sciences, University of Chicago (1948-53); Director, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, California (1953-67); Acting President, Social Science Research Council (1971-72); Vice President, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (1975-78); and President, System Development Foundation (1969-until his death?).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Tyler served as the official Director of the Examinations Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute from 1943-1954 during which the military asked him to administer tests to measure the effectiveness of its training programs.

<p>In the 1960's, Tyler worked with his colleagues on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, measuring educational achievements around the United States. Tyler advised six U.S. Presidents and assisted in writing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. After leaving the University of Chicago in 1953, Tyler moved to California as the founding director of the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, funded by the Ford Foundation (1953-1967). Throughout the 1980's Tyler commuted from California to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to teach and advise the Coalition for School Improvement.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tyler's style of testing became common and was known as the "Tyler Rationale". His methods were initially considered unorthodox because he advocated the involvement of teachers and parents at every level of school reform. Tyler believed that the purpose of education was to teach children how to function as citizens. He stated, "Carrying on citizenship is the most important reason for public education…As society keeps moving forward, we need to have more and more education to understand problems that are much more complex than those that were dealt with in 1776."

<p>Tyler's wife, Flora V. Tyler passed away before he did. Ralph Tyler suffered from cancer and passed away on February 18, 1994. He was survived by his brother, Keith I. Tyler; his daughters, Helen Parisi and Ann Fathy; and his son, Ralph W. Tyler, Jr.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Some of his more famous projects included: Director of Evaluation, Eight-Year Study (1934-42); Director, Cooperative Study in General Education (1939-45); Director, Examinations Staff, U.S. Armed Forces Institute (1943-53); Chairman, Exploratory Committee on Assessing the Progress of Education (1964-68); and Senior Consultant, Science Research Associates, Inc. (1967-82).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He was also a member of a number of associations and throughout the course of his career held broad associations well beyond the University of Chicago including: Member, National Advisory Mental Health Council (1959-63); Chairman, National Commission on Resources for Youth (1964-79); Chairman, National Commission for Cooperative Education (1962-75); Honorary Life Chairman (1975-?); President, National Academy of Education (1965-69); Chairman, Research Advisory Council of the U.S. Office of Education (1967-70); Member, National Science Board, 1962-68; Vice Chairman (1966-68); and Member, National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children (1965-72)

<p>The John Crerar Library was founded in 1894 and was initially housed in the Marshall Field Building (111 N. State Street, Chicago). By 1961 a larger space was needed to house the rapidly growing collection and a new building was constructed at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This building opened in 1963 and the collection was housed there until 1981. By the late 1970s the collection had once again expanded beyond the capacity of its building. On April 13, 1981 an agreement was reached between the Crerar Library Board of Directors and the University of Chicago to consolidate the collection with the University of Chicago's science collection.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A new building was constructed on the University of Chicago campus to house the consolidated collection and opened on September 10, 1984. The structure was designed by Stubbins Associates of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has 160,836 square feet of floor space, costing $22 million to build. It has capacity for 1.3 million volumes. This building currently houses the John Crerar Library collection.</p>

<p>The first Committee on University Ranking Policy was appointed on May 16, 1966, by the Council of the University Senate and charged to study "...the consequences over the coming summer and fall of adhering to or reversing the present university policy of submitting rank upon the request of the student." The expansion of the Vietnam War in the mid-1960's had made the student deferment no longer automatic, and local draft boards were using, among other measures, a student's rank among other males in his class to determine whether to grant a deferment. Growing dissatisfaction with the University's policy of compiling male class ranks had culminated the week before with the occupation of the Administration Building for six days by groups of students, notably Students Against the Rank.</p>

<p>One of the five original divisions of the University, the Extension was created, much like its British counterparts, "to bring as far as possible its [the University's] many advantages for culture and instruction to people who are prevented by circumstances from going to the University itself." President William Rainey Harper, veteran of the Chautauqua Movement and professor of Semitic languages, first defined the Extension's purposes and scope; under Harper's direction, adult education in the early University became a secular embodiment of his personal evangelical vision.</p>
<p>t the beginning the Extension Division was organized into six departments, each administered by a secretary who reported to the division's Director. Lecture-Study Department speakers went on tours throughout the Midwest to present evening and weekend courses. The Class-Study Department provided off-campus instruction in the city, offering courses similar to those available on campus; in the early years of the twentieth century, Class-Study began giving courses in subject areas requested by specific groups of people. Basic and remedial courses by mail came under the jurisdiction of Correspondence-Study. By 1897 the other three units-Examination, Library, and Training-had been absorbed by the first three; a department devoted to Bible study had been dropped even more quickly. Not until 1905, when the American Institute of Sacred Literature merged with the Extension, was Bible study restored.</p>
<p>In 1900 the Extension faculty lost its separate and statutory existence. The Board of University Extension assumed governing responsibility until 1916, when the Extension's administration and governance reverted to its Director.</p>
<p>Especially during the first quarter-century of its existence, the Extension served teachers and aspiring teachers. In 1898, aided by a grant from Mrs. Emmons Blaine, the University organized the downtown College of Teachers. Two years later it merged with the Class-Study Department under the name University College. University College was conceived as "an arrangement for selecting and conducting courses of study at a place and time convenient for those who cannot attend ordinary courses at the Quadrangles." By 1911 the Lecture-Study Department had also been incorporated into University College, and its circuit riding program was discontinued. The Correspondence-Study Department remained part of the Extension and in April 1924 was renamed the Home-Study Department.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1920s, but particularly during the 1930s and 1940s, University College developed educational programs in cooperation with specific professional groups, among them the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Meat Packers. Other specialized courses included those for mechanical and electrical engineers as well as for members of the printing and lithographic industries. During this same period University College expanded its services by tailoring courses to the needs of businessmen, civic leaders, and government administrators. Innovative offerings in the liberal arts, particularly the Great Books series and the Basic Program in Liberal Education for Adults, proved to be extremely popular. Capitalizing on the success Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler had with the Great Books courses, the Basic Program was a four-year liberal arts training program designed around group discussions and lectures on classical and modern literature. Other programs, such as the Institute of Statistics and the Institute of Public Service, survived only briefly in wartime conditions.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, University Extension enrollment had declined precipitously from the two previous decades. After 1963-64 the Home-Study Department ceased to exist, and the Downtown Center closed in 1974. By 1982 the University Extension had become part of the Center for Continuing Education. Though Its programs and course offerings have been reduced from earlier years, this entity continues to offer adult educational services, most of them non-credit, in the following areas: liberal education, including the Basic Program; business and professional courses, particularly in publishing, communications, and marketing; and higher education, including faculty symposia and seminars.</p>

Walgreen Foundation for the Study of American Institutions was established in June, 1937 when Walgreen, who felt that there was need for a greater appreciation of the American way of life among University of Chicago students, gave the University $550,000 for this purpose. Although the funds have been used to support scholarships, teaching, and research in the various fields of American studies, the Foundation has perhaps been best known for the many series of public lectures which it has sponsored. Over the years, people of outstanding accomplishment in public life and in the academic world of the social sciences and the humanities have been brought to the campus to speak on various aspects of American institutions and values; among the speakers have been Walter Lippmann, Carl Sandburg, Jaques Maritain, Ralph Bunche, George Kennan, Paul Douglas, Hannah Arendt, and Jacques Barzun.</p>

<p>During the Second World War several programs of instruction were instituted at the University of Chicago. The major war activity of the University, in addition to research, was the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) inaugurated in the spring of 1943. The students in this program were enlisted and drafted soldiers who had demonstrated on intelligence and aptitude tests that they possessed outstanding qualifications for further training. The University provided instruction in basic-phase subjects and in several advanced courses including medicine, pre-medicine, area and language, and psychology. Those who had had only high school or a limited college experience were assigned to the basic phase of the program, and were given a broad background of training with instruction in English, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and geography. The trainees who had completed some college work or who had special qualifications were assigned to one of a series of advanced courses that provided specialized training. The last group to be trained at the University graduated in October 1944.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The other major program was the Civilian Pilot Training Program. Originally established in 1939 to teach college and university students to fly, it was converted after the outbreak of war to a program of instruction for men in the armed services. Its name was changed to the CAA War Training Service (WTS) and provided instruction for Navy combat pilots, Army glider pilots, and Army flight instructors. These men took a two-month course, including ground school instruction and flight training. When the CPT Program was converted to military purposes, the University began a program to train civilian Aviation Ground School Instructors.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While the ASTP and the WTS were the major wartime training programs, the University did institute other smaller programs. Of note are the Civil Affairs Training School and Production Training for War Industries programs. The Civil Affairs Training School trained soldiers in military government at Provost Marshall General's School in Georgia and then they were sent to select universities for training in foreign languages and culture. At the University of Chicago, the soldiers were trained in Japanese language and culture. The Production Training for War Industries trained men for war industries through tuition free classes at the School of Business.</p>

The World Citizens Association was an outgrowth of S. de Maderiaga's attempts at founding an American division of the World Foundation. Founded in 1939 under the patronage of Mrs. Anita McCormick Blaine, the Chicago group was dissolved in 1943 for lack of sufficient operating funds. In the course of its life under the chairmanship of Carleton Washburne, superintendent of schools in Winnetka, and under the executive directorship of Edwin M. Clough (1939-1940), John R. Van de Water (1940-1943), and Caroline Willis (1943), the Chicago Group prepared eleven surveys/study kits on as many different subjects having some relation to international cooperation. The World Citizens Association actively encouraged the development of groups to use these materials or sponsored them in order to come to some understanding and opinion as to the practicality, possibility, and nature of the post-war "organization" of the world.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through work with the University of Chicago's International House, Greene became interested in film as an educational medium. In 1937, he incorporated International Film Bureau, an importer and exporter of educational films. Greene subsequently created additional branches of his distributorship, including College Film Center, which specialized in low-cost rentals of classroom films, and Trans-World Films, which distributed foreign films and general entertainment titles. Greene's companies handled a variety of film genres, particularly European and Latin American features, art and experimental films, foreign language instruction series, vocational guidance films, and classic entertainment titles. Greene's clients included schools, colleges and universities, churches, clubs and businesses.
</p>

</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Greene developed film series in coordination with University of Chicago affiliated organizations such as International House, the Renaissance Society, and the University Film Society. During the early 1940s, Greene and his family moved to Canada, where he served on the National Film Board. In Chicago, he was active on the Chicago Film Council, and organized the group's Films of the World Festival in 1947.

<p>William Rainey Harper (1856 -1906) was the first president of the University of
Chicago, from 1891 to 1906. Born on July 24,1856, Harper was the son of Samuel
Harper and Ellen Elizabeth Rainey. An excellent student, Harper learned Hebrew
at an early age and received his B.A. from Muskingum College at fourteen. After
working for a few years in his family's store, in 1873 he went on to graduate
work at Yale. There he studied philology, concentrating particularly on Hebrew.
His dissertation was entitled, ";A Comparative Study Prepositions in Latin,
Greek, Sanskrit and Gothic. Harper earned his Ph.D. in two years, graduating
just before his nineteenth birthday.</p>
<p>In 1875, Harper married Ella Paul and they moved to Macon, Tennessee where Harper
had found a position as the head of Masonic College. This was the first of
several positions, including Denison University, Baptist Union Theological
Seminary and Chautauque Institution, he held before returning to Yale in 1886 to
teach Hebrew in the Semitic Languages department and the Divinity School.</p>
<p>Harper remained at Yale for only a few years. He had already been a member of the
faculty at the Baptist Union Theological Seminary in Morgan Park, Illinois,
where he had taught Hebrew. Before leaving, he had been offered the presidency
of the failing old University of Chicago, so when the American Baptist
Educational Society formed and decided to organize a midwestern Baptist
university, Harper was invited to join the organizational committee. With the
financial support of John D. Rockefeller, a board of trustees was formed and
they soon nominated Harper for the presidency. On February 16, 1891, after
lengthy negotiations, he accepted the presidency of the new University of
Chicago. </p>
<p>Even before his official acceptance of the presidency, Harper was planning.
Although originally envisioned as a Baptist, undergraduate college for the
midwest, Harper had bigger ideas. Instead of merely an undergraduate institution
Harper wanted to promote his ideal of higher education with a combination of
undergraduate teaching and strong support for research. Also part of this plan
was a continuation of the kind of correspondence education he had developed at
the Baptist Union Theological Seminary and Yale. With this in mind, he began an
intensive period of recruitment and building. Harper worked tirelessly to
recruit first class faculty and raise money for his institution. He brought in
faculty from a range of fields and institutions, using his persuasive skills and
tenacity, as well as promises of time for research, to convince them to join the
new university. </p>
<p>Eventually, the university came to include graduate degree programs, adult
education programs, athletics, a university press and extension services. These
were in addition to the undergraduate college. It was formed according to the
plan of two years of general study of the classics followed by two years of
greater specialization. Harper himself taught in the Department of Semitic
Languages and Literatures. Despite the burden of administrative activities,
Harper was the chair of his department as well as president, he felt it was
important to teach. Even with this interest in teaching, a key part of Harper's
vision of higher education was research and scholarship. Harper wanted his
senior faculty to have ample time and freedom to pursue their research interests
as well as teach. This emphasis on research was somewhat novel at the time, but
Harper was able to exploit the absence of traditional constraints in forming a
new university in order to give research and scholarship a central role.</p>
<p>When he was not occupied with his educational plan, Harper was raising money and
soliciting donations, especially from John D. Rockefeller. In addition to the
recruitment of faculty and the organization of programs of study, there were
buildings to be built and academic ceremonies to be held. During all this
activity Harper continued to write, producing biblical commentaries and other
works, and maintaining a passionate interest in sports. He never stopped
planning for the future and continued to expand the university and include new
programs and schools over the following years. This caused problems in
budgeting, however, and Harper ran up large deficits in his fifteen years in the
presidency. These financial problems would not be addressed until Harry Pratt
Judson was appointed president after Harper.</p>
<p>In 1905, Harper became ill. Although he continued to work and teach throughout
the period of his illness, Harper died on January 10, 1906. He left behind the
foundations of the University of Chicago, which would continue to grow and
change after his death, but never lose his emphasis on a combination of
undergraduate education and scholarly research.</p>
<p>Harper and his wife, Ella, had three sons, Samuel Northrup, Paul and Donald, and
one daughter, Davida.</p>

<p>Yerkes Observatory, located in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, is a facility of the University of Chicago's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The observatory opened in 1897 as the joint creation of three founders: William Rainey Harper, the first president of the University of Chicago; Professor George E. Hale, the observatory’s first director; and Charles T. Yerkes, a wealthy Chicago businessman who provided funds for the erection of the observatory building. On the shores of Lake Geneva, this observatory was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, with landscape architecture by John Olmsted.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yerkes became known in the astronomical community as the home of the last of the great refracting telescopes, a 40-inch instrument first exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893. The observatory housed the university's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics until the 1960s, and was the site of some of the most significant research in modern astronomy and astrophysics. </p>
<p>In 1932, the University of Chicago struck an agreement with the University of Texas to construct an observatory endowed by the Texas banker William Johnson McDonald (1844–1926). Texas at that time had neither the funds nor the faculty for its operation. Under the agreement, the observatory was to be constructed and operated under the direction of Otto Struve, with the understanding that eventually University of Texas would assume complete responsibility for McDonald Observatory. As such, Dr. Struve became the first director of McDonald Observatory. The agreement between University of Chicago and the University of Texas was modified in 1959 as Texas’ program in astronomy broadened, and in 1962-1963 the entire operation of McDonald Observatory was placed under the Department of Astronomy at The University of Texas.</p>

<p>International House at the University of Chicago was constructed in 1932 at 1414 East 59th Street through the support of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. His hope was “to promote international understanding and friendship of the people of Chicago and the Middle West towards nations and cultures other than their own.” The co-educational residence was designed by Holabird and Roche, and built out of Indiana limestone in the gothic style. It could house over 500 students and was administered by a Board of Governors consisting of members of the faculty and representatives of the Chicago business community. </p>
<p>The idea for International House began in 1910 at Columbia University through the work of Harry E. Edmonds. International Houses were built in New York (1924); Berkeley, California (1930); Boston, and Paris. The goals of International House were (1) to provide educational facilities for students of different nationalities and races, (2) to promote understanding and friendship among students of diverse national, cultural, and social backgrounds, and (3) to serve as a cultural facility for the foreign students at the University of Chicago and other educational institutions in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Members of the International House organized dances, film festivals, lecture series, debates, and forums. The International House Council at the University of Chicago was one of the governing bodies of International House, along with the Board of Governors and the Senate.</p>
<p>The majority of the papers in this collection concern events of the early 1970s. In the spring of 1971 I-House announced the firing of part of its maid staff in an effort to economize. This led to active student protests, including picketing, and a call for more student participation in I-House budget-making. This led to the formation of the I-House Senate, which was composed of the I-House Governors and the I-House Council. Moreover, this event led to student membership on I-House Governors Committees, student attendance at I-House Governors meetings, increased budgets for activities such as film festivals, and a preservation of I-House cafeteria service. In the winter of 1972 students passed a referendum for co-ed housing, which was resisted by some students and led to changes in the amount of power given to I-House Council.</p>

<p>The Innominates club was an organization created by and for faculty in the physical, biological, and social sciences at the University of Chicago. According to the earliest records maintained by the club, the Innominates modeled themselves after faculty "shop clubs" at Harvard University. An organizational meeting of interested science faculty convened on February 5, 1917, at the Hotel del Prado in Hyde Park. At that meeting, founding members agreed that monthly meetings would consist of an evening meal and presentation of research in progress by an individual or group of collaborating members. Speakers and topics of discussion were to be pre-arranged in order to facilitate advance announcement. Initially, membership was to be limited to approximately twenty members, with new members admitted through a nomination and election process. The name Innominates--the unnamed or anonymous ones--was officially adopted for reasons left unelaborated in the record. The organizing members of the club were: Elbert Clark, Charles H. Swift (Anatomy); William E. Cary (Bacteriology); J. W. E. Glattfield, H. I. Schlesinger (Chemistry); L. I. Knight (Botany); J. H. Bretz, E. A. Stephenson (Geology); A. C. Lunn, A. R. Schweitzer (Mathematics); A. J. Dempster, Harvey B. Lemon (Physics); F. C. Koch, Arnold B. Luckhardt (Physiology); J. G. Sinclair (Zoology); and H. D. Kitson (Psychology). Harvey B. Lemon volunteered to serve as the group's first secretary.</p>
<p>The Innominates soon settled into a pattern of dinner and discussion at the Quadrangle Club, with occasional field trips and picnics. Over the years, attendance at meetings and the degree of formality and the scientific rigor of presentations fluctuated. The club carefully monitored its membership roster and preserved the original plan of admission by means of nomination and election. Submission of resignation was required for those wishing to leave the club, so that vacancies could be filled with active, bright, and interesting younger scholars. Gradually, the number of members, both active and inactive, grew to over forty. By the early 1940s, the secretary's minutes show that non-University of Chicago scholars were also inducted. Although members and topics of discussion predominantly represented the physical and biological sciences, membership and speaker lists attest to the participation of others, including anthropologists Fay-Cooper Cole and Fred Eggan.</p>
<p>The X-Club originated as a faculty club similar to, but distinct from, the Innominates. At an organizational meeting held January 10, 1928, X-Club founders established that the objective of the club would be "to broaden the scientific knowledge and interests of its members, and to promote acquaintance and friendship among its members, by meeting monthly for the presentation of some scientific subject by some member, and the informal discussion of the topic by the group." The initial concept of the club was that it should provide a forum of exchange for a maximum of twenty-five junior faculty members in the physical and biological sciences. Charter members were Walter Bartky (Astronomy), J. A. Bearden (Physics), W. W. Watson (Physics), Paul Cannon (Pathology), G. M. Dack (Bacteriology), and R. W. Gerard (Physiology). Like the Innominates, the X-Club selected members via nominations and ballot and quickly established a routine of dinner at the Quadrangle Club followed by lecture. Although the X-Club began strictly as a community of physical and biological scientists, it soon embraced social scientists, and in the 1960s and 70s it began to admit scholars from the humanities in order to foster interdisciplinary discussion.</p>
<p>The Innominates and the X-Club co-existed at the University of Chicago for many years, often sharing the same members and even holding occasional joint meetings. Neither club ever required its members to pay dues. When membership in both clubs began to dwindle, Donald Rowley (Pathology and Committee on Immunology) and Donald Fiske (Psychology) initiated the idea of a merger. In 1980, the members of both clubs voted to integrate the two organizations and member lists, thereby forming the Innominates/X-Club. The records of both predecessor clubs and of the combined Innominates/X-Club were presented to the University of Chicago Archives in 1982 after continuing decline in participation seemed to presage the club's demise. The consolidated club continued, however, despite diminished interest, until 1996 when it became inactive. Although presently dormant, the club has never been formally dissolved.</p>

<p>John Gunther, the internationally known journalist and writer, was born in 1901 in Chicago. He was educated in the public schools there and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1922, where he had been literary editor of the Daily Maroon, the campus newspaper. Soon after graduation he began work as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Daily News and remained in Europe until 1936. He was at various times in charge of Daily News offices in London, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, Rome, and Paris, and has worked or visited in every European country except Portugal. In 1936, he published the results of his early years of European experience in the first of his "inside" books, INSIDE EUROPE, which sold more than 500,000 copies.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For more than twenty years Gunther continued the writing of these phenomenally successful "inside" books which include INSIDE ASIA (1939), INSIDE LATIN AMERICA (1941), INSIDE U.S.A. (1947), INSIDE AFRICA (1955), INSIDE RUSSIA TODAY (1958), and most recently INSIDE EUROPE TODAY (1961). In addition, Gunther wrote a number of other books on current affairs as well as biographical studies of major figures in American life. These include D-DAY (1944), concerning the Allied invasion of Italy and the Mediterranean war in general; BEHIND THE CURTAIN (1949), investigating conditions in Europe at the time, especially the countries behind the Iron Curtain; ROOSEVELT IN RETROSPECT (1950); THE RIDDLE OF MACARTHUR (1951); EISENHOWER: THE MAN AND THE SYMBOL (1952); TAKEN AT THE FLOOD: THE STORY OF ALBERT D. LASKER (1960). In 1949, Gunther published the deeply moving account of the death of his young son, John, two years earlier, of a brain tumor, entitled DEATH BE NOT PROUD. In addition, he is the author of a series of juvenile books, which are revised versions for younger readers of chapters from INSIDE AFRICA and INSIDE RUSSIA TODAY. He has also written three other children's books on historical and mythical characters: ALEXANDER THE GREAT (1952), JULIUS CAESAR (1959), and THE GOLDEN FLEECE (1959). In 1955, Gunther prepared the text and captions for DAYS TO REMEMBER, a pictorial volume on America, 1945-1955, written in collaboration with Bernard Quint, associate art editor of Life.

<p>Jenkin Lloyd Jones, born in Wales in 1843, was brought to the United States by his parents in
1844 and was raised on a pioneer farm in Wisconsin. Several of his ancestors, including Jenkin Jones
and David Lloyd, had been pioneer ministers in the Arminian movement in Wales. Jones enlisted in the
Union army during the Civil War as a matter of conscience, fighting in the battles of Vicksburg,
Chattanooga, and Missionary Ridge. He was mustered out in 1865 as a confirmed opponent to war, a
position he maintained throughout his life. Upon graduation in 1870 from Meadville Theological
Seminary in Pennsylvania, he was ordained a Unitarian minister, serving at Winnetka, Illinois,
1870-71, and Janesville, Wisconsin, 1871-80. In 1882, Jones began missionary work on the south side
of Chicago, which resulted in the organization of All Souls Church, of which he remained pastor
until his death. Jones early in his career was active in forming "Mutual Improvement Clubs", a new
idea in church life in the 1870's, a movement that spread and eventually became the "Unity Clubs"
found in almost all Unitarian churches of the Middle West. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1874, Jones became secretary of the Western Unitarian Conference, a position he held until
1884. He infused new life into the dying organization, moved its headquarters to Chicago in 1880,
and devoted all of his time to the Conference, giving up his church in Janesville. He helped found
the weekly magazine Unity in 1878, dedicated to "Freedom, Fellowship and Character in Religion," and
remained its editor until his death. He set up a Sunday School society which published numerous
lessons and vigorous tract-publications. But Jones also led a movement within the Western Conference
for ethical rather than theological unanimity as the basis for liberal fellowship. This issue
erupted at the Cincinnati meeting of the Conference in 1886, where many of the conservative churches
withdrew and the eastern branch of the movement set up a rival organization. Until the breach was
healed in 1894, Jones used his editorship of Unity to advance the liberal cause and the magazine
became the mouthpiece of the liberal party within the movement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon after the foundation of All Souls Church Jones dropped the word "Unitarian". He felt that
denomination built a fence around religion and he did not want his church, even by remote
implication, to exclude anyone. This church became the nucleus of Jones' even more ambitious
project, the Abraham Lincoln Centre, founded in 1905. Lincoln Centre was a combination social, civic
and religious center in its early years, with All Souls Church at its core, but it also provided a
gymnasium, manual training, domestic science classes, reading rooms, libraries, lecture courses, as
well as study classes in subjects including religion, citizenship, literature. Jones' idea of
universal religion inspired the World's Parliament of Religion, in connection with the Columbian
Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He was the moving force behind the movement as well as its General
Secretary. He also sailed on the Ford Peace Ship Mission in December 1915 and became the chairman of
the Committee of Administration after the withdrawal of Henry Ford due to illness. He maintained his
pacifist viewpoint until his death and in 1918 his editorial opposition in Unity to war in general
and American participation in World War I led to the suspension of mailing privileges of the
magazine by the United States Postmaster-General. Jones also founded the Tower Hill (Wisconsin)
Summer Camp in 1889, which gave systematic lectures on literary and liberal religious subjects. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was the author of numerous works, among them: An Artilleryman's Diary (1914); The Faith That
Makes Faithful, with W. C. Gannett (1886); Jess: Bits of Wayside Gospel (1899); A Search for an
Infidel (1901); and Love for the Battletorn Peoples (1916). He received an honorary LL.D. from the
University of Wisconsin in 1909. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Susan Barber, Jones' first wife died in 1911. In 1915, he married Edith Lackersteen, his longtime
associate at Lincoln Centre. Jones died at Tower Hill, Wisconsin, in 1918. Edith Lloyd Jones died in
1932.</p>

<p>Founded in 1921, the Journal of Religion was part of a long lineage of religious history and studies journals. One of the journals that the Journal of Religion grew out of was The Biblical World, which in turn was a continuation of a journal founded by William Rainey Harper in 1882. First known as The Hebrew Student, it was re-titled The Old Testament Student and The Old and New Testament Student before becoming The Biblical World in 1893. Harper edited the journal until his death in 1906. The position of editor passed first to Ernest DeWitt Burton, then to Shailer Mathews in 1913. The journal solicited articles on Biblical scholarship, examining historical subjects as well as current religious issues. It was aimed at a popular rather than a strictly academic audience.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1897, the American Journal of Theology featured articles of a more technical and scholarly nature than The Biblical World. The title page stated that the "Faculty of the Divinity School" edited the journal, although by 1915 it was acknowledged that most of the faculty members were not directly involved in its production. The journal was reorganized in that year and two managing editors were named, Gerald B. Smith and Shirley Jackson Case, who served through 1920.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Biblical World and the American Journal of Theology were each published by the Divinity School and managed by a single board of editors. Due to financial difficulties with both publications, it was decided to merge them under a new title, the Journal of Religion, which appeared beginning in 1921 with Gerald Smith as editor. Although intended to combine the features of its two predecessors, the new journal increasingly emphasized the scholarly side of theological studies.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Smith served as editor until 1926, when he was replaced by Shirley J. Case. Upon Case's retirement from the University in 1939, the editorship was given to John Knox (1939</p>

<p>John Todd Wilson was born on March 17, 1914, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He was one of nine children of Reverend Clark Wilson and Alice Warren. John Wilson received his A.B. degree with distinction from George Washington University in 1941, an M.A. in 1942 from the State University of Iowa, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1948. He married Ann Camilli Wilson, his second wife, in 1939.</p>
<p>During World War II, Wilson served in the United States Naval Reserve. He was commissioned as an Ensign in 1942 and left the service as a Lieutenant Commander USNR in 1946.</p>
<p>In 1948, Wilson became Assistant Executive Secretary of the American Psychological Association while teaching concurrently as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at George Washington University. He returned to government service in 1950 as the head of the Personnel and Training Research Branch of the Office of Naval Research. He left the Office of Naval Research in 1952 for the newly created National Science Foundation, where he served as Program Director for Psychology in the Biological and Medical Sciences Division. In 1955, he became Assistant Director of NSF for Biological and Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>Wilson first came to the University of Chicago in 1961 as a special assistant to President George W. Beadle. He was also appointed as Professor of Psychology and taught graduate level courses. From 1963 to 1968 Wilson served as Deputy Director of the NSF and received the Foundation's first Distinguished Service Award.</p>
<p>Wilson returned to the University of Chicago in 1968 as Vice-President and Dean of Faculties. He became Provost in 1969 under President Edward H. Levi. While Provost, Wilson responded to the economic pressures of inflation and cutbacks in government aid to education by implementing a five-year austerity plan. He held the position of Provost until February 1975 when Levi resigned to become U.S. Attorney General. Wilson then became Acting President and expected to hold that position until a replacement was found. Although initially reluctant to accept the post, he was elected President by the Board of Trustees on December 9, 1975. He was noted for his fundraising efforts at a time of financial difficulty for all universities and as a supporter of student activities. He served as the ninth president of the University of Chicago until July 1, 1978, when he was succeeded by Hanna H. Grey.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Kleitman was born in Kishinev, Russia on April 26, 1895 to Jewish parents, Nathaniel and Pesia Kleitman. Nathaniel Kleitman, Sr. died of tuberculosis a few months prior to his son's birth. Pesia Kleitman remarried in 1900, and Nathaniel spent much of his childhood living with his maternal grandparents. He attended a private high school (a Realschule) until 1912. Kleitman studied briefly at Syrian Protestant College in Lebanon, now the American University of Beirut, in 1914. Following the outbreak of World War I, Kleitman and other foreign students were evacuated to Turkey. From there, Kleitman travelled to Greece, and then to New York in August of 1915. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1918. The following year, he earned his B.S. degree from what is now City College of New York. In 1920 he received his M.A. from Columbia University, followed by two years as an instructor in physiology and pharmacology at the University of Georgia. In 1923 he became a research associate in physiology at the University of Chicago and earned his Ph.D. that same year. Upon graduation, Kleitman was the recipient of a National Research Council fellowship which allowed him to continue his research at the University of Utrecht, the University of Paris, and the University of Chicago until 1925.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1925 as an assistant professor of physiology, and was named associate professor in 1929. He married Paulena Schweizer in 1927; they had two daughters, Hortense and Esther. Kleitman established the world's first sleep laboratory early in his career at the University of Chicago, and in 1939 published a seminal text on sleep research: Sleep and Wakefulness as Alternating Phases in the Cycle of Existence (revised and enlarged in 1963). Kleitman became a full professor at the University of Chicago in 1950.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Kleitman regularly used himself, family members, students, and assistants as research subjects. For several years, his daughters slept on beds designed to record sleep patterns. In 1938, Kleitman and post-graduate student Bruce Richardson lived for more than a month in Mammoth Cave in Kentucky to determine if humans could adapt to a twenty-eight-hour day in the absence of normal environmental cues of light and temperature change. They discovered that body temperatures fluctuate throughout the day, and that a person's peak efficiency coincides with peak body temperature. Kleitman continued this line of inquiry in 1948 when he spent two weeks aboard a submarine, the U.S.S. Dogfish, studying the relationship between mental alertness and temperature change. From May to July of 1951, Kleitman and his family lived in Tromso, in northern Norway, where he studied how long periods of exposure to daylight affected the sleep patterns of inhabitants of the Arctic Circle.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>These studies influenced the conception and scheduling of shift work for soldiers and industrial workers. Kleitman's research also greatly impacted scientists' understanding of circadian and ultradian rhythms. He proposed a regular, 90-minute cycle of rest and activity - in sleep and wakefulness - which he called the basic rest-activity cycle (BRAC).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1953, Dr. Kleitman and student Dr. Eugene Aserinsky famously reported their discovery of rapid eye movement (R.E.M.) during sleep in their paper "Regularly Occurring Periods of Eye Motility, and Concomitant Phenomena, During Sleep," published in the journal Science. They demonstrated the correlation between R.E.M. sleep and dreaming. A 1956 study of R.E.M. sleep with student William C. Dement dispelled the notion that dreams last for only a few seconds (the average person dreams for two hours a night).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Kleitman remained active in his profession long after his retirement from the University of Chicago in 1960. He published his last article at the age of eighty-seven, and was a participant in D. L. Bliwise's study, "Sleep in a Nonagenarian: N. Kleitman" (Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 2001) from age eighty-six to ninety-four. In 1995, at the age of one-hundred, Kleitman was a special guest at the American Professional Sleep Societies meeting in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he was accorded great respect for his impact on the field, and he interacted with other significant sleep researchers including Michel Jouvet, and former students William C. Dement and Eugene Aserinsky.

Her dissertation was entitled "The Onset of Structured Discourse: A Developmental Study of the Acquisition of Language." She examined how five children learned to speak through interactions with parents and caretakers and presented a major challenge to the dominant theories of Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. According to her dissertation advisor, Philip Lieberman, Professor of Linguistics at Brown University, she was one of the first people to show that children have different styles of acquiring language.&#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>While working on her dissertation she pursued a second major area of interest as a consultant and a collaborative researcher in Chicago at the Center for Craniofacial Anomalies at the University of Illinois Medical Center. Her work here focused on the effects of Crouzon and Apert syndromes on speech production.&#13;</p>
<p>Following a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in Speech Communications at MIT in 1981-2, she returned to Illinois and took a position as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>At the University of Chicago she worked on the connections between phonetics, computers, and language learning. In the 1990s, with her student Yukari Hirata, she researched the use of the Visipitch software program in language learning. With this program, students could watch how pitch rises and falls when a native speaks a language, and then learn to imitate it. Landahl had a wide variety of other linguistic interests, including the study of linguistic "others" such as feral children, sign-language using chimps and humans without tongues or with cleft palates, and the origins of human language. &#13;</p>
<p>&#13;</p>
<p>She was diagnosed with cancer in 2000 and her illness rendered her unable to speak. As a result, she moved from classroom teaching to spearhead a program in educational technology as Associate Dean for Computing and Language Technologies. Here she used her knowledge of speech perception and production to become a leader in the use of computers in language teaching.&#13;</p>

<p>She died on February 2, 2003.</p>

<p>James Laurence Laughlin was born on April 2, 1850 in Deerfield, Ohio. In the fall of 1869 he entered Harvard College and was graduated summa cum laude in history in 1873. He continued the study of history under Henry Adams at Harvard. He also taught at Hopkinson's Classical School in Boston. In 1876 he received his Ph. D. degree for his thesis on "The Anglo-Saxon Legal Procedure."
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1878 Laughlin was appointed instructor of political economy at Harvard. After receiving graduate training in economics, he was appointed an assistant professor at Harvard (1883-1888); during this period, Laughlin organized and sponsored the Political Economy Club. He also completed his History of Bimetallism in the United States in 1885. In 1888 Laughlin left Harvard and became president of the Manufacturer's Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia. He accepted a professorship in Political Economy at Cornell University in 1890.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Two years later President Harper appointed Laughlin Head Professor of Political Economy at the new University of Chicago. At Chicago, Laughlin introduced the seminar as a method of instruction and founded the Journal of Political Economy. In 1894, Laughlin proposed that the University establish a School of Commerce and Industry. The new professional school, which began undergraduate instruction in 1898, evolved into the Graduate School of Business.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 1916 Laughlin became Professor Emeritus. He moved to East Jaffery, New Hampshire, where he completed his Credit of Nations, published in 1918. He also wrote numerous magazine articles, largely on labor questions, including "Monopoly of Labor." He died on November 28, 1933.

<p>Born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1747, John Lewis was the only son born to Colonel Fielding Lewis by his first wife, Catherine Washington, the daughter of Major John Washington of Gloucester County, Virginia. After the death of Catherine Washington Lewis in 1750, Fielding Lewis married Betty Washington, the younger sister of George Washington. This union provided young John Lewis with eleven half-brothers and -sisters. As befitted the eldest son of a well-to-do eighteenth- century American, John Lewis went abroad for much of his education. He returned to Virginia in about 1769, having studied for a time at Oxford.</p>
<p/>
<p>In that year John Lewis, who was to be widowed four times, took as his first wife – his cousin Lucy Thornton of Caroline County, Virginia. Lucy died shortly after the birth of a daughter, Mildred, and in 1771 Lewis was married for the second time, to Elizabeth Thornton of Northumberland County, Virginia. This marriage lasted only a few months before Lewis was widowed again. His third marriage, to Elizabeth Bates Jones, the daughter of Gabriel Jones, produced three sons (the younger two are represented in this sub-collection): Fielding (1773-1798), Gabriel (1775-1864), and Warner Washington (1779-1833). Widowed a third time in 1783, Lewis was married again in 1786, this time to Mary Ann Fontaine Armistead, the daughter of Peter Fontaine and widow of Bowles Armistead. Already the mother of four children, Mary Ann Lewis bore three more by John Lewis: Frances, Howell, and Mary Ann. The death of his fourth wife in 1799 left John Lewis a widower once more. His last marriage, to Mildred Ann Byrd Carter Mercer, the daughter of Landon Carter and widow of Robert Mercer, was not a happy one, and after the birth in 1810 of a son, Attaway, the couple separated.</p>
<p/>
<p>As a young Virginian John Lewis enrolled in the state militia, attaining the rank of captain in about 1780, and assisted his father in the manufacture of gunpowder. His father's death in 1781 left the business entirely in Lewis' hands. At the same time he continued to be active in civic affairs, holding a seat on the Common Council of Fredericksburg. In 1785 he became seriously ill, and recuperated during lengthy visits to Abingdon, the home of Dr. David Stuart, and to Mount Vernon. (George Washington noted the latter visit in his diary). During the 1790's Lewis became interested in western lands, and after his separation from his fifth wife, he moved to Warren County, Kentucky, with his daughter Mary Ann.</p>
<p/>
<p>Meanwhile Lewis' sons Gabriel and Warner Washington had also settled in Kentucky. The sons' connection with western affairs had begun in 1801 when they were employed by their father's half- brother Lawrence Lewis, the principal executor of the estate of George Washington, to survey the Kentucky lands belonging to the Washington estate. At the same time the two acted as agents for their father in locating tracts connected with military warrants he was purchasing. John Lewis gradually consolidated these properties into a single large holding in Warren County, and it was there that he and his daughter settled when they moved west in 1811. About a year later, however, Lewis' title to his Kentucky lands was challenged in the Kentucky courts, which decided in favor of the rights of the squatters on the property. Now landless, Lewis joined his sons in Logan County and remained at their home, “Elmwood,” until his death in 1825.</p>
<p/>
<p>Gabriel Lewis outlived his father by nearly forty years, married twice, and fathered many children. Warner Washington Lewis, however, lived for only eight years after his father's death. He was drowned in an accident on the Wabash River while on a journey to New Harmony, Indiana, in the late spring or summer of 1833.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The first period in the history of the University Library, extending from the opening of the University in 1892 to the end of Zella Allen Dixson's administration in 1910, was marked by a continuing debate between proponents of departmental libraries and advocates of a consolidated central library. While decentralization of library resources was a common pattern at many colleges and universities during the late nineteenth century, departmental autonomy developed to an unusual degree at the University of Chicago. The recurring waste and inefficiency of acquisition and cataloging under a departmental system drew repeated criticism during the first eighteen years of the University Library's existence, yet the convenience afforded individual departments and faculty served to insure the retention of dispersed book collections.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The origin of these difficulties lay in William Rainey Harper's initial plan for the organization of the University Library. According to the prospectus issued in the first two numbers of the Official Bulletin (January and April 1891), the University Library was to consist of a General Library and a supporting series of departmental, laboratory, classroom, and extension libraries. The University Librarian, the chief administrative figure, was to be an executive officer of the University working under the direction of the University Council. The Librarian would have direct control of the General Library and supervise the operation of the departmental and auxiliary libraries. Each academic department was to be provided its own library and reading room, developed in consultation with the department head and controlled by an adviser appointed from the faculty.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This plan, never more than a rudimentary outline, was temporarily laid aside once Harper turned his attention to the acquisition of books and the recruitment of library staff. In July 1891, Zella Allen Dixson, the librarian of the Baptist Union Theological Seminary, was appointed Assistant Librarian on a half-time basis, with full-time duties to begin in October 1892. Dixson was to prepare the 10,000-volume B.U.T.S. library for transfer to the University of Chicago campus, and there supervise its integration with the 40,000-volume library being received as a legacy of the Old University of Chicago. Several weeks after Dixson's appointment, Harper augmented these collections with a remarkable purchase made in the course of a European tour: the entire stock of the Berlin book dealer S. Calvary, said to number 450,000 volumes. Although the University ultimately received only 96,650 volumes of books and theses from Calvary, the acquisition of the so-called "Berlin Collection" placed the University Library immediately on par with the largest academic libraries in the country.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The size of these holdings and the complexity of organization envisioned by Harper made the appointment of a strong experienced University Librarian crucial. Harper felt he had found such a personality in Zella Dixson's mentor, Melvil Dewey, creator of the Dewey classification system and head of the innovative state library school in Albany, New York. During negotiations with Harper in early 1892, Dewey expressed an interest in assuming the dual position of University Librarian and Director of the University Extension, offering as well to bring his library school to the University of Chicago. Negotiations collapsed, however, when the New York state regents reassured Dewey of their support and granted him a substantial raise in salary. With Dewey's services lost and other matters pressing him from all sides, Harper suspended the search for a University Librarian and allowed the day-to-day supervision of the General Library to fall to Zella Dixson.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The most serious problem faced by the University Library during its first year of operation was the lack of an adequate building to house the book collections. Although Henry Ives Cobb's plan for the campus had included an impressive University Hall and Library on Ellis Avenue, no donor was ever found to provide funds for the structure. Instead, the General Library was housed in temporary space on the second floor of Cobb Hall during Autumn Quarter, 1892. In January 1893, the Library was moved into new quarters in a temporary Gymnasium-Library located in the northeast quadrangle of the campus. This one-story building, constructed as quickly and cheaply as possible, held the General Library stacks, offices, and reading room, as well as a women's gymnasium, a men's gymnasium, and the offices of the University Press. Constantly exposed to the dangers of fire and storm, the General collections remained in this overcrowded space until September 1902, when they were transferred to the second and third floors of the new University Press Building at 58th and Ellis. A final move to permanent quarters in Harper Memorial Library did not come until 1912.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Continual problems of space were compounded by the difficulties of inadequate administration. When the Library opened in the fall of 1892, it had been made part of one of the five divisions of the University, the University Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums, which was to include the General and departmental libraries, the General Museum and all special museums, and the laboratories of the University with their apparatus and materials. The division was to be headed by the Director of the University Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums, but this position, like the position of University Librarian, was never filled. In the absence of a Director or a University Librarian, the main administrative responsibilities devolved on the Board of Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums, a fifteen-member body formed in January 1893. The Board, consisting of President Harper, Zella Dixson, and members appointed from the faculty, soon found itself immersed in such matters as the pasting of labels into books, the setting of fines, the wording of gift acknowledgements, and the enforcement of regulations governing the printing and distribution of University theses and dissertations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By far the greatest portion of the Board's time, however, was devoted to the persistently troublesome issue of departmental libraries. Organized informally as soon as the University opened, these libraries quickly began ordering books and establishing catalogs and rules under the direction of the faculty adviser and his student assistants. Four departmental libraries were already in operation by the end of Autumn Quarter, 1892; by early 1893, there were thirteen, and by Spring Quarter, 1895, the number had increased dramatically to twenty-four. The lack of a central library building and the inadequate space available for the General Library collections might have forced the development of a departmental system in any case, but the strong influence of the departments and their faculty, when combined with the lack of a strong Library administrator, made the drift of events permanent. Departmental libraries were soon scattered all over the growing campus, and provision for them became a standard element of each newly constructed University building. By 1898, departmental libraries held 65,000 volumes housed in forty-two separate rooms in ten buildings: Kent Laboratory, for example had three rooms devoted to the Chemistry, Public Speaking, and Music libraries, while Cobb Hall had eighteen library rooms holding seven departmental collections ranging from History and Political Economy to English.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The problems inherent in such a poorly controlled system were readily apparent. The fact that departmental libraries were administered by a faculty member, not a professional librarian and that the staff consisted solely of graduate students meant that cataloging was often irregular or incomplete. As departments moved frequently from building to building, so did the libraries-so frequently, in fact, and with such little concern for the system that in 1898 the Board directed departments not to move their libraries without first giving notice. Volumes in departmental libraries were not intended to circulate (except over-night in unusual circumstances), but by 1899 the ease of faculty and student access produced such steady losses of books that the Board recommended to the Trustees that a private detective be hired to investigate the situation. Stocks for departmental libraries came in part from departmental purchases, but they also developed through transfers from the holdings of the General Library and the un-cataloged mass of the Berlin Collection. Two or more departmental libraries could thus often claim priority for the transfer of the same volumes as each attempted to fortify its own holdings at the expense of the General collections.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Increasingly, the Board of Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums was forced to enter the fray as an adjudicator of such disputes and of other questions arising from the management of the departmental libraries. In 1895, William I. Thomas of the Sociology Department was appointed Superintendent of Departmental Libraries; he was given "general oversight of the administration of departmental libraries" and charged with examining all departmental book purchase and transfer requests, but his powers were limited to recommendations to the Board on actions it might take. In November 1896, the Board appointed Thomas to head a Committee on the Development of the Departmental Libraries in Connection with the General Library. Thomas's committee, after assessing the complete range of problems generated by the departmental system, recommended that the growth of departmental libraries be rigorously controlled through two new regulations: that 50 per cent of each department's book budget be allocated for books in its field in the General Library, and that each departmental library be limited to 3,000 volumes, after which any new acquisitions would be balanced by transfers back to the General collections. The Board considered Thomas's report in January 1897, but tabled it after an inconclusive discussion.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Efforts to reform the departmental system and plan for the future of the General Library did not resume until two years later. In April 1899, several days after President Harper expressed renewed concern for the physical safety of the General collections, the University Senate appointed a committee consisting of Professors Ernest D. Burton, J. L. Laughlin, Harry P. Judson, T. C. Chamberlin, and John U. Nef to consider the entire Library situation and its relation to educational policy. After surveying alternative systems of organization, the committee recommended that science libraries remain in departmental buildings, but that libraries in the social sciences and modern languages be located in a central library building. Following this lead, the Board of Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums in 1899-1900 directed the consolidation of twelve departmental libraries into three new group libraries: the Classical Group (Comparative Philology, Greek, Latin, and Archaeology); the Historical Group (Political Economy, Political Science, History, and Sociology); and the Modern Language Group (Romance Languages, Germanic Languages, English Languages, and English Literature).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In October 1900, the library question was taken up by yet another University body. During the regular quarterly meeting of the University Congregation, Professors Judson and Burton debated the merits of the departmental system, Judson recommending the greatest possible degree of consolidation, while Burton argued that interdisciplinary needs could be met by a consolidated catalog and a system of underground book-railways linking the General and departmental libraries. Following this discussion, the Congregation polled the departmental library committees and found that a consensus existed to permit science buildings to keep their departmental libraries, but that other departmental libraries would agree to locate in a central building only if their separate identities were maintained.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>These conclusions were passed on to the Board of Libraries, Laboratories, and Museums, which in turn appointed Burton, Frederick I. Carpenter, and Zella Dixson as a committee to review them. The committee returned its recommendations to the Congregation in November 1901: that science department libraries be retained in their own buildings; that six Group Libraries (Philosophy and History, Theology and Semitic Languages, Classical Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics and Astronomy, and Music and Fine Arts) be located in or attached to the General Library; and most significant of all, that the new central library building be located not at the designated Ellis Avenue site but instead on 59th Street at the south edge of campus, near the presumed site of the future social science and modern language buildings. After a second poll of the departments produced no further signs of agreement on the issue of consolidation, the Congregation asked the Board of Trustees to establish a commission to consult with an architect and formulate a proposal for an integrated library system.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Joint Commission on Library Building and Policy, appointed by the Trustees in June 1902, included President Harper, Trustee Martin Ryerson, and Professors Carpenter, Coulter, Small, Judson, and W. G. Hale, with Burton serving as chairman. After discussions among its members and meetings with architect Charles Coolidge of the firm of Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge, the Commission submitted its report in August 1902. Quickly approved by the Congregation, the report was endorsed by the Trustees in September 1902. In short, the Commission's plan called for the central library to be housed in a long narrow building on a constricted site at the south edge of the quadrangles. The central library would be surrounded by departmental buildings, each with its own group library, and would be connected to them by bridges. To the west would be erected the Modern Language and Classics buildings, with the Historical and Social Science departments to the east, and Law, Philosophy, and Divinity to the north. The Commission also proposed the creation of a general catalog which would include the holdings of both the General and departmental libraries. The central building itself, housing the General Library, and some departmental stacks, was to provide space for 1,500,000 to 1,750,000 books and permit the growth of the General and Humanities Group collections for the next 75 to 100 years. Shortly after the adoption of the Commission's report, President Harper appointed Burton to tour libraries, universities, and colleges in the eastern United States and report on physical and administrative solutions to library problems adopted at other institutions. Burton's suggestions were incorporated into ongoing planning for the central library, although funds for construction of the building had not yet appeared.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When President Harper died in January 1906, the idea quickly grew that some sort of permanent memorial to his name should be established on campus. John D. Rockefeller agreed to give up to $600,000 toward the erection of a library in Harper's memory if $200,000 could be raised from other sources. This was quickly accomplished through the creation of the Harper Memorial Fund. Ground for Harper Memorial Library was finally broken on January 10, 1910, and the cornerstone was laid on June 14.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>1910 was a turning point in the Library's history in another sense as well. Not only was the long-needed central building underway, but, Zella Dixson resigned her position as Associate Librarian effective July 1. Although the official announcement stated that she was leaving to devote her time to private literary interests, it appears likely that her resignation was forced. During her eighteen years as head of the General Library, Dixson had often been the focus of faculty complaints. Her courses in library science, first offered through the Extension in 1897, drew such criticism from the American Library Association that the University dropped them in 1902. Part of Burton's tour of the East in 1903 had in fact been devoted to inquiries about possible successors to Dixson.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If Zella Dixson's departure was a propitious development, the end of the first period in the Library's history was nevertheless marked by irony. President Harper's inability to secure the services of a University Librarian was, as Richard Storr has noted, his greatest and most puzzling failure as an academic organizer, while Harper's devotion to the departmental system had set in motion precisely those forces which made the construction of the library named in his honor so tortuously difficult to achieve. As late as 1903, in the wake of the Library Commission's report, Harper still found himself, in the President's Decennial Report, satisfied with the departmental system: "Without question," he wrote, "this policy is attended with some disadvantages, but upon the whole it may be said that it secures advantages which more than outweigh the disadvantages." Zella Dixson's successors, Ernest D. Burton and J. C. M. Hanson, would have to confront the legacy of this position, the organizational weakness it had encouraged, and the awkward administrative compromises it had produced, embodied now in the permanent form of Harper Memorial Library.

<p>Rev. William Eleazar Barton (1861-1930) The Rev. William Eleazar Barton (1861-1930) was one of the early twentieth century's most prominent writers and lecturers on the life of Abraham Lincoln. Born in Sublette, Illinois, in the same year Lincoln assumed the presidency, Barton grew up in an environment heavily influenced by reverence for Lincoln. After pursuing undergraduate studies at Berea College in Kentucky, Barton earned his divinity degree from the Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1890. He served parishes in Tennessee, Ohio, and Massachusetts before becoming the pastor of the First Congregational Church of Oak Park, Illinois, a position he held until his retirement in 1924. Four years later, Barton accepted an appointment as lecturer at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, where he also organized and served as pastor of the Collegeside Congregational Church.
</p>
<p>Barton's work as a writer produced a number of denominational manuals for church organization and a series of books presenting the wisdom and parables of a character he named Safed the Sage. For the last ten years of his life, however, Barton was best known to the public as a prolific author and lecturer on Abraham Lincoln. His publications about Lincoln included The Soul of Abraham Lincoln (1920), The Paternity of Abraham Lincoln (1920), The Life of Abraham Lincoln (1925), The Great and Good Man (1927), The Women Lincoln Loved (1927), and The Lincoln of the Biographers (1930).
</p>
<p>In the course of compiling material for his writings and talks, Barton visited Lincoln sites in Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois; interviewed surviving Lincoln relatives and acquaintances; and traveled as far as California and England to collect information and conduct genealogical research on the ancestry of the Lincoln family. While acquiring a large collection of books, periodicals, pamphlets, manuscripts, and ephemera related to Lincoln and the Civil War era, Barton also purchased privately or at auction historical materials amassed by other Lincoln collectors such as John E. Burton and Osborn H. Oldroyd.

</p>
<p>The sociologist Luther Lee Bernard (29 Oct. 1881-23 Jan. 1951) was born in Russell County, Kentucky to the farmer Hiram H. Bernard and his wife Julia Wilson. Hiram H. Bernard, a former Union solider treated Luther tyrannically and that led to a bitter and antagonistic relationship between them. The family moved to West Texas in 1891 where Luther enrolled with teachers who introduced him to the subject of modern science and the writings of Charles Darwin.
</p>
<p>After attending a high school which offered no grades Bernard entered Pierce Baptist College in Missouri. Graduating in1900, Bernard stayed on to teach science for two years; two more years teaching languages at Lamar College followed. After that Bernard entered the University of Missouri to complete his BA degree in 1907.
</p>
<p>While Bernard earned his BA he studied with the sociologist, Charles A. Ellwood, a PhD from the University of Chicago. Ellwood’s reputation rested on the theory that society was bound by a “physic” rather than “real” bond. Bernard, in becoming a confrontational scholar would later critique these ideas.
</p>
<p>Bernard earned his PhD at the University of Chicago under Albion Small. His thesis, “An objective standard of social control,” promoted the study of society as a whole over the study of the individual representative. He used the work of Emile Durkheim to critique the tradition of psychological sociology. Studying the whole of society would give a better scientific “social control.” This thesis involved a harsh critique on the work of Albion Small and thus the two scholars parted ways. In leaving the University of Chicago Bernard delivered a scathing six page letter in which he condemned the University of Chicago’s Department of Sociology for it’s approach toward education and which involved a heavy use of theory and abstraction rather than application and an aloofness towards student that hurt the students in their job searches. This was the first of the many confrontations he would provoke during his career.
</p>
<p>Bernard was unsatisfied with his first job placement after his degree and viewed his position at the University of Florida as a form of exile from the academy. He moved on to the Universities of Minnesota (1918-1925) and North Carolina (1928-1929), Washington University in St. Louis (1929-1946), and Pennsylvania State (1947-1950). His frequent moving was viewed by his colleagues as reflective of his hypersensitive and prickly personality in addition to scandals that arose when his adulterous affairs began shortly after he married Francis Fenton, his fellow graduate student, in 1911. The marriage produced one child and Bernard and Fenton divorced in 1922. While teaching in Minnesota, the administrators forced Bernard’s resignation when he was charged with “common-law-marriage” which was then illegal in that state. Before moving on to Cornell in September 1925, Bernard married the gifted graduate student, Jessie Ravitch (more than twenty years his junior), whose scholastic work as Jessie Bernard surpassed his own. They had three children and remained married until his death but his philanderous practices made their marriage a stormy one. All in all, Bernard’s confrontational personality and rumors of his personal life subdued his academic achievements.
</p>
<p>Despite his personal and professional troubles and the third rate universities that employed him Bernard grew to be “leading proponent of a radical variant of objectivist sociology”. He stated that positivistic sociology requires “projective logic,” which was later compounded by C. Wright Mill’s call for a “sociological imagination”.
</p>
<p>Bernard argued that the ideal situation was one in which the individual adjusted perfectly to his surrounding environment. In Instinct he argued that instincts were learned customs and traditions, the way to social progress was through a manipulation of the environment.
</p>
<p>In the 1930’s Bernard began collecting “life histories” in preparation for a history of sociology. He also collaborated with his wife Jessie Bernard in researching and published the history of positivism which they presented in 1943 as Origins of American Sociology. Extremely active within his profession, Bernard corresponded frequently with his “life history” interview subjects and with potential allies in his sociological debates. His letters became widely known as “L.L.B.’s onion skins.”
</p>
<p>Considered a rebel within the field of Sociology Bernard, decided to take a more dominant role within professional organizations and organized a group to oppose the interpretive policies of the American Sociological Society (ASS). Successful in his opposition, Bernard was elected president in 1932. He emphasized research on contemporary social issues and recruiting women into the field. In Bernard’s presidential address he alienated many colleagues by attacking the existing research establishments. The Sociological Research Association was founded as a response and Bernard viewed his exclusion as an “elitist plot.” Bernard continued his struggle against the sociological establishment and resigned from the ASS in 1938. He then undertook editing American Sociologists which became the outlet for his professional opinions until 1947.
</p>
<p>Concerned with the sociological position of the “little man” and not assured that New Deal focus on business was the only answer to the Depression, Bernard spoke out against Roosevelt and called for an “objective standard” that would balance the focus of the profession of sociology. Concerned with international issues since before his Argentinean fellowship (1926-1927) he spoke out against Fascism. Before the war ended Bernard published his critique, War and Its Causes and rejected the barbarity of war throughout history.
</p>
<p>Although he perceived himself as marginalized from the sociological profession Bernard influenced his student George Lunberg who brought Bernard’s focus on “sociological objectivism” into the post war debate.
</p>
<p>Bernard passed away in State College, Pennsylvania in 1951.

<p>Lloyd Appleton Metzler was born on April 3, 1913 in Lost Springs, Kansas. He attended the University of Kansas, where he studied economics under John Ise and earned a Bachelor's degree in 1935 and an MBA in 1938. Metzler then entered Harvard University. He served as an instructor and tutor at Harvard and completed a Ph.D. in economics in 1942. His dissertation, "Interregional Income Generation," earned him the Wells Prize. That same year, Metzler was the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From Harvard, Metzler went on to Washington, D.C., where worked for the Office of Strategic Services and several economic policy and planning commissions between 1943 and 1946. Metzler joined the research staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1944. In 1946 he returned to academia when he accepted a teaching position at Yale University. He soon left Yale for the University of Chicago in 1947, where he remained for the rest of his career.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dr. Metzler survived surgery for a brain tumor in 1952, and with the help of his wife Edith, managed to continue teaching and writing for the next twenty years. He served as Editor of the Journal of Political Economy from 1966 until his retirement in 1971. Metzler made numerous contributions to business cycle literature, macro-monetary theory, tariff theory, mathematical economics, and the field of international trade. The Metzler paradox, Laursen-Metzler effect, and Metzler matrix, all bear his name. He died on October 26, 1980.</p>

<p>State lotteries were used in 18th and early 19th century Britain to raise the capital for a variety of state projects. In this capacity, early state lotteries essentially functioned as loans to the government and prior to 1796 every ticket was guaranteed some return.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Initially, state lotteries worked to curb popular participation. Individual tickets were priced beyond the means of anyone but the wealthy out of a paternalistic concern to protect the lower classes from being seduced into deprivation. This scheme worked well for a time until lottery brokers devised schemes to sell fractional shares of tickets enabling them to reap greater profits from an expanded popular participation. This shift by ticket sellers seeking to draw a popular audience is reflected in the handbills used to advertise state lotteries.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thomas Bish, accrued both fame and notoriety as a lottery broker. Bish was a major proponent, and profiteer, of state lotteries and played a significant role in their popularization. To this end he produced a variety of handbills designed to appeal to people of more modest means. The lotteries came to an end in 1826 amidst increasing corruption, unscrupulous practices by ticket sellers and intensifying concerns over the promotion of gambling.

<p>Colonel Edmund Lyne was a frontier entrepreneur of the late eighteenth century, who lived and owned land in Blue Licks, which became a part of Nicholas County, Kentucky. He operated salt licks, a whiskey still, and a ferry service until his death in November or early December, 1791. </p>
<p/>
<p>The collection is primarily of interest for what it reveals about the life-style of a man in Lyne's circumstances, his standard of living and his role in the commodity-exchange economy of the region. Lyne dealt in buffalo, beef, pork, basic foodstuffs, and whiskey. He traded salt for a number of items, including shoes, tallow, livestock, linen, and china. Chores connected with his various entrepreneurial projects were done either by slaves (manumitted at his death) or by hired laborers. As a rule little cash was exchanged, although Lyne did use it to purchase paper, a beehive, a butter mold, and wine glasses.</p>
