        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>Ruth Falkenau was born on September 28, 1895 to Esther Friend Greenebaum and Harry Falkenau, a well-regarded Chicago musician, critic and bookseller. Falkenau received her bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago in 1918. From 1919 to 1930, Falkenau corresponded with American poet and writer Carl Sandburg. The exact nature of their relationship is unclear, but Falkenau seems to have assisted in Sandburg's correspondence with publishers. Falkenau died on June 8, 1988.</p>
