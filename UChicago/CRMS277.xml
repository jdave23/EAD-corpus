        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>This is a volume containing student notes on the lectures of Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). The lectures are broken up into general subjects and subsections, and they seem to be of a fairly general nature describing the basic physiological and psychological make-up and processes of human beings. Rush was a well-known doctor in Philadelphia during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He taught at the College of Philadelphia, the University of the State of Pennsylvania, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was also a signer of the Declaration of Independence, served in the army during the war, helped in the ratification process of the Constitution, and was active in the early abolition and temperance movements. According to the records of the John Crerar Library, this is a notebook of a student who attended and recorded the lectures of Dr. Rush.  At the front of the notebook, on the first flyleaf, is written the name and address: “Thomas F. Gibbs, 935 R.I. Ave,” along with the note: “Prof. Rush’s Lectures.” </p>
