        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>Uncle Tom's Cabin: or, Life Among the Lowly was an anti-slavery novel that profoundly affected American attitudes towards African Americans and slavery in the United States.  The best-selling novel of the 19th century, Uncle Tom's Cabin is credited both with galvanizing Northern support for the Civil War and with creating a number of durable stereotypes about blacks.  Major themes of this sentimental novel are the fundamental incommensurability of slavery and Christianity, the abiding power of Christian love, and the moral power and sanctity of women.

        <p>
</p>
        <p>Uncle Tom's Cabin generated great interest in England.  Vendors sold 200,000 copies in 1852, its debut year.  Critics generally agree that this fascination with the tale stemmed from British antipathy to America.  Brits did not necessarily harbor their own national hatred of slavery, but felt vindicated by the play's criticism of Americans' self-professed freedoms.

        <p>
</p>
        <p>The collection contains promptbooks, playbills, posters, programs and other pictorial or printed ephemera, most of which are of British origin and describe or announce theatrical presentations of the tale. The announcements of presentations typically contain specific information about actors, scenes, and the venue.  Most of the other documents are critical reviews of performances of various adaptations of Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Although the documents span the dates 1852 to 1956, most date from the mid to late 19th century.
