        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>This collection of seven scrapbooks was titled by its author as “Fogarty’s Process of Making Water Gas (and simultaneously producing ammonia and carbonates of soda). Journals labeled A-E mainly contain clippings on the new processes and apparatuses for making gas at the end of the 19th century, the same time Fogarty was working on his Water Gas apparatus. Engineering, chemistry, and gas usage as the main source of fuel and energy are the main topics of the clippings. Sources of the materials include the Scientific American, Progressive Age, American Gas-Light Journal, and The Engineer and Mining Journal. 
</p>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>In addition to the collection of Jogarty’s clippings, other elements of the scientific environment of the era are included in the content of the scrapbooks. Journal A contains a published paper by Fogarty which was read at the American Gas-light Association in 1882. The scrapbook labeled Patent--Scraps contains clippings addressing the issues surrounding patent laws and debated cases of patent ownership.
