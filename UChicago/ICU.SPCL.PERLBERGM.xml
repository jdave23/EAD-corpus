        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>Mark Perlberg was born in 1929 in Palisade, New Jersey. In 1950, he graduated from Hobart College with a degree in English Literature. While taking graduate courses at Columbia University in 1952, he was called to serve in the Korean War. In 1953, he married Anna Backer and, in 1954, he was discharged from the service. He then began his career as a journalist with Time Magazine, relocating to Chicago in 1956. He later worked for Encyclopaedia Britannica, World Book Encyclopedia, and Prism. During this time, he and Anna had two daughters, Katherine Eve and Julie Anna. In 1968, he co-founded the Poetry Center of Chicago, serving as president for 13 years. He also taught a poetry workshop at the Newberry Library for nearly 20 years. Perlberg has five published poetry collections: The Burning Field (1970), The Feel of the Sun (1981), The Impossible Toystore (2000), Waiting for the Alchemist (2009), and Theater of Memory: New and Selected Poems (2012). Mark Perlberg died on June 23rd, 2008 in Skokie, Illinois. His wife, Anna, was instrumental in bringing his final collection to publication. </p>
