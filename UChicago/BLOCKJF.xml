        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>Jean Friedberg Block, a lifelong Hyde Park resident, was born in 1912.  She received a master’s degree from the University of Chicago in 1963 and was awarded the Alumni Association Public Service Citation in 1981.  A founding member of the Hyde Park Historical Society, Block also served on the boards of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Architecture Foundation and International House.
</p>
        <p>Block was a renowned expert on the architecture of the University and its surrounding neighborhood.  Her 1978 book, Hyde Park Houses: An Informal History, 1856-1910, describes the neighborhood’s sociological and architectural transformation from bucolic suburb to urban neighborhood through photographs and text.  Block next turned her attention to the aesthetics of the university itself.  In 1983, the University of Chicago published her second book, Writing in The Uses of Gothic: Planning and Building the Campus of the University of Chicago 1892–1932.  Block was a lead author and coordinator of The Uses of Gothic, a 1985 exhibit in the Special Collections Research Center. At the time of her death, Mrs. Block was writing a history of apartment houses and their effect on Chicago neighborhoods from 1910 to 1950.
</p>
        <p>Block died in 1988 at the age of 76.  She was survived by two children and five grandchildren.  The sunken viewing garden directly north of the Joseph Regenstein Library was named the Jean F. Block Memorial Garden after her death.
