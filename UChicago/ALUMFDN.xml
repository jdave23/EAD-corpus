        <p>This collection tracks fundraising campaigns from 1941 to 1965. The collection is organized first by campaign year, covering fundraising campaigns from 1948-1955 and 1959-1961, each year containing correspondence, membership lists, minutes, and progress reports. The collection includes the Foundation's "Honor Roll" of donors for 1942-1946. Contributions are broken down by graduating class, city, and degree granted; individual contribution amounts are not listed. The collection concludes with scrapbooks containing fundraising materials - predominately mailings - from 1941 to 1965.</p>
