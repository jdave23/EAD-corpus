      <abstract label="Abstract">In 1912 the construction of a new University of Chicago Library was completed.  The building was dedicated in memory of the University of Chicago’s first President, William Rainey Harper, who died in 1906.  The Harper Memorial Library was then renovated in 1973 and rededicated in conjunction with the renovation of Wiebolt Hall.  Materials in this collection include programs, booklets, speeches, film media, and miscellaneous memorabilia associated with the 1912 and 1973 dedication ceremonies.</abstract>

        <head>Biographical Note</head>
        <p>In 1902 the University of Chicago saw the need to construct a permanent central library.  Plans for the new library were underway when the university’s first President, William Rainey Harper, passed away in 1906.  To honor his service to the university, it was decided that the new library would be dedicated to his memory.  Construction began in 1910 when the first cornerstone was laid.  The building was completed in June of 1912, when the first dedication ceremony took place.  Harper Memorial Library served as the main library for the university until the Regestein Library opened in September of 1970.  At this time, Harper Library and Wiebolt Hall (originally constructed in 1928) were renovated to preserve their unique architecture and make them better able to meet the university’s growing needs.  The rededication ceremony in 1973 marked the completion of these renovations and the transformation of the Harper Memorial Library from the university’s main library to the new College Center, designed to be the distinctive home for the undergraduate College.</p>
