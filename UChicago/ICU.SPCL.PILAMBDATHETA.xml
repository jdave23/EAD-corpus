        <head>Historical Note</head>
        <p>Pi Lambda Theta is an honor society for educators which was founded in 1910 by the Dean of Education at the University of Missouri, Dr. W.W. Charters.  As a member of Phi Beta Kappa, an honor society who admitted only men at the time, Dr. Charters sought to create a similar honor and professional society for women educators.  Six other Midwestern institutions had joined the University of Missouri in creating local charters by 1916.  In 1917, the society increased its regional scope to a national one, and by the 2000s, it had sixty-three regional, national, and international charters and 15,000 men and women members.
</p>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>The mission of the Pi Lambda Theta is to honor academic excellence, promote leadership among educators, encourage educational research, and make available to members activities and resources for pursuing these goals.
</p>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>Pi Lambda Theta installed the Lambda Chapter at the University of Chicago in June, 1921.  Its meetings were held on campus in Judd Hall where the Department of Education was housed.  Different members of the Education Faculty served as Faculty Advisers to the Chapter.  It appears that the Lambda Chapter was dissolved in the mid 1990s when the University of Chicago closed the Department of Education.

        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>The records are organized in sixteen folders.  The first folder contains a notebook holding the handwritten minutes of the Lambda Chapter’s installation and first two years of meetings.  
</p>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>The remaining fifteen folders contain documents created between 1982 and 1989, including membership lists, procedural guidelines, meeting materials (including announcements, agenda, and minutes), financial and fundraising reports, newsletters, memoranda from the national society, program schedules, correspondence, and catalogs of reprints.
</p>
        <p>
</p>
        <p>These fifteen folders follow an order that is generally chronological.  Folders two through six contain information about the organization and membership of the Lambda Chapter; folders seven through fourteen contain information on the Chapter’s activities (programs, meetings, and reports); folders fourteen and fifteen contain correspondence; and folder sixteen contains catalogs of the Educational Excellence Network.
