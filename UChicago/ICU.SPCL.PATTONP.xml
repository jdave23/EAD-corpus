        <p>Phyllis J. Patton is a former employee of the Valley Forge Division of the Container Corporation of America. As secretary to the Public Relations Manager, Patton received books, coasters, and calendars created at the facility. The Container Corporation of America was founded in Chicago in 1926 by Walter Paul Paepcke (1896-1960). The company manufactured cardboard boxes but is best known for its modernist design department and their innovative advertisements beginning in the 1930s.</p>

        <head>Scope Note</head>
        <p>The Phyllis J. Patton Collection contains print publications, coasters, and calendars produced by the Container Corporation of America between 1936 and 1983. It is organized chronologically where physical condition allows. The print publications are comprised of a 1936 atlas (Box 2 Folder 3), a 1937 book by Alexander Weaver about the history of paper (Box 1 Folder 1), a 1976 book recounting the first fifty years of the corporation’s history (Box 2 Folder 1), and a 1976 publication of the 1950-1975 advertisement series entitled Great Ideas of Western Man (Box 2 Folder 2). All of these books were published by the Container Corporation of America. The collection also includes one publication by the International Paper Company from 1974, the eleventh edition of their Pocket Pal: a Graphic Arts Production Handbook (Box 1 Folder 2). Box 1 also contains three calendars: an accordion calendar from 1974 and a corrugated cardboard folding calendar from 1978, both in Folder 3, and a pop-up calendar from 1983, in Folder 5. Finally, the collection contains two sets of coasters and one measuring tape with the company name printed on it. Several items are related to the 50-year anniversary of the Container Corporation’s 1926 founding (Box 1 Folder 4, Box 2 Folders 1-2).</p>
