<p><emph render="bold">Judy Ball.</emph> Ball was born in 1952 in West Virginia, and adopted by parents Clyde and Nelly Ball. Raised as an only child, and living in a rural, isolated part of West Virgina, Ball and her parents were very close. She grew up in a lower middle-class and racially homogenous area, and because of this was not even aware of LGBTQ identities until much later in life. In her early childhood, Ball’s mother was a factory worker, while her father worked as a truck driver. However, due to financial difficulties and lack of job availability, both of her parents worked odd jobs for much of her youth, doing whatever was necessary to put food on the table. Interested in history and public policy from a young age, Ball escaped poverty through education, earning both a bachelor’s and master’s degree. Although she has had relationships with both men and women, today Ball is happily single and is very involved in the local Corvallis community.</p>

<p>The Recreational Sports Department provides recreational and
educational opportunities for the Oregon State University (OSU) community,
primarily students, and oversees recreational facilities on the Corvallis
campus, including the Dixon Recreation Center and Stevens Natatorium,
McAlexander Fieldhouse, and intramural sports fields.</p>
<p>A study of the administration and oversight of recreational programs
and facilities was conducted in the early 1970s. Based on a recommendation
of this study, a Board of Physical Recreation was established in January
1973 and the process was initiated to fund recreation programs and
facilities with student fees. Recreational Sports celebrated its 25th
anniversary in 1998.</p>
<p>The Dixon Recreation Center opened in 1975 and was dedicated in memory
of James V. Dixon and Jeannette Brauns Dixon; the Stevens Natatorium was
completed in 1992. The recreation center was extensively remodeled and
expanded in 2004. McAlexander Fieldhouse and the outdoor sports fields
were remodeled and upgraded in 2010-2011.</p>
<p>Sports clubs are recognized student organizations that provide OSU
students the opportunity to compete in various sports against other
schools' teams and community groups in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>William Jasper Kerr was born November 17, 1863 in Richmond, Utah. At a young age, Kerr dropped out of school in favor of a position on his father's railroad construction crew. He later returned to school, earning a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Utah in 1885. Following graduation, Kerr accepted a position teaching in Smithfield, Utah. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Superintendent of the Smithfield district. Between 1887 and 1894, Kerr taught mathematics at Brigham Young College and the University of Utah. In 1894, Kerr was appointed President of Brigham Young, a position he held until 1900 when he became President of Utah State Agricultural College. In 1907, Kerr resigned his position at Utah and became President of Oregon Agricultural College.</p>
<p>Kerr's presidency at OAC was defined by a period of prolonged and aggressive growth. During his tenure, the college constructed more than twenty buildings, including the Memorial Union, and more than doubled the total size of the campus to 555 acres. He tightened admissions requirements, expanded curricular offerings, and added talented staff to the college's ranks. Kerr resigned from his post in 1932, ending the longest reign of any OSC president.</p>
<p>After leaving the college, Kerr became the first Chancellor of Oregon's system of higher education. He held this position for three years before retiring. William Jasper Kerr died in 1947 at the age of 83.</p>

<p>The Order of the Spoon, or Ordo Cochlearis, was an organization founded to foster
sound scholarship and promote graduate study, including teaching, writing, and
research, among doctoral degree holders on the faculty at Oregon Agricultural College (OAC). Established by the Triad Club in
1927, the organization became a separate and independent entity in May of 1929 and
the majority of the Ph.D faculty were members. The Order took its name from the
history of scholarship; it was derived from the custom of medieval scholars to wear
a wooden spoon as the insignia of their calling. The group's committee officers held
titles of Chief Spoon Bearer, Assistant Chief Spoon Bearer, and Ladler.</p>
<p>On the day of an Order meeting, members often met at one campus location, dressed in hoods and gowns (academic regalia),
each carrying a spoon that was their totem. The group then paraded with much fanfair
and frivolity to the location of their meeting, at which members took part in a
banquet while speakers gave presentations on the state of scholarship at the
College. New members -- new Doctors residing within the "realm" of Oregon Agricultural
College -- were inducted into the Order at these meetings.</p>
<p>Notable individuals associated with the organization were Othniel R.
Chambers, George W. Peavy, William Edmund Milne, Francois A. Gilfillan, Willibald

<p>Commercial hops production began in Oregon in the 1860s; by the early 20th century, Oregon was the nation's largest hop producer. Scientists began experimenting with planting hops on campus grounds in 1893 and plant pathologists at Oregon State were instrumental in addressing downy mildew problems with hops during the mid-20th century. The USDA-OSU hop breeding program developed and released more than a dozen hop cultivars beginning in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Godfrey R. Hoerner was appointed the Extension Specialist for Hop Production in January 1948 as a half-time appointment with the Extension Service. This position was established at the request of Oregon hop growers and was initially funded by the Agricultural Research Foundation. Hoerner had been a plant pathologist with the USDA in Corvallis since 1931 and held various previous positions with the USDA; he continued a half-time appointment with the USDA while he was also serving as Hop Specialist. Hoerner earned a BS in Plant Pathology at Oregon Agricultural College in 1916 and completed an MS at the University of Minnesota in 1918. Hoerner left his positions at Oregon State and the USDA in April 1955 to become Chief of the Oregon State College Technical Assistance Team at Kasetsart University in Thailand. Hoerner completed two 2-year contracts at Kasetsart in 1955-1959 and died in October 1959.</p>

<p>In 1959 coach Dale Thomas and his Oregon State College wrestling team devised the idea of creating a wrestling court to promote the upcoming Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Wrestling Tournament, to be held in Corvallis. Wrestler Ken Noteboom selected twenty-nine female students for potential inclusion in the court. Noteboom and other members of the team interviewed all twenty-nine women, chose seven, and gave them titles based on wrestling objectives - titles which might also be construed to have sexually suggestive meanings. Carol Lindbloom was "Miss Time Advantage," Susan E. Hall "Miss Takedown," Mary Ann Backen "Miss Predicament," Carol Scott "Miss Fall," Suzanne Chapman "Miss Near Fall," Sharon Ransom "Miss Reversal," and Janet Aune "Miss Escape."</p>
<p>At the time, it was not unusual to use women to publicize college athletics and draw crowds for events. Controversy arose however, when the women were asked to pose for photos in bathing suits, wearing sashes bearing their titles, during a time when women at OSC were bound by a strict dress code requiring them to wear long skirts and high-necked tops. In response to the photographs, Oregon State College President August Strand placed a public ban on promotional "cheesecake" photographs for athletics. ("Cheesecake" was a common term used to describe pictures of women wearing little clothing, though still enough as to remain publicly acceptable for advertisement purposes.)</p>
<p>President Strand's ban caught the attention of the national media, and an article referencing the controversy appeared in the March 30, 1959 issue of <emph render="italic">Life Magazine</emph>, which featured the controversial swimsuit photo of the wrestling court as well as another image of the court wearing dress code compliant clothing and walking with President Strand on the OSC campus. The March 30, 1959 issue of <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph> also reported on the wrestling court, and its successful promotion of the Oregon State wrestling team, in an article titled "Really Nothing Like A Dame." These and other articles prompted numerous men in the United States and beyond to send letters to members of the court, requesting photos, expressing their support of the wrestling court and, in some cases, proposing marriage.</p>
<p>In her paper, Backen concludes that the 1959 wrestling court was not just about "coed cheesecake" and drawing crowds to wrestling events. Rather, the court represented one of numerous opportunities for female students to demonstrate their marriageability in a time when becoming the idealized post-war wife was a goal for many women. Backen argues that the wrestling court was comprised of women who were each trying to reach their own personal goals and, based on their own accounts, they largely succeeded. </p>
<p>Capsule biographies of individuals interviewed by Brittany Backen for her project are as follows:</p>
<p>Janet (Aune) Essig, "Miss Escape," was raised in Milwaukee, Oregon and Oak Grove, Oregon. She graduated from Oregon State in 1961 with an Education degree. While at Oregon State she pledged with Alpha Chi Omega sorority and was Miss November in the 1959 Sigma Delta Chi calendar.</p>

<p>The beginnings of Greek letter social organizations at Oregon State University date back to the formation of the Gamma Delta Phi fraternity in 1905. This group was organized at a local level as more of a club than a recognized chapter and soon inspired the establishment of other local greek letter organizations such as Kappa Sigma Nu (1906), Phi Delta Sigma (1914), and Gamma Upsilon (1913). In 1915, two fraternities, Alpha Chi Omega and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, became the first at Oregon State Univerity to receive official recognition as chapters of national fraternal organizations. After these chapters set the groundwork for establishing a Greek presence at Oregon State University, the fraternity and sorority community grew rapidly. This growth is reflected in the 1925 Beaver Yearbook which lists 50 established Greek chapters (34 fraternities and 16 sororities) on campus that year.</p>
<p>The Panhellenic and Interfraternity Councils were established in 1917 and 1927, respectively, to serve as the student governing bodies of the Oregon State University Greek community. All sororities and fraternities have representation on the councils, which have the authority to offer direct recommendations to the university and regulate areas not covered by institutional policies.</p>
<p>Membership in the Greek community at Oregon State University has fluctuated over time owing to a number of factors. Chief among them has been the competition posed by the post-World War II growth in campus residence halls and a changing college culture emergent in the 1960s activist movements.</p>
<p>Until 1970, university administration of the Oregon State University Greek community resided in the hands of the Dean of Women and the Dean of Men. With the closure of these gender based student administrative offices, Oregon State University placed the management of fraternities and sororities under a single office, the Assistant Dean of Students. In 1998, an administrative reorganization that eliminated the Assistant Dean of Students position resulted in the establishment of a new office, the Greek Life Office. With the formation of this office, Oregon State University for the first time had an administrator devoted solely to the management of the Greek community. The Greek Life Office, in turn, served as one of the six "functional areas" managed by the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement. In 2015, the office was renamed the Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life.</p>
<p>Greek Life Coordinators have been Clay Torset (1998-2000), Robert Kerr (2000-2015), and Leslie Schacht-Drey (2015-present).</p>

director of the Navy's Nuclear Technology Division where he oversaw the design of cooling and shielding systems for reactors. In 1955, he was named Technical Director of the Navy's nuclear program and reported directly to
Admiral Hyman Rickover. Rockwell was instrumental in the design and construction of numerous historically significant vessels including the USS Nautilus, the USS Enterprise, and the USS Long Beach. In the course of his work
with the Navy, Rockwell edited several important offerings in nuclear reactor design including <emph render="italic">The Reactor Shielding Design Manual</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Shippingport Pressurized Water
Reactor</emph>, participated in nuclear submarine and aircraft carrier sea trials, and observed the detonation of a nuclear weapon at the Nevada Test Site.</p>
<p>In 1964, Rockwell co-founded MPR Associates, Inc. with fellow Navy Reactors alums Harry Mandil and Robert Panoff. The firm helped the U.S. Navy design a maintenance program for its nuclear submarine fleet, designed and tested
components of the Loss-of-Fluid Test (LOFT) reactor facility at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, and conducted operations on post-meltdown Three Mile Island Reactor Two. During this time, Rockwell was also a
research associate for the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Chairman of the Atomic Industrial Forum’s Reactors Safety Task Force, and Consultant to the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy.
He retired from MPR in 1987 but continued in an active role in the company until his death. In 1996, James Muckerheide and Ted Rockwell co-founded Radiation, Science, and Health, Inc as president and vice president
respectively. RSH was conceived as a direct response to the anti-nuclear movement and intended to influence regulatory reform within the nuclear power industry. Among RSH's activities was a 2000-2003 legal challenge to the
Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of radionuclides in drinking water.</p>
<p>In addition to his long career in nuclear science and engineering, Rockwell was also a successful author. He published <emph render="italic">The Rickover Effect</emph> (a biography of Admiral Rickover), <emph render="italic">Creating the New World</emph> (an autobiographical history of early nuclear engineering), <emph render="italic">The Virtual Librarian</emph> (a futuristic mystery novel) and <emph render="italic">Vice Versa</emph> (a
triology of plays), as well as numerous scientific and popular articles. Rockwell also cultivated an interest in the field of parapsychology, loosely defined as the study of paranormal phenomena including but not limited to
extrasensory perception, psychokinesis, and psychic healing. Rockwell was an avid participant in the parapsychology community and maintained membership in numerous related organizations, published widely within the field,
and even conducted research into psychokinesis.</p>
<p>Rockwell was the recipient of numerous awards and honors during his lifetime including the first American Nuclear Society Lifetime Achievement Award (1986), a Distinguished Service Medal from the U.S. Navy and the Atomic
Energy Commission (1964), an honorary doctorate from Tri-State College (1960), and the Edward Teller Award (2006), and also held several patents in the field of nuclear engineering. Rockwell passed away on March 31,
2013.</p>

<p>In 1931, it was proposed that all students, those completing liberal arts degrees and
those completing technical degrees, would have a common freshmen and sophomore year
curriculum known as the Lower Division. This proposal was part of a larger attempt to organize and
unify the public higher education system in Oregon in order to limit the challenges
faced by students transferring between universities or from a junior college.
Establishment of a Lower Division curriculum was not initially supported by many
Deans at Oregon Agricultural College (OAC). They stated that it would disrupt the four-year timeline that
had already been established for the completion of most technical degrees offered at
OAC.</p>
<p>A number of suggestions were made by OAC faculty in order to improve upon the initial
proposal. Notably, Dean M. Ellwood Smith of the School of Basic Arts and Sciences
and later Dean of the Lower Division, theorized that Lower Division curricula could
be integrated throughout the four years of schooling received by students rather
than being required in the first two years.</p>
<p>By 1932 the Lower Division was established with M. Ellwood Smith acting as Dean. The
majority of the college's administration and faculty had acknowledged that requiring
Lower Division curricula as a part of every student's education would not disrupt
the curriculum already in place within each School.</p>

<p>The Environmental and Molecular Toxicology (EMT) Department is an academic unit within the College of Agricultural Sciences. The EMT Department offers graduate degrees (Ph.D. and M.Sc.) and an undergraduate minor in toxicology; faculty and graduate student researchers conduct toxicology-based research on the effects of chemicals on humans and the environment. Research expertise within the department is focussed on molecular and mechanistic toxicology and environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology.</p>
<p>The current department has its roots in the Agricultural Chemistry Department which was established in 1883 when the first agricultural chemist was hired for the Oregon Agricultural College faculty. In 1998, the agricultural chemistry and toxicology programs were reorganized and renamed the Environmental and Molecular Toxicology Department.</p>

<p>Edward Sheriff Curtis was a notable photographer and ethnographer best known for his work <emph render="italic">The North American Indian</emph> a set of 20-volume photographic project that documents the Native-American tribes and their culture in North America. This monumental work was published over a span of 23 years between 1907 and 1930. Curtis was inspired to capture the native Indian people and their culture lest it would be infringed upon and disappear due to the white expansion and white culture. Curtis dedicated thirty years of his life traveling, exploring, documenting and living with the native tribes, which later ensued into one of his most celebrated work, ‘The North American Indian.</p>
<p>A self-taught photographer, Curtis was born in 1868 in Whitewater, Wisconsin. His interest in photography was evident from his early years as he assembled his own camera when he was only twelve years old with the help of the then popular manual <emph render="italic">Wilson’s Photographics</emph>. Curtis and his family moved to Puget Sound, Washington in 1887 and he later opened a portrait studio in 1892 in partnership with Thomas Guptill in Seattle. He renamed the photo studio to ‘Edward S. Curtis, Photographer and Photoengraver’ after he and partner Guptill parted ways in 1897. It was in Washington where Curtis first began photographing the local Native Americans. His images of Puget Sound Native Americans won him the grand prize at the National Photographic Convention of 1898.</p>
<p>In 1898, Curtis came across a group of scientists who were lost while he was photographing the Mt. Rainier. Anthropologist George Bird Grinnell, a noted expert in Native American cultures, was one of the scientists in the group. This happenstance meeting allowed Grinnell to learn about Curtis’ work. Grinnell invited Curtis to be the photographer for the Harriman Alaska Expedition of 1899 that was spearheaded by Edward H. Harriman and comprised of naturalist John Muir, and zoologist C. Hart Merriam in the team. Grinnell again appointed Curtis the following year to photograph Blackfeet Indian tribe in Montana. These experiences proved crucial for Curtis in perusing and bolstering his interest in studying and documenting the native tribes of North America.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Seattle, Curtis organized exhibitions featuring his work, published articles and gave lectures on native Indian tribes. His work garnered attention from many including the then President Theodore Roosevelt who asked Curtis to photograph family portraits. In 1906, Curtis reached out to John Pierpont Morgan, the railroad tycoon to finance his work, which set his project ‘The North American Indian’ in motion. It was decided that the project would be a set of 20 volumes of ethnographic text illustrated with photoengraving.  The final two volumes of the series was published in 1930. During his 30 years of extensive fieldwork, Curtis is believed to have taken more than 40,000 photographs, 10,000 cylinder sound recordings of Indian speech and music and taken more than 125 trips across country for the making of the project. He was also known as the ‘Shadow Catcher’, a name he earned from the Native Americans. ‘In the Land of the Head Hunters’, is his another notable work which is a first feature-length film to capture the Native Indian people in North America that premiered in 1914. Curtis’ work celebrated Native American culture and left a valuable legacy that offered a rich insight into indigenous people of North America and their way of living.</p>

<p>Henry B. Miller was born April 11, 1854 in Sidney, Oregon. After graduating from Toledo High School in 1873, he joined his father's firm of bridge builders and contractors. Beginning in 1879, Miller supervised a Josephine County lumber company, a post he maintained even after being elected to the Oregon Legislature in 1891. In 1896, he left the Rogue River Valley for Corvallis, Oregon where he assumed the position of President of the State Agricultural College of Oregon following the resignation of John M. Bloss. Miller held the position of President for only eleven months before resigning. He went on to head the state board of horticulture, serve as consul-general in China, Japan, and Ireland, and act as Director of extension and publishing programs for the University of Oregon's School of Commerce. Miller retired in 1917 as a result of ill health and died in Portland in 1921.</p>

<p>Nuclear Free America (NFA) was an international clearinghouse and resource center founded in 1982, primarily to serve communities in the United States wishing to declare themselves nuclear free zones (NFZs) as part of a worldwide movement. NFA closed its doors in 1997. During its fifteen years of operation, more than 200 NFZ declarations passed within the territory of the United States, as part of over 4,500 declarations passed by local governments in 26 nations worldwide.</p>
<p>Local NFZs were established in solidarity with <extref show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="https://unoda-web.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/WMD/Nuclear/pdf/NWFZ-postcard-2010.pdf" role="text/html">international treaties</extref> covering the Antarctic, Outer Space, the Sea-Bed, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Central Asia.</p>
<p>NFA, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, and, from 1993-1997, with a second office in Salem, Oregon, served as the US affiliate and United Nations representative of the International Secretariat of the Nuclear Free Zone Local Authorities. Primary organizers were Chuck Johnson and Albert Donnay.</p>
<p>The early focus of NFA was assisting mostly symbolic declarations against nuclear weapons - part of national and international efforts to protest Cold War nuclear weapons policies of the US and its allies.</p>
<p>After the Cold War, fears about nuclear weapons waned, but concerns about storage of nuclear waste from more than 100 commercial nuclear power plants grew as proposed nuclear waste sites proliferated throughout the country.  NFA assisted communities in developing NFZ declarations that served as symbolic buffers - or real barriers in the case of laws passed by sovereign Native American Nations.</p>
<p>To assist several communities that wished to end investment or purchase from nuclear weapons manufacturers, NFA researchers, working with Eagle Eye Publishers, developed an annual database of US nuclear weapons contractors that eventually expanded to include several specific definitions of weapons production and was used as the definitive measure by socially responsible investment companies and others to boycott weapons makers.  This service continued in an attenuated form until 2003.</p>

<p>Courses in Military Science and Tactics were first taught at Oregon
State in 1872. In 1873 Captain Benjamin D. Boswell was appointed Professor
of Military Science and Tactics (1873-1876), the first U.S. Army officer
on active duty to hold such a position in any land grant college in the
West. The first cadet uniforms, worn at all times by male students, were
gray with caps of the Civil War type. The more familiar blue uniforms were
adopted in 1893.</p>
<p>ROTC at Oregon State University is made up of the Departments of
Military Science, Naval Science, and Air Force Studies. In 1917, the
Department of Military Sciences became responsible for all military
training under the National Defense Act of 1916. The act expanded and
standardized the training of Army Officers by colleges and universities
and established the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). During World
War II, OSU became known as the "West Point of the West" for commissioning
more officers than any other non-military academy in the nation. At the
end of World War II, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned the Department
of Naval Science (ROTC) on this campus to provide the training of both
Navy and Marine Corps officers. On July 1, 1949, the U.S. Air Force
activated an AFROTC unit that is now called the Department of Air Force
Studies. As of 1999, OSU is one of only 48 colleges and universities that
offers education for all three military departments.</p>
<p>Originally, two years of military science and tactics were required of
all able-bodied male students, but since 1962, ROTC has been voluntary.
Since 1965, two-year programs have been available for students who have
finished two years of college but have not taken ROTC previously.</p>

Many of the photographs that are found in the collection have been dated later than this 1940 cut off. Existing stocks of Sam Browne type belts were exhausted by the Quartermaster as well as officers having this type previously issued to them. Although officially not a part of the World War II era dress uniform, many photographs show officers and cadets still wearing the Sam Browne type belt in the 1941, 1942 and 1943 <title render="italic">Beaver</title> yearbooks.

<p>The Difference, Power, and Discrimination (DPD) Program at Oregon State University was established in the early 1990s as a means to deliver courses to address cultural and ethnic diversity as well as racism, discrimination, and their origins. The initiating action for the DPD Program was a November 1990 letter from concerned student leaders to OSU President John Byrne proposing several actions in response to recent incidents of discrimination and harassment at OSU. One of these proposals was the development of mandatory courses for all students. In the Spring of 1992, the Faculty Senate approved the incorporation of the Difference, Power, and Discrimination requirement into the Baccalaureate Core, contingent on the development of enough courses. The DPD Program was created to provide faculty with the training and resources to develop or modify courses to meet the DPD criteria; the intent was that courses would address issues of diversity and discrimination not only in society in general, but within specific academic disciplines.  Annie Popkin was chosen as the first director in June 1992. By Fall 1994, within two years of its establishment, a sufficient number of DPD courses were in place for the DPD requirement to become a component of the Baccalaureate Core.  A comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the Program was conducted in 1998.</p>

<p>The Benton County Courthouse is located at 120 NW 4th Street in downtown Corvallis on land originally donated to the city by its founders, Joseph Avery and William Dixon. Designed by Portland architect Delos D. Neer, the courthouse project was dedicated on July 4, 1888 and completed in Fall 1889, thus replacing the county's first courthouse building, which had been erected in 1854. The new building was constructed using local stone and brick, and was meant, in Neer's words, to evoke "an Italian villa with a military influence." Total costs for the construction, including furnishings, ran to about $70,000, which reputedly made Benton County's courthouse project the second most expensive in Oregon's history to that point.</p>
<p>From 1977-1979, the facility was the focus of a major restoration and renovation project, overseen by local architect Cy Stadsvold. For his efforts, Stadsvold received the American Institute of Architect's "Significant Building Award" in 1979. Stadsvold's work also contributed to the building's nomination, in 1977, to the National Register of Historic Places. An icon of the mid-Willamette Valley, Benton County's courthouse remains the oldest in operation anywhere in the state of Oregon.</p>
<p>Richard Mengler (1911-2001) served as City Attorney of Corvallis from 1952-1954, District Court Judge from 1954-1959 and Circuit Court Judge from 1965 to his retirement in 1981. Mengler also served three temporary terms on the Oregon Supreme Court. Born in Nebraska to impoverished itinerant farmers, Mengler earned a bachelor's degree in English from Kearney State College in 1933 and, in 1939, a master's in Education from the University of Oregon. Following a two-year stint as vice-principal at Corvallis High School and another two years of service in the Pacific theatre during World War II, Mengler worked toward a law degree, which he received from the University of Oregon in 1952. For the better part of the next thirty years, Mengler pursued a career in law throughout the Pacific Northwest, though Corvallis always remained his home. Mengler's close association with the Benton County Courthouse stemmed both from decades working in the building as well as his many years' service as chair of its Preservation Committee.</p>
<p>Twin brothers Edmund Gravelle (1913-2005) and Elroy Gravelle (1913-1991) were grandchildren of Odina Gravel, a carpenter who helped to build the Benton County Courthouse.</p>
<p>Gladys (Mack) Hunt (1909-2004) was the daughter of Herschel Mack, Benton County Clerk from 1926-1932. As a teenager, Gladys spent a summer working for her father in the Benton County Courthouse.</p>
<p>Dorothy Moore (b. 1901) and Louise (Moore) Forland (b. 1913) were daughters of A.J. (Albert Jordan) Moore, Benton County Clerk from 1932-1948.</p>

<p>The Portland Brewing Company was incorporated by Fred Bowman and Art Larrance in 1983; it opened in 1986. Hart Brewing was founded by Beth Hartwell and Tom Baune in Kalama, Washington in 1984; the name was changed to Pyramid Breweries in 1996. The Portland brewery facility closed in 2021. At various points, these companies merged and purchased by other companies.</p>
<p><emph render="underline"><emph render="italic">Portland Brewing Company</emph></emph></p>
<p>The Portland Brewing Company was incorporated by Fred Bowman and Art Larrance in 1983. Bert Grant, owner of Yakima Brewing Company, was hired in 1985 as a technical consultant to assist in designing the brewhouse. The company was initially funded by a small public offering in 1985 that raised $125,000.</p>
<p>In 1986, the brewpub opened at 1339 NW Flanders Street in an old creamery building in Northwest Portland; they only produced draft beer. In 1988, they began bottling their flagship Portland Ale in 32-ounce package and in 1989 began bottling it as a 12-ounce 6-pack. In 1991, Tony Adams and Mac and Scott MacTarnahan invested capital in the brewery, and that same year the company embarked on an ambitious financial plan to build a new brewery. In 1992, they expanded their distribution network to the seven western states and won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival with MacTarnahan’s Ale.</p>
<p>With a growing market and need for increased production, in 1992, they purchased brewing equipment from Sixenbräu in Nördlingen, Germany, including copper brewing vessels, and began production of a new brewery at 2730 NW 31st Avenue with an expected 65,000-barrel annual capacity, which was more than double the production at the Flanders facility. The new brewery met its full production level in 1993. In spring of 1995, Portland Brewing purchased and installed a new state of the art bottling line from Krones Inc., which could rinse, fill, cap, and label up to 250 bottles a minute, roughly twice the amount of the old line. With the addition of equipment and increased tank space, by 1995 the brewing capacity was 100,000 barrels annually and by 1996 was 135,000 barrels.</p>
<p>The company embarked on several campaigns to raise money for expansion and renovation projects. In 1992, the company offered 100,000 shares of common stock to Oregon residents (which sold in 32 days); the next year, they offered an additional 100,000 shares to Oregon and Washington residents (which sold in 60 days). These two offerings raised $1 million. In 1994, they offered an additional 490,000 shares to finance increased production capabilities, marketing efforts, and German style beer hall and restaurant; they raised $2.8 million. In 1995, they raised $2.9 million, which brought the total number of shareholders to approximately 5,500, number of outstanding shares to 2.1 million, and the total dollars raised by investors to almost $7 million. The NW Flanders Street facility was remodeled in summer 1996 and a new kitchen was added.</p>
<p>By 1998 the company was in financial trouble and MacTarnahan bought $3.5 million in debt in exchange for stock; as a result, Portland Brewing began using MacTarnahan labeling. Portland Brewing Company merged with Saxer Brewing Company of Lake Oswego in 2000.</p>
<p><emph render="italic"><emph render="underline">Hart Brewing and Pyramid Breweries</emph></emph></p>
<p>Hart Brewing was founded by Beth Hartwell and Tom Baune in Kalama, Washington in 1984; the name of the brewery was a contraction of Hartwell. Five investors from Seattle acquired Hart Brewing in 1989 and then purchased Thomas Kemper Brewing Company from Poulsbo, Washington in 1992. They also moved to a new, larger facility in 1992 and by 1994, Hart Brewing was the fourth largest craft brewery in the United States. In 1995, Hart Brewing opened a new brewery in Seattle, known as the Seattle Alehouse (closed in 2020). Also in 1995, the company became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ exchange, issuing 2.6 million shares. The name was changed to Pyramid Breweries in 1996. In 1997, Pyramid Brewery opened a brewing facility and restaurant in Berkeley, California (closed in 2015).</p>
<p>Hart Brewing’s first beer was Pyramid Pale ale, and it was followed in 1985 by Pyramid Wheaten Ale, the first year-round wheat beer made in America since Prohibition. Pyramid Snow Cap Ale was released in 1986. They began making a Hefeweizen in 1993 and an Apricot Ale in 1994.</p>
<p><emph render="italic"><emph render="underline">Portland Brewing and Pyramid Breweries</emph></emph></p>
<p>In 2004, MacTarnahan, then 88 years old, sold the Portland Brewing Company to Pyramid Breweries of Seattle. The Portland Brewing facility was renamed “MacTarnahan's Brewing Company.” MacTarnahan died later that year.</p>
<p>In 2008, Pyramid Breweries was acquired by Magic Hat Brewing Company, which was subsequently bought by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York in 2010. In 2012, the company was purchased by the Costa Rican company Florida Ice &amp; Farm Co. In 2013, the brewery announced it would return to the Portland Brewing Company name.</p>
<p>After declining revenue, the company closed the Portland taproom and restaurant in 2018 and ceased production entirely in 2021.</p>

<p>The Course in Pharmacy was established at Oregon Agricultural College in 1898 with a four-year program leading to a B.S. degree in pharmacy, at a time when most pharmaceutical curricula were only 2-year programs. In 1951, Oregon State College inaugurated a five-year curriculum leading to a B.S. degree in pharmacy -- nine years before the five-year curriculum became the minimum requirement for all U.S. pharmacy schools. In 1999, the College of Pharmacy began offering a four-year entry-level Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) instead of a B.S. degree.</p>
<p>Ernst Thedore Stuhr served on the faculty of the Oregon State College (OSC) School of Pharmacy from 1927 to 1944 as Assistant Professor of Pharmacy (1927-1930) and Associate Professor (1930-1944) of Pharmacology and Pharmacognosy. His major area of research, medicinal plants, was reflected in the many articles that he wrote for scholarly and trade journals.</p>

<p>Mount St. Helens is an active volcano located in the Cascade mountain range in southwest Washington state. For centuries a sacred space to the region's indigenous communities, the mountain became a popular site for recreation during the twentieth century, with many flocking in particular to Spirit Lake on its north side. In March 1980, a series of small earthquakes - followed by episodes of steam venting - indicated that the long dormant volcano was becoming geologically active again. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens famously erupted in spectacular fashion, ultimately losing more than 1,300 feet in elevation from its peak, unleashing a fearsome landslide, and creating a cloud of ash that blanketed communities across the Pacific Northwest and eventually circulated around the world. At least fifty-seven people were killed by the explosion, with property damage estimates in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>On August 26, 1982, an act of Congress designated the mountain and 110,000 acres that surrounded it as the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This declaration restricted development activities within the monument to permit natural processes to "proceed substantially unimpeded" so that research could track responses of the land to the eruption. The resulting wealth of research findings have been conducted in part by the following individuals, who were interviewed for this collection in 2015.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Lynn Burditt</emph> has served in a variety of leadership positions in the National Forest System of the US Forest Service, including tenures as Ranger at the Blue River Ranger District on the Willamette National Forest and Deputy Forest Supervisor on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest where the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is located.</p>

<p>In 1959 Honors work began in the School of Science which developed into
a joint program between the School of Humanities and Social Sciences in
1964. The University Honors Program was established campus-wide in 1966
and offered enriched educational opportunities to students of superior
scholastic ability or of particular academic focus. In addition to
participation in extra-curricular honors colloquia and seminars, students
were required to complete a Senior Honors Thesis. The Honors Program was
terminated at the end of the 1990-1991 academic year due to budget
constraints. A new University Honors College was established for fall
1995. Today, the Honors College operates as a small degree-granting
college, within Oregon State University, which offers an Honors
Baccalaureate Degree in any undergraduate major. </p>
<p> In September 1965 Leonard J. Weber, Professor of Engineering, was the
chair of the newly established All University Honors Committee. This
committee was initially assigned to study the feasibility of establishing
a University-wide honors program at Oregon State University. Once the
University Honors Program was established, the Honors Committee became

After she graduated she lived in New Zealand for six months, where she worked in the restaurant industry. After returning to the U.S., Allen got a summer job at Pelican Brewing; she helped open the Monroe McMenamins in Corvallis in 2006. Allen also worked in the wine industry, starting with harvest and then working in tasting rooms, while simultaneously studying for the GRE and applying for grad school in historic preservation. She was accepted into a graduate program in England for historic preservation, but by then had decided to pursue a career in wine. In 2009, Allen left the wine industry to join her father at Heater Allen Brewing, which he'd opened in 2007 after a long career as an investment banker.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Rick Allen</emph> is the owner and head brewer at Heater Allen in McMinnville, Oregon. He was born in Palo Alto, California and lived there for most of his childhood. He graduated from Woodside High School and though he was interested in a variety of subjects, including chemistry and meteorology, he chose to study business at Oregon State University. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. The Allen family has a deep connection to Oregon State University: Allen's grandfather went to OAC (Class of 1923) and his grandmother studied Home Economics; his parents both attended OSU, meeting during their freshman year at an "alternative Thanksgiving" retreat and marrying during their junior year; his two brothers attended OSU; he met his wife at OSU; and their daughter, Lisa, attended in the early 2000s. After university, Allen took a position as an investment banker in Portland, with short moves to Washington and California for employment; he left that field in the early 2000s.

He got a job helping a friend’s digital audio technology company, and they toured with Split Ends, Supertramp, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. When he returned, he worked at a video store, the Hult Center, and opened a recording studio. His wife bought him a Pike Place Brewing home brewing kit from Costco in 1998; brewing made sense to him because of his chemistry education, his love of cooking, and his experimental nature. He learned about different styles and methods, and soon began to experiment in a rather radical way. One method was batch sparging, which turned out to be a divisive one for home brewers; Conn started publishing his information about batch sparging online in 2003 to 2004, and people criticized it. He also experimented with ingredients, including rye for a Rye IPA, which John Maier from Rogue liked; Conn’s RIPA as inspiration for one of Rogue’s anniversary beers. He's also experimented with equipment, and is a big fan of the Pico-Brew.

<p>Established in 1972, the original nine members of the Chicano Cultural Center (CCC) met weekly in the basement of Milam Hall. At the end of 1976, the Chicano Cultural Advisory Committee requested that the university provide housing for the Center. The CCC was first given the house at 2475 Orchard Street and later the small house at 1969 SW “A” Street, which was to become the permanent Chicano Cultural Center. On April 13, 1977, OSU President Dr. Robert MacVicar cut the ribbon to symbolically open the new Center to the public. The center was renamed the Hispanic Cultural Center in the mid-1980s, but the final name change came in 1996 to honor Mexican farm worker activist César Chávez. The Centro Cultural César Chávez (4Cs) was established to provide a location and facility for programming various academic, cultural, recreational, and social events related to the Chicano/Latino/Hispanic culture and heritage. The 4Cs is managed by the office of Diversity Development, a unit of Intercultural Student Services. On April 7, 2014, the new Centro Cultural César Chávez opened its doors to the public. Located at 691 S.W. 26th St, the new building was one of four new cultural centers being built on campus to replace aging structures. The 3,565 square-foot building cost $2,521,051 and was designed by Seattle-based architects Jones &amp; Jones.

Portland.</p>
<p>In 1936, Ralph became the first photographer of the newly established
Travel and Information Department of the Oregon State Highway Commission.
His landscape views of Oregon's natural beauty were used for many years to
promote tourism in the state. He also took motion pictures for the Highway
Commission, including its 1941 color version of

<p>After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States Western Defense Command created two "exclusion zones," encompassing all of California and large portions of Washington, Oregon, and Arizona. Because of the perceived security threat attributed to individuals of Japanese ancestry by the federal government within these zones. Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from these zones and relocated to concentration camps by Executive Order 9066.</p>
<p>In March 1942, the War Relocation Authority (WRA) was created by executive order to oversee the internment of Japanese Americans removed from the exclusion zone. That spring, more than 100,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly removed to ten WRA-operated internment camps located on public lands in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. These camps were typically crude and lacking in many basic amenities. Work opportunities were available for incarcerees, but compensation was minimal. Education programs were offered in the concentration camps, but were often intended to foster pro-American sentiments among the incarcerees.</p>
<p>The Community Analysis Section (CAS) of the WRA was established in 1943. It was composed of social scientists assigned to study incarcerees within the concentration camps for the benefit of the federal government.  The CAS staff produced reports on topics including self-governance, education, language, concentration camp labor, incarceree religious practices, and incarceree conflict.</p>
<p>The exclusion zone was eliminated in January 1945 and the WRA began closing camps in October of that year. The WRA was officially eliminated on June 26, 1946.</p>

During the 1990s, the SSD office would experience two additional moves, first to the Office of Academic Affairs during the Fall of 1994, and later to the Office of Student Affairs during the Fall of 1997. The Services for Students with Disabilities office would later be renamed as the Disability Access Services office.</p>
<p>As the office evolved, new programs and services were introduced to address the growing needs of students, including the Learning Disabilities Program, approved in the mid-1980s, and the Disability Access Services Testing Center, opened in 2012. Student organizations were also founded alongside the programs. The Handicapped Students Unlimited became a recognized student organization in 1976, hosting the first Handicapped Awareness Week in May of 1978. The organization would later be renamed as the Disabled Students Organization.</p>

<p>Marie Norris pursued a life of active service for her Klamath community. In addition to founding the Organization of Forgotten Americans in 1969 to address the effects of tribal termination, Norris served on the Klamath Tribal Executive Committee on Claims, the Klamath Indian Game Commission, the Civil Rights Committee for the state of Oregon, the Klamath County Juvenile Advisory Council, and the Committee of Oregon Rural Opportunities. Norris spoke frequently about Native American culture and was one of the last people able to speak the Klamath language. Oregon Governor Vic Atiyeh declared Norris as one of the most outstanding women in Oregon history. Marie G. Norris was born on January 15, 1920 in Modoc Point, Oregon; she died on August 16, 1981 in Klamath Falls, Oregon.</p>
<p>Roger Weaver, an Oregon State University faculty member in English literature and poetry from 1962 to 1996, met Norris in 1974 during a storytelling event. Weaver was inspired by Norris to develop a course on Native American literature in which he featured some of her stories. Weaver, in turn, inspired Norris to compile and write her stories as a book. Roger Keys Weaver was born in Portland, Oregon on February 2, 1935 and graduated from Salem High School in 1953. In addition to his University teaching, Weaver has taught children, youth, and adults in school settings as well as through workshops and summer programs.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the Western Small Fruit Virus Disease Conference was held in Portland, Oregon, in January 1950. For many years prior to 1950, a number of agriculture-related groups met in Portland each year during the second week of January. Many of the meetings were related to the control of insects and diseases. Small fruit crops (specifically strawberries and raspberries) were included in those meetings, but there was not a specific meeting devoted to small fruit diseases.</p>
<p>Individuals working specifically on small fruit diseases held an informal gathering in Portland in January 1949 and decided to develop a more formal meeting, with a program, for January 1950 that would include breeders, plant pathologists, and entomologists. Robert Rosenstiel, a faculty member in the Entomology Department at Oregon State College and specialist on insect pests of small fruits, especially strawberries, was involved in these initial meetings.</p>
<p>The conference included scientists from Oregon, Washington, California, and British Columbia; the role of chair rotated between the 3 states and British Columbia. In the 1950s and 1960s the organization was known as the Western Small Fruit Virus Disease Conference; through the early 1970s, the name Western Small Fruit Disease Conference was used; by the 1990s, it was known as the Western Small Fruit Pest Conference.</p>
<p>Richard H. (Dick) Converse was a plant pathologist and small fruit virus specialist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory on the Oregon State University campus in Corvallis from the late 1960s until his retirement in 1990.</p>

<p>Since its establishment in the early 1880s, the Herbarium has served as
the chief repository for the University's collection of flora as well as a
laboratory for the study and identification of plants and fungi. Managed since
1883 by a Curator under the auspices of the Department of Botany and
Horticulture, the focus of the Herbarium has shifted away from the traditional
role of student instruction and more toward the acquisition and cataloging of
Pacific Northwest plant specimens. As a research facility, the Herbarium has
become the leading center for research on the taxonomy of mycorrhizal fungi.
Currently housed at Cordley Hall, the Herbarium has moved many times from its
original location in Education Hall. The Herbarium has also resided in the
Strand Agricultural building, the basement of the Memorial Union, and Gill
Coliseum. In 1993, under pressure to cut costs stemming from state budget

From the outset, the mission of the Longhouse has been to "honor the cultures of the First People of this land, including Alaskan Natives and Hawaiian Natives." A focal point for the Native community on campus, the Longhouse has served as a gathering place for students, faculty and staff and has also promoted cross-cultural outreach through a variety of recreational and educational programs. In collaboration with other campus groups, including the Native American Student Association, the Longhouse has been instrumental in the organization of numerous events, including the annual salmon bake and Klatow Eena (Chinook for "Go Beavers") pow wow.</p>
<p>The original Longhouse facility was remodeled in 1999 to insure compliance with health and safety regulations. Over the next decade, momentum built to replace the facility entirely and in May 2011 ground was broken for a new Longhouse, to be located directly south of the existing Quonset hut.

<p>On July 24, 1911, Oregon Agricultural College's Board of Regents
organized the Oregon Extension Service in response to requests from citizens of
Oregon for assistance (particularly in agriculture) from the college. In May of
1914, nearly three years after Oregon had established its Extension Service,
President Woodrow Wilson signed the federal Smith-Lever law, which provided
federal money for the establishment of extension services in all states for
developing off-campus programs, primarily in agriculture and home economics.
The first home extension agents were hired in August 1917 to do wartime
emergency work; several of the agents were retained by counties after World War
I. By 1937, all counties had at least one county extension agent. During the
Extension Service's first forty years, it concentrated on three traditional
programmatic areas -- agriculture, home economics, and 4-H. </p>

<p>Proposals for a student activity center on the Oregon Agricultural College (OAC) campus began in 1920. Planning and fundraising for the building was approved by the Student Assembly in May 1921 and by the College administration in October of the same year. The building, named the OAC Memorial Union, was intended to "provide a suitable center for student and alumni activities...and stand as a lasting memorial erected to the honor and memory of the students and alumni who gave their lives in the service of their country...". By the winter of 1923, a governing structure had been established for the Union, which was largely separate from the College administration. The Memorial Union was officially incorporated in 1924. Edward Christopher (E. C.) Allworth, an Oregon Agricultural College alumnus and World War I veteran, was hired by OAC in 1925 to fill the positions of secretary of the Alumni Association, secretary of the Memorial Union Board of Governors, and manager of the Memorial Union.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1922, $3 of each student's term registration fees were committed to the Memorial Union. Early pledge signings began in May 1924 when graduating students were asked to commit $50 to the Memorial Union. The first official Memorial Union pledge drive began in January 1925 and was operated predominately by students organized into teams by class and overseen by a "colonel." The campaign focused on College employees (who were encouraged to donate between $250 and $1000) and students (who were asked to contribute $100). By the spring of 1925, the Memorial Union had collected pledges representing $375,000.</p>
<p>A second drive was held in March 1926. By June 1926, pledges had surpassed $500,000 and the Union had collected approximately $125,000 of the $200,000 cash needed to begin construction. Anticipating forthcoming payments on pledges, the Memorial Union Board of Governors approved excavation of the site, which began on May 5, 1927. In June 1927, despite having not yet reached the $200,000 cash goal, the Board elected to begin construction using a loan (with the unpaid pledges as security) from the Marine National Bank of Seattle. The total cost of the building was estimated at $560,000. A final drive was held in February and March 1928 with a focus on building furnishings, though results fell short of the $120,000 quota. The Union also hosted supplemental drives targeting alumni in Benton County and Portland, Oregon and encouraged pledging individuals to increase or renew their pledges.</p>
<p>Construction of the Memorial Union was completed on June 1, 1928 and the dedication ceremony took place one year later on June 1, 1929. Efforts to collect on pledge debts continued far beyond the building's grand opening. E.C. Allworth, the Memorial Union Manager, oversaw an intensive campaign of by-mail solicitations to those with outstanding pledges using both form and direct letters. These exchanges are well documented within the Memorial Union Campaign Records. Ultimately, the Memorial Union resorted to employing attorneys to act as collection agents and, in a relatively small number of cases, pursued legal action against pledging individuals. Attempts to recover pledged funds continued into 1944.</p>

<p>Richard Yukio Morita was born on March 27, 1923 in Pasadena, California. He graduated from Pasadena High School in 1941. In 1942 the Morita family was forced to enter an internment camp; they were first sent to Tulare Assembly Center in southern California, and then to the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona. Richard Morita left the camp later in 1942 to attend the University of Nebraska, but was drafted into and served in the U. S. Army 442<emph render="super">nd</emph> Regiment Combat Team in 1944-1946. Afterwards, he earned a B.S. in Bacteriology-Chemistry from the University of Nebraska in 1947, an M.S. in Bacteriology from the University of Southern California in 1949, and a Ph. D. in Microbiology-Oceanography from the University of California, Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1954, where he was the first Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) to graduate. He held several assistant professorships before coming to OSU, where he was an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Oceanography in 1962-1964. In 1964 he became a full Professor at OSU, a post he held until 1988. OSU granted him Professor Emeritus status in 1989. He also served as program director for biochemistry at the National Science Foundation in 1968-1969. Morita married Toshiko Nishihara on March 14, 1953 and they had three children: Sally Jean, Ellen Jane, and Peter Wayne. He was the likely the first Nisei in biological oceanography, and one of the first Nisei with academic rank in microbiology.</p>
<p>During his career, Morita was part of several large research expeditions. He was a microbiologist for three of them: the Mid-Pacific Expedition of 1950 (where he was the first microbiologist to study the deep sea), the 1952 Royal Danish Navy <emph render="italic">Galathea</emph> Deep Sea Expedition, and the Trans-Pacific Expedition of 1953. In 1962 he was an invited investigator for Expedition Dodo. Morita studied microbiology in extreme earth environments, including the polar regions and the deep sea. Some of his important contributions to the field include: the discovery of barophiles (pressure loving bacteria) with his mentor Dr. Claude ZoBell; demonstrating that enzyme reactions can occur over 100°C; the discovery of psychrophiles (cold-loving bacteria); the concept of starvation-survival in bacteria; and with Francisco Torrella, the discovery that the marine environment has many phage particles. The genus <emph render="italic">Moritella</emph> was named after him to honor his work in marine microbiology.

<p>The pre-history of Oregon State University's Center for the Humanities can be traced to the Humanities Grant Study Committee, a collection of fifteen department chairs and faculty representatives from OSU's departments of Art, English, History, Modern Languages, Music, Philosophy, and Religious Studies, as well as the College of Liberal Arts Dean's Office. Led by faculty members Gordon Gilkey and Richard Astro, the study committee was charged with evaluating the feasibility of major changes to the humanities curriculum at Oregon State and exploring the possibility of applying for funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities that might facilitate changes of this sort.</p>
<p>The product of this group's work was a successful NEH Development Grant proposal that made a significant impact on the university's intellectual culture. The 1977 grant, titled "An Exploration of Community," steered just under $1,000,000 in federal money to the university for use in developing curricula in four areas: Northwest Studies; Marine and Maritime Studies; Community Studies; and Studies in Science, Technology, and Values. Administered by the newly created Humanities Development Program, these interdisciplinary certificate programs were meant to both broadly strengthen OSU's humanities offerings and to link study in the humanities to courses already extant in the university's science and professional schools.</p>
<p>The Humanities Development Program was run from the outset by Peter Copek, a faculty member in English, and it succeeded in filling a void at OSU. During the program's six year lifespan, over fifty faculty members participated in the development effort, creating sixty-five courses in what became three program areas. (The program's "Community Studies" and "Science, Technology and Values" offerings were reorganized as "Twentieth Century Studies.")</p>
<p>The Humanities Development Program contributed to the vigor of campus life in other ways, in part through its use of NEH funds and other support from organizations including the Oregon Humanities Committee to sponsor a wide array of campus events. Seminars, musical performances and film screenings were common sources of outreach for the program, which also supported and helped to organize at least four conferences. Perhaps most notably, Copek, who maintained a scholarly interest in film studies, co-founded the International Film Series, which screened independent and foreign films every weekend during the academic year for over twenty years, beginning in 1977.</p>
<p>The OSU Center for the Humanities was created as a result of a second NEH grant, this time a challenge grant which, in 1984, awarded $700,000 to the university following its own success in raising an additional $1.4 million from private donors. The $2.1 million total was used to endow the Center which, as with the Humanities Development Program before, was run by Peter Copek. In addition to continued offerings within the certificate programs, the new center also unveiled a fellowship program which provided stipends for both OSU faculty and "external fellows" to conduct research in the humanities, usually for one term. For external fellows, the funds provided by the Center supported travel, lodging and office space. Similarly, the Center lessened the load on internal OSU fellows by paying others to teach the courses to which they were normally assigned. The Center likewise continued to organize and support various events on campus, including multiple music festivals, a lecture series (keynoted by Gore Vidal) marking the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, and a symposium on the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>In its early years, Center for the Humanities operations were run out of an office located in Moreland Hall. That changed in June 1989 when the Center moved into what would become its permanent home, a former sorority house on Jefferson Avenue. At the time of its formal purchase by the university in 1993, the facility was christened the Autzen House in honor of the Autzen Foundation of Portland, which provided major funding for the acquisition of the space.</p>
<p>The Center enjoyed stability and moderate growth throughout the 1990s, but change came suddenly in June 2001, when Peter Copek died at the age of fifty-six from a heart attack that struck in the aftermath of gall bladder surgery. English professor David Robinson was subsequently named director of the Center. Under Robinson's leadership, the OSU Center for the Humanities has continued to sponsor academic fellowships and to support campus and community offerings, including two annual events - The Magic Barrel Reading to Fight Hunger and The OSU Holocaust Memorial Program. The certificate programs that emerged from the original 1977 NEH grant are no longer offered at OSU; removal of the last of them, Twentieth Century Studies, was initiated in 2005.</p>

<p>Ellis Samuel Dement was born January 10, 1890 in Norway, Oregon to Russell Cook Dement and Lucy Ann Dement. He had seven siblings: Nellie Estelle, Eunice Viola, Raymond Benton, Winnifred Elizabeth, Clare Leroy, Lester Thomas (his twin), and Harry George. Ellis's father, Russell, worked the ranch that his father, Samuel Maxwell Dement, established, and worked as a cattle rancher his entire life.</p>
<p>Dement attended Oregon Agricultural College (OAC) from 1907 to 1911, graduating with a degree in agriculture. After graduation, Dement returned to the family ranch and became a stock raiser. In 1914 he married Cecile Beryl (Miller) Dement. They had three children: Aileen Dorothy, Russell Albert, and Ellis Samuel Jr (who went by Sam).</p>
<p>Sam, the youngest of Dement’s children, went on to be something of a star at Oregon State College (OSC). He attended from 1939 to 1943, and like his father pursued a degree in agriculture. Sam was a forward on OSC’s varsity basketball team from 1940 to 1943, and helped the team take second place in the regional tournament. Sam’s graduation was fast tracked when he was drafted into World War II; when he returned from service overseas he went back to work on the Dement Ranch with his brother, Russell.</p>
<p>Sam and Russell Dement continued to expand the family ranch, and it achieved some prominence in the Oregon ranching community. In 1997, Russell and Sam filed to turn the ranch into a Limited Liability Corporation, ensuring its longevity. The ranch has continued to expand over the years, and in 2009 was designated as a Century Ranch by the Oregon Century Farm and Ranch Program. Sam and Russell eventually deeded the farm to Sam’s two daughters, Diane Simon and Joan Harpole. They are the fifth generation to assume ownership, and continue to manage the farm as of this writing.</p>
<p>Ellis Samuel Dement died October 29, 1972 in Myrtle Point, Oregon.</p>

<p>Formed in 1991, the Office of Multicultural Affairs assists OSU in the
promotion of cultural diversity, awareness, and sensitivity throughout the
campus community. In this capacity, the office serves as a resource for the OSU
community and the region in understanding multicultural issues; helps in the
recruitment and retention of students, staff, and faculty from ethnic, racial,
and other underrepresented groups; participates in curriculum development; and
provides consultation services to all academic and support units.</p>
<p>The development of the Office of Multicultural Affairs is rooted in
recommendations made by two advisory bodies, the OSU Board of Visitors and the
Minority Affairs Commission. Created by President Byrne in 1986 to investigate
ways to enhance diversity at OSU, the Board of Visitors advocated for the
formation of a Minority Affairs Commission, which, in turn, argued for the
establishment of an office devoted to addressing multicultural affairs. Phyllis
Lee became the office’s first director. </p>
<p>After Lee retired in 2003, the Office of Multicultural Affairs was
renamed the Office of Community and Diversity and Terryl Ross appointed as new
director in 2004. The basic mission of the office, however, did not change.
</p>
<p>Appointed to the OSU Board of Visitors in 1986, Phyllis Lee served as
acting director of the Office of Multicultural Affairs before assuming the
directorship in 1992. After earning a doctorate in counseling from OSU in 1983,
Lee worked for Kaiser Permanente in Portland before returning to campus in
1991. Lee also worked as a public school teacher and in counseling education at
Portland State University prior to her post with the Office of Multicultural
Affairs.</p>

<p>Courses in elocution and speech have been taught at Oregon State
University since its founding in the 1860s. During the 1890s, these were
taught by the Department of Elocution and later by the Department of
Public Speaking. The Department of Public Speaking and Dramatics was
established in 1920, as the first Speech Department in Oregon, and grew
quickly during the 1920s. Courses in "speech correction" were added in the
mid-1920s. When higher education in Oregon was re-organized in the early
1930s, responsibility for speech degrees was transferred to the University
of Oregon and several faculty moved to establish the program. However, the
service department at Oregon State continued to offer courses in debating,
extempore speaking, oratory, voice and diction, and radio speech and
coordinated an extensive program of forensics and dramatic activities for
students.</p>
<p>In 1965-1966, the Speech Department was one of the first departments to
offer an undergraduate degree in the new School of Humanities and Social
Sciences. In 1970, the department name was changed to Speech
Communication.</p>
<p>C.B. (Charles Buren) Mitchell joined the faculty of Oregon Agricultural
College in 1920 to head the new Department of Public Speaking and
Dramatics. Earl W. Wells joined the department at about the same time
(1921); he was instrumental in developing the forensics and public
speaking program and coached orators who gained national prominence. Wells
served as Speech Department Chair from 1952 until his retirement in
1962.</p>

<p>These oral histories recount the work of Portland's African American railroad porters in the early and mid-20th century, at a time when job opportunities for African American males were largely limited to service jobs. The subjects featured in these interviews include prominent figures both within and beyond the African American community.</p>
<p>To highlight the significance of these interview subjects, the following is a brief overview of the work of a selection of interviewees: Otto Rutherford was involved in the Portland chapter of the NAACP and played an important role in the successful passage of the Public Accommodations Bill, also known as the Oregon Civil Rights Bill, in the state legislature in 1953; E. Shelton Hill arrived in Portland in 1941 as a railroad employee, served as president of the Urban League of Portland from 1959 to 1973, and successfully advocated for the rights of Oregon’s African Americans; and James Brooks who served as director of the Urban League of Portland from 1974-1978, after heading several of the League's programs.</p>
<p>An educator and co-founder of the World Arts Foundation, Michael "Chappie" Grice has been an advocate for the preservation of African-American culture. In 2010, he was honored by the National Education Association with the H. Councill Trenholm Memorial Award.
