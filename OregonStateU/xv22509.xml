      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>Commercial hops production began in Oregon in the 1860s; by the early 20th century, Oregon was the nation's largest hop producer.  Scientists began experimenting with planting hops on campus grounds in 1893 and plant pathologists at Oregon State were instrumental in addressing downy mildew problems with hops during the mid-20th century.  The USDA-OSU hop breeding program developed and released more than a dozen hop cultivars beginning in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Godfrey R. Hoerner was appointed the Extension Specialist for Hop Production in January 1948 as a half-time appointment with the Extension Service.  This position was established at the request of Oregon hop growers and was initially funded by the Agricultural Research Foundation.  Hoerner had been a plant pathologist with the USDA in Corvallis since 1931 and held various previous positions with the USDA; he continued a half-time appointment with the USDA while he was also serving as Hop Specialist.  Hoerner earned a BS in Plant Pathology at Oregon Agricultural College in 1916 and completed an MS at the University of Minnesota in 1918.  Hoerner left his positions at Oregon State and the USDA in April 1955 to become Chief of the Oregon State College Technical Assistance Team at Kasetsart University in Thailand.  Hoerner completed two 2-year contracts at Kasetsart in 1955-1959 and died in October 1959.</p>

      <p>The <title render="italic">Hop Press: A Memorandum of What's Brewin'</title> was prepared by Hop Specialist G.R. Hoerner and issued monthly by the Oregon State College Extension Service as a means to provide information on hops and brewing to County Extension Agents in Oregon.  The first issue was published in October 1948; it ceased publication with the March 1955 issue.  This informal publication provides a detailed view of hops growing and production in Oregon and the northwest for this period.  Each typewritten, mimeographed, 8-page newsletter includes a variety of announcements and news items regarding hops and brewing in Oregon.  Statistics on hop acreage, the costs of production, and number of growers are available throughout. Information about the Oregon Hop Industry Research Advisory Committee, the Growers Advisory Committee, and other industry organizations is provided in the newsletter.  Summaries and preliminary reports of hops research being conducted at Oregon State are included as well as news items from newspapers and other publications in Oregon and Washington.  Agendas for Hop Growers Conferences and summaries of presentations at these conferences are also provided in the newsletter.</p>
      <p>The <title render="italic">Hop Press</title> includes information about hops growing in Washington, Idaho, and California and was distributed to individuals and organizations outside of Oregon.
