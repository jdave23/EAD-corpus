      <p>The Spike Sisters Scrapbooks consist of three scrapbooks assembled by
the sisters during their student years at Oregon Agricultural College. Two
of the scrapbooks were assembled by Eleanor and Frances and include
materials primarily from the early 1920s; the other scrapbook was
assembled by Mary and includes materials from the 1930s. The scrapbooks
include photographs, clippings, programs, dance cards, tickets, and other
ephemeral items. The photographs are primarily snapshots of other
students; they also include images of student activities and outings,
campus buildings, and snow scenes. Group photographs of Mary Spike's Sigma
Kappa sorority sisters and fellow pharmacy students are included.</p>
      <p>The collection includes football game programs, a program for the
Military Tournament, and dance and theater performance programs. Of
special note is a menu from the Andrews and Kerr restaurant in Corvallis
and the fall 1931 edition (volume 5) of 
<title render="italic">The Manuscript</title>, a literary magazine of
student writing published by the English Department. Lecture notes taken
by Mary Spike for Chemistry 204 (taken in 1934) and Economic Geography
(taken in 1931) are included. An Oregon State College binder used by Mary
and autographed by fellow students is part of the collection.</p>
