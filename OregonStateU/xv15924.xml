      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>The Recreational Sports Department provides recreational and
educational opportunities for the Oregon State University (OSU) community,
primarily students, and oversees recreational facilities on the Corvallis
campus, including the Dixon Recreation Center and Stevens Natatorium,
McAlexander Fieldhouse, and intramural sports fields.</p>
      <p>A study of the administration and oversight of recreational programs
and facilities was conducted in the early 1970s. Based on a recommendation
of this study, a Board of Physical Recreation was established in January
1973 and the process was initiated to fund recreation programs and
facilities with student fees. Recreational Sports celebrated its 25th
anniversary in 1998.</p>
      <p>The Dixon Recreation Center opened in 1975 and was dedicated in memory
of James V. Dixon and Jeannette Brauns Dixon; the Stevens Natatorium was
completed in 1992. The recreation center was extensively remodeled and
expanded in 2004. McAlexander Fieldhouse and the outdoor sports fields
were remodeled and upgraded in 2010-2011.</p>
      <p>Sports clubs are recognized student organizations that provide OSU
students the opportunity to compete in various sports against other
schools' teams and community groups in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
