      <head>Biographical Note:</head>
      <p>Benjamin Boreman Stout worked as a a forestry researcher, professor and
university administrator before moving to Oregon in 1985, where he
continued his work as a researcher, advocate, and writer. A native of West
Virginia, Stout earned a BS in forestry from West Virginia University in
1947, a Master of Forestry in silviculture from Harvard University in
1950, and a Ph.D. in ecology from Rutgers University in 1967. He served as
manager of Harvard University's Black Rock Research Forest in Cornwall,
New York from 1950 to 1959 when he joined the faculty of Rutgers
University in forestry. He was appointed an Associate Provost at Rutgers
during his tenure there and became Dean of Forestry at the University of
Montana in 1978. His research interests were hardwood silviculture,
biophysical relationships in trees, and analysis of complex ecological
systems.</p>
      <p>In 1985, he joined the West Coast Regional Center of the National
Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI) in
Corvallis, Oregon as the National Air Quality/Forest Health Program
Manager. He retired from the position in 1988 and moved to Albany,
Oregon.</p>
      <p>Stout remained active during his retirement as a researcher, writer,
and advocate in forestry and natural resources issues. He served as the
senior natural resources advisor for his local state legislator, Liz Van
Leeuwen, and on the Board of Directors of the Oregon State Fish Hatchery.
From 1988 to 2002, he held a courtesy appointment in the Oregon State
University College of Forestry. He authored numerous scientific articles
and two books on natural resources, including 
<title render="italic">The Northern Spotted Owl: An Oregon View</title>
which describes the history of northwest forest legislation in the the
1980s and 1990s. Stout died in 2007.</p>

      <p>The Benjamin B. Stout Papers consist of materials created and assembled
by Stout in the course of his work as a forestry researcher, university
professor and administrator, writer, and advisor and advocate on natural
resources policy. The Papers include articles, essays, and other
publications; correspondence; presentations and speeches; research data;
and reference materials. Stout's publications and presentations reflect a
diversity of topics, including forest monitoring programs, declines in
pine growth, forest growth simulation, and height-diameter studies of
trees as a sign of productivity. Correspondents represented in the
collection include fellow academics, including Hugh Raup; foresters;
governmental agencies; natural resource organizations; and state and
federal legislators including Oregon State Representative Liz Van Leeuwen,
Congressmen Mike Kopetski and Peter De Fazio, and Senators Ron Wyden and
Gordon Smith. The collection also includes materials documenting Stout's
work for the National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream
Improvement such as research publications, conference and workshop
presentations, correspondence with academic colleagues.</p>
      <p>The reference materials comprise about a third of the collection and
include reports, publications, newspaper clippings, maps, and articles
documenting various forestry, ecology, and natural resource management
topics. In addition to the controversial listing of the northern spotted
owl and marbled murrelet as protected endangered species in Oregon, the
materials address global warming, historical overviews of the timber
industry in Oregon, cumulative effects of forest practices in Oregon, and
Harvard University's research forest.</p>
