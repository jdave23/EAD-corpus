<p>(1:01:28) Rylan Wall begins this one-hour interview by discussing his time serving as co-director for Rainbow Continuum, delving into the issues the organization faced that year with a lack of gender diversity in the leadership and the non-inclusive decision-making that can stem from that situation. Wall talks about the different leadership positions available within Rainbow Continuum at that time, noting that there was a higher than normal rate of student engagement within the organization that year. In addition, Wall briefly discusses his mentor at the Pride Center and the important impact mentorship can have—a topic he returns to later in the interview. Wall details what a typical Rainbow Continuum meeting entailed while he was working there, including a facilitated introduction, and establishing a “safe” or brave space. Wall explains that what would follow was sometimes discussion questions centered on community issues or larger LGBTQ+ issues, and often an activity or game, led by the social director. Wall describes his experience with planning OSU’s Pride Week, including general highlights, again noting that the number of people involved and the number of programs put on was record-breaking that year. Following this, Wall briefly discusses how Rainbow Continuum came to be designated as a voluntary student organization, and the ways that this designation ensured a standard of student autonomy. Wall notes that in his experience, OSU’s administration, faculty, and staff have been supportive of student voices on campus, and seem to always be looking for student input. This conversation brings him back to the importance of mentorship, support, and role models—specifically highlighting the work Jeff Kenney did to improve the Pride Center as Director of Outreach, and how he helped them restructure the center to better fit the expectations of a cultural center. Wall ends by speaking on the importance of having a Pride Center on campus, and how the visibility and resources it provides impacted him in his early days at Oregon State.

<p>(0:34:51) In the interview, Goetter begins by briefly describing her high school experience, and the lack of a queer community in that space. Because of this, she explains that she was committed to creating that space when she came to Oregon State, but was pleasantly surprised to find that a queer community was already firmly established at the school. Goetter details how Rainbow Continuum was beneficial to her, particularly in her early days at OSU, and how she fell into activist work. Goetter talks about the kind of work she did as web director for the Pride Center, and later as a co-director of Rainbow Continuum. After describing her early involvement at Oregon State, Goetter primarily focuses on the OSU drag show, its history, and its impact. She pinpoints the ways in which the show has created community, and created a space for playfulness and performativity. Goetter emphasizes drag as activist work that is both empowering and political. In the second half of this interview, Goetter describes a Corvallis Gazette article that ultimately prompted changes within the OSU drag show, thanks to input from Dr. Brenda McComb. Because of this, Goetter explains how she has worked to make the drag show open to a wider range of ideas, particularly in making the show more supportive and inclusive of transgender folks.

Wicks describes the ways in which both OSU and other land-grant institutions have made progress in transgender inclusivity, yet still have a long way to go in terms of resources, support, and policy. Wicks also speaks to her involvement at the Pride Center, describing Rainbow Continuum and what it achieves for the community, and detailing Pride Week events on Oregon State’s campus.

<p>(0:17:43) This interview with Adrian Borycki focuses primarily on their involvement in the Greek community as an openly queer-identified individual. Borycki paints a nuanced picture of Greek life at OSU, describing the ways in which it is both heteronormative and homogenous, but nevertheless supportive in their personal experience. Borycki explains that their sorority, Sigma Kappa, has been very supportive since Borycki came out to their sisters. Borycki explains that they have often felt like a “queer representative” in their sorority, supporting their sisters and having the ability to blend the two OSU worlds of Greek life and the Pride Center. Borycki details micro-aggressions they have experienced at Greek life social events, particularly from fraternities. Borycki ends by speaking about their work as the publications coordinator for the Pride Center, outlining their social media strategy for the center to create a stronger online presence. Borycki explains that the Pride Center’s social media presence is a vital way to keep the community connected, show that there is support, and create an “unassuming way” for students to get involved with the Pride Center—especially for those students who may not be “out” to friends and family. At the time of the interview Borycki used the first name “Sarah.” Interviewer: Kiah McConnell.

<p>(0:25:23) In this interview, Allen details their coming out experience as someone who began to explore their identities a little bit later in life. They describe coming out as a process, and describe the way this process looks different with friends, family, teachers, and peers. Allen briefly explores the intersection of masculinity and race, and how this intersection has impacted them as a masculine-presenting person of color. In addition, they share their vision for the future of SOL (the LGBTQ+ Multicultural Network), the Pride Center, and the other cultural centers. Allen explains the ways in which the mere existence of SOL is indicative of a greater problem with inclusion amongst the cultural centers, and a lack of intersectional awareness in their resources and staff. At the end of the interview, Allen briefly discusses Project Social Justice and how it has impacted their life. Interviewer: Kiah McConnell.

<p>(1:01:55) In this hour-long interview, Jeff Kenney discusses a wide range of topics relating to the culture and history of the Pride Center at OSU, and student affairs and outreach work more generally. Kenney explains that as Coordinator of LGBTQ+ Outreach and Services, his primary goal was to ensure the promotion and success of LGBTQ+ students. He details the responsibilities of this position, including serving as an active liaison to the Pride Center and partnering with other units both on- and off-campus; providing supervision, mentorship, and guidance to OSU students; and mediating pressures to serve both students and staff, to reach outside the OSU community or focus on campus issues. Kenney briefly explains the root of this conflict, detailing the ways in which queer and trans faculty at OSU can feel isolated, as well as face micro-aggressions or direct hostility from their colleagues, but have no significant support for this issue. In addition, he discusses the ins and outs of serving a diverse constituency, not only balancing the demands of students and staff, but also seeking to serve non-students from the surrounding community. Kenney suggests that another pull and tug is experienced by outreach coordinators like himself—being held responsible to both the institution as well as the student body, and having to sometimes represent policies that feel outdated or created from a place of fear. Following Kenney’s in-depth exploration of the many conflicting expectations for outreach coordinators in general, but particularly at Oregon State, he briefly discusses how the push for marriage equality during his time at Oregon State impacted the Pride Center. This part of the discussion details the ways in which marriage equality is important, but also homonormative, and often negates the more pressing needs (i.e. stable jobs, shelter, food) of many queer communities. Kenney concludes the interview with a more general discussion on the Diversity and Cultural Engagement Office at Oregon State. Kenney describes the changes he has observed in the relationships between cultural and resource centers on campus, as students and staff increasingly envision these centers as one consortium. He describes the ways his office has become a more complex organization in reaction to a complex student body, and ends by speaking on the emotional aspect of doing this kind of work.

<p>(1:48:45) Helding begins the interview by sharing information about his family history and early childhood in Spokane, WA and later Gresham, OR. He shares some of his memories regarding the lack of open discussion about LGBTQ+ issues and lack of support for LGBTQ+ peoples within his communities growing up. Helding then shares his recollections of his time at OSU; he lived in Poling Hall, was an RA in Cauthorn Hall his junior year, and sang with the OSU choir for five years. Helding describes the campus climate in terms of LGBTQ+ issues. During his time on campus, he recalls the “Moral Majority” movement and Evangelical Christian organizations that promoted anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and practice emerging at OSU. Helding then begins the story of the 1981 ASOSU vote to fund the Gay People’s Alliance. The interview focuses on the April 28, 1981 meeting in which the ASOSU vote to fund the Gay People’s Alliance was discussed. As this was the second to last meeting of the year, this was the meeting that student groups lobbied for their organizations to be funded. Eddie Hickey represented the Gay People’s Alliance since the student fees committee had denied them funds and they wanted the senate to overturn that ruling. Helding says that he did not know who they were as individuals or as an organization and that the group of individuals were the first openly gay people with whom he interacted. He says that he was interested in the GPA request because it was a new request and thought it should be more seriously considered. Helding then describes the process of the debate on whether or not to fund the GPA – he goes into great detail explaining the discussion, which lasted over an hour, and the pros and cons to funding the GPA. The final vote was 18-13 in favor. Notably, Helding takes time to reflect on his interactions with the GPA members immediately following the meeting. Helding then describes the aftermath of the vote. The arbitration committee approved the entire proposed budget except for the funds for the GPA. Helding continues the interview with his post-OSU life story. He reflects on the importance of the ASOSU GPA vote and its impact on his career. Helding then shares his professional experiences. Helding notes that the oral history interview process has enabled him to reflect upon “touch points in time” throughout his life and how each of his experiences built on each other and helped him be more open and more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. His last thoughts are about his positive experience of sharing his story as an oral history interview and expresses the power of people sharing their stories. Interviewer: Natalia Fernández.

<p>(0:42:46) In this interview with Judy Ball, she begins by describing her childhood, which primarily holds good memories despite the poverty she grew up in. She explains that early on in her life, she knew that school would be her only outlet to pursue a better life. For Ball, life in college was dedicated to her studies. After getting her master's degree from Syracuse University, she began working for the federal government. Ball discusses her busy life in Maryland, and her career as a healthcare worker with the federal government, which lasted over 30 years. During this time in her life, Ball was married for ten years. However, Ball explains that their love faded, and she describes the strong sense of independence that has always been an important feature of her personality. In 2008, Ball moved to Corvallis, and her relocation marked the beginning of her involvement with the LGBTQ+ community, as she had fallen in love with a woman and decided to follow her out to the West Coast. Ball admits she had never questioned her sexuality growing up and issues of alternate sexualities were never discussed in the household, which resulted in her finding the whole experience surreal. Although her relationship with this individual eventually came to an end, Ball continues to be very active in the Corvallis community, both serving on the school board and participating in local events. Ball discusses her sexual identity, and though she states that "the evidence would suggest" she is bisexual, she explains that she does not necessarily find herself aligned with this identity.

<p>(0:46:37) In the interview, Williams first discusses her early years being raised in Corvallis, Oregon. Born in 1962, she attended school in Corvallis until leaving for Montana to pursue a college degree. Williams explains that there was little to no talk in her family of the LGBTQ+ community, and that she herself remained in denial of her sexual identity until her mid-twenties. Almost all of her life has been spent in Corvallis, and she offers some insight into the changes the community has experienced. Williams discusses her decision to become a teacher and what it was like to teach at her alma mater, Corvallis High School. Williams explains how her connection to the LGBTQ+ community has both positively and negatively affected her teaching career. She shares her own stories, as well as those of students and fellow faculty members, to showcase the LGBTQ+ -friendly atmosphere at Corvallis High School. The remainder of the interview focuses on the Queer-Straight Alliance club at Corvallis High School. As an integral member of its formation, Williams explains the goals of the QSA. She shares her hopes for the future of the QSA, her take on the community’s response to the QSA, and information on what the club offers for today’s student body.

<p>(1:29:00) The interview begins with Neustadt talking about her childhood and describing what family life was like for her. She remembers playing in the streets with local neighborhood children and staying out as late as possible—until their mothers insisted they come in. She discusses the rather authoritative parenting style of her father, which was balanced by her mother’s nurturing approach. Neustadt describes the difficulties of middle school and high school, recalling the awkwardness she experienced during that time in her life. Neustadt proceeds to discuss her life after graduation. She moved to Iowa to attend a small liberal arts college, and although she enjoyed being young and single, Neustadt did not excel academically because she lacked focus. Aware of how much debt she was accruing, she decided to put her studies on hold until she was certain of her career path. Neustadt explains that she eventually decided to pursue an advanced degree in Clinical Psychology and moved to Oregon to do so. She speaks quite fondly of her time in Eugene. The interview then shifts to Neustadt’s discussion of her sexuality, and the expansive support of the women’s community in Eugene during her college years. Shortly after obtaining her master’s degree she moved from Eugene to Corvallis and co-founded an LGBTQ advocacy group called After 8. She describes the volatile environment in Corvallis that prompted her to establish such a group. For most of the interview, Neustadt details the specific activities After 8 was involved in. Many of the stories are difficult, while others have a humorous tone. Neustadt recalls the times when the group received death threats, but also details positive events experienced by the LGBTQ community since that time, including the group’s annual Harvey Milk Dinners, which took place from 1989 – 1999. The interview concludes with Neustadt’s reflection on the progress made and the work still to be done in regards to equality for the LGBTQ community. Neustadt ends by discussing how grateful she is for the support of other human and civil rights groups, who helped After 8 accomplish the goals they set out to accomplish.

<p>(0:21:59) In the interview, Reynolds briefly describes her upbringing. She then proceeds to outline her career in law and how she has contributed to resolving legal marriage issues and asset distribution challenges for both in-state and out-of-state same sex marriages. In addition, Reynolds describes her involvement in assisting transgender clients who must navigate legal changes to their documentation. She explains that in Oregon, transgender individuals who wish to change their name or sex on legal documents are required to undergo surgery, which can present numerous challenges. Following this, Lorena describes the challenges her family faced when her brother Tristan came out as transgender. In trying to find his true identity, Tristan, who is nine years younger than Reynolds, had to come out multiple times, first as a lesbian, and then later as trans. This process put a strain on Tristan and his familial relationships. Lorena explains that when Tristan came out, there was no framework for transgender folks, so it was hard for both Tristan and the family to process and adapt to the change. Lorena’s brother created a video called “It Gets Better” with the help of his family, where each member of the family agreed to be interviewed on their experience with Tristan’s transition.

<p>(0:43:39) The interview begins with Gelser discussing her upbringing and family life, traveling frequently between Las Vegas, where she was born, and her parent’s home state of Indiana, then moving to Oregon when she was a sophomore in high school. Gelser talks about applying to Earlham College in Indiana in 1990, and accepting due to their progressive environment and inclusive programming. She explains that Earlham’s values aligned with her own, having worked with friends in the LGBTQ+ community in a Teens for the Prevention of AIDS group. She notes the misunderstanding of AIDS at the time and how it contributed to her interest in LGBTQ+ issues. She mentions LGBTQ+ issues weren’t discussed at home and weren’t tolerated at schools in the late 80s, and notes the contrast between her own and her children’s experiences with LGBTQ+ issues in school. Gelser’s interest in politics grew in her interactions with the community, through non-hierarchical methods she learned at Earlham, and her experiences advocating for a son with special needs. This eventually led her to join the Corvallis school board in 2001 and later to become involved in Oregon legislature from 2005 onwards. Before participating in Oregon politics, Gelser attended OSU from 1996 to 1998, pursuing a master’s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, with a focus in History and Women’s Studies. She explains that she focused on Interdisciplinary Studies in hopes of teaching high school students, but eventually expanded out of teaching into politics because she began to note important patterns in history and their correlation to present issues. In her political experience in the Oregon House of Representatives, Gelser talks about legislation that she helped pass, such as improvements to the accessibility of birth control, better structures for supporting domestic partnerships, making public accommodations for same-sex couples, and Karly’s Law on child abuse. In addition to these priorities, Gelser stayed true to her roots in education, and headed a committee on Oregon education. During her time in the Oregon Senate, Gelser talks about passing legislation on LGBTQ+ issues, including Senate Bill 946, a bill on veteran’s benefits for those discharged through Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, a bill on preferred gender and name identification for students, and a bill concerning bullying in schools related to LGBTQ+ students. As for future pieces of LGBTQ+ legislation, Gelser mentions legislation on marriage statutes, clarification of language for couples in previous legislation, changes to identification for same sex couples, and talks about her experience with debating on the Senate floor over legislation about solemnizing marriages outside of churches. The interview concludes with Gelser talking about the untapped history of LGBTQ+ issues. Interviewers: Brett Bishop and Brittney Nicole Aman.

<p>(0:25:31) In the interview, Mary Renneke begins by discussing her childhood with her sister and twin brother. Born in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1956, Mary was introduced to sports at a very early age, inspiring her passion for athletics. At age ten, Renneke began playing softball on a women’s team, and as she grew older she discovered that the sport was often a safe place for lesbians. Renneke jokingly claims that in the 70s, at least 80% of women’s softball players were lesbians. She notes that because her sister was also involved in softball, she suspected early on that Renneke might identify as lesbian. However, Renneke remarked that because there was no social media at that time, being a lesbian was something she knew little about, and did not discuss with her family until she turned 30. Because she enjoyed the community that women’s softball had to offer, Renneke continued to play softball into her 40s. However, she says she decided not to pursue a career in softball, either as a player or a coach, because there simply weren’t enough opportunities for women in sport in the 70s and 80s. Renneke briefly discusses Title IX, and the improvements it has made for women athletes. When Renneke was in high school and college, women’s teams were only just being introduced, and the teams she played for outside of college were self-funded. Although her tuition for community college in the 70s was a mere one-hundred dollars per year, she spent upwards of two-thousand dollars a season to play softball. Renneke describes her life after leaving college, explaining that work was merely a means to an end, allowing her to support herself while continuing to play sports. During this time, one of Renneke’s friends was a student at Oregon State University, and convinced her to come to OSU to play softball. Although Renneke agreed, receiving a partial scholarship from OSU at the age of 24, she did not complete her degree at the university and instead moved back to San Jose to work as a city bus driver. After ten to twelve years of this work, Renneke says she missed Oregon, so she returned to Corvallis and opened a coffee shop with a friend. At the age of 57, Renneke completed a bachelor’s degree through OSU’s online education program. Following this, she returned once again to California to become a job trainer for city bus drivers, but was laid off from this position during the recession. Renneke now lives in Albany and works at Natural Grocers in Corvallis. Interviewers: Suheng Chen and Hangyi Zhang.

<p>(0:56:01) Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1947, Dr. Martha Cone, Ph.D. begins her interview by speaking on her early life. Her father was an air traffic controller, a position that required the family to relocate frequently while Dr. Cone was growing up. She attended high school in San Antonio, Texas from 1961-1965; Dr. Cone describes this time in her life as devoid of discussion on LGBTQ issues, explaining many from this community were still in the closet, including herself. After graduation, Cone matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, where she studied microbiology and ultimately earned her doctorate degree. Dr. Cone explains how she was married from the age of 19 until she came out at 27, when she left her marriage and moved to a forested 1900s utopian commune in Delaware. Following this, Dr. Cone moved to California with friends from Philadelphia, where she met some women who owned a big pink bus, “tricked out” with beds and a kitchen, and joined them on their journey to Oregon. Dr. Cone details how this experience brought her to a women’s commune near Estacada. Everything was done by consensus among the women, including farm work and class instruction. Dr. Cone lived at the commune for about a year and a half before coming to Corvallis in search of a job, and eventually accepted a position in the Oregon State University (OSU) Microbiology Department. Dr. Cone describes how in her time at OSU, she was a part of the ‘book scandal’ in the OSU Women’s Center, wrote a letter to the editor of the Barometer on the subject, and was even involved in a picket march. While working for the College of Science, Dr. Cone was good friends with a gay man and by a mutual agreement, they conceived a child together. The man is still very much involved in their daughter’s life. Dr. Cone commented that when she first came to OSU, the gay communities were closeted and activism was just beginning to take place on campus. She became involved in activism for women’s college sports at the university, which often involved Title IX issues. Dr. Cone admits that her work experience at OSU was somewhat of a "locker room" environment because not many women worked in her department. In part because of this unsupportive environment, and the general discrimination against women prevalent in the science department, Dr. Cone says she decided not to try for tenure. She instead took up a post-doc position working in a lab for 10 years until the professor left, and Dr. Cone was unable to attain grants for the project on her own. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, and ultimately using all of her sick leave, Dr. Cone officially retired. In 2002, she took advantage of an opportunity to learn how to transcribe textbooks into Braille, an activity she actively participates in to this day. At the time of the interview, Dr. Cone shared that she planned to move to Portland to live in a floating home on the Columbia River with her partner. Interviewers: Eugenia Rott and Jared Ziegler.

<p>(0:36:21) Robin Frojen was born in Los Angeles in 1966. In the interview, Frojen begins by describing the difficulties she faced in her youth, not caring for traditional gender roles or expectations, which led to bullying throughout her early life. Frojen cites a notable incident that occurred in elementary school in which she did not receive any valentine cards from her peers. Frojen continued her education at a Catholic middle school and high school. Ironically, the nuns at Frojen’s institution were incredibly progressive when it came to their acceptance of diverse personalities and sexualities. Her high school has more recently become a visible beacon, having graduated their openly first transgender student. Frojen recognizes this is an incredible accomplishment, especially for a Catholic school. Frojen maintains a close relationship with the high school and its faculty members. Frojen remembers her childhood outside of school affectionately, speaking about her parents with admiration, and recognizing how hard her father worked to provide for her family. Frojen describes her mother as a strong and supportive force, particularly when Frojen came out to her family at 22. Frojen explains that the way in which she came out to her family was not ideal. Afraid her sexuality would ruin her relationship with her family, Frojen agreed to have a good friend break the news to her mother over lunch. Frojen admits that her mother suspected she was a lesbian, so was not shocked by Frojen’s coming out. Her mother had refrained from asking her daughter outright, because she valued integrity and honesty and did not want to put Frojen in a position that would require her to lie. After Frojen came out, her mother proceeded to call all of their immediate family members to break the news and affirm her love and support for Frojen. After moving around the country, from coast to coast, Frojen eventually settled down in Corvallis, Oregon in 1997. In Corvallis, she rediscovered her love for food and made the courageous decision to pursue a degree in chemistry and food science. Frojen is now the manager of the Oregon State Creamery. Corvallis’s welcoming community has made it an amazing city to reside in for Frojen and her family. It has allowed her to become active in different communities throughout Corvallis. She has helped with the LGTBQ+ community by attending diversity panels held by Kathy Grieves. Frojen also helps with NAMI, a program that helps families deal with mental illness. Robin always expresses that she is available for anyone who needs help and lives by the motto, “Work hard at being yourself, not someone else.” Interviewers: Madeleine Selfors and Kevin More.

<p>(1:27:26) As part of Trans Awareness Week 2016 on OSU’s campus, SOL and the Pride Center hosted an event entitled “Occupying Margins: A Panel Discussion on Gender” in which three OSU students—Tara Crockett, Malik Ensley, and Vickie Zeller— with moderator Samantha Wood, spoke about their personal experiences with gender, as well larger impressions of the topic. The description of the panel was as follows: “This panel aims to spotlight the lived experiences of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming folx who live beyond the gender binary.” During the event, the panelists answered pre-decided questions as well as queries from the audience. A wide array of issues were addressed, including South Asian poetry duo Dark Matter and their argument that if you are a person of color, queer, differently abled, neuro-diverse, low-income, etc. you already do not fit the definition of “man” or “woman.” The three describe their vision for working towards a society that <emph render="italic">cherishes</emph> these trans and non-binary genders and relationships, rather than just “accepting” non-binary people. In addition, the group explores the ways in which the definition of gender can be expanded and improved upon by acknowledging histories and legacies of slavery and colonization. All of the panelists stress the need for difficult conversations, and interventions that make others question their harmful assumptions. They explain that this includes talking to strangers, standing up for your friends, and fostering dialogue with family members.

<p>The Oregon Central Military Road Map depicts a portion of the Oregon Central Military Road as surveyed in July-September 1865. The hand-drawn manuscript map depicts the daily progress of the survey party, which was accompanied by a U.S. Army cavalry escort. Major geographic and natural features along the route are shown on the map, including the Middle Fork of the Willamette, Deschutes, and Williamson Rivers; Klamath Marsh, Fort Klamath, Klamath Lake, and Lower Klamath Lake; the Lakes Basin including Goose, Summer, and Abert Lakes; and Diamond Peak, Beatys Butte, and Steens Mountain.

<p>The Oregon Native American Language Sound Recordings consist of
cassette audiotape recordings of interviews conducted by Joe E. Pierce
with members of the Coquille and Siletz tribes. The recordings were made
as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation for a
systematic study of Native American languages in Oregon. Bruce J. Rigsby
also participated in the study.</p>
<p>The recordings document the Tolowa and Tutuni languages, especially
word phrases, songs, and stories. The grammatical structure of the
languages is also addressed. The bulk of the recordings are interviews
with Mrs. Amelia Brown; other individuals that are included in the
recordings are Mr. and Mrs. Lopez, Mrs. Ida Bensell, Hoxy Simmons, Miller
Collins, and Mrs. Carrie Streets.</p>
<p>The cassette audiotapes were prepared in the late 1980s by Tom Grigsby
of the OSU Anthropology Department from original reel-to-reel recordings.
Tape logs were prepared at that time and are included with the
collection.</p>

<p>The Clifford L. Smith Photograph Collection consists of photographs assembled by Smith that document student life at Oregon Agricultural College (OAC) in the late 1910s. Several photos are pictures of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity house and members. A number of photos also show many early traditions at Oregon Agricultural College, including the rook bonfire and rook-sophomore tug-of-war at the millrace. All of the items in the collection are photographic or postcard prints.</p>
<p>These images were made several years before Smith attended OAC; he may have acquired them through his connection with Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.</p>

<p>The <title render="italic">Hop Press: A Memorandum of What's Brewin'</title> was prepared by Hop Specialist G.R. Hoerner and issued monthly by the Oregon State College Extension Service as a means to provide information on hops and brewing to County Extension Agents in Oregon. The first issue was published in October 1948; it ceased publication with the March 1955 issue. This informal publication provides a detailed view of hops growing and production in Oregon and the northwest for this period.

<p>The Nuclear Free America Records document the activities of this nonprofit antinuclear organization during its most active years.</p>
<p>Series 1: Administrative Records covers all general operational functions of Nuclear Free America (NFA) including staffing, administration, finance, outreach and promotion, and organizational contacts. Series 1 is further divided into 4 subseries. Subseries 1: General includes financial records, meeting minutes, and staffing records. Subseries 2: Grant Funding and Subseries 3: Fundraising demonstrate the funding efforts by this small organization through different means, including local initiatives and private donations. Subseries 4: Conferences contains several folders of meeting minutes from the Nuclear Free Local Authorities international conferences, which shed further light on NFA's work.</p>
<p>Series 2: Nuclear Free Zones contains the majority of materials in the collection and documents the efforts by NFA to create "nuclear free zones" (NFZs), or communities where nuclear production, testing, waste, and transportation activities were banned. The series is arranged geographically and contains documentation of NFA's work with each locality or community organizing toward an NFZ declaration. While some efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, most declarations happened successfully due to the liaising and guidance provided by Nuclear Free America. Some communities, including those in New York, Ohio, and California used the NFZ effort to successfully protest nearby nuclear waste disposal plans. Within this series, Subseries 3: Native Lands contains important documentation of efforts by tribal leaders to eradicate nuclear presence from various native reservations. Of particular note are materials including correspondence, meeting minutes, and legal documents related to NFA's partnership with the National Environmental Coalition of Native Americans to help fight the U. S. Department of Energy's plan to site 'temporary' high-level radioactive waste dumps on native lands. The international zones represented in Subseries 4 include documentation of efforts by NFA to include nuclear issues in international discussions related to protecting the Arctic and other remote regions.</p>
<p>Series 3: Weapons-Maker Database shows how NFA became the sole source of information on U.S. companies that make or support nuclear weapons, in order to support socially conscious investing, boycott efforts, and divestment campaigns. The Weapons Maker Database and its various datasets were provided to buyers from 1990 to 1995 and the series contains client information sheets, compiled lists, and correspondence. Series 4: Other Initiatives and Projects demonstrates fundraising and other outreach efforts undertaken by the organization, including significant boycotting activity and documentaries. The collected materials in Series 5: Related Organizations offer a window into both national and international antinuclear and peace activism during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and show grassroots activist efforts addressing a number of nuclear concerns through publications, activities, events, and outreach. The similar materials in Series 6 were grouped by NFA according to topic rather than organization. Series 7: Artifacts and Memorabilia contains ephemera such as stickers, buttons, and placards from a wide body of antinuclear events and organizations. Series 8: Video Recordings contains over 20 VHS tapes about a variety of topics, including the Trojan Nuclear Plant in Oregon and environmental impacts on the Columbia River. Series 9: Electronic Records contains various electronic formats that are not currently processed and inaccessible to researchers.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 1 documents the administrative activities of the organization, and includes summary reports, financial records, funding proposals, grant applications, contact lists, and outreach records. Evidence of the organization’s donor outreach activities, including mailer campaigns and donor approaches, is ample in this series. Notable in this series are records of several events sponsored jointly with other local anti-nuclear nonprofit organizations, including two dance marathon fundraisers, which show the organization’s network and community reach. Also notable is an incomplete run of The New Abolitionist, the newspaper produced by Nuclear Free America from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s. Content includes reports from national and international Nuclear Free Zones, progress reports from campaigns underway, and related nuclear and disarmament news.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 2 documents the primary campaign of Nuclear Free America, to create Nuclear Free Zones around the world. Grouped by geographical area, the files in this series show how NFA worked with grassroots activists at each locality to advance this goal. In addition to correspondence with these activists and data sheets detailing the nature of the local campaign, these files include fundraising materials, promotional materials for the campaign such as event flyers, advertising posters, and petitions; local news and press coverage, including newspapers and clippings, letters to the editor, and editorials; text of proposed ordinances and resolutions; correspondence with local authorities; handwritten notes; literature from pronuclear organizations and individuals; city council agendas and minutes; minutes and related materials from partner organizations; speeches, and more. These document the organizing activities at the grassroots level and can be used to show how the presence of nuclear materials, waste, or energy production affected specific localities and communities.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 3 documents an important product of Nuclear Free America which was in high demand by activist groups for many years. The weapons-maker database compiled and cross-referenced numerous federal datasets to provide reports on the sources, materials, and makers of nuclear weapons in the United States. This database included Department of Defense and Department of Energy contracts for weapons systems and weapons systems support by contractor and parent company. These data were derived from the Federal Procurement Data Center’s Individual Contract Actions and Awards master file, and were combined with parent company data provided by Eagle Eye Publishers of Arlington, Virginia. Buyers of these data and reports, including individuals, organizations, and nonprofits, used them to prepare boycotts, educate consumers, and a variety of other legal and social uses. NFA published a top 100 and a top 50 nuclear weapons systems makers list annually, ranked by total contract amount from the U.S. government. Familiar corporations such as AT&amp;T, Boeing, General Motors, General Electric, Ford Motor, Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed, and Westinghouse appear annually on each list ranked according to total amounts received. Materials include data sheets, correspondence with clients and data providers, a list of cross-reference codes, and compiled lists.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 4 compiles files on other Nuclear Free America projects, including those intended to increase public awareness of consumer links to the nuclear arms race and to provide people with simple ways of taking action against nuclear weapons contractors. The boycott of Morton Salt (whose parent company Morton Thiokol was the producer of solid rocket boosters for all U.S. nuclear weapons) was promoted through the media, direct mailings, and the efforts of hundreds of local campaigns, and was featured in the mainstream press via Newsweek, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, and several radio talk shows. The boycott lasted for several years and had a notable impact on the company. Other projects include the Nuclear Free Home Project, which marketed lightbulbs and smoke detectors made by non nuclear-affiliated companies and contained no radioactive material.  Materials include project files, correspondence, promotional materials, budgets, and graphic design files.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 5 collects materials from a number of affiliated activist and social justice organizations both small and large. These include Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, Greenpeace, International Peace Bureau, the Indigenous Environmental Network, Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, NukeWatch, the Peace Boat, SANE/Freeze, and the World Information Service on Energy (WISE). Topics span a huge range of nuclear concerns, including waste disposal, power plant siting, construction, accidents, environmental protection, nonproliferation, disarmament, uranium mining, and international relations. Materials include newspapers, newsletters, white papers, flyers, brochures, conference papers, reports, and other ephemera. Many of the periodicals included are quite rare, as they were produced by small organizations with limited reach and a community focus; others are commonly available and produced by larger organizations with wider membership. Nuclear concerns are covered from many different angles, including legal, religious, and environmental directions.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 6 contains similar materials to those found in Series 5, but are arranged by subject focus. Flyers, brochures, pamphlets, newsclippings, and articles on a number of areas of concern are in this series. Files on the Hanford Site and the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant document Pacific Northwest issues, and more general files on topics such as pro-nuclear campaigns and economic justice show the breadth and depth of Nuclear Free America's concerns.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 7 is comprised of antinuclear ephemera, artifacts, and memorabilia collected by Nuclear Free America, including buttons, placards, posters, armbands, coffee mugs, stickers, and signs. Most are related to Nuclear Free Zones at various localities, but other national and international organizations represented include Bike for Peace and Movement de la Paix.</p>
</scopecontent>

<p>The Oregon State University Military Photographs Collection contains images of Oregon State military science and tactics cadets and officers from its beginning in 1873 through the 1960s. Many photographs are prints of images found in Oregon State publications such as the <title render="italic">Beaver</title> yearbook, <title render="italic">Oregon Stater</title> alumni magazine and the <title render="italic">Barometer</title> campus newspaper. The development of cadet uniforms and training can be seen throughout the collection. Images include views of campus buildings and locations during various eras. The collection contains prints and original negatives, glass negatives/positives (some hand colored), and instructional lantern slides of World War I vintage.</p>
<p>Subject matter features cadet formations on parade fields during military inspection day
events, artillery, cavalry and engineering training scenes and casual snapshots. The
collection includes a large group of glass negatives of early Oregon Agricultural College
cadet corps circa 1870 through 1918. A glass lantern slide collection of instructional
materials for Military Tactics courses includes images from World War One, with a focus on
combat engineers. Numerous images of Ulysses Grant McAlexander are included in the collection. After WWI, the Oregon Agricultural College ROTC program expanded to include
the new mechanized units developed in the Great War. Photographs from this period show the new
cadet artillery batteries equipped with surplus US Army equipment. The annual inspection of
cadets by dignitaries was a popular event during the college
year and is well documented in the collection. Dignitaries that are depicted include Oregon Governors Charles Martin
and Charles Sprague and Oregon State Presidents William Jasper Kerr, George Peavy, and A.L. Strand. The US Army ROTC Pershing Rifles are well represented with photographs of drill team competitions and awards during the 1960s. Stock U.S. Military photographs and college photographs from all eras are found in the series.</p>

<p> Negative version of print in collection P002:383. OAC Cadet "Battalion" in box formation on parade field with rifles, dated May 1895. The caption on the most original of the prints states, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 Strut Column". The box formation shown can be dated back to Napoleonic Tactics (adaptation of ancient warfare formations). Still practiced in the late 19th to early 20th century infantry training. Uniforms are of the pattern 1892 sack coats with a variety of Forage Caps shown in the group. Most of the cadets are wearing the 1895 Forage cap, which was patterned after the contemporary caps worn by firemen and train conductors, and did not find favor with the troops. There are still a few cadets with the Civil War era looking Forage Cap pattern 1872. Rifles issued to the cadets were most probably the M1884 Rifle, .45 Caliber with the Buffington Rear Sight. Buildings in the background are notable, showing the carriage house and Mechanical Hall with the railroad spur (Corvallis and Eastern RR) still in place.</p>

<p> OAC Cadet "Battalion" in box formation on parade field with rifles, dated May 1895. The caption on the most original of the prints states, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 Strut Column". The box formation shown can be dated back to Napoleonic Tactics (adaptation of ancient warfare formations). Still practiced in the late 19th to early 20th century infantry training. Uniforms are of the pattern 1892 sack coats with a variety of Forage Caps shown in the group. Most of the cadets are wearing the 1895 Forage cap, with a few cadets wearing the Civil War era Forage Cap pattern 1872. Rifles issued to the cadets were most probably the M1884 Rifle, .45 Caliber with the Buffington Rear Sight. Buildings in the background are notable, showing the carriage house and Mechanical Hall with the railroad spur (Corvallis and Eastern RR) still in place.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Mounted Print, titled, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 - Close Order Column of Companies". The uniforms are consistent with the 1890 period, showing the Forage Caps and sack coat patterns in blue.

State University Archives". There is a handwritten note included in sleeve stating "Found in (with title page) 1893-4 Catalog". This would put the dating of this photograph in question based on the caption written on the front. The period uniforms and Benton Hall configuration are consistent with a circa date of 1895.</p>

<p> possibly contemporary reprint of original negative (accompanying photo) by the Department of Information, Oregon State University (Stamped on reverse) Original photograph described as circa 1919, this is related to the photograph of the address by dignitaries of OAC "Inaugural Exercises, Oct. 1, 1918. The first four rows of crowd are cadets, with civilian onlookers in rear. Officer in Bandstand addressing crowd is unidentified. The cadets uniforms reflect the WWI era with some exceptions that can be attributed to cadet corps being issued older uniform stock. The Campaign Hats are of correct vintage, but the canvas puttees are of older style. Rifles in the group are the older design, Model 1896 .30 Caliber Krag-Jorgensen Rifles of Spanish American War vintage. The cadets were probably issued these supplies from existing US Army stockpiles and they may or may not be upgraded in the field.</p>
<p>Notes on reverse of photograph are concerning the buildings in the background, "Note: Dairy (Soc. Sc.), 2 white frame building the larger of which should be part of Alpha hall; daeke(?) frame house (SPE)"</p>

<p>During the post World War I period, the ROTC program at Oregon State was nationally recognized. The Armory, built in 1911 (now McAlexander Field House) was the best equipped facility on the West Coast. Many of the photographs in the series are from the post World War I time frame, highlighting the annual Military Tournaments.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>After the end of WWI, the Military built up the ROTC Training Battalion at OAC to include a Transportation Corps company. This new technology of warfare, the movement of men and materials by Trucks was to become a new science in Military and Tactics training. Original equipment provided to the OAC Armory included the WWI vintage "Liberty Trucks"and the FWD type. The 1922 Beaver yearbook describes the unit, "Equipment of the latest type and most complete nature is furnished each unit, and a large and able force of officers and enlisted men are stationed here as instructors. OAC has the third largest armory among colleges in the United States." (p.256) This unit was absorbed into the Engineers during the early 1930s.</p>

<p>After WWI the US Army instituted artillery training for ROTC Cadets at OAC. During the 1920s up until the beginning of WWII, a Battalion of Field Artillery was assigned with batteries (Companies A,B, and C) of 4 French WWI design 75mm Howitzers and a M1918 155mm Heavy artillery piece. These guns were used for training in the use of artillery including transport, maintenance and tactics. The "French 75mm" was the standard artillery piece of the US Army during the interwar period. Drawn by 4 horse teams with Caissons (ammunition/parts storage carts) and Limbers (used to attach horses to harnesses), the weapons were seen around campus often. The heavy artillery piece, the M1918 155mm, was moved by a caterpillar tractor (US Army type) and accompanied by trucks with materials and ammunition. These vehicles were part of a new type unit at OAC, the Motor Transport Corps. The 1922 Beaver yearbook describes the unit, "Equipment of the latest type and most complete nature is furnished each unit, and a large and able force of officers and enlisted men are stationed here as instructors. OAC has the third largest armory among colleges in the United States." (p.256)</p>

<p>Series of 20 color slides of the OSU Army ROTC Pershing Rifles Drill Team in various formations during their performance. Photos include marching drills, with rifle "tricks", and inspections of weapons and uniforms by officers. Uniforms depicted are dress coats with chrome helmets, khakis with berets and white laced boots. It is not certain if all drill units are from Oregon State, but the different uniforms and groups are probably separate platoons or companies within the Pershing Rifles Regiment in attendance.

<head>Content Description</head>
<p>The centenary of the Benton County Courthouse building was celebrated in July 1988. In planning for this commemoration, the Benton County Commissioners' office approached the Horner Museum with the proposal that an oral history of the building be captured. This project was carried out over a period of three years with Horner Museum oral historian Jennifer Lee serving as interviewer and project manager. County officials selected six individuals to be interviewed for the project - Judge Richard Mengler, Gladys (Mack) Hunt, Elroy and Edmund Gravelle, Dorothy Moore and Magdalen (Mann) Schultze - and Lee identified a seventh, Dorothy Moore's sister Louise (Moore) Forland.</p>
<p>The resulting collection consists of two sets of audiocassettes of each interview, annotated draft transcripts, correspondence, photographic slides of interviewees, signed permissions forms, and a two-volume spiral-bound monograph titled <emph render="italic">An Oral History of the Benton County Courthouse</emph>, which contains finalized transcripts of each interview.</p>

<p>The Portland Brewing Company Records includes brewing records, photographs, promotional and training materials, and ephemera.</p>
<p>The bulk of the collection is in Series 1, Brewing Records. These are arranged chronologically and by type of record. There are a few exceptions for early Hart Brewing beers, but most of these records document production at the Portland facility. However, the name of the company and the title of the forms changed several times, and that is reflected on the folder titles.</p>
<p>Series 2 through 4 are organized by company. The Portland Brewing Company materials include photographs of facilities, events, and equipment; marketing, promotional, packaging items; news clippings; building plans; and training materials. The Hart Brewing Company materials include marketing and promotional items, as well as a scrapbook with photographs, correspondence, ephemera, and news clippings. The Pyramid Breweries, Inc. materials include marketing and promotional items, news clippings, and a training manual.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The brew house and cellar logs record data about ingredients, temperatures, waste, and other measurements of the brewing process and when the beer is in storage. A Bright Tank is a tank used to hold beer in preparation for packaging; the term “bright” refers to “bright beer,” which is beer that has been rendered clear by filtration, centrifugation, fining, and/or maturation. Pilot brewing systems are the secondary systems used by breweries; typically, they produce a fraction of the beer compared to the main system and are used for experimenting with new styles or ingredients. Of note is the Pyramid Breweries recipe archive, Pyramid beer lab reports, and the Craft Brand trademark portfolio (Dundee, Magic Hat, Portland Brewing, Pyramid) and includes beer information sheets and marketing materials.</p>

<p>On the headwaters of the Sandy river on western slope of Mt. Hood;
reproduction is slowly covering the scars of a forest fire which probably
raged a half century ago, the result of some carelessly thrown match or
unguarded campfire. In recent years the Mt. Hood area has been reasonably
free of devastating flames. Mt. Hood, 11,245 feet high, was named in 1792
in honor of Viscount Hood of the English peerage. Oregon State Highway

<p>OSU Queer Studies Program Files consist of course-related and promotional materials; creative work produced by queer studies students; press coverage of the program and its faculty; and programs, handouts, and posters for both on- and off-campus events centering on LGBT or queer topics.</p>
<p>Course materials included in the collection include syllabi for classes such as Introduction to Queer Studies, Indigenous Queer &amp; Two-Spirit Studies, Queer of Color Critiques, and Trans/Gender Politics. Also included in this folder are a sampling of lesson plans and course assignments, as well as the drafted proposal for the creation of the queer studies minor at Oregon State. Promotional materials in the OSU Queer Studies Program Records consist mainly of full-color flyers, dating back to 2013, which were posted around campus to promote and encourage enrollment in various queer studies courses each term. Student-produced work included in the records consists of three unique and separate ‘zines created as part of class projects for Arts &amp; Social Justice, Queer &amp; Trans People of Color Arts &amp; Activism, and as part of a Queer Indigenous Gathering at Portland State University. Press coverage in the records includes articles from the <emph render="italic">Corvallis Gazette-Times</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Daily Barometer</emph>, and Beaver’s Digest. Of particular note in this folder is an article in the <emph render="italic">Gazette-Times </emph>which documents Dr. Qwo-Li Driskill’s work in launching the queer studies degree program. Event programs and handouts document a variety of events both on- and off-campus. Highlights of this grouping include performances and workshops by OSU queer studies faculty, and booklets for the Lavender Celebration (OSU’s LGBTQ+ graduation and award ceremony). Finally, the on-campus event posters included in this collection consist primarily of events concerning queer and trans lives, and/or featuring prominent figures in the LGBTQ+ community. A majority of these events are also explicitly considering the intersection of queer identity and race, with posters for events like “Queering el Día de los Muertos,” and flyers advertising visits to OSU by Cherríe Moraga, Deborah A. Miranda, Daniel Heath Justice, and other queer scholars, artists, and activists of color.</p>

<p>The United States War Relocation Authority Reports are comprised of four sets of mimeographed reports: Community Analysis Reports, Community Analysis Notes, a Project Analysis Series, and Quarterly and Semi-Annual Reports. Series 1 through 3 were produced by the War Relocation Authority's (WRA) Community Analysis Section (CAS). CAS was predominately staffed by sociologists and anthropologists who studied the concentration camps and their incarcerees. Topics reflect the interests of CAS and include topics such as incarceree daily life in the camps including forced participation in WRA programs, forced assimilation, and resistance to WRA activities; forced removal; and white American attitudes toward incarcerees. Also included are detailed reports on logistical issues, facilities concerns, and adverse living conditions at individual concentration camps.</p>
<p>Series 4 is comprised of bound reports created by the WRA to document its activities at a high level. These reports include budgetary data, information about concentration camp organization and operation, reports on incarcerees' daily life in the campus and population data, among other topics. Many of these reports are supplemented with maps, organizational charts, and other data visualizations.</p>
<p>The contents of Series 1, Series 2, Series 3, and Series 4 have been digitized and are available upon request.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 1 is comprised of 19 Community Analysis Reports generated by the WRA's Community Analysis Section (CAS) between 1942 and 1946. The series is comprised of reports on a broad set of issues facing the incarcerees and concentration camp administrators. Topics include cultural activities, religion, education, labor, assimilation, unrest in the centers, and reintegration (including analysis of community attitudes in California and Hood River, Oregon). The authors of the reports are largely anonymous, though the first two reports are attributed to anthropologist John F. Embree. The series also includes a six-part annotated bibliography of CAS reports.</p>
<p>Reports 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 12 include cover letters authored by Dillon S. Myer, Director of the WRA. Report 7 includes a cover letter from Leland Barrows, Acting Director. A stamp on Report 11 indicates it was circulated to the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center.</p>
<p>This series has been digitized and is available upon request.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 2 is composed of 14 "notes" published by the Community Analysis Section (CAS) between 1944 and 1945. The notes are short reports on subjects including marriage customs, healing practices, and “block” self-governance within the concentration camps. The notes series includes several reports documenting interviews with incarcerees. It also includes a series of reports on areas within the exclusion zone including Fresno County, Imperial Valley, the San Francisco Bay Area, and San Joaquin County.</p>
<p>This series has been digitized and is available upon request.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 3 is comprised of 23 Project Analysis Series reports produced by the Community Analysis Section. Topics include registration processes, security, resettlement, social structures, linguistics, and incidents of resistance in the concentration camps. Report 21 is attributed to Margaret L. Latnis. Reports 23 and 24 are attributed to G. Gordon Brown and J. Ralph McFaring, respectively. Report 7 was circulated to the Poston War Relocation Center and Report 21 was received by the Heart Mountain War Relocation Center.</p>
<p>This series also includes a memorandum to the head project director concerning the Project Analysis Series.</p>
<p>The materials in this series have been digitized and are available upon request.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 4 is comprised of 10 bound quarterly and semi-annual reports documenting the activities of the War Relocation Authority from its genesis in 1942 to its dissolution in 1946. The reports include information on the WRA's work and educational programs, camp organization and operation, activities and behavior of incarcerees, population data, property issues, unrest, and camp management, among other topics. The reports also include organizational charts, timelines, maps, graphs, and data tables detailing the work of the WRA. The first two reports in this series also include manuscript annotations.</p>

<p>The Wanda Gifford Photographs were taken by Wanda Gifford during the
late 1940s and 1950s and document the changing face of post-war Salem,
Oregon; agriculture in the Willamette Valley; and scenic views of Oregon
landmarks, Mount Baker and the northern Cascades in Washington, and
Glacier National Park in Montana. The collection also includes images of
family and friends and portrait photographs of individuals, family groups,
and special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries. Children were
one of Wanda Gifford's favorite subjects. Numerous images of snow scenes
in the Willamette Valley are included in the collection.</p>
<p>Oregon landmarks that are depicted in the collection include Mount
Hood, the Oregon Coast, Multnomah Falls, the Wallowa Mountains, and Steens
Mountain. Agricultural images include orchards, strawberry fields, dairy
herds, and other livestock. Of special note are numerous images of Mary
Kueny and the Kueny Ranch in southeastern Oregon near Steens Mountain.
Photographs of the Detroit Dam are also included.</p>
<p>The images of Salem, Oregon, include the original Marion County
Courthouse, the Oregon State Capitol and other state buildings, churches,
businesses and street scenes, schools, and homes. The courthouse
photographs include interior and exterior views and images of offices and
workers in the building.</p>
<p>The majority of items in the collection are 4x5 and 120 format film
negatives; accompanying prints are included for about a third of the
negatives. There are only a few prints without accompanying film
negatives. A small percentage of the 4x5 negatives are diacetate-based
that are degraded and in poor condition; these are housed separately. The
collection also includes 96 color transparencies, primarily 4x5 format.
Some of the color transparencies were probably made by Ben L. Gifford.</p>

<p>This stretch of flume made with Armco pipe is a link in a long
irrigation ditch which heads in 4 Mile Lake high in the Cascade Mountains
and runs down into the Valley around Medford, Oregon for irrigation

the dirt and using the earth from the ditch for a very narrow road to
travel in the maintenance of this long flume. Hundreds of fishermen also
travel this dike formed road to reach 4 Mile Lake which is amply stocked
with trout.</p>

<p>The Oregon State Highway Maps consist primarily of the official highway map produced annually by the Oregon State Highway Department from the late 1910s through early 1990s. The collection also includes road and recreation maps produced by the U.S. Forest Service in the 1920s-1930s and several commercial highway maps.</p>
<p>Highway maps produced annually by the Oregon State Highway Department are included for almost all years between 1918 and 1991; maps for 1918-1942, 1945, 1948-1977, 1979-1986, and 1991 are part of the collection. Two of the commercial highway maps also include Washington. All of the maps are at a small scale (approximately 1 inch = 15 miles) in order to depict the entire state on one sheet. The more recent maps include maps of cities and towns. Many of the maps have linen backing that obscures text on the verso. Some of the state highway maps are photocopies. Duplicate copies of some maps are part of the collection.</p>
<p>In addition to showing federal and state highways in Oregon, the maps depict municipalities; predominant land features, such as rivers, lakes, and mountain ranges; state boundaries; populations of cities; mileage between towns and junctions; and National Parks, State Parks, and wildlife refuge locations. The maps also note locations of airports, roadside rest areas, fish hatcheries, lighthouses, county seats, and winter sport areas. Many of the maps also include tourist information for travelers, crucial State Laws pertaining to automobiles and drivers, and mileage tables for calculating trip distances.</p>
<p>Official highway maps published by the State Highway Department are available online in the <extref role="text/html" show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://oregondigital.org/digcol/ormaps/index.php">Oregon Maps</extref> digital collection.</p>

<p>The Marie Norris Collection documents Norris' life and work as a Native American activist, storyteller, and historian and consists of materials created by Norris and assembled by Roger Weaver. The Collection includes two versions of the manuscript <title render="italic">Along Klamath Waters</title>, a letter, newspaper clippings, publications, and a sound recording. The manuscript is an autobiographical narrative prepared by Norris for publication as a book. Norris describes her life as a member of the Klamath community in southern Oregon and interweaves stories of Klamath culture and history throughout the narrative. A primary topic of the manuscript is the termination of the Klamath Tribe in the 1950s and the impact on the culture, economy, and lands of the Klamath peoples. Both versions were edited by Roger Weaver. The 1979 version of the manuscript is unabridged; the 1980 version is an abridged version edited for submission to a publisher. It was not published.</p>
<p>The letter was written from Norris to Roger Weaver in February 1980; Norris writes about her family, provides an update on her health, and discusses her book. The collection also includes a journal article written by Roger Weaver about Norris' interpretation of Klamath chants and a biographical sketch of Norris in <title render="italic">Notable Women in the History of Oregon</title>. The audiocassette is a sound recording, <title render="italic">On Klamath Life &amp; Singing in Klamath</title>, that includes a 1974 interview between Roger Weaver and Marie Norris. The sound recording has been digitized and is available in two parts: <extref role="text/html" show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oa8g2tuc/2947392">Part 1</extref> (about 40 minutes) and <extref role="text/html" show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_jmtxgf8h/2947392">Part 2</extref> (about 45 minutes).</p>

<p>The Staff Newsletter consists of the weekly publication for Oregon State University faculty and staff written, edited, and produced by News and Communications Services (and previously the Department of Information).  The newsletter was published weekly during the academic year resulting in about 35 issues per year.   Beginning in 1993, a summer edition was published monthly.</p>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Staff Newsletter</emph> launched in September 1961 and the first issue welcomed new Oregon State University President James Jensen.  The title was changed to <emph render="italic">OSU This Week</emph> in 1987.   In 1994, the publication format changed to tabloid-size printed on newsprint.  In 2008, <emph render="italic">OSU This Week</emph> ceased publication and <emph render="italic">LIFE@OSU</emph>, which featured lengthier stories on the people and programs of Oregon State, was produced in print twice per month with an accompanying website<emph render="italic">.  LIFE@OSU</emph> ceased publication with the August 13, 2009 issue.</p>
<p>While the content and format of the Staff Newsletter evolved during its nearly 50-year run, the function remained constant – to provide news and announcements to all employees of Oregon State University.  To that end, the newsletter included announcements and news of campus-wide interest; reports regarding budgets, new academic programs, gifts and grants received, and other campus programs and activities; a calendar of campus events; and announcements of new administrators and faculty.  Information about campus buildings and infrastructure, including new construction and major remodels was included.  Notices of retirements, deaths, honors and appointments were often published.  With time, more feature stories about Oregon State faculty and staff were published.  The annual statewide food drive (in February) and charitable fund drive (in November-December) are prominent in the newsletter at those times of the year.</p>
<p>The Faculty Senate Minutes were distributed as an appendix to the Staff Newsletter in the 1960s and 1970s and are included in this collection for the 1969-1970 through 1973-1974 academic years.</p>

<p>The Benjamin B. Stout Papers consist of materials created and assembled
by Stout in the course of his work as a forestry researcher, university
professor and administrator, writer, and advisor and advocate on natural
resources policy. The Papers include articles, essays, and other
publications; correspondence; presentations and speeches; research data;
and reference materials. Stout's publications and presentations reflect a
diversity of topics, including forest monitoring programs, declines in
pine growth, forest growth simulation, and height-diameter studies of
trees as a sign of productivity. Correspondents represented in the
collection include fellow academics, including Hugh Raup; foresters;
governmental agencies; natural resource organizations; and state and
federal legislators including Oregon State Representative Liz Van Leeuwen,
Congressmen Mike Kopetski and Peter De Fazio, and Senators Ron Wyden and
Gordon Smith. The collection also includes materials documenting Stout's
work for the National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream
Improvement such as research publications, conference and workshop
presentations, correspondence with academic colleagues.</p>
<p>The reference materials comprise about a third of the collection and
include reports, publications, newspaper clippings, maps, and articles
documenting various forestry, ecology, and natural resource management
topics. In addition to the controversial listing of the northern spotted
owl and marbled murrelet as protected endangered species in Oregon, the

<p>The Agricultural Experiment Station Special Reports consist of more than 1100 reports published from 1954 to 2012.  The reports address a wide variety of agricultural topics studied by Agricultural Experiment Station and Extension Service researchers.  The bulk of the reports document activities of the Experiment Station; however, Extension Service programs are also reflected in the reports and the Extension Service published some of the reports solely or in collaboration with the Experiment Station.  Beginning in the 1970s, the series includes some reports prepared by the Sea Grant College Program and the Western Rural Development Center.</p>
<p>The Special Reports are available online in <extref show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/3905" role="text/html">ScholarsArchive@OSU</extref>, where keyword searching can be performed on the reports.</p>
<p>For numbers 1 through 133, the publications were referred to as “Miscellaneous Papers”; the title of the series changed to Special Reports in the early 1960s.  Through the early 1970s, some numbers in the series were assigned to research papers or reports published in journals or conference proceedings.  Some, but not all of these, are included in this collection.</p>
<p>Annual research reports from branch experiment stations – Malheur, Columbia Basin, Eastern Oregon, Klamath Basin, and North Willamette – comprise a substantial quantity of the Special Reports.  Annual reports of the international Winter X Spring Wheat Screening Nursery for 1977-1978 through 1997-1998 were issued as Special Reports, as well as annual reports on beef cattle nutrition and management and reports of the annual field days focused on beef, sheep and wool, and swine.  Annual reports of recommended grain varieties for winter (1986-2003) and spring (1998-2003) are also available.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1990s, the Special Reports include user guides and manuals for computer programs.  Agricultural estimates for Oregon counties and the state were issued annually from 1986 to 2011.</p>
<p>The Special Reports address a broad scope of topics pertaining to agriculture in Oregon and the impact of agriculture on the Oregon economy; rangeland management, grazing, soils, water resources and irrigation, water quality, riparian areas,  and watershed management; land use planning and planning for recreation and tourism in the state, beginning in the early 1970s; climatological data; ecological provinces of Oregon; pesticide use; salmon restoration;  alternatives to field burning; wine grape research; and mink research.</p>
<p>The Special Reports ceased publication in 2012.</p>

<p>The Memorial Union Campaign Records document efforts to fund construction of the Oregon Agricultural College Memorial Union through a multi-year pledge drive. The vast majority of the materials in this collection reflect the Memorial Union's attempts to collect on pledges generated during the campaign. Much of the collection is comprised of correspondence between representatives of the Memorial Union, attorneys employed by the Memorial Union, various financial institutions, and pledging individuals who detail the financial hardships created by the pledge debts, especially following the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p>
<p>The collection also includes pledge cards, ledger cards, and other documents representing the financial successes and failures of the campaign. The ledger cards record individual pledges, itemized debits to each pledge account, and in some cases, extenuating circumstances surrounding nonpayment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the collection includes two scrapbooks, photographs, newspaper clippings, mailers, promotional materials, and other ephemera documenting the campaign from 1924-1928.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 1 is comprised of correspondence to and from individuals with Memorial Union pledges. The series includes correspondence from representatives of the Memorial Union (predominately the Manager, Edward C. Allworth), firms contracted by the Memorial Union to collect on outstanding debts, and individuals with pledges to the Memorial Union. The series includes "Paid in Full" and "Unpaid" accounts, as identified and organized by Memorial Union personnel. While the majority of the correspondence documents the efforts of the Memorial Union to collect on outstanding pledges, some correspondence does acknowledge full payment of pledges.</p>
<p>Many of the letters in this series are from individuals giving reasons for non-payment or asking to be excused from their debt to the Memorial Union. Many detail personal and financial hardships including unemployment, illness, and family obligations. As one individual noted, "Times were pretty tough for those of us just getting out of college in 1929 which didn’t help matters any of course... $14.00 is still $14.00 and John still has to have new shoes." Others express frustration or anger, arguing that the Memorial Union had no authority to demand payment, or request to have their pledges cancelled due to misgivings about the College, the Memorial Union organization, or the building itself. Another individual with an unpaid pledge claimed, "That pledge is not binding to me since the plans were altered since that pledge was made and the auditorium--which was the only worthwhile feature of the building--was taken out."</p>
<p>The correspondence in this series appears in approximately alphabetical order by last name assigned to the pledge account, as organized by Memorial Union personnel.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 2 is comprised of correspondence and documents describing legal action taken by the Memorial Union against individuals with oustanding pledge balances. Files include correspondence with pledging individuals, contracted law firms, and various legal bodies including courts and law enforcement offices. Account cards and court documents are also present. A portion of these materials are organized by the law office or attorney's name. The remainder of the series is organized alphabetically by the defendant's last name.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 3 is comprised of records documenting funds generated by the Memorial Union campaign. The series includes pledge cards, which took the form of legally binding promissory notes and include basic information about the pledging individual and the terms of the pledge; ledger cards which document the payment history of each pledge, basic information about the pledging individual, and special circumstances or changes to the pledge's status; and aggregate financial records including a cash journal, a ledger, and three undated lists with names, addresses, and pledge amounts for pledging individuals.</p>
<p>The pledge and ledger cards are arranged approximately alphabetically by the pledging individual's last name and the status of the pledge. Status assigned to pledges, repetition in alphabetical ordering, and inconsistent organization are reflective of the original order imposed by Memorial Union personnel.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Series 4 is comprised of two scrapbooks and several files documenting the genesis and progress of the Memorial Union Campaign. The scrapbooks contain materials from the 1924-1925 and 1925-1926 legs of the campaign and include promotional materials, campaign documents, newsclippings, and photographs. The series also includes newspaper clippings reporting on the 1928 drive; "Bulletins of Progress" issued by the Memorial Union chronicling the construction of the building; copies of the Memorial Union Constitution; and other ephemera including promotional mailers, pledge cards, and membership cards.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This scrapbook includes the campaign schedule; packets for pledge drive workers including pledge cards, envelopes, workers' agreements, and instructions; pamphlets, brochures, and flyers; form letters sent to potential donors; and stationary.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>This scrapbook includes 9 photographs of the Memorial Union site and personnel; pledge cards; promotional flyers and event announcements; pages from the <emph render="italic">OAC Alumnus</emph>; and numerous clippings from newspapers throughout the Pacific Northwest. The newsclippings document the progress of the campaign throughout 1925 and 1926, with emphasis on the success of the funding drives.</p>

<p>The Center for the Humanities Records document the creation and activities of the Center itself, and also tell the story of the entity that preceded the Center at Oregon State University, the Humanities Development Program.</p>
<p>The collection includes, in Series I, records describing the formation, operation and assessment of the Humanities Development Program, which was first conceptualized in 1975 and came into being following OSU's receipt of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant in 1977. Events sponsored or co-sponsored by the program, including lecture series, film screenings and stage performances, have been arranged into Series II. The primary thrust of the NEH grant that funded the Humanities Development Program was the creation of four interdisciplinary study certificate programs - two in Community Studies, one in Northwest Studies and another in Marine and Maritime Studies - and records relating to these initiatives are available in Series III.</p>
<p>Series IV is devoted to the second NEH grant, a challenge grant funded in 1984, that led to the creation and endowment of the OSU Center for the Humanities. The Center's operations are described in Series V and include records of the Center's Program Advisory Board, Center newsletters, annual reports, materials relating to budget and facilities, newspaper clippings and a small collection of photographs. The Center's correspondence - mostly written by Peter Copek - with a wide array of individuals and organizations is available in Series VI. Series VII focuses on events sponsored or co-sponsored by the Center, including music festivals, colloquia and a high-profile lecture series celebrating the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution in 1987. The successful proposals and subsequent tenures of various Center fellows, both internal and external, have been arranged into Series VIII. Finally, Series IX lends detailed insight into the International Film Series, a Center-supported initiative which brought foreign and independent cinema to the OSU campus every weekend during the term for more than twenty years.</p>

contains programs of drama productions, musical and literary events, teachers
institutes, Corvallis College commencements (1881 &amp; 1882), and meetings of
organizations. Most are from Corvallis and Portland and date from 1878 to

<p>Daniel Allen was born in Muldoon, Texas in 1899. His railroad experience began in 1915 as a “sniper” caring for a stretch of railroad track in one area. The crew was racially mixed. Allen recalls working as cotton harvesters with his family until they ran out of money in Lubbock, Texas. He then worked as a cement worker for a contractor and went on strike with six or seven other workers to demand a raise. Soon after he got a job as a chair car porter on the Santa Fe railroad but was fired when the contractor he had worked took revenge by calling the railroad about him. Allen then worked at the Giles Lake shipyard until he was hired by the Union Pacific in 1945. The pay was so low that his sons still working at the shipyard helped to pay his bills. He retired in 1967. Allen also describes racism in Portland Oregon and the brotherhood he felt with his railroad co-workers.</p>

<p>James Brooks was originally born James Thompson in Mississippi. He moved to Portland in 1929 where his uncle, Mr. Green, was a Pullman porter. Brooks discusses the poverty at the time which made racial differences less apparent, as many white residents in the area had no jobs at all. Brooks talks about the white and black communities in Portland co-existing because the black community was not an economic or social threat to the white community. At the time, Brooks says the black population in the entire state of Oregon was only between one or two thousand persons, mostly concentrated in Portland. Brooks talks about his work as a chair car porter and the hierarchy of positions on the train, with waiters at the top and porters at the bottom. Brooks compares this hierarchy to the hierarchy of slavery where house slaves were viewed as above others, and discusses how this hierarchy continued into post-slavery life. Brooks also explains why porters suffered more abuse from passengers than waiters did, and the lack of recourse for railroad workers. Brooks describes an underground system of mentors and family-like bonds among railroad workers, even with the hierarchy.</p>
