      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>The Fish, Game and Fur Animal Management Department was created in 1935
under the jurisdiction of the School of Agriculture. Roland E. Dimick was
the first department chair, a position he held until 1963. The department
operated the OSC Experimental Fur Farm from 1937 to 1957 and also
established field stations on Protection and Eliza Islands in Puget Sound
and a fisheries lab at Yaquina, Oregon. The department's name was changed
to Fish and Game Management in 1936, and in 1964 was renamed Fisheries and
Wildlife. Thomas G. Scott was department chair from 1963 to 1972.</p>
      <p>The Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit was established in 1935
as a cooperative venture between the U.S. Biological Survey, the American
Wildlife Institute, the Oregon State Game Commission, and Oregon State
College. Arthur Einarson, U.S. Biological Survey research biologist,
served as Unit Leader from 1935 to 1957, directing its graduate training
and research programs. The unit was discontinued in 1961.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The Fisheries and Wildlife Department Photographs consist of images
taken or assembled by the department that document students and faculty as
well as the teaching and research programs in fisheries and wildlife. The
bulk of the photographs were separated from the Fisheries and Wildlife
Department Records (RG 190) and include photographs of big game field
trips conducted by the department; a fish pond field day in Jefferson
County in 1968; and several Oregon Cooperative Wildife Research Unit
projects.</p>
      <p>The big game field trip photographs are primarily group photographs of
the students and faculty that participated in the annual trips; they also
depict locations visited during the trips as well as guest leaders. The
fish pond field day was sponsored by the Extension Service for a group of
third graders at the Roy Stevenson farm in Jefferson County; the students
may include Native American children from Warm Springs.</p>
      <p>The Oregon Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit photographs depict
projects pertaining to waterfowl, pheasants, duck and geese hunting, and
antelope.</p>
      <p>The collection also includes images of Fisheries and Wildlife alumnus
Don Carr receiving the Distinguished Service Cross in 1971; Thomas G.
Scott, department chair, presenting an award for best paper at the Oregon
Wildlife Society meeting to Eleanor Horvitz; and a field trip to the
Murderer's Creek deer range.</p>
      <p>The collection consists predominantly of b/w prints and negatives;
there are a few color prints included.</p>
