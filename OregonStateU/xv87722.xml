      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>The pre-history of Oregon State University's Center for the Humanities can be traced to the Humanities Grant Study Committee, a collection of fifteen department chairs and faculty representatives from OSU's departments of Art, English, History, Modern Languages, Music, Philosophy, and Religious Studies, as well as the College of Liberal Arts Dean's Office.  Led by faculty members Gordon Gilkey and Richard Astro, the study committee was charged with evaluating the feasibility of major changes to the humanities curriculum at Oregon State and exploring the possibility of applying for funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities that might facilitate changes of this sort.</p>
      <p>The product of this group's work was a successful NEH Development Grant proposal that made a significant impact on the university's intellectual culture. The 1977 grant, titled "An Exploration of Community," steered just under $1,000,000 in federal money to the university for use in developing curricula in four areas: Northwest Studies; Marine and Maritime Studies; Community Studies; and Studies in Science, Technology, and Values.  Administered by the newly created Humanities Development Program, these interdisciplinary certificate programs were meant to both broadly strengthen OSU's humanities offerings and to link study in the humanities to courses already extant in the university's science and professional schools.</p>
      <p>The Humanities Development Program was run from the outset by Peter Copek, a faculty member in English, and it succeeded in filling a void at OSU. During the program's six year lifespan, over fifty faculty members participated in the development effort, creating sixty-five courses in what became three program areas. (The program's "Community Studies" and "Science, Technology and Values" offerings were reorganized as "Twentieth Century Studies.")</p>
      <p>The Humanities Development Program contributed to the vigor of campus life in other ways, in part through its use of NEH funds and other support from organizations including the Oregon Humanities Committee to sponsor a wide array of campus events.  Seminars, musical performances and film screenings were common sources of outreach for the program, which also supported and helped to organize at least four conferences.  Perhaps most notably, Copek, who maintained a scholarly interest in film studies, co-founded the International Film Series, which screened independent and foreign films every weekend during the academic year for over twenty years, beginning in 1977.</p>
      <p>The OSU Center for the Humanities was created as a result of a second NEH grant, this time a challenge grant which, in 1984, awarded $700,000 to the university following its own success in raising an additional $1.4 million from private donors.  The $2.1 million total was used to endow the Center which, as with the Humanities Development Program before, was run by Peter Copek.  In addition to continued offerings within the certificate programs, the new center also unveiled a fellowship program which provided stipends for both OSU faculty and "external fellows" to conduct research in the humanities, usually for one term. For external fellows, the funds provided by the Center supported travel, lodging and office space. Similarly, the Center lessened the load on internal OSU fellows by paying others to teach the courses to which they were normally assigned.  The Center likewise continued to organize and support various events on campus, including multiple music festivals, a lecture series (keynoted by Gore Vidal) marking the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, and a symposium on the military-industrial complex.</p>
      <p>In its early years, Center for the Humanities operations were run out of an office located in Moreland Hall.  That changed in June 1989 when the Center moved into what would become its permanent home, a former sorority house on Jefferson Avenue.  At the time of its formal purchase by the university in 1993, the facility was christened the Autzen House in honor of the Autzen Foundation of Portland, which provided major funding for the acquisition of the space.</p>
      <p>The Center enjoyed stability and moderate growth throughout the 1990s, but change came suddenly in June 2001, when Peter Copek died at the age of fifty-six from a heart attack that struck in the aftermath of gall bladder surgery.  English professor David Robinson was subsequently named director of the Center. Under Robinson's leadership, the OSU Center for the Humanities has continued to sponsor academic fellowships and to support campus and community offerings, including two annual events - The Magic Barrel Reading to Fight Hunger and The OSU Holocaust Memorial Program.  The certificate programs that emerged from the original 1977 NEH grant are no longer offered at OSU; removal of the last of them, Twentieth Century Studies, was initiated in 2005.</p>

      <p>The Center for the Humanities Records document the creation and activities of the Center itself, and also tell the story of the entity that preceded the Center at Oregon State University, the Humanities Development Program.</p>
      <p>The collection includes, in Series I, records describing the formation, operation and assessment of the Humanities Development Program, which was first conceptualized in 1975 and came into being following OSU's receipt of a National Endowment for the Humanities grant in 1977.  Events sponsored or co-sponsored by the program, including lecture series, film screenings and stage performances, have been arranged into Series II.  The primary thrust of the NEH grant that funded the Humanities Development Program was the creation of four interdisciplinary study certificate programs - two in Community Studies, one in Northwest Studies and another in Marine and Maritime Studies - and records relating to these initiatives are available in Series III.</p>
      <p>Series IV is devoted to the second NEH grant, a challenge grant funded in 1984, that led to the creation and endowment of the OSU Center for the Humanities.  The Center's operations are described in Series V and include records of the Center's Program Advisory Board, Center newsletters, annual reports, materials relating to budget and facilities, newspaper clippings and a small collection of photographs.  The Center's correspondence - mostly written by Peter Copek - with a wide array of individuals and organizations is available in Series VI.  Series VII focuses on events sponsored or co-sponsored by the Center, including music festivals, colloquia and a high-profile lecture series celebrating the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution in 1987.  The successful proposals and subsequent tenures of various Center fellows, both internal and external, have been arranged into Series VIII. Finally, Series IX lends detailed insight into the International Film Series, a Center-supported initiative which brought foreign and independent cinema to the OSU campus every weekend during the term for more than twenty years.</p>

          <p>Items tracing the creation, evolution and operations of the Humanities Development Program's academic certificate programs have been arranged into Series III.  The 1977 grant that led to the implementation of the Humanities Development Program specified that four interdisciplinary certificate programs be added to OSU's humanities offerings.  Two of these programs - "Community as People, Place and Idea" and "Science, Technology and Community" - were later merged together under the umbrella of Twentieth Century Studies.</p>

          <p>Documentation of both the Center's on-going planning processes and regular operations is held in Series V. Of particular note are records pertaining to the Center's Program Advisory Committee, a group of OSU faculty, mostly from the College of Liberal Arts, who served two-year terms and who provided input on a number of issues related to the Center, including selection of both internal and external fellows. The series also holds materials related to the Center's budget and facilities, as well as annual reports, newsletters and newspaper clippings that provide detailed insight into the Center's activities over time. Where appropriate, date ranges reflect activities conducted over the course of a given academic year.</p>

            <p>Initiated by the Humanities Development Program, the Humanities Film Collection consisted of films either purchased or leased by the Center for Humanities and made available to OSU faculty for use in the classroom.  A catalog of this collection was compiled by the Center for the Humanities and its films were organized into the following categories: Early Comedy, Silent Drama, The Thirties, Post-War Cinema, International New Waves, Experimental Film and Animation, and Documentaries.  The collection's documentaries were further classified as: General, World War II, Religion, Third World, Americana, and Marine and Maritime.</p>

          <p>Series VI holds materials that document the Center's communications with fellowship applicants, invited speakers, internal stakeholders, and other humanities centers around the country.  The series' General Correspondence files primarily focus on daily operations at the center. While the files in the series are dominated by correspondence, they also hold grant proposals made by other institutions/humanities centers and proposals made to funding organizations by the Center, as well as an array of newsletters, articles, curricula vitae, brochures, event posters and assorted background materials.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1977 by Peter Copek and fellow English professor Anne Taylor, the International Film Series screened independent and foreign films every weekend during the term for over twenty years. Largely through Copek, the film series was administered by the Humanities Development Program and the Center for the Humanities for the duration of its existence.  Series IX contains detailed documentation of the film series' operation, including the selection and screening of specific films, the proceeds (and deficits) accrued by the screenings, and the series' advertisement and impact on campus.  Where appropriate, date ranges reflect activities conducted over the course of a given academic year.</p>
