      <p>The Claud L. Booth Photograph Album was assembled by Booth to document his student years at Oregon Agricultural College (OAC), primarily from 1919 to 1924.  The images depict student activities, sports teams and events, athletes, and coaches.  Several photographs of the rook-sophomore tug-of-war are part of the album as well as an image of yell leaders and the band marching in downtown Corvallis. About half of the album's images depict sports at Oregon Agricultural College and include photographs of individual athletes and coaches, teams, and athletic events.  Images for baseball, basketball, football, soccer, track, and wrestling are included, with baseball and basketball comprising the majority.  Of special note are a team photograph of the 1919 OAC soccer team as well as photographs of A.T. (Slats) Gill as a basketball player; W.A. Kearns, Director of Athletics; and baseball coach, Ralph Coleman. Booth is depicted in photographs of the 1920 freshman baseball team and the 1921 baseball team as well as the 1919 soccer team.  Group photographs of students in the Class of 1923 as freshmen and of the Class of 1923 at its 50th reunion in 1973 are part of the collection;  Booth is included in both of these images.</p>
      <p>The album includes snapshots of places that Booth visited outside of Oregon, including New Orleans, El Paso, Tucson, Mount Shasta, and Orr's Lake.  The collection also includes a ribbon for the OAC vs Washington State College football game on November 11, 1921 and a dance card for the Varsity O winter formal in 1927.  Photographs that were not attached to the album pages have been placed in a separate folder housed with the album.</p>
