                                       <p>Established in 1972, the original nine members of the Chicano Cultural Center (CCC) met weekly in the basement of Milam Hall. At the end of 1976, the Chicano Cultural Advisory Committee requested that the university provide housing for the Center. The CCC was first given the house at 2475 Orchard Street and later the small house at 1969 SW “A” Street, which was to become the permanent Chicano Cultural Center. On April 13, 1977, OSU President Dr. Robert MacVicar cut the ribbon to symbolically open the new Center to the public. The center was renamed the Hispanic Cultural Center in the mid-1980s, but the final name change came in 1996 to honor Mexican farm worker activist César Chávez. The Centro Cultural César Chávez (4Cs) was established to provide a location and facility for programming various academic, cultural, recreational, and social events related to the Chicano/Latino/Hispanic culture and heritage. The 4Cs is managed by the office of Diversity Development, a unit of Intercultural Student Services. On April 7, 2014, the new Centro Cultural César Chávez opened its doors to the public. Located at 691 S.W. 26th St, the new building was one of four new cultural centers being built on campus to replace aging structures. The 3,565 square-foot building cost $2,521,051 and was designed by Seattle-based architects Jones &amp; Jones. The new building includes a large gathering hall, multiple office and study spaces and a large kitchen for hosting social events.</p>

                  <p>Series 6 consists of brochures, flyers, newsletters, and newspaper clippings published by or about the Centro Cultural César Chávez. Many of the flyers are of events hosted by the 4Cs or one of the cultural centers on campus; there are also Memorial Union and University events. Flyers are sorted by year; those without dates are at the front followed by oldest to most recent. Most of the brochures have information on the 4Cs such as its purpose, history, mission statement, and contact information. Also included are a dozen or so newsletters published by the 4Cs, these range from 1989 to 2010. The first of the newsletters was published when the 4Cs was still referred to as the Hispanic Cultural Center. Across the years the newsletter changed names from El Obrero to El Mensajero and finally kept as Newsletter. The newsletters have information of interest to the Latino/a community in Corvallis and especially Latino/a students attending Oregon State University. There are a number of newspaper clippings that were collected by the 4Cs over the years, mostly from OSU’s The Barometer. Some of the articles focus on issues that impact the Latino/a community, others mention events hosted by the 4Cs, and some deal specifically with the Centro.</p>
