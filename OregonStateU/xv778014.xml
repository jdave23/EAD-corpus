                        <p>Milton Oscar Stemmler was born in 1871 in Sebastian County, Arkansas to parents Jacob Stemmler and Sarah Howeth. In 1881, Stemmler and his family moved to Oregon, eventually settling on a ranch in Coos County. He began attending Oregon Agricultural College in 1892, working his way through college as a teacher, before graduating with a degree in Agriculture in 1895. While attending OAC, he also participated on the college football team during the 1894/1895 season.</p>
                        <p>After graduating from OAC, Stemmler taught for a year in Merced, California before moving out to St. Louis, Missouri to study medicine at Marion-Sims Medical College. He graduated from Marion-Sims Medical College in 1900 and practiced general medicine in St. Louis for a year before returning to the Pacific Northwest, moving to Spokane, Washington. In January of 1904, he married Mary Marie Barton, and the two of them eventually moved back to Coos County, Oregon. Stemmler resided in Coos County, Oregon with his wife and four children until passing away in December of 1916 from typhoid fever.</p>
