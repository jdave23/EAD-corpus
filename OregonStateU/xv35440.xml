      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>Courses in Military Science and Tactics were first taught at Oregon
                State in 1872. In 1873 Captain Benjamin D. Boswell was appointed Professor
                of Military Science and Tactics (1873-1876), the first U.S. Army officer
                on active duty to hold such a position in any land grant college in the
                West. The first cadet uniforms, worn at all times by male students, were
                gray with caps of the Civil War type. The more familiar blue uniforms were
                adopted in 1893.</p>
      <p>ROTC at Oregon State University is made up of the Departments of
                Military Science, Naval Science, and Air Force Studies. In 1917, the
                Department of Military Sciences became responsible for all military
                training under the National Defense Act of 1916. The act expanded and
                standardized the training of Army Officers by colleges and universities
                and established the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). During World
                War II, OSU became known as the "West Point of the West" for commissioning
                more officers than any other non-military academy in the nation. At the
                end of World War II, the Secretary of the Navy commissioned the Department
                of Naval Science (ROTC) on this campus to provide the training of both
                Navy and Marine Corps officers. On July 1, 1949, the U.S. Air Force
                activated an AFROTC unit that is now called the Department of Air Force
                Studies. As of 1999, OSU is one of only 48 colleges and universities that
                offers education for all three military departments.</p>
      <p>Originally, two years of military science and tactics were required of
                all able-bodied male students, but since 1962, ROTC has been voluntary.
                Since 1965, two-year programs have been available for students who have
                finished two years of college but have not taken ROTC previously.</p>

      <p>The Oregon State University Military Photographs Collection contains images of Oregon State military science and tactics cadets and officers from its beginning in 1873 through the 1960s.  Many photographs are prints of images found in Oregon State publications such as the <title render="italic">Beaver</title> yearbook, <title render="italic">Oregon Stater</title> alumni magazine and the <title render="italic">Barometer</title> campus newspaper.  The development of cadet uniforms and training can be seen throughout the collection.  Images include views of campus buildings and locations during various eras.  The collection contains prints and original negatives, glass negatives/positives (some hand colored), and instructional lantern slides of World War I vintage.</p>
      <p>Subject matter features cadet formations on parade fields during military inspection day
                events, artillery, cavalry and engineering training scenes and casual snapshots. The 
                collection includes a large group of glass negatives of early Oregon Agricultural College
                cadet corps circa 1870 through 1918. A glass lantern slide collection of instructional 
                materials for Military Tactics courses includes images from World War One, with a focus on 
                combat engineers.  Numerous images of Ulysses Grant McAlexander  are included in the collection. After WWI, the Oregon Agricultural College ROTC program expanded to include
                the new mechanized units developed in the Great War.  Photographs from this period show the new
                cadet artillery batteries equipped with surplus US Army equipment.  The annual inspection of 
                cadets by dignitaries was a popular event during the college
                year and is well documented in the collection.  Dignitaries that are depicted include Oregon Governors Charles Martin
                and Charles Sprague and Oregon State Presidents William Jasper Kerr, George Peavy, and A.L. Strand.  The US Army ROTC Pershing Rifles are well represented with photographs of drill team competitions and awards during the 1960s.  Stock U.S. Military photographs and college photographs from all eras are found in the series.</p>

              <p>Large glass negative of the much used "OAC formation of cadets". Used first in the 1910-1911 OAC Catalog, the photo also shows up in the 1910 Orange Yearbook.  The uniforms and instruments of the OAC band are in excellent detail. Houses and streets are in clear focus, showing fence lines and outhouses.</p>

Standard forage caps are worn, blue uniforms with large chevrons and striped pants. Medical corps training was part of the Military curriculum during this period, with a dedicated medical unit training coming after the turn of the century. Building in background is undetermined, but style of stonework can be used for identification. Possibly could be the 1902 Agriculture Hall facade.</p>

              <p> Negative version of print in collection P002:383. OAC Cadet "Battalion" in box formation on parade field with rifles, dated May 1895. The caption on the most original of the prints states, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 Strut Column". The box formation shown can be dated back to Napoleonic Tactics (adaptation of ancient warfare formations). Still practiced in the late 19th to early 20th century infantry training. Uniforms are of the pattern 1892 sack coats with a variety of Forage Caps shown in the group. Most of the cadets are wearing the 1895 Forage cap, which was patterned after the contemporary caps worn by firemen and train conductors, and did not find favor with the troops. There are still a few cadets with the Civil War era looking Forage Cap pattern 1872. Rifles issued to the cadets were most probably the M1884 Rifle, .45 Caliber with the Buffington Rear Sight. Buildings in the background are notable, showing the carriage house and Mechanical Hall with the railroad spur (Corvallis and Eastern RR) still in place.</p>

              <p>Cadet formation at attention for inspection, circa 1895. Uniforms include forage caps of civil war style, large chevron stripes on sleeves. Cadets have older style Springfield Armory rifles with fixed bayonets. Of significant note with this image is the detail of Administration Building (now Benton Hall). Excellent detail of old east steps, no hands on clock and roof details. Clock tower has wrought iron(?) details on peak, possible lightning rod is visible. Further study of the details is warranted.</p>

            <p>Military draft horses used to pull heavy wagons in review by cadets and officers. Good detail of the carriage house in background. Horses are dressed out with braided tails and mains for inspection. Cadet uniforms reflect brimmed field caps and high boots of the pre-WWI era. Photo is probably circa 1910. The artillery unit was not formed on OAC Campus until after WWI, but the college was issued muzzle loading field pieces for training purposes. Very clear and detailed focus on this vintage photograph.</p>

Standard uniforms with high collars and field caps. High boots with early canvas puttees. Formation is at attention with officer in front with ceremonial sword. Dating between 1901-1914 puts this photo probably in the early 1910s based on uniforms. These formation photos of the units appear in the Beaver Yearbooks of the period, postcard probably produced from stock OAC photograph.</p>

Cadets are issued the Pre Spanish American War standard uniform from 1895 in dark blue with standard Forage Cap.

Also on bottom Right hand corner; "Eva Bailey - now Mrs. Jess Wiley with school bag, on way to school". Men do not have uniforms at this time, probably holding Civil War era long M1863 rifled muskets, surplus from the US Military. The building in the background is the original building that would become OAC. The college was originally located in downtown Corvallis on the block where City Hall and the Corvallis Moose Lodge are currently located. The first college building was a structure built in 1858 and added onto in 1876.</p>

            <p> OAC Cadet "Battalion" in box formation on parade field with rifles, dated May 1895. The caption on the most original of the prints states, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 Strut Column". The box formation shown can be dated back to Napoleonic Tactics (adaptation of ancient warfare formations). Still practiced in the late 19th to early 20th century infantry training. Uniforms are of the pattern 1892 sack coats with a variety of Forage Caps shown in the group. Most of the cadets are wearing the 1895 Forage cap, with a few cadets wearing the Civil War era Forage Cap pattern 1872. Rifles issued to the cadets were most probably the M1884 Rifle, .45 Caliber with the Buffington Rear Sight. Buildings in the background are notable, showing the carriage house and Mechanical Hall with the railroad spur (Corvallis and Eastern RR) still in place.</p>

            <p>Mounted Print, titled, "OAC Cadet Battalion - May 1895 - Close Order Column of Companies". The uniforms are consistent with the 1890 period, showing the Forage Caps and sack coat patterns in blue. Formation of cadets with the Cadet Band on parade field appears to be an inspection event, with seated observers under tree in background. The print is stamped on reverse with "Ore. State University Archives". There is a handwritten note included in sleeve stating "Found in (with title page) 1893-4 Catalog". This would put the dating of this photograph in question based on the caption written on the front. The period uniforms and Benton Hall configuration are consistent with a circa date of 1895.</p>

Previous description states "Booklet OAC Cadets 1908-09" this dating is probably incorrect. This photo is posed at the base of Benton Hall (then Administration Bldg) steps and the facade is still in original brick. Renovations in 1899 covered brick with stucco. Photo is probably dated circa 1895. Uniforms are vintage with brimmed caps with OAC badge. Officer's uniform shows rank on shoulderboads.</p>

            <p>Formation of OAC Cadets wearing the Pre 1893 Grey uniforms with civil war era forage caps. The uniforms of this period were of a Civil War vintage style, Grey in color based on the allegiance of the College President. Unknown date of photograph, mid 1880s is a good possibility based on the string of boxcars in background with the curved logo of the Corvallis and Eastern Railroad. Significant early photograph of OAC Cadet Corps.</p>

            <p>Print mounted on canvas. Period photograph of OAC's Spanish American War veterans, posed group of 34 men in period uniforms, c.1900. The June 1900 Barometer states that "At the outbreak of the late Spanish War, 48 of the cadets and graduates of the college shouldered the rifle to fight for the flag, and the then Commandant, Capt. Woodbridge Geary, and three of the students gave up their lives on their country's altar". Publication of the photograph is included in the Military section of the June 1900 Barometer. The June issues acted as sort of a yearbook prior to the beginning of "the Orange". Photograph is in poor condition, as transferred from the Horning Museum Collection in August 1996, with damage to the right side. Soldiers are all in period field uniforms, various unit badges are seen on the standard campaign hats. Description of item includes one identification of Harvey L. McAlister ("Pap Hayseed"). Photo does appear to be taken here in the United States, possibly Oregon, ivy and background vegetation does not appear to be tropical. Significant OAC artifact.</p>

Model B, built by the Four Wheel Drive Co. of Clintonville, Wisconsin, this was a four-wheel drive vehicle. Rated as a 3-tonner, the F. W.D. had a Wisconsin four-cylinder petrol engine with a three-speed gearbox and a two¬speed transfer gearbox. There was a shaft drive to each axle. On roads the F.W.D. was driven as a normal rear-wheel drive vehicle, but for off road driving an additional gear lever was provided on the chassis side which controlled the low gears and connected up the drive to the front axle. Slide is marked: R.S.G. no.14" The RSG indicates Railroad Standard Gauge. .</p>

            <p> possibly contemporary reprint of original negative (accompanying photo) by the Department of Information, Oregon State University (Stamped on reverse) Original photograph described as circa 1919, this is related to the photograph of the address by dignitaries of OAC "Inaugural Exercises, Oct. 1, 1918. The first four rows of crowd are cadets, with civilian onlookers in rear. Officer in Bandstand addressing crowd is unidentified. The cadets uniforms reflect the WWI era with some exceptions that can be attributed to cadet corps being issued older uniform stock. The Campaign Hats are of correct vintage, but the canvas puttees are of older style. Rifles in the group are the older design, Model 1896 .30 Caliber Krag-Jorgensen Rifles of Spanish American War vintage. The cadets were probably issued these supplies from existing US Army stockpiles and they may or may not be upgraded in the field.</p>
            <p>Notes on reverse of photograph are concerning the buildings in the background, "Note: Dairy (Soc. Sc.), 2 white frame building the larger of which should be part of Alpha hall; daeke(?) frame house (SPE)"</p>

            <p>Contemporary reprint of an early field radio training session with OAC Cadets. Very clear and detailed photo showing the early style wireless radio with cadets and training NCO. Uniforms are Pre WWI vintage based on Puttees issued. The caption on reverse in older fountain pen states: "Field Radio - or wireless Oregon Agricultural College, Corvallis" The dating in pencil of about 1915-16 is added later, as is the Department of Information, Oregon State University stamp. This type of radio equipment was in use in the Pre WW1 years, and the Signal Corps Company of OAC included this training on campus. Stock photo may have been published in the Barometer or Oregon Stater during the period.</p>

          <p>A number of the photographs in this series show cadets and military officers wearing the standard Sam Browne style leather belt and shoulder strap. The official US Army regulations for dress uniforms deleted this item to conserve on leather in a 1940 directive. From 1941 on, cloth belts attached to the dress uniform coat with metal buckles were standard issue. Many of the photographs that are found in the collection have been dated later than this 1940 cut off. Existing stocks of Sam Browne type belts were exhausted by the Quartermaster as well as officers having this type previously issued to them. Although officially not a part of the World War II era dress uniform, many photographs show officers and cadets still wearing the Sam Browne type belt in the 1941, 1942 and 1943 <title render="italic">Beaver</title> yearbooks. This unauthorized (not enforced, apparently) use of this type of belt can move the dating of some photographs from the interwar years to early World War II.</p>

            <p>After the end of WWI, the Military built up the ROTC Training Battalion at OAC to include a Transportation Corps company. This new technology of warfare, the movement of men and materials by Trucks was to become a new science in Military and Tactics training. Original equipment provided to the OAC Armory included the WWI vintage "Liberty Trucks"and the FWD type. The 1922 Beaver yearbook describes the unit, "Equipment of the latest type and most complete nature is furnished each unit, and a large and able force of officers and enlisted men are stationed here as instructors. OAC has the third largest armory among colleges in the United States." (p.256) This unit was absorbed into the Engineers during the early 1930s.</p>

            <p>After WWI the US Army instituted artillery training for ROTC Cadets at OAC. During the 1920s up until the beginning of WWII, a Battalion of Field Artillery was assigned with batteries (Companies A,B, and C) of 4 French WWI design 75mm Howitzers and a M1918 155mm Heavy artillery piece. These guns were used for training in the use of artillery including transport, maintenance and tactics. The "French 75mm" was the standard artillery piece of the US Army during the interwar period. Drawn by 4 horse teams with Caissons (ammunition/parts storage carts) and Limbers (used to attach horses to harnesses), the weapons were seen around campus often. The heavy artillery piece, the M1918 155mm, was moved by a caterpillar tractor (US Army type) and accompanied by trucks with materials and ammunition. These vehicles were part of a new type unit at OAC, the Motor Transport Corps. The 1922 Beaver yearbook describes the unit, "Equipment of the latest type and most complete nature is furnished each unit, and a large and able force of officers and enlisted men are stationed here as instructors. OAC has the third largest armory among colleges in the United States." (p.256)</p>

An annual event on the OAC Campus, Military Review or "Inspection Day" involved the entire cadet division. Representatives from the Military Department would attend the ceremonies and certify the ROTC Program and its personnel. OAC Boasted a continuous Excellent rating in these evaluations for most of the 1920s and 30s. Uniforms of cadets and officers date to Pre 1925 uniform regulations. Officers jackets have the high collar (vintage WWI) design which was changed in 1925. Many of the photos in the sub series portray marching formations of cadets on the parade field below Benton Hall.</p>

Photograph is probably from stock used for OSC publication, identified in pencil narration on reverse, reading like a press release; "Governor Charles H. Martin always dressed the part when he reviewed the cadet regiment and spoke to the men to receive commissions. Here in 1936 he advised the officers not to join the "grouches and radicals" when they finished college. Probably all these men are now in active service." The last comment about active service would probably speak to WWII, placing these comments of that era. There is also a fountain pen caption at the top reverse, "Military Review 1935-36"</p>

            <p>Two US Army men, one cadet, wearing post WWI issue high collar jacket with brim cap and high laced leather boots. The second, an officer, probably OAC Staff personnel with later rolled collar (1926 issue) dress jacket and Sam Browne belt. This was a common theme in military photographs depicting the tallest and shortest men in a particular unit. Photograph is clear with good detail of uniforms and markings.</p>

This weapon saw only limited use by the US Army during WWI. This photo, probably just after WWI due to the uniform style with campaign hats and wrapped puttees, show training of cadets in setting up and firing the gun.  This is a second view of the scene depicted in P002:656, same cadets are shown, observers have moved away. Of special note in the background next to the Armory is a cadet practicing semaphore flag signaling, also seen in the other view, but with flags now raised to form a letter.</p>

          <p>A number of the photographs in this series show cadets and military officers wearing the standard Sam Browne style leather belt and shoulder strap. The official US Army regulations for dress uniforms deleted this item to conserve on leather in a 1940 directive. From 1941 on, cloth belts attached to the dress uniform coat with metal buckles were standard issue. Many of the photographs that are found in this series have been dated later than the 1940 directive.</p>

              <p>Stock US Maritime Photograph (#2712) 8X10 for publication. Detailed photograph of the launching of a Liberty Ship with crowd of onlookers and speakers.

            <p>Stock photo of three college coed females with Army rifles. Previous description dates photograph to April 1943. The rifles are US Military 1903 Springfield Bolt Action, with special after market adjustable peep sights, most likely used for the precision rifle team. Photograph appears to be staged for publicity shot, possibly in the Oregon Stater or Beaver Yearbook (not found in 1943 edition). The military ball in the spring of 1943 hosted a competition for women as a "Little Colonel" for the event. Previous description of this photograph lists the women as "Little Colonel selection, April 1943" The 1944 Oregon Beaver Yearbook page 53 lists the women's names.</p>

            <p>Stock US Army head shot. Portrait of Brigadier General Thomas M. Robbins, probably early WWII. Promoted to Major General, Robbins was involved in the Manhattan Project as the head of the Corps of Engineers Construction Division, with a deputy commander, Gen. Leslie Groves (who ended up running the project to develop the Atomic Bomb). Connection to Oregon State College is unclear, this photograph is a stock US Army portrait, and may have been used by OSC publications or ROTC department.</p>

              <p>Series of 20 color slides of the OSU Army ROTC Pershing Rifles Drill Team in various formations during their performance. Photos include marching drills, with rifle "tricks", and inspections of weapons and uniforms by officers. Uniforms depicted are dress coats with chrome helmets, khakis with berets and white laced boots. It is not certain if all drill units are from Oregon State, but the different uniforms and groups are probably separate platoons or companies within the Pershing Rifles Regiment in attendance. Also included are slides of the Military Ball including coed sponsors and their escorts. Many of the slides have been reproduced for publication in OSC and Pershing Rifles periodicals.  The original packaging of this series was the mailing box from the processing laboratory. Addressed to Rod Commons, 301 Waldo Hall, Corvallis Oregon. Photocopy of box label maintained in file, slides transferred to protective sleeves.</p>
