      <head>Biographical Note:</head>
      <p>Nettie Spencer was born near Corvallis in 1861 to Oregon pioneer
		  parents. She graduated from Corvallis College in 1882, and spent the next
		  several years teaching and studying at various places in the U.S. and abroad,
		  including Portland, Davenport College (North Carolina), Berlin, Paris, London
		  and India. She returned to Oregon in 1916 and taught at Eugene and Roseburg
		  High Schools. Spencer received a masters degree in sociology from Oregon State
		  in 1928. She was a charter member of the Mazamas, a Portland mountain climbing
		  club, and in 1935 was elected president of the Oregon State Women's Press Club.
		  Spencer died in Portland in 1953.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
      <p>The papers consist of two series. Series one contains letters written to
		  Nettie Spencer by William Barrett, a sailor on the bark Carrie Winslow. The
		  letters describe Barrett's experiences on board the ship and at ports of call.
		  They also describe the relationship between Spencer and Barrett. Several were
		  written in 1884 and chronologically arranged; others are undated but were
		  probably written at about the same time. Series two is a small scrapbook that
		  contains programs of drama productions, musical and literary events, teachers
		  institutes, Corvallis College commencements (1881 &amp; 1882), and meetings of
		  organizations. Most are from Corvallis and Portland and date from 1878 to
		  1897.</p>

      <p>The letters were donated to the Horner Museum in 1992 via James S.
		  Witzig from the estate of Frances Witzig Milne, a niece of Nettie Spencer. They
		  were transferred to the University Archives in August 1996. The scrapbook was
		  donated by Spencer to the Oregon State College Library in 1951 and was
		  ultimately made part of the University Archives holdings after its
		  establishment in 1961.</p>
