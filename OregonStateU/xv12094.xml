      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>Prior to 1900, the Clerk of the College kept all student records in ledger books. This early office in the Administration Building (now Benton Hall),was part of the President’s Office. The Registrar’s Office as an official function is first mentioned in the Oregon Agricultural College Catalog of 1903.  Professor John B. Horner (1856-1933) held the title of first Registrar.   The Registrar’s office originally had responsibility for recruitment of students, admissions, registration, and maintenance of student permanent academic records.  In 1960, a separate Admissions Office was established at Oregon State University.</p>

          <p>Series III consists of original student academic records for students enrolled from the early 1900s through early 1960s with record numbers 005081 through 106999.  The records are arranged in rough chronological order as the numbers were assigned as when students enrolled for their first term at Oregon State.  The name index to record numbers is available in Series V.  These records include Oregon State transcripts, applications, high school and other college transcripts, military discharge documents, and foreign school documents.  The Oregon State transcripts are also available on microfilm in Series IV.  Beginning with record 076899, the documents have not been processed and are still housed in the original folders and record storage boxes. Legal-size and oversize documents have been separated and are listed at the end of this series.  Note:  Separation sheets for oversize materials that are filed with letter-size documents may direct a user to a superceded box number or location; current box numbers for oversize materials are listed at the end of this series.</p>

The cards are arranged alphabetically by last name and provide the student's name and the associated record number for their student academic record.
