      <head>Historical Note:</head>
      <p>The Order of the Spoon, or Ordo Cochlearis, was an organization founded to foster
				sound scholarship and promote graduate study, including teaching, writing, and
				research, among doctoral degree holders on the faculty at Oregon Agricultural College (OAC). Established by the Triad Club in
				1927, the organization became a separate and independent entity in May of 1929 and
				the majority of the Ph.D faculty were members. The Order took its name from the
				history of scholarship; it was derived from the custom of medieval scholars to wear
				a wooden spoon as the insignia of their calling. The group's committee officers held
				titles of Chief Spoon Bearer, Assistant Chief Spoon Bearer, and Ladler.</p>
      <p>On the day of an Order meeting, members often met at one campus location, dressed in hoods and gowns (academic regalia),
				each carrying a spoon that was their totem. The group then paraded with much fanfair
				and frivolity to the location of their meeting, at which members took part in a
				banquet while speakers gave presentations on the state of scholarship at the
				College. New members -- new Doctors residing within the "realm" of Oregon Agricultural
				College -- were inducted into the Order at these meetings.</p>
      <p>Notable individuals associated with the organization were Othniel R.
				Chambers, George W. Peavy, William Edmund Milne, Francois A. Gilfillan, Willibald
				Weniger, and Clair V. Langton.</p>
