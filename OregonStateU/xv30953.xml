        <bioghist encodinganalog="5451_"><head>Historical Note:</head>
                        <p>The beginnings of Greek letter social organizations at Oregon State University date back to the formation of the Gamma Delta Phi fraternity in 1905. This group was organized at a local level as more of a club than a recognized chapter and soon inspired the establishment of other local greek letter organizations such as Kappa Sigma Nu (1906), Phi Delta Sigma (1914), and Gamma Upsilon (1913). In 1915, two fraternities, Alpha Chi Omega and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, became the first at Oregon State Univerity to receive official recognition as chapters of national fraternal organizations. After these chapters set the groundwork for establishing a Greek presence at Oregon State University, the fraternity and sorority community grew rapidly. This growth is reflected in the 1925 Beaver Yearbook which lists 50 established Greek chapters (34 fraternities and 16 sororities) on campus that year.</p>
                        <p>The Panhellenic and Interfraternity Councils were established in 1917 and 1927, respectively, to serve as the student governing bodies of the Oregon State University Greek community. All sororities and fraternities have representation on the councils, which have the authority to offer direct recommendations to the university and regulate areas not covered by institutional policies.</p>
                        <p>Membership in the Greek community at Oregon State University has fluctuated over time owing to a number of factors. Chief among them has been the competition posed by the post-World War II growth in campus residence halls and a changing college culture emergent in the 1960s activist movements.</p>
                        <p>Until 1970, university administration of the Oregon State University Greek community resided in the hands of the Dean of Women and the Dean of Men. With the closure of these gender based student administrative offices, Oregon State University placed the management of fraternities and sororities under a single office, the Assistant Dean of Students. In 1998, an administrative reorganization that eliminated the Assistant Dean of Students position resulted in the establishment of a new office, the Greek Life Office. With the formation of this office, Oregon State University for the first time had an administrator devoted solely to the management of the Greek community. The Greek Life Office, in turn, served as one of the six "functional areas" managed by the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement. In 2015, the office was renamed the Center for Fraternity and Sorority Life.</p>
                        <p>Greek Life Coordinators have been Clay Torset (1998-2000), Robert Kerr (2000-2015), and Leslie Schacht-Drey (2015-present).</p>
