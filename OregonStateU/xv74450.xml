      <head>Biographical Note:</head>
      <p>Marie Norris pursued a life of active service for her Klamath community.  In addition to founding the Organization of Forgotten Americans in 1969 to address the effects of tribal termination, Norris served on the Klamath Tribal Executive Committee on Claims, the Klamath Indian Game Commission, the Civil Rights Committee for the state of Oregon, the Klamath County Juvenile Advisory Council, and the Committee of Oregon Rural Opportunities.  Norris spoke frequently about Native American culture and was one of the last people able to speak the Klamath language.  Oregon Governor Vic Atiyeh declared Norris as one of the most outstanding women in Oregon history.  Marie G. Norris was born on January 15, 1920 in Modoc Point, Oregon;  she died on August 16, 1981 in Klamath Falls, Oregon.</p>
      <p>Roger Weaver, an Oregon State University faculty member in English literature and poetry from 1962 to 1996, met Norris in 1974 during a storytelling event.  Weaver was inspired by Norris to develop a course on Native American literature in which he featured some of her stories.  Weaver, in turn, inspired Norris to compile and write her stories as a book.  Roger Keys Weaver was born in Portland, Oregon on February 2, 1935 and graduated from Salem High School in 1953. In addition to his University teaching, Weaver has taught children, youth, and adults in school settings as well as through workshops and summer programs.</p>

      <p>The Marie Norris Collection documents Norris' life and work as a Native American activist, storyteller, and historian and consists of materials created by Norris and assembled by Roger Weaver.  The Collection includes two versions of the manuscript <title render="italic">Along Klamath Waters</title>, a letter, newspaper clippings, publications, and a sound recording.  The manuscript is an autobiographical narrative prepared by Norris for publication as a book.  Norris describes her life as a member of the Klamath community in southern Oregon and interweaves stories of Klamath culture and history throughout the narrative.  A primary topic of the manuscript is the termination of the Klamath Tribe in the 1950s and the impact on the culture, economy, and lands of the Klamath peoples.  Both versions were edited by Roger Weaver.  The 1979 version of the manuscript is unabridged; the 1980 version is an abridged version edited for submission to a publisher.  It was not published.</p>
      <p>The letter was written from Norris to Roger Weaver in February 1980; Norris writes about her family, provides an update on her health, and discusses her book.  The collection also includes a journal article written by Roger Weaver about Norris' interpretation of Klamath chants and a biographical sketch of Norris in <title render="italic">Notable Women in the History of Oregon</title>.  The audiocassette is a sound recording, <title render="italic">On Klamath Life &amp; Singing in Klamath</title>, that includes a 1974 interview between Roger Weaver and Marie Norris.  The sound recording has been digitized and is available in two parts:  <extref role="text/html" show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oa8g2tuc/2947392">Part 1</extref> (about 40 minutes) and <extref role="text/html" show="new" actuate="onrequest" href="http://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_jmtxgf8h/2947392">Part 2</extref> (about 45 minutes).</p>
