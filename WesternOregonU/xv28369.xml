      <p>Born in 1915 in Butler, New Jersey, Daniel Louis Goldy attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he graduated with honors in economics in 1936. He then went on the University of Chicago for graduate school.  He was a guest lecturer at Northwestern University Graduate School before serving in the United States Navy from 1943-1946 where he was assigned to offices overseeing war production and civilian personnel and industrial relations programs.</p>
      <p>Goldy served as an economist under three U.S. Presidents (Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson) and governors of four states on both coasts. He held positions in four departments of federal government – Labor, Commerce, Interior and the Executive Office.  He was proudest of his achievements in the public sector, but he secured his independence and influence as a successful business executive, investor and consultant.  In his words, "I had to learn what it was that motivated private people to invest their money … how they could accomplish public purpose at the same time that they were accomplishing their private mission."</p>
      <p>Goldy tackled labor and trade issues on four continents, yet he left his deepest tracks in the timberlands of the Northwest. Audacious forest management policies that he initiated as a young, mid-level bureaucrat assigned oversight of O and C Railway lands change the rules for government, industry and labor.  Although he was a life-long progressive Democrat and passionate environmentalist, his strong held views linking protection of job to management of natural resources alienated many conservationists and liberal activists, while bringing to his side key Republican legislators and business leaders. Goldy passed away at the age of 85 in Portland, Oregon, in 2001.</p>
