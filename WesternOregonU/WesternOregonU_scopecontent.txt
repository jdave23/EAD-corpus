<p>The collection consists of two herbariums created by students attending Oregon State Normal School, one from 1896 and one from 1898.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This herbarium was created by freshman student Mabel Haines from Eckley, Oregon. “Herbarium and Plant Descriptions” book designed by Edward T. Nelson, published by Allyn and Bacon in Boston, 1888. Inscribed by Mabel Haines, no. 253, O.S.N.S., Monmouth, Oregon. The dates recorded in the herbarium range from April-June of 1896. All of the plant locations are local to Monmouth, Oregon, and include areas such as fields, roadsides, swamps, forests, pastures, and meadows near the Normal School.</p>
<p>The herbarium includes 50 plant description page sets, separate back index to “Herbarium and Plant Descriptions” from the publisher, and 11 pages of plant tracings and rubbings. The page sets include two parts: the plant description page to make notations, and a second page to attach the specimen. Of the 50 page sets in this book, nine are specimen-only, 1 is description-only, and the rest include descriptions and specimens. Plant descriptions include information such as number, date, family/order, scientific and common name, locality, habitat, root, stem, branches, buds, leaves, inflorescence, flower, calyx, corolla, stamens, pistils, fruit, and remarks. Some examples of the types of plants recorded in the herbarium include flowers (poppies, roses, lilies, ferns) and edible plants (onions, mustard).</p>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="5202_">
<p>This herbarium was created by senior student Maymie Bryant Hogue from Monmouth, Oregon. The “Oregon State Normal Herbarium” book was designed by G.G. Balcomb of the Science Department, printed by Independence Enterprise Print in Independence, Oregon. The dates recorded in the herbarium range from March-May of 1898. Each plant description is dated and signed M.B. Hogue except one that is recorded as Jessie C. Bryant, dated April 24, 1899. All of the plant locations are local to Monmouth, Oregon.</p>
<p>The herbarium includes 51 plant description page sets and intermittent pages of plant tracings and rubbings. The page sets include two parts: the plant description page to make notations, and a second page to attach the specimen. Plant descriptions include information such as number, date, family/order, scientific and common name, locality, habitat, root, stem, branches, buds, leaves, inflorescence, flower, calyx, corolla, stamens, pistils, fruit, and remarks. There is room on the right side of the data page to add drawings. Unlike the older herbarium, this one includes a decorative page for collecting specimens, with tissue paper between the data and specimen pages. Some examples of the types of plants recorded in the herbarium include flowers (roses, lilies, buttercups) and edible plants (lettuce, strawberries).</p>
