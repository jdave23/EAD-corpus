      <p>In the 1890s, Oregon State Normal School academic study and teaching tools included botany. Described in the 1898 college catalog, botany classes systematically studied seeds including dry physical attributes, planting, germination, and the effects of light on growth with students making careful documentation of each phase and effect. Students created plant collections of 50 local floras, identifying each in intricate detail and pressed the specimen for preservation. The product from the study project, called a herbarium, gave each class member a representative collection of plants with which to commence teaching. The herbarium was an essential tool for teaching botany in the public classroom for studying and verifying plants in Oregon.</p>
      <p>Description of project taken from the 1897-1898 Oregon State Normal School Sixteenth Annual Catalogue: “The student makes a collection of fifty plants, mounting them and writing out a careful description of each on specially prepared paper.  They are then bound in appropriate covers.  This gives the members of the class a representative collection of plants with which to commence his teaching.”</p>

          <p>This herbarium was created by freshman student Mabel Haines from Eckley, Oregon. “Herbarium and Plant Descriptions” book designed by Edward T. Nelson, published by Allyn and Bacon in Boston, 1888. Inscribed by Mabel Haines, no. 253, O.S.N.S., Monmouth, Oregon. The dates recorded in the herbarium range from April-June of 1896. All of the plant locations are local to Monmouth, Oregon, and include areas such as fields, roadsides, swamps, forests, pastures, and meadows near the Normal School.</p>
          <p>The herbarium includes 50 plant description page sets, separate back index to “Herbarium and Plant Descriptions” from the publisher, and 11 pages of plant tracings and rubbings. The page sets include two parts: the plant description page to make notations, and a second page to attach the specimen. Of the 50 page sets in this book, nine are specimen-only, 1 is description-only, and the rest include descriptions and specimens. Plant descriptions include information such as number, date, family/order, scientific and common name, locality, habitat, root, stem, branches, buds, leaves, inflorescence, flower, calyx, corolla, stamens, pistils, fruit, and remarks. Some examples of the types of plants recorded in the herbarium include flowers (poppies, roses, lilies, ferns) and edible plants (onions, mustard).</p>

          <p>This herbarium was created by senior student Maymie Bryant Hogue from Monmouth, Oregon. The “Oregon State Normal Herbarium” book was designed by G.G. Balcomb of the Science Department, printed by Independence Enterprise Print in Independence, Oregon. The dates recorded in the herbarium range from March-May of 1898. Each plant description is dated and signed M.B. Hogue except one that is recorded as Jessie C. Bryant, dated April 24, 1899. All of the plant locations are local to Monmouth, Oregon.</p>
          <p>The herbarium includes 51 plant description page sets and intermittent pages of plant tracings and rubbings. The page sets include two parts: the plant description page to make notations, and a second page to attach the specimen. Plant descriptions include information such as number, date, family/order, scientific and common name, locality, habitat, root, stem, branches, buds, leaves, inflorescence, flower, calyx, corolla, stamens, pistils, fruit, and remarks. There is room on the right side of the data page to add drawings. Unlike the older herbarium, this one includes a decorative page for collecting specimens, with tissue paper between the data and specimen pages. Some examples of the types of plants recorded in the herbarium include flowers (roses, lilies, buttercups) and edible plants (lettuce, strawberries).</p>
