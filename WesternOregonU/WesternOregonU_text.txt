The Robert W. Straub Oral History Project, commissioned by the Robert W. Straub Archives Advisory Board and conducted by oral historian Michael O'Rourke, documents the life and legacy of former Oregon governor Bob Straub through the testimony of family, friends, and colleagues. Interview subjects include Straub's wife Pat and several of their children, as well as former Oregon governors Barbara Roberts, Neil Goldschmidt, and Victor Atiyeh. The collection includes video recordings of interviews, transcriptions, and research materials.
Born in 1915 in Butler, New Jersey, Daniel Louis Goldy attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he graduated with honors in economics in 1936. He then went on the University of Chicago for graduate school. He was a guest lecturer at Northwestern University Graduate School before serving in the United States Navy from 1943-1946 where he was assigned to offices overseeing war production and civilian personnel and industrial relations programs.
Goldy served as an economist under three U.S. Presidents (Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson) and governors of four states on both coasts. He held positions in four departments of federal government – Labor, Commerce, Interior and the Executive Office. He was proudest of his achievements in the public sector, but he secured his independence and influence as a successful business executive, investor and consultant. In his words, "I had to learn what it was that motivated private people to invest their money … how they could accomplish public purpose at the same time that they were accomplishing their private mission."
Goldy tackled labor and trade issues on four continents, yet he left his deepest tracks in the timberlands of the Northwest. Audacious forest management policies that he initiated as a young, mid-level bureaucrat assigned oversight of O and C Railway lands change the rules for government, industry and labor. Although he was a life-long progressive Democrat and passionate environmentalist, his strong held views linking protection of job to management of natural resources alienated many conservationists and liberal activists, while bringing to his side key Republican legislators and business leaders. Goldy passed away at the age of 85 in Portland, Oregon, in 2001.
For an extensive list of positions held by Goldy, see the Daniel L. Goldy Papers finding aid at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum, www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/goldy.htm

In the 1890s, Oregon State Normal School academic study and teaching tools included botany. Described in the 1898 college catalog, botany classes systematically studied seeds including dry physical attributes, planting, germination, and the effects of light on growth with students making careful documentation of each phase and effect. Students created plant collections of 50 local floras, identifying each in intricate detail and pressed the specimen for preservation. The product from the study project, called a herbarium, gave each class member a representative collection of plants with which to commence teaching. The herbarium was an essential tool for teaching botany in the public classroom for studying and verifying plants in Oregon.
Description of project taken from the 1897-1898 Oregon State Normal School Sixteenth Annual Catalogue: “The student makes a collection of fifty plants, mounting them and writing out a careful description of each on specially prepared paper. They are then bound in appropriate covers. This gives the members of the class a representative collection of plants with which to commence his teaching.”
Ruth Irene Nelson was born in Cascade Locks, Oregon, on November 10, 1908. Her family moved from Cascade Locks to Tillamook, Oregon in 1919. She graduated from Tillamook High School in the Class of 1925. She continued her education at Oregon Normal School (now Western Oregon College) in Monmouth where she earned her teaching credentials in 1927. She taught at Wilson School in Tillamook for 5 years. In 1931 she married Alfred E. "Pete" Gabriel. During the next 20 years, they moved around Oregon and Washington and owned a grocery store, motel, and hardware store. Ruth returned to teaching and received her BA from Oregon College of Education in 1959. In 1960, Pete and Ruth moved back to Washougal, WA where she taught third grade and became the first school librarian. She retired in 1973 and passed away March 19, 2006, at the age of 97.
Merle J. Rogers was born in Yamhill, Oregon in 1871. He attended Oregon State Normal school in Drain, Oregon and graduated as valedictorian in 1894. He moved to California immediately after graduation and married in 1896. He taught in Saticoy, California while continuing his education to become a lawyer. Rogers was admitted to the California State Bar in 1900 and served as city attorney for Ventura until 1910. He later served as a judge in Ventura County and later returned to private practice to put his children through college. Rogers and his wife were buried in Laurel, Oregon.
Sponsored by Western Oregon University and administrated by the Robert W. Straub Archives Advisory Board, led by former Governor Victor Atiyeh, the Robert W. Straub Oral History Project’s goal was to create a research resource regarding Oregon's political, economic, and social history to complement the Robert W. Straub Collection. Friends, family, and colleagues of Straub were interviewed regarding their backgrounds, their relationship with Straub, and their recollections of him, both as a politician and as a person.
Interviews were videotaped and conducted by oral historian Michael O'Rourke, usually in the interview subject's home. Ellen Beckett was contracted by the Straub Oral History Project to create a transcript of Neil Goldschmidt's interview. Some later work on the project was done by Keni Sturgeon, who served as project coordinator. Funding was provided by private donations; a lack of funding prevented the project from fulfilling its original goal of 100 interviews. These recordings were utilized by Charles (Chuck) Johnson in writing his biography of Straub,
Standing at the Water's Edge.
