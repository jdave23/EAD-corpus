Ivory Vance Nelson was born in Curtiss, Louisiana, on June 11, 1934. He attended public primary and secondary schools in Mississippi and Louisiana. He graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Shreveport, LA, in 1951 at the age of sixteen. A year after graduating high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving as a crypto-annalist. In 1955, he entered Grambling State University and four years later graduated with a bachelor's degree in secondary education with a focus in chemistry. He attended the University of Kansas in the fall of 1959, where he received his doctorate in analytical chemistry in 1963. Later that same year, he was hired by Southern University as an Associate Professor of Chemistry, and in 1966 became the college's Head of the Division of Sciences. In 1968, Dr. Nelson became Assistant Academic Dean at Prairie View A&M University. Four years later he was promoted to Vice President of Research and served as Acting President of the school from 1982 to 1983. He was appointed Executive Assistant to the Texas A&M University System in fall of 1983, and in 1986 became Chancellor of the Alamo Community College District in San Antonio. Dr. Nelson was selected as President of Central Washington University in early 1992. In the fall of 1998, the faculty senators at Central Washington University voted to sponsor a no confidence vote. President Nelson lost the vote by a margin of 63%. Dr. Nelson announced his retirement in February of 1999. On August 15, 1999, he was appointed president of Lincoln University.
The Foreign Languages Department of Central Washington University was established in the fall of 1964. Prior to that date, foreign language courses fell under the Division of Language and Literature. The first foreign language course to be taught at Central Washington University was Latin in 1895, when the college was known as the Washington State Normal School. An academic major in French was first offered in 1942 but a decline in enrollment during the war years and lack of support from the school’s administration led to its removal the following year. French was re-introduced as a major in the fall of 1949 along with Spanish. Currently the Foreign Languages Department offers degrees in six languages, including American Sign Language.
The doors of the Washington State Normal School in Ellensburg opened in 1891. Mr. Benjamin Franklin Barge was the first principal of the school, which was founded to educate future elementary and junior high teachers. Classes were held at the Washington Public School until the normal school's first building, Barge Hall, opened in 1893. The normal school became Central Washington College of Education in 1937, Central Washington State College in 1961, and Central Washington University in 1977.
Founded in 1944, Central Washington University's Alumni Association provides opportunities for the continued connection between alumni and Central Washington University. The Alumni Association manages events and activities throughout the year, including reunions, homecoming, annual fundraising, Alumni Association scholarships and Distinguished Alumni Awards, Board meetings and workshops, the Central advisor program, tennis clinics, and miscellaneous gatherings.
The Central Washington University library began in Barge Hall, moved into Bouillon Hall in 1962, and finally to a new building in 1973. In 2003, the building was named in honor of Dr. James E. Brooks, former president of Central Washington University.
The Accounting Office at Washington State Normal School was established in 1917 as a duty assigned to the head of the Department of Business Education. A full-time accountant was hired by the school in 1924. The Accounting Office has continued to manage the university’s finances since that date and is currently known as the Accounting Department.
The Department of Education at Central Washington University was formally established in 1898 as part of the Department of Psychology, Sociology and Education. Prior to that date, from 1893 to 1898, education courses were taught as part of the teaching certificate program at the Washington State Normal School (predecessor to Central Washington University). In 1904, the department's name was changed to the Department of Psychology and Education. The Department of Psychology and Education was divided into two separate departments in 1916. Daniel A. Unruh was a professor of education from 1965 to the early 1990s.
Central Washington University's Advancement Office began as the Office of Public Service in 1938. In 1946 the office was renamed the Publications Office, a name which it retained until 1962 when it became part of the Office of Auxiliary Services. After 1966 it became the College Relations and Financial Aid Office and later, in 1969, the College Information Office. When Central Washington State College became a university in 1977, the office was renamed the University Information Office. In 1979 it was called the University Relations Office, and in 1993 it became the University Advancement Office.
The Office of the Registrar at Washington State Normal School was established in 1917. Prior to that date the office served under the principal of the school as secretary and recorder.
A model elementary school was established at Washington State Normal School during the first year of its operation in 1891. In 1917, the school was named the Edison School after an agreement was made between the trustees of the Normal School and the Ellensburg School District for use of the training school building. After the completion of a new school building, the name was changed to the College Elementary School. Students at the Washington State Normal School put theory into practice by observing and teaching at the elementary school.
Science classes were initially taught at Washington State Normal School not long after the school opened in 1891. In 1893, a staff member was appointed to teach science courses, which included zoology and botany. The biological science department was organized in 1899 as a separate department.
The Small Towns Institute was incorporated by the State of Washington on January 8, 1969, as a non-profit organization to research and disseminate information on the plights and problems associated with small town communities primarily in the United States and Canada in the latter part of the 20th century. The concept for a research institute was first proposed by Clayton E. Denman, a professor of anthropology at Central Washington University, on November 1, 1966, as an academic program to be added to the college’s curriculum. On February 13, 1967, Dr. Denman called for the selection of a committee of interested faculty members and administrators to organize the program. After a series of committee meetings on organizational structure and program development, a constitution and by-laws were devised and ratified by the committee on January 4, 1969, and an application for incorporation sent to the Secretary of State of Washington. The Institute was housed on the Central Washington University campus, where it remained until 2001.
The Institute began publishing a short newsletter titled <title render="italic">Small Town</title> in July 1969. By the mid 1970s the newsletter had expanded into a monthly magazine and in 1980 it became a bimonthly journal. The Institute also published resource guides, booklets and various pamphlets and brochures related to the preservation of small town communities. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, the Small Towns Institute received international recognition and was involved in formulating national policy on rural development, particularly during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. A significant transition occurred during the spring of 1983, when founder and Executive Director Clayton Denman resigned as director after fourteen years. His wife Anne, the Editorial Director for over a decade, submitted her resignation later the same year. Financial woes that had plagued the Institute since the organization’s early years were made considerably worse during the recession of the late 1980s. Sizable private loans, declining memberships and waning journal subscriptions led to financial instabilities in the 1990s. In 2001 the Institute ceased publication of its journal and the following year its offices closed on the Central Washington University campus.
Jerilyn Sue McIntyre was born on June 24, 1942, to Frank Otto and Maxine (Ward) McIntyre. She attended Stanford University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1964. The following year she acquired a Master of Arts degree in journalism from Stanford. From 1965 to 1967, she worked as a correspondent for McGraw-Hill Publishing Company at their World News Bureau in Los Angeles. In 1968, after obtaining a teaching certificate, she was hired as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mass Communications at Chico State College in California. In 1973 she attained a Ph.D. in Communications from the University of Washington and later the same year, took a position as Assistant Professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Iowa. Dr. McIntyre remained there until 1977, when she was hired as Associate Professor in the Department of Communications at the University of Utah. While at the University of Utah, she served as Associate Dean of the College of Humanities from 1984 to 1988, Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs from 1988-1990, Vice President for Academic Affairs from 1990-1998, and briefly as interim President in 1991 and for the entire year of 1997.

The Flute Network Collection was donated by Jan and Jerry Pritchard and the Flute Network. Founded in 1984 by Jan Spell (later, Jan S. Pritchard), the Flute Network is a non-profit entity, whose purpose is to serve flutists, flute teachers, and the flute community. The overriding purpose of The Flute Network is/was to provide a "bulletin board service" of information pertinent to flutists and flute teachers and to facilitate communications among those interested in the flute. In addition to serving as an information clearing house by phone and mail (before computers were widely used), the Flute Network produced and mailed a publication that went out free of charge, ten times per year, to more than 6,500 different flutists and flute teachers nationwide, as of 2009. With the development and growth of the Internet and the expanded electronic connections between people that came along with that, the Flute Network started a website (www.flutenet.com) and began to share as much of each printed issue as possible through that medium, as well. No membership has ever been required to join the Flute Network. As of February 2013, the print/mail publication remains on planned hiatus, though the website remained active at that time.
The National Flute Association (NFA), founded in 1972, is the largest flute organization in the world. Approximately 6,000 members from more than 50 countries participate in the association, whether in person, online, at conventions, informally and in forums, through publications and classrooms, or in performances. Guided by its goals to encourage a higher standard of artistic excellence for the flute, its performers, and its literature, members include leading soloists, orchestral players, jazz and world music performers, teachers, adult amateurs, and students of all ages (http://www.nfaonline.org/). A quarterly publication is provided to members, and organization membership is required to participate in NFA conventions. The materials from the NFA that are part of this collection were an earned benefit of membership, and were actively used by the Flute Network in performing its services over the years.
Prior to the construction of Kamola Hall in 1911, the Washington State Normal School (presently Central Washington University) managed and operated a women’s dormitory off-campus in downtown Ellensburg, Washington, that housed fifty female students. With the completion of Kamola Hall, women students were relocated on campus as male students rented rooms in private residences throughout the town of Ellensburg.
The Office of Business and Financial Affairs at Central Washington University was established in 1970 as a division of the Business Office. From 1933 to 1969, business and financial duties were administered by the Business Manager. Prior to 1933, the school hired an accountant to supervise the financial activities of the institution.
The Central Washington University library began in Barge Hall, moved into Bouillon Hall when it was constructed, and finally to a new building in 1973. The architect of the new library building was Ibsen Nelson of Seattle. The library was initially part of a Library-Instructional Complex that included another building attached to the library via a breezeway which would have contained the Anthropology, Sociology and Psychology departments as well as general use classrooms. In 2003, the building was named in honor of Dr. James L. Brooks, former president of Central Washington University.
Daniel Bailey Ramsdell taught in the Department of History at Central Washington University from 1969 to 1996. He served as chair of the History Department from 1984 to 1991 and was founder of the school’s Asian Studies Program in 1974. Professor Ramsdell received his Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. His Ph.D. degree was conferred in 1961. Prior to being appointed to the faculty at Central Washington University, he taught at Bowling Green State University in Ohio for several years. He retired in June of 1996.
Alice Low Yee came of age in 1930s-1940s Spokane, WA. Yee earned a master’s degree and began teaching at Wenatchee Valley College. In 1960, she assumed a position as Dean of Women at Central Washington College of Education. In that position, she challenged restrictive curfews and dress codes for women. She remained at Central until 1966, then took a position as Dean of Women Students at Grinnell College in Iowa. There she encountered the quintessential ambience of the ‘60s—drugs, anti-war protests, and agitation for civil rights. In 1970, she returned to Central and soon married Robert Yee. In 1972, she established the university’s first Women’s Center, which aimed to support women at the university and in the wider community. Over the next few years, Yee built up the center, raising funds for educational outreach and special projects and establishing contacts with women’s organizations across the state.
In July of 1977, Central witnessed a key moment in the modern feminist movement, as the Washington State Conference on the Status of Women met in Ellensburg to elect 24 delegates to the National Women’s Conference, to be held that November in Houston, TX, in observance of International Women's Year (IWY). Two thousand church women, including a significant population of Mormon women, surprised local organizers in Ellensburg by showing up without pre-registering. As a result, the 4280 attendees often disagreed as they attended the conference’s 80 workshops. Feminists and fundamentalists were unable to reach consensus about the controversial women's issues of the day, including the Equal Rights Amendment, affirmative action, and gay and lesbian rights. This cleavage occurred in most International Women’s Year conferences, all of which enacted the nationwide debate about the necessity of reforms in women’s rights. Despite the inability of the delegates to reach agreement on key issues, 23 of the 24 delegates elected by the conference were strong proponents of the rights of women. Later that year, they represented Washington state at the national conference in Houston and together with delegates from across the nation, effectively agreed upon a final plan of action, which was presented to President Jimmy Carter.
Over the course of her career, Yee was involved not only in International Women’s Year but also in the League of Women Voters, the National Organization for Women (NOW), and Planned Parenthood. She served as member of the Ellensburg IWY Coordinating Committee, Vice Chair of the Ellensburg City Planning Commission, and member of the board for the Washington State League of Women Voters.
The Payroll Department at Central Washington University has its roots in the school's Business Office of the 1960s, and the Payroll Supervisor who served there. The department currently resides as an independent office in the Division of Business and Financial Affairs.

The scrapbook was ultimately procured by the Extension Service at Washington State Normal School.
Dr. Rosco Tolman first began teaching Spanish for Central in 1970. He attended University of Iowa for his masters and earned his PH.D. from the University of Utah. As a faculty member here at Central he filled many roles throughout his career. At one point in his career he served as chair for the department and as interim dean too. In 1961 and again in 1965 Tolman took several busload of Central students to Guadalajara, Mexico to study Spanish abroad and learn to about Mesoamerican archaeology sites. 
Corinne Farrell was born in Ellensburg, Washington in 1924. She graduated from Ellensburg High School in 1942 and earned bachelor's degrees from the University of Washington and Central Washington College of Education.

She returned to Central Washington University in 1985 as a research professor.
The University Advancement Office at Central Washington University began as the Office of Public Service in 1938. In 1946 the office was renamed the Publications Office, a name which it retained until 1962 when it became part of the Office of Auxiliary Services. After 1966 it became the College Relations and Financial Aid Office and later, in 1969, the College Information Office.

In 1979 it was called the University Relations Office, and in 1993 it became the University Advancement Office.
Closed Circuit Television was used for distance education at Central Washington State College.
Martin R. Kaatz was born on April 16, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio, to David and Ella Kaatz. As a child his family relocated to Detroit, Michigan, where he attended public schools and graduated from Central High School in 1942. After graduation he attended the University of Michigan but remained only one semester before joining the United States Army in 1943. He returned to the University of Michigan after he was discharged from the service in 1946. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1948 and a year later his master's degree in geography. From 1949 to 1950 he attended Syracuse University’s doctorial program in geography, but returned to the University of Michigan where he received his Ph.D. in 1952. In October of 1952, he was hired by Central Washington College of Education (presently Central Washington University) as an Assistant Professor of Geography. Dr. Kaatz served as chairman of the Geography Department for fifteen years. He remained as an instructor at the college until his retirement in December of 1982.
Bowers Field Airport was named after Ensign Robert Keith Bowers, Ellensburg’s first native son killed at the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II.
Beginning in 1926, civilian aviation developed at Ellensburg, with aircraft initially operating from a privately-owned golf course which served as a landing strip. In 1930, a graded runway was constructed by the County and aviation enthusiasts, with a crosswind (7-25) built in 1936 with Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) funds and work program labor. The airport was sold to the City of Ellensburg in 1938, as airfield improvements were further implemented under governmental jurisdiction and as flight training programs and other airport activity increased to respond to wartime aviation needs.
In the early 1940’s Bowers Field was expanded through the CAA’s DLAND program (Development of Landing Areas for National Defense) as a leased military airfield for the 4th Air Force Bomber Base and then a Bowers Field Airport, Kittitas County, Washington tactical fighter sub-base serving the west coast command.
An auxiliary airport was built by the Army Air Corps in 1943 for cadet training north of Smithson Road. During this period, the airfield received extensive infrastructure improvements though government and military funding programs, including the paving and expansion of the runways (4,500’), a control tower, and support buildings, housing and hangars.
In 1947, Bowers Field was declared military surplus and deeded to Kittitas County, resulting in the deactivation, closure and further abandonment of military airfield and landside infrastructure (primarily west and east of the airfield). In the late 1940’s, airline service was initiated by Empire Airlines at Bowers Field as a locally owned regional carrier. Later, another regional carrier service was attempted for Ellensburg.
From 1957 to 1961 the City of Ellensburg assumed ownership of Bowers Field. In 1961 it reverted to County control. During this period, Midstate Aviation emerges from the purchase of Ellensburg Flying Service, as general aviation responds to military flight training needs. In 1965, the newly formed Port District assumes operation of Bowers Field, but is dissolved in 1973, after which Kittitas County again reassumes airport control.
During the 1990’s airport facilities were upgraded, including the extension of utilities to the south side industrial area to support further business development and airport facility expansion. Central Washington University, during 1990, began a Flight Technology program under contract with Midstate Aviation, offering a four-year degree program that resulted in the construction of new terminal building facilities and a dedicated college classroom building. In 2001, an Airport Master Plan Update was initiated and a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance passed which protects Bowers Field from non-compatible land use development. Marguerite Carpenter was born in Massachusetts in 1906 and attended the Washington State Normal School in 1926 and 1927. She was the "Yell Quenn," as cheerleaders were known then, during her time at the Washington State Normal School. She went on to teach Physical Education and coach girls basketball at Yakima High School in the 1930's.
The Office of Business and Financial Affairs at Central Washington University was established in 1970 as a division of the Business Office. From 1933 to 1969, business and financial duties were administered by the Business Manager. Prior to 1933, the school hired an accountant to supervise the financial activities of the institution.

Central Washington University began as the Washington State Normal School in 1891. In 1937, the school was rechristened the Central Washington College of Education. In 1961, the school became Central Washington State College and, finally, in 1977, Central Washington University. This collection documents the financial affairs office of Central Washington University through the years of 1902 to 2016. The Associated Student Body of Washington State Normal School (WSNS) was established in March of 1908 to educate WSNS students in parliamentary procedures during weekly meetings. In 1910, meetings produced proposals to manage student affairs as a student government organization. Eventually, the student body developed into a student government and was renamed the Associated Students of Central Washington State College and later Associated Students of Central Washington University.
The Central Washington University Board of Trustees was established as part of a legislative act to create the Washington State Normal School at Ellensburg on March 28, 1890. The first board of trustees consisted of the Governor, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and three others to be appointed by the Governor. The Trustees first met in the summer of 1890. The board of trustees was appointed to establish and review university policies and oversee the general management of funds and properties of the school. Currently the board is composed of eight trustees, seven of whom are appointed for six-year terms by the governor of Washington State with the consent of the Senate, and one of whom is a student appointee that changes yearly.
The Office of the President at Central Washington University originated with the appointment of a Principal for Washington State Normal School by the Board of Trustees in the fall of 1891. The title of Principal was changed to President in 1914 and continues in use today.
The Physical Education, Health Education and Leisure Services Department of Central Washington University was first established in 1969 with the consolidation of the Physical Education Department, Health Education Department and the Recreation Program. It was named the Department of Physical Education, Health and Recreation. In 1974, the Recreation Program was reorganized and renamed Leisure Services, and thus the change to Physical Education, Health and Leisure Services Department. The department’s final title change was in 1994 to Physical Education, Health Education and Leisure Services Department.
In 1966, Beatrix and R. Allen Gardner began Project Washoe by cross-fostering (i.e. one species raising another, in this case humans raising a chimpanzee) the chimpanzee Washoe as if she were a deaf child at the University of Nevada at Reno. A vital component of the cross-fostering environment was the exclusive use of American Sign Language (ASL) in communication between Washoe and her caregivers. Raised in this environment, Washoe acquired the signs of ASL in much the same way that deaf human children acquire the signs, making her the first non-human in history to acquire a human language. In 1967 Roger Fouts entered Project Washoe as a graduate assistant and became intimately involved in the daily care of Washoe and exposing her to ASL. In 1970, Washoe, accompanied by Roger Fouts and his wife Deborah Fouts, moved to the Institute of Primate Studies (IPS) at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma. For the first time Washoe was able to interact with other chimpanzees. At the IPS, in addition to working with Washoe, Roger Fouts exposed other chimpanzees at the Institute to ASL.
The next step in the study was to see if a chimpanzee mother, Washoe, could transmit the acquisition of American Sign Language to an infant chimpanzee. On January 9, 1979 Washoe gave birth to a male infant, Sequoyah, and it seemed the project could move forward. However, Sequoyah suffered from a number of health setbacks during the first months of his life and ultimately succumbed to pneumonia on March 8, 1979. The opportunity to study the transmission of ASL from mother to infant was ultimately revitalized with the introduction of another infant chimpanzee, thus beginning Project Loulis (1979-1985). On March 29, 1979, Washoe was introduced to a 10 month old infant, Loulis, whose own mother was unable to care for him. During the early years of Loulis’s life, humans were restricted from signing around him. Loulis learned his signs from Washoe and from the other signing chimpanzees, making him the only chimpanzee ever to acquire a human language from a conspecific.
The Gardners' cross-fostered other young chimpanzees: Moja, Tatu, and Dar, who also acquired the signs of ASL; Moja joined Washoe, Loulis, and the Foutses in Oklahoma in 1979. By this point, Roger Fouts was looking for a new place to call home for the chimpanzees under his care and for his research. In 1980, the Foutses moved with Washoe, Loulis, and Moja to Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. In 1981, Dar and Tatu joined the other chimpanzees at Central Washington University. Originally housed in the Psychology Building, the chimpanzees were relocated to the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute in 1993 which was specifically built with their needs in mind. Roger and Deborah co-directed the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute until their retirement in 2011. The current director, Dr. Mary Lee Jensvold, has been a member of the research team since 1986 and studied under Drs. Fouts and Gardner.
The research that continues today with the cross-fostered adult chimpanzees shows they use their signs in spontaneous, appropriate, and conversational ways with their human caregivers and each other. They sign to initiate activities, comment on their world, request, respond to questions, and clarify misunderstandings. They adjust their signing to their conversational partner, for example they slow down their signing for new signers. They sign to themselves like humans talk to themselves. They use their signs in imaginary play, for example signing to stuffed animals. They draw pictures and name the images they create.
While the main objectives of Project Washoe and Project Loulis have come to a close, the chimpanzees continue to serve as the focus of continuous research studies. Thirty undergraduates intern each academic year and participate in the daily care and enrichment of the chimpanzees. Nine graduate students per academic year work towards their Masters of Science degrees in Experimental Psychology and Primate Behavior with CHCI as their research host. CHCI also runs a Summer Apprentice program which allows students and faculty to gain experience working with the chimpanzees as well as learning the history of the project. Additionally, CHCI has played host to a number of visiting researchers, drawing both nationally and internationally, who have conducted new research as well as utilizing the over forty years of data housed on-site.
Washington State Normal School, Central Washington University's predecessor, completed Kamola Hall in October of 1911. A dining room was added in 1915 and enlarged in 1919. The facility was originally used as a women’s dormitory. During the Second World War, Army Air Corps cadets used the dorms as barracks while training at the college and nearby airfield. During the 1990s, Kamola Hall served as a dorm for international students from Asia. The building was completely remodeled in 2002 and 2003 and is currently a co-ed dormitory for honor students.
Michael L. Jennings became Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs at Central Washington University in 2005. He received his Bachelor of Arts (1986) and Master of Education (1987) degrees from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, and his Ph.D. (1995) in Social and Educational Policy Studies from the University of British Columbia. Prior to his arrival at Central, Dr. Jennings served in several positions at the University of Alaska from 1980 to 2005. This included serving as Director of Employee and Labor Relations, Assistant Professor in the School of Education and Native American Studies, and the Director of Alaska Native Studies. Jennings has also authored Native Political Leadership and Higher Education: One University, Two Universes.
The doors of the Washington State Normal School in Ellensburg opened in 1891. Mr. Benjamin Franklin Barge was the first principal of the school, which was founded to educate future elementary and junior high teachers. Classes were held at the Washington Public School until the normal school's first building, Barge Hall, opened in 1893. The normal school became Central Washington College of Education in 1937, Central Washington State College in 1961, and Central Washington University in 1977.
College of Business, Self-Evaluation and Accreditation Files.
The School of Business and Economics was established by the Board of Trustees of CWSC on August 5, 1974. President Brooks, believed the college was a necessary addition to the Central, “whose time had come.” In 2001, the SBE recommended that name be changed to College of Business (COB). In 2008, the COB changed its name to CB.
Central Washington University's Advancement Office began as the Office of Public Service in 1938. In 1946 the office was renamed the Publications Office, a name which it retained until 1962 when it became part of the Office of Auxiliary Services. After 1966 it became the College Relations and Financial Aid Office and later, in 1969, the College Information Office. When Central Washington State College became a university in 1977, the office was renamed the University Information Office. In 1979 it was called the University Relations Office, and in 1993 it became the University Advancement Office.
Sarah Spurgeon (1903-1985) came to Ellensburg from Iowa in 1939 and joined the art department at the college the same year. She took a hiatus from her work at Central Washington College of Education during World War II when she went to work for Boeing as an artist. Following the war, she returned to Ellensburg and continued as a professor until her retirement in 1971. The Sarah Spurgeon Art Gallery, named in 1977 and currently housed in Randall Hall, is free and open to the public. 
Helen M. Michaelson was associate professor of home economics at Central Washington State College from 1937 until her retirement in 1970. She earned a master’s degree at the University of Washington. Extremely active in her profession, she developed a modern program in home economics to train teachers for the public schools. 
Kappa Pi is the National Art Honor Society that promotes an interest and appreciation for art among college students. The Central Washington University chapter of Kappa Pi (designated Alpha Beta) was believed to have been established sometime during the 1930s and disbanded sometime in the late 1960s.
Central Washington University's Facilities Management Department was initially established under the supervision of the Washington State Normal School Board of Trustees when the school opened in 1891. In 1910, a Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds was appointed and given the responsibility for facilities management of the campus. During the 1920s, a Business Manager replaced the Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds consolidating departments. The Facilities Management Department was reorganized in 1986 and included the planning division.
Lawrence L. Lowther received his Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Language Arts from the University of Washington in 1952. He completed a Master’s degree in History at the University of Washington in 1959, followed by a Ph.D. in History at the same university in 1964. After graduating in 1952, he worked as a language arts teacher at Twisp High School in Twisp, Washington, from 1952-1954. He then taught language arts at Davenport High School in Davenport, Washington, from 1954-1955, before becoming a social studies teacher at West Valley High School in Yakima, Washington, from 1955-1961. He became Associate Professor of History at General Beadle State College in Madison, South Dakota, from 1964-1965. In 1965 he became a professor of history at Central Washington State College, teaching early American history until his full retirement in 2000. He served as chairman of the History Department from 1979 to 1984. Professor Lowther also played an important role in the growth and development of the History Day program in Washington, serving as the state coordinator (1985-1996) and a member of the National History Day Executive Committee (1990-1996). He was also president, secretary, and executive secretary of the Washington State Council for the Social Studies for many years.

A model school was established at Washington State Normal School during the first year of operation in 1891. In 1917, the school was named the Edison School after an agreement was made between the trustees of the Normal School and the Ellensburg School District for use of the training school building. After the completion of a new school building the name was changed to the College Elementary School.
The Curriculum Library operated as a separate department at Central Washington University, reporting to the Dean of Education within the library building until it was relocated to Black Hall in 1993. The Curriculum Library houses teaching materials and manuals for use by students in Central's education program.
Edward J. Harrington served as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Central Washington University from 1970 to 1989.

The Athletics Department at Central Washington University dates back to 1893 with the introduction of a Physical Culture class at the Washington State Normal School and with the first women’s basketball game played in 1895. Throughout the 1890s and early 1900s, the men’s and women’s basketball teams played local and regional high schools. In 1909 the Normal School hired a part-time athletics coach to manage the growing number of sports teams. Later that same year, the men’s basketball team played Bellingham Normal School (Western Washington University), making it the first inter-collegiate sporting event in the school’s history. The athletics program served as part of the Department of Health and Physical Education until 1983 when it became its own independent department.
The Symposium Committee of the Associated Students of Central Washington State College was established by the request of President James Brooks during the first year of his administration in 1962. It was during his inauguration that the first symposium on American values was held on campus. The annual event reached its pinnacle in the mid 1960s but by the late 1960s interest in the program declined significantly and eventually was discontinued in 1971.
The Faculty Senate at Central Washington University began as the eleven-member Faculty Council in the fall of 1946. The Faculty Council evolved into the Faculty Senate in September of 1963.
