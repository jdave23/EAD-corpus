<p>The box list for this collection documents the contents of each scrapbook as it was found. Most of the photographs, etc., stayed secure to the mounts or picture corners of the book, but many were found loose. The processor numbered the photos on the page running from top to bottom and left to right. In some instances captions appeared without a corresponding photo--these captions are noted in the box list, as well as instances where a loose photo was positively matched to a caption. The box list also notes the original location of each item. Descriptions in quotes come directly from the scrapbook creator, while descriptions in brackets are those contributed by the processor for identification purposes. Three photos from the early 1990s were found loose at the front of the scrapbook. With the provenance to these photos unknown, the processor removed them for future placement within contemporary scrapbook / image collections.</p>
