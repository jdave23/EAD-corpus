<p>The Foreign Languages Department of Central Washington University was established in the fall of 1964. Prior to that date, foreign language courses fell under the Division of Language and Literature. The first foreign language course to be taught at Central Washington University was Latin in 1895, when the college was known as the Washington State Normal School. An academic major in French was first offered in 1942 but a decline in enrollment during the war years and lack of support from the school’s administration led to its removal the following year. French was re-introduced as a major in the fall of 1949 along with Spanish. Currently the Foreign Languages Department offers degrees in six languages, including American Sign Language.</p>

<p>The Small Towns Institute was incorporated by the State of Washington on January 8, 1969, as a non-profit organization to research and disseminate information on the plights and problems associated with small town communities primarily in the United States and Canada in the latter part of the 20th century. The concept for a research institute was first proposed by Clayton E. Denman, a professor of anthropology at Central Washington University, on November 1, 1966, as an academic program to be added to the college’s curriculum. On February 13, 1967, Dr. Denman called for the selection of a committee of interested faculty members and administrators to organize the program. After a series of committee meetings on organizational structure and program development, a constitution and by-laws were devised and ratified by the committee on January 4, 1969, and an application for incorporation sent to the Secretary of State of Washington. The Institute was housed on the Central Washington University campus, where it remained until 2001.</p>
<p>The Institute began publishing a short newsletter titled <title render="italic">Small Town</title> in July 1969. By the mid 1970s the newsletter had expanded into a monthly magazine and in 1980 it became a bimonthly journal. The Institute also published resource guides, booklets and various pamphlets and brochures related to the preservation of small town communities. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, the Small Towns Institute received international recognition and was involved in formulating national policy on rural development, particularly during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. A significant transition occurred during the spring of 1983, when founder and Executive Director Clayton Denman resigned as director after fourteen years. His wife Anne, the Editorial Director for over a decade, submitted her resignation later the same year. Financial woes that had plagued the Institute since the organization’s early years were made considerably worse during the recession of the late 1980s. Sizable private loans, declining memberships and waning journal subscriptions led to financial instabilities in the 1990s. In 2001 the Institute ceased publication of its journal and the following year its offices closed on the Central Washington University campus.</p>

<p>The Flute Network Collection was donated by Jan and Jerry Pritchard and the Flute Network. Founded in 1984 by Jan Spell (later, Jan S. Pritchard), the Flute Network is a non-profit entity, whose purpose is to serve flutists, flute teachers, and the flute community. The overriding purpose of The Flute Network is/was to provide a "bulletin board service" of information pertinent to flutists and flute teachers and to facilitate communications among those interested in the flute. In addition to serving as an information clearing house by phone and mail (before computers were widely used), the Flute Network produced and mailed a publication that went out free of charge, ten times per year, to more than 6,500 different flutists and flute teachers nationwide, as of 2009. With the development and growth of the Internet and the expanded electronic connections between people that came along with that, the Flute Network started a website (www.flutenet.com) and began to share as much of each printed issue as possible through that medium, as well. No membership has ever been required to join the Flute Network. As of February 2013, the print/mail publication remains on planned hiatus, though the website remained active at that time.</p>
<p>The National Flute Association (NFA), founded in 1972, is the largest flute organization in the world. Approximately 6,000 members from more than 50 countries participate in the association, whether in person, online, at conventions, informally and in forums, through publications and classrooms, or in performances. Guided by its goals to encourage a higher standard of artistic excellence for the flute, its performers, and its literature, members include leading soloists, orchestral players, jazz and world music performers, teachers, adult amateurs, and students of all ages (http://www.nfaonline.org/). A quarterly publication is provided to members, and organization membership is required to participate in NFA conventions. The materials from the NFA that are part of this collection were an earned benefit of membership, and were actively used by the Flute Network in performing its services over the years.</p>

<p>Alice Low Yee came of age in 1930s-1940s Spokane, WA. Yee earned a master’s degree and began teaching at Wenatchee Valley College. In 1960, she assumed a position as Dean of Women at Central Washington College of Education. In that position, she challenged restrictive curfews and dress codes for women. She remained at Central until 1966, then took a position as Dean of Women Students at Grinnell College in Iowa. There she encountered the quintessential ambience of the ‘60s—drugs, anti-war protests, and agitation for civil rights. In 1970, she returned to Central and soon married Robert Yee. In 1972, she established the university’s first Women’s Center, which aimed to support women at the university and in the wider community. Over the next few years, Yee built up the center, raising funds for educational outreach and special projects and establishing contacts with women’s organizations across the state.</p>
<p>In July of 1977, Central witnessed a key moment in the modern feminist movement, as the Washington State Conference on the Status of Women met in Ellensburg to elect 24 delegates to the National Women’s Conference, to be held that November in Houston, TX, in observance of International Women's Year (IWY). Two thousand church women, including a significant population of Mormon women, surprised local organizers in Ellensburg by showing up without pre-registering. As a result, the 4280 attendees often disagreed as they attended the conference’s 80 workshops. Feminists and fundamentalists were unable to reach consensus about the controversial women's issues of the day, including the Equal Rights Amendment, affirmative action, and gay and lesbian rights. This cleavage occurred in most International Women’s Year conferences, all of which enacted the nationwide debate about the necessity of reforms in women’s rights. Despite the inability of the delegates to reach agreement on key issues, 23 of the 24 delegates elected by the conference were strong proponents of the rights of women. Later that year, they represented Washington state at the national conference in Houston and together with delegates from across the nation, effectively agreed upon a final plan of action, which was presented to President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>Over the course of her career, Yee was involved not only in International Women’s Year but also in the League of Women Voters, the National Organization for Women (NOW), and Planned Parenthood. She served as member of the Ellensburg IWY Coordinating Committee, Vice Chair of the Ellensburg City Planning Commission, and member of the board for the Washington State League of Women Voters.</p>

<p>Bowers Field Airport was named after Ensign Robert Keith Bowers, Ellensburg’s first
native son killed at the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. </p>
<p> Beginning in 1926, civilian aviation developed at Ellensburg, with aircraft
initially operating from a privately-owned golf course which served as a landing
strip. In 1930, a graded runway was constructed by the County and aviation
enthusiasts, with a crosswind (7-25) built in 1936 with Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) funds and work program labor. The airport was sold to the City
of Ellensburg in 1938, as airfield improvements were further implemented under
governmental jurisdiction and as flight training programs and other airport activity
increased to respond to wartime aviation needs. </p>
<p> In the early 1940’s Bowers Field was expanded through the CAA’s DLAND program
(Development of Landing Areas for National Defense) as a leased military airfield
for the 4th Air Force Bomber Base and then a Bowers Field Airport, Kittitas County,
Washington tactical fighter sub-base serving the west coast command. </p>
<p> An auxiliary airport was built by the Army Air Corps in 1943 for cadet training
north of Smithson Road. During this period, the airfield received extensive
infrastructure improvements though government and military funding programs,
including the paving and expansion of the runways (4,500’), a control tower, and
support buildings, housing and hangars. </p>
<p> In 1947, Bowers Field was declared military surplus and deeded to Kittitas County,
resulting in the deactivation, closure and further abandonment of military airfield
and landside infrastructure (primarily west and east of the airfield). In the late
1940’s, airline service was initiated by Empire Airlines at Bowers Field as a
locally owned regional carrier. Later, another regional carrier service was
attempted for Ellensburg. </p>
<p> From 1957 to 1961 the City of Ellensburg assumed ownership of Bowers Field. In 1961
it reverted to County control. During this period, Midstate Aviation emerges from
the purchase of Ellensburg Flying Service, as general aviation responds to military
flight training needs. In 1965, the newly formed Port District assumes operation of
Bowers Field, but is dissolved in 1973, after which Kittitas County again reassumes
airport control. </p>
<p> During the 1990’s airport facilities were upgraded, including the extension of
utilities to the south side industrial area to support further business development
and airport facility expansion. Central Washington University, during 1990, began a
Flight Technology program under contract with Midstate Aviation, offering a
four-year degree program that resulted in the construction of new terminal building
facilities and a dedicated college classroom building. In 2001, an Airport Master
Plan Update was initiated and a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance passed which protects
Bowers Field from non-compatible land use development. </p>

<p>In 1966, Beatrix and R. Allen Gardner began Project Washoe by cross-fostering (i.e. one species raising another, in this case humans raising a chimpanzee) the chimpanzee Washoe as if she were a deaf child at the University of Nevada at Reno. A vital component of the cross-fostering environment was the exclusive use of American Sign Language (ASL) in communication between Washoe and her caregivers. Raised in this environment, Washoe acquired the signs of ASL in much the same way that deaf human children acquire the signs, making her the first non-human in history to acquire a human language. In 1967 Roger Fouts entered Project Washoe as a graduate assistant and became intimately involved in the daily care of Washoe and exposing her to ASL. In 1970, Washoe, accompanied by Roger Fouts and his wife Deborah Fouts, moved to the Institute of Primate Studies (IPS) at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma. For the first time Washoe was able to interact with other chimpanzees. At the IPS, in addition to working with Washoe, Roger Fouts exposed other chimpanzees at the Institute to ASL.</p>
<p>The next step in the study was to see if a chimpanzee mother, Washoe, could transmit the acquisition of American Sign Language to an infant chimpanzee. On January 9, 1979 Washoe gave birth to a male infant, Sequoyah, and it seemed the project could move forward. However, Sequoyah suffered from a number of health setbacks during the first months of his life and ultimately succumbed to pneumonia on March 8, 1979. The opportunity to study the transmission of ASL from mother to infant was ultimately revitalized with the introduction of another infant chimpanzee, thus beginning Project Loulis (1979-1985). On March 29, 1979, Washoe was introduced to a 10 month old infant, Loulis, whose own mother was unable to care for him. During the early years of Loulis’s life, humans were restricted from signing around him. Loulis learned his signs from Washoe and from the other signing chimpanzees, making him the only chimpanzee ever to acquire a human language from a conspecific.</p>
<p>The Gardners' cross-fostered other young chimpanzees: Moja, Tatu, and Dar, who also acquired the signs of ASL; Moja joined Washoe, Loulis, and the Foutses in Oklahoma in 1979. By this point, Roger Fouts was looking for a new place to call home for the chimpanzees under his care and for his research. In 1980, the Foutses moved with Washoe, Loulis, and Moja to Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington. In 1981, Dar and Tatu joined the other chimpanzees at Central Washington University. Originally housed in the Psychology Building, the chimpanzees were relocated to the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute in 1993 which was specifically built with their needs in mind. Roger and Deborah co-directed the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute until their retirement in 2011. The current director, Dr. Mary Lee Jensvold, has been a member of the research team since 1986 and studied under Drs. Fouts and Gardner.</p>
<p>The research that continues today with the cross-fostered adult chimpanzees shows they use their signs in spontaneous, appropriate, and conversational ways with their human caregivers and each other. They sign to initiate activities, comment on their world, request, respond to questions, and clarify misunderstandings. They adjust their signing to their conversational partner, for example they slow down their signing for new signers. They sign to themselves like humans talk to themselves. They use their signs in imaginary play, for example signing to stuffed animals. They draw pictures and name the images they create.</p>
<p>While the main objectives of Project Washoe and Project Loulis have come to a close, the chimpanzees continue to serve as the focus of continuous research studies. Thirty undergraduates intern each academic year and participate in the daily care and enrichment of the chimpanzees. Nine graduate students per academic year work towards their Masters of Science degrees in Experimental Psychology and Primate Behavior with CHCI as their research host. CHCI also runs a Summer Apprentice program which allows students and faculty to gain experience working with the chimpanzees as well as learning the history of the project. Additionally, CHCI has played host to a number of visiting researchers, drawing both nationally and internationally, who have conducted new research as well as utilizing the over forty years of data housed on-site.</p>
