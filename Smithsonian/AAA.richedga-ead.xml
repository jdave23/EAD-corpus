      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Art historian, museum director, and writer E. P. (Edgar Preston) Richardson (1902-1985) served as director of the Detroit Institute of Arts (1945-1962) and Winterthur Museum (1963-1966).  He was also a board member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1966-1977 and, in 1954, co-founded the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.    </p>
      <p>E. P. Richardson was born in 1902 in Glens Falls, New York and died in Philadelphia in 1985.  He graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts in 1925 and studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for the three years following graduation.  In 1930 he became educational secretary at the Detroit Institute of Arts, was quickly named assistant director in 1933, and served as director from 1945 to 1962.  He left Detroit to take the position of director of the Winterthur Museum, where he remained until 1966.  
Richardson married Constance Coleman in 1931. Born in Berlin, Germany in 1905, Constance Coleman Richardson was an award-winning and widely exhibited realist style painter of American landscapes.  She gave up painting in the 1960s and died in 2002.</p>
      <p>While at the Detroit Institute of Arts, E. P. Richardson co-founded the Archives of American Art with Lawrence Fleischman, and served as the Archives' first director.  Richardson was also art advisor to John D. Rockefeller III for over ten years, editor of <emph render="italic">Art Quarterly</emph> from 1938 to 1967, and a member of various boards, including the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, the Smithsonian Arts Commission, and the National Portrait Gallery.  He authored numerous books including ones on artists Washington Allston and Charles Willson Peale, and <emph render="italic">The Way of Western Art:  American Romantic Painting </emph>(1939), <emph render="italic">Painting in America:  The Story of Four Hundred and Fifty Years</emph> (1956), <emph render="italic">A Short History of Painting in America</emph> (1963), and <emph render="italic">American Art, an Exhibition of the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. John D.

      <p>Multiple accretions of E.P.

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The papers of art historian E. P. Richardson measure 28.7 linear feet and date from 1814-1996, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1921-1996.  Within the papers are scattered biographical materials; acquisition files for Richardson's personal art collection; professional and personal correspondence with colleagues, art historians and critics, artists, museums, galleries, and dealers; numerous writings, including manuscripts and research files for his published books, articles, and lectures; general research notebooks and files compiled by Richardson on a wide variety of art-related topics and artists; professional and committee files; as well as a smaller amount of Constance C.

            <p>Generally scattered correspondence is with various artists concerning their artwork and exhibitions, interested collectors, advice, return of paintings, fellowships, and other topics.  Most files contain only one or two letters.  Among the numerous correspondents are Isabel Bishop, Louis Bouche, William Bostick, Eve Garrison, Edward Hopper, Irene Jungwirth, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Hughie Lee-Smith, Reginald Marsh, Gerald Mast, Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Sheeler, Walt Speck, and John Wedda. The greatest extent of correspondence is with Andrew Wyeth, Harold Cohn, and Frederick Simper. There is also one letter from Winston Churchill about a traveling Smithsonian exhibition of his paintings in Detroit.</p>

          <p>Constance C. Richardson's papers include business and professional correspondence with various institutions including the Carnegie Institute, De Young Museum, and San Francisco Museum of the Fine Arts, and most extensively with the Macbeth Gallery. In addition, there is a smaller amount of personal correspondence, photographs of a drawing of Constance by Alison Farmer, a folder of financial records, biographies, clippings, photographs, transparencies, and slides of her artworks, exhibition catalogs, two illustrated notebooks on her work (with titles, dates, dimensions, sites, names of purchasers and galleries where shown), and miscellaneous notes. Also included is Constance's artist palette.</p>
