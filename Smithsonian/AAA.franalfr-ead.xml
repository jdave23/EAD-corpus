      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The papers of art critic and historian Alfred Victor Frankenstein measure 19.1 linear feet and date from 1875 to 1985.  The bulk of the collection consists of Frankenstein's research and writing files on American painting, particularly artists working in the nineteenth-century.  There are extensive files on artists John Haberle, William Michael Harnett, and William Sidney Mount.   The collection also includes biographical material, correspondence, general writings and notes, professional activities files, personal business records, printed materials, photographs, and unidentified sound recordings.</p>
      <p>Biographical materials include awards, museum passes from the 1970s, school records, and a scrapbook documenting Frankenstein's career at the <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</emph>. Also found is his father's medical school diploma.  </p>
      <p>Largely professional in nature, Frankenstein's correspondence is with galleries, museums and institutions, colleges and universities, as well as art historians and museum colleagues including Paul Jenkins, Stanton MacDonald-Wright, and Thomas E. Ripley.  </p>
      <p>General writings are on subjects such as music, art, California, and the Ronald P. Murdock art collection. It is likely that some writings may be drafts for articles that later appeared in the <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</emph>. Also found are three notebooks, a recorded interview, recorded lectures by Frankenstein and by others. </p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of Frankenstein's extensive research files on American sill-life painting in the nineteenth-century.  Research topics focus primarily on artists John Haberle (including sketches by Haberle), William Michael Harnett, William Sidney Mount, and John Frederick Peto; however, some files are found for collectors, dealers, and subjects. Files are found both for the research and writing of Frankenstein's books, <emph render="italic">After the Hunt (1953)</emph> and <emph render="italic">The World of Copley: 1738-1815 </emph> (1970). Contents of the research files vary but many contain correspondence, photographs, notes and writings, provenance research, printed materials, and photocopied and original primary documents.  Additional research files are also found in Series 5, Exhibition Files. </p>
      <p>Files concerning exhibitions curated or organized by Frankenstein include <emph render="italic">Artist Self-Portraits</emph> (1974) at the National Gallery of Art, an exhibition at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, and the World's Fair Exposition exhibition,  <emph render="italic">Our Land, Our Sky Our Water: an Exhibition of American and Canadian Art </emph> (1974). Files contain loan agreements, gallery plans, photographs, writings, correspondence, and printed materials. </p>
      <p>Frankenstein's professional activities files include material about  his job as a music critic at the <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</emph>, and records documenting his participation in the American Arts Alliance and the San Francisco Arts Commission.  Also found are scattered student writings, lecture notes, and some correspondence from his teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley.  </p>
      <p>An appraisal for a Joseph Decker work, the estate records of Sylvia Frankenstein, general receipts for purchases and shipping records, and vehicle ownership records comprise Frankenstein's personal business records. </p>
      <p>Printed materials include clippings, exhibition announcements and catalogs, magazines, and blank postcards.  Also found are eight commercial audio recordings, including a musical piece by Charles Ives on cassette, and six phonograph records that are likely of music.  A cassette entitled "Heritage of American Art" may be from an exhibition of the same title held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1975. 
      
Personal photographs include snapshots of Frankenstein with his family and portraits of him, as well as a photocopy of a family photo album. The bulk of the photographs are of artwork.  </p>
      <p>There are six unidentified sound recordings. </p>

      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Alfred Victor Frankenstein (1906-1981) was an art historian, writer, art and music critic, and educator active in San Francisco, California. </p>
      <p>Frankenstein was born in 1906 in Chicago, Illinois.  He studied at the University of Chicago but moved to San Francisco to take a job as a music critic for the <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle </emph>.  Later, the position expanded to include critiques of visual art and art exhibitions.  He remained at the <emph render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</emph> until 1979, concentrating only on art from 1965. </p>
      <p>He was an expert on 19th century American still-life and his notable book, <emph render="italic">After The Hunt</emph> (1953), examined the American trompe-l'œil movement in late 19th century and early 20th-century through the work of painters William Harnett and John Frederick Peto.  He also authored <emph render="italic">The World of Copley: 1738-1815 </emph> in 1970.  Frankenstein curated several major exhibitions, including <emph render="italic">American Self-Portraits</emph> (1974) at the National Portrait Gallery and the 1974 World's Fair Exposition exhibition,  <emph render="italic">Our Land, Our Sky Our Water: an Exhibition of American and Canadian Art.</emph>.</p>
      <p>An educator, Frankenstein was a professor of Art History at the University of California at Berkeley (1940-1974), Stanford University (1973-1981), and at Mills College (1945-1974), where he also taught American music. </p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>The collection was processed to a minimal level and a finding aid prepared by Jayna Josefson in 2016, with funding provided by the Smithsonian Collections Care and Preservation Fund. The Archives of American Art has implemented minimal processing tactics when possible in order to increase information about and access to more of our collections.</p>
      <p>Minimal processing included arrangement to the series, subseries, and folder levels. Generally, items within folders were simply verified with folder titles, but not arranged further. The collection was rehoused in archival containers and folders, but not all staples and clips were removed.</p>

          <p>Correspondence primarily concerns  professional activities, research, and general inquiries.  Letters are from the Downtown Gallery (Edith Halpert) and other galleries, institutions, museums, colleges and universities. Correspondents include Paul Jenkins, Stanton McDonald-Wright, Thomas E. Ripley, and numerous art historians and museum curators.

          <p>The bulk of the papers consist of Frankenstein's research and project files.  For the most part, the files retain the original folder titles and reflect either artist's name or the names of dealers, collectors, general subjects, and a few named project files.  There is extensive research material on artists Karel Appel, Christo, John F. Francis, Richard LaBarre Goodwin, John Haberle, William Michael Harnett, William Sidney Mount, and John Frederick Peto, among others.  Research material concerning Frankenstein's book <emph render="italic">After the Hunt</emph> (1953) is found within the folders for William Henry Harnett. And manuscript drafts of <emph render="italic">The World of Copley: 1738-1815</emph> (1970) are found within the research files for William Singleton Copley.  There are also files containing research materials and drafts for the exhibition and published catalog, <emph render="italic">The Reality of Appearance</emph> (1970). </p>
          <p>There are three project files on Hawaiian painted churches, a panorama of American painting, and the tapestries of Villanueva, New Mexico.  </p>
          <p>Content of the files vary but often contain contain correspondence between Frankenstein and collectors, dealers, or museums; photographs and slides of works of art; notebooks, notes and drafts of manuscripts, articles, and books; provenance research information; annotated printed material; and original and xeroxed primary source research material.  A few files also contain sketches (notably by John Haberle).  </p>
          <p>Users should note that there is some overlap between the Research Files in Series 4 and Exhibition Files in Series 5.  </p>
