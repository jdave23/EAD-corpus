      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Adolf Dehn (1895-1968) was well-known for his drawings, lithographs and watercolors which satirically chronicled the social and political milieu of his times, as well as poetic landscapes, many of which depicted the rolling hills and farmlands of his native Midwest. Although he worked mostly in New York, Dehn also spent substantial time traveling and working in Europe, the Middle East, South America, and the American mid-west. </p>
      <p>Dehn was born on a farm in Waterville, Minnesota on November 22, 1895, he began his formal art education in 1914 at the Minneapolis School of Art (currently known as the Minneapolis College of Art and Design). As a student, his drawings were featured in the school's humor journal, <emph render="italic">The Minne-Ha-Ha</emph> and by 1917 he had published his first drawing in one of his favorite political journals, <emph render="italic">The Masses</emph>. Later that year he and fellow Minneapolis School of Art student Wanda Gág were among a select group of art students nationwide who won scholarships to the Art Students League of New York. After only eight months in New York, however, Dehn was drafted into the Army to serve in the final months of World War I, but he proclaimed himself as a conscientious objector and was sent to Camp Wadsworth in South Carolina for several months.</p>
      <p>Dehn returned to New York, where his friend and mentor Boardman Robinson introduced him to lithography through the master printer George Miller and brought him to the Weyhe Gallery to meet Carl Zigrosser, an avid supporter of American printmakers. However, he soon left New York for Europe in September 1921 where he spent most of the following eight years. There he traveled with his sketchbooks to the cafes and opera houses of Berlin, Paris, and Vienna, as well as on hiking trips in the Alps. He became friends with the poet E.E. Cummings, Scofield Thayer, editor of <emph render="italic">The Dial</emph>, who published many of his drawings, and met the German artist, George Grosz, whose work he so admired. In addition to <emph render="italic">The Dial</emph>, his satirical drawings of jazz-age entertainments and European cafe life also appeared in , <emph render="italic">The Liberator</emph>, <emph render="italic">Jugend</emph>, <emph render="italic">Vanity Fair</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Simplicissimus</emph>. Finally during his stint in Europe, Dehn met and married the Russian dancer Mura Tsiperovitch. They were married in Vienna in 1926, but divorced sometime in the early 1930s.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately Dehn's return to the United States coincided with the Great Depression of 1929 and sales of his work were slim. However in the 1930s, <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph> and <emph render="italic">Vogue</emph> began to publish his work. He continued to work in lithography and returned to Paris to work at the Atelier Desjobert, the print studio with whom he worked most closely throughout his life. In the late 1930s, Dehn began working in watercolors, mostly rural landscapes, and had a one man show of works in his new medium at Weyhe Gallery in 1938. In 1939 Dehn traveled through the Southwest and Mexico on his first Guggenheim Fellowship (he was awarded his second in 1951).</p>
      <p>By the 1940s Dehn was an active member of both the American Artists Group and Associated American Artists; both organizations sought to popularize contemporary American Art, primarily through reproductions of fine art prints and commercial use of artists' designs on greeting card, calendars, and even wall paper. Appreciation for his lithographs and watercolors grew, and along with it his recognition. He also taught art classes a few summers; in the late 1930s at Stephens College, Columbia, Missouri where his friend Albert Janner-Christ was head of the art department and in the early 1940s at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, where friend and mentor Boardman Robinson was the director. In 1955 he published <emph render="italic">Watercolor, Gouache, and Casein Painting</emph>, a manual on technique. Throughout the rest of his life he continued to travel, not only returning to Europe, but also visiting Afganistan, Cuba, Haiti, and a trip to Venuzuala on assignment from Standard Oil to document the oil industry there. On many of his later trips, he was accompanied by his wife, fellow artist, Virginia Engleman Dehn, whom he had married in November 1947.</p>
      <p>Near the end of his long career, Dehn was elected in 1961 to the National Academy of Design as a full academician. He was later elected to the National Academy of Arts and Letters. After his death in 1968, his wife Virginia worked with the University of Missouri Press on the catalog <emph render="italic">Adolf Dehn Drawings</emph> (Columbia: University of Missouri, 1971).</p>

            <p>Files consist of letters and cards that document his relationships with family, friends, artists and associates and to a lesser extent his work processes and travels. Letters written by Adolf Dehn are also included in this subseries, both in separate folders that primarily contain letters to his first wife Mura, and scattered throughout the subseries in the form of drafted responses to other correspondents.</p>
            <p>Notable correspondents include fellow artists George Biddle, Aaron Bohrod, Albert Christ-Janer, Wanda Gág, Reginald Marsh, Abraham Rattner, Boardman Robinson and Frederick Shane; associates from political and literary magazines including Max Eastman, Joseph Freeman, Frederick Kuh, and Scofield Thayer; and former gallery director and print curator Carl Zigrosser. The letters of artist Federico Castellon may be of particular interest as they contain numerous mentions of printmaking processes and descriptions of working with Parisian master printers Desjobert and Dimitri, with whom Dehn also worked.</p>

            <head>Arrangement note</head>
            <p>General and personal correspondence is arranged in alphabetical order by last name of the correspondent when it is known, and first name when it is not; there is also a file of unidentified correspondents. As a general rule, when extant, envelopes precede cards and letters and enclosures follow. Envelopes, which had at some earlier point been separated from correspondence, and get well cards are arranged in files at the end of the series.</p>

            <p>Business correspondence documents Dehn's career and professional associations. Files consist of letters from galleries, museum directors, collectors, publishers, researchers, greeting card companies, researchers, and government officials.</p>
            <p>Gallery correspondence includes exhibitions lists, consignment lists, sales invoices and accounts and records galleries from across the United States that sold Dehn's prints and watercolors. Business correspondence documents early representation of his work by the Weyhe Gallery and his long association with both Associated American Artists, an art gallery that marketed art, primarily prints, to the middle class; and American Artists Group, a greeting card company, an organization created to provide work for artists during the Depression by commissioning original artwork. Generally, correspondence from museums and universities contains information about exhibitions of Dehn's work.</p>

            <p>Files consist of the general, personal and business correspondence of Virginia Dehn. General A-Z correspondence includes both personal letters, including notes her sister-in-law Viola Tiala recalling Dehn's early years and business letters, primarily from galleries and museums concerning her or her late husband's art work. There are separate files of condolence letters and cards received from friends and associates. Additionally there are several files of correspondence with the University of Missouri Press related to the publication of a book on the prints and drawings of Adolf Dehn, which includes signed contracts and third-party correspondence with Dehn collectors.</p>

            <head>Arrangement note</head>
            <p>While additional Virginia Dehn correspondence is scattered throughout the other correspondence subseries, this grouping was established, presumably by the creator, and has been retained. General correspondence is arranged alphabetically; insurance and University of Missouri Press correspondence is arranged chronologically; and condolence cards and letters are in no specific order.</p>

          <p>Items in this series include exhibition announcements, catalogs, brochures, clippings, article reprints, programs, and other publications. There are also examples of Dehn's commercial work, including Christmas cards, calendars featuring Dehn's watercolor scenes, and a sample of wallpaper, as well as reproductions of his fine art work.</p>
          <p>Exhibitions announcements and catalogs are for one-man exhibitions and group shows that featured his art, with scattered announcements and catalogs for other artists work, including his wife Virginia Dehn. Catalogs and announcements from Associated American Artists document limited edition prints, Christmas cards, and other object by their artist members that were available for sale. Included was a catalog of Dehn prints and portfolios to mark his twenty fifth year as a celebrated printmaker; this catalog is a source of valuable information about Dehn's print oeuvre as it includes image, titles, creation dates, plate dimensions and prices. There is also announcements and brochures from The Adolf Dehn Print Club, a print society established by the artist in 1934 to promote and distribute his work.</p>
          <p> Clippings are primarily about Dehn and his work, but there are also scattered articles on other artists, art criticism and general news items. Publications include two issues of <emph render="italic"> Improvisations</emph>, a journal published in conjunction with the Artists Equity Associations annual Spring Fantasia, in which the artists contributed illustrations for sympathetic advertisers and a book of poetry by Mura Dehn, the artists first wife.</p>
          <p>Other printed materials found in this series include publishers catalogs that contained books illustrated by Dehn, art school brochures and newsletters from programs at which Dehn taught or attended, event programs, and an annotated insurance company calendar. Additional printed materials can be found in Dehn's scrapbooks.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This series consists of three scrapbooks. One scrapbook contains clippings of editorial cartoons by Dehn's mentor and friend, the artist Boardman Robinson; the other two scrapbooks contain clippings, editorial cartoons, and exhibition announcements related to Dehn. Additionally there are several files of loose items that have become separated from the scrapbooks that contained them. There is a file of loose items that has been labeled "Extra Items from Scrapbook," a title provided by an earlier processor for a discrete group of documents that consist of a handwritten biographical note, photographs, and clippings. It is not known which scrapbook originally contained these items.</p>
          <p>One of the Dehn scrapbooks (Scrapbook I) is comprised of large loose sheets on which clippings, editorial cartoons, telegrams, programs, and exhibition announcements have been affixed. Included among the files of loose items are two early ink drawings of Gibson Girls by Dehn, posters, examples of his Christmas cards, as well as additional clippings and exhibition announcements.</p>
          <p>The other scrapbook (Scrapbook II) contains similar items, the bulk of which have remained affixed to the pages. Although unbound, the pages are stored within the front and back covers. Dehn's faded monogram is visible on the front cover. This scrapbook begins with a high school graduation announcement from 1914 and contains clippings and exhibition announcements that span from that early date to 1942. It also includes a loose 1929 announcement from the Weyhe Gallery, which contains a brief note to his mother and sister reporting early sales of his work form the exhibition.</p>
          <p>Additional clippings, exhibition announcements, as well as examples of Dehn's editorial cartoons, magazine covers, and Christmas card designs can be found in the Printed Materials series.</p>

          <head>Arrangement note</head>
          <p>The large sheets of Scrapbook I, as well as oversize loose items, have been arranged in rough chronological order. The clippings and other detached items from Scrapbook I have been arranged by format and date into several standard sized files. Due to the presence of adhesive residue, these files are heavily interleaved.</p>
