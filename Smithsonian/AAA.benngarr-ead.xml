      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Garry Knox Bennett (1934-2022) was a woodworker, sculptor, and furniture designer in Oakland, California.</p>
      <p>Bennett was born in Alameda, California to Katherine von Tagen and Robert Bennett, but was raised by his grandparents. He attended the California College of the Arts, then the California College of Arts and Crafts, where he studied painting and began experimenting with metals. During this time he married his wife Sylvia. </p>
      <p>He opened a studio in the late 1960s where he produced his famous roach clips, then later opened a larger studio named Squirkenworks in Oakland. In the 1970s, he began working with wood and on 1980 fabricated his infamous <emph render="italic">Nail Cabinet</emph>, a wood cabinet with a single nail driven through the face of the door, which garnered attention not only for Bennett's expert craftsmanship but also for what some saw as disrespect for the craft. Regardless of any controversy Bennett's work created, he became highly respected as a craftsman. In step with his unconventional nature, Bennett exhibited and sold his paintings and jewelry using the pseudonyms Ambrose Pillphister and Gerraldo Bennucci. </p>
      <p>Bennett received the Award of Distinction from the Furniture Society and the Master of the Medium Award from the James Renwick Alliance, and was a Fellow of the American Craft Council. A major retrospective, <emph render="italic">Made in Oakland: The Furniture of Garry Knox Bennett</emph>, took place in 2001 at the American Craft Museum in New York and the Oakland Museum in California.</p>
      <p>Bennett died unexpectedly in 2022 in Oakland, California.</p>

          <p>Files titled with the names of museums, galleries, and organizations consist of correspondence, loan forms, artwork lists, contracts, printed materials, and other material related to various activities in which Bennett was involved. Other files are for donations, grant proposals, juror and panelist roles, projects and publications, and studio visits and tours.  Also included are artist statements by Tom Farber written under the pseudonym Tomaso Fabrizzi for Bennett's jeweler and painter pseudonyms Gerraldo Bennucci and Ambrose Pillphister. Bennett disliked writing artist statements and often looked to other people to write them for him. Bennett's close friend and writer Jack Marlowe wrote several tongue-in-cheek statements for Bennett that became widely distributed and included in articles about Bennett that took snippets from these statements. The Bennetts thought that statements did not read well when partially printed in an article, therefore they stopped sending Marlowe's statements to journalists. The series also includes digital formats including digital video recordings of an interview with Bennett for the Oakland Museum.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The 2001 retrospective of Bennett's work was first exhibited at the American Craft Museum in New York before traveling to the Oakland Museum. Files include correspondence, fundraising records, publicity, loan agreements, and material regarding photographs and slides. Lender files contain correspondence with collectors requesting to visit their homes in order to assess the works they own by Bennett for possible use in the exhibition, photographs of artwork, printed material, forms, and notes. </p>
          <p>A large portion of the series contains material regarding the creation of a book that also served as the catalog for the retrospective. Initially, the American Craft Museum was tasked with developing the book, but after some debate over pricing the remainder of the book's development fell into the hands of the Bennetts. They worked with curator Ursula Neuman, designer Mark Ong, and editor Fronia Simpson to finish the book. The book includes an exhibition history compiled by Elizabeth Bard and a chronology by John Marlowe. </p>
