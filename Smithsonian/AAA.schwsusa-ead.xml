      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The papers of artist Susan Schwalb measure 19.3 linear feet and date from 1961 to 2014. The collection documents Schwalb's extensive practice in a few mediums, with the bulk related to the medium and history of silverpoint drawing.  Included is correspondence, works of art, financial records, journals, and photographs.</p>
      <p>Correspondence is with artists in the field of silverpoint drawing. Other correspondence includes holiday and birthday cards, often handmade and with substantive messages from friends, loved ones, and other artists. Schwalb is primarily active in Boston and New York City, and correspondents include artists such as Petah Coyne and Kay Turner. </p>
      <p>Works of art include dozens of sketchbooks containing studies of line and form, which can be considered preparatory material for her finished works in silverpoint. </p>
      <p>There is also extensive documentation of loans and sales with museums and galleries throughout the United States and include photographs or slides of the works, alongside price lists, invoices, and related correspondence with dealers and curators. There are also photographs of Schwalb's works installed in various exhibitions. </p>
      <p>Journals and photographs created during residencies at Yaddo, MacDowell, and other well-known sites.</p>
