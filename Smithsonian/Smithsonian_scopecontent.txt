<p>The Wallace Berman papers, 1907-1979 (bulk 1955-1979), measure 5 linear feet and present a cursory overview of Berman's career as an assemblage artist and poet. The collection is valuable not only for its documentation of the work of Wallace Berman, but for its documentation of the California beat movement of the late 1950s through the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Found are numerous letters, writings, poems, and other published material which portray the thoughts, attitudes, and trends popular in a prominent underground culture which eventually led to radical changes in America and American art. The collection contains business correspondence, letters from other artists and writers of the beat movement, writings by others, scattered artwork by Berman, and photographs by Robert F. Heinecken. In addition, the collection contains files for Berman's mail art publications <emph render="italic">Semina </emph>and <emph render="italic">S.M.S.</emph> Also of note is the large volume of printed material (2.7 feet), much of it in the form of books and other published material. Sound recordings include poets Michael McClure, Kenneth Patchen, David Melzer, and another unidentified writer performing their work. </p>

<p>The papers of wildlife illustrator, painter, and cartoonist Paul Bransom measure 10.1 linear feet and date from 1862 to 1985. Almost half of the collection is comprised of personal and professional correspondence. Also found in the papers are biographical essays, certificates and awards, memorabilia, writings and notes, business files, bibliographies, an artwork inventory, exhibition catalogs, clippings, printed illustrations, pamphlets, photographs, scrapbooks, and original artwork. </p>
<p>The correspondence is particularly rich in documenting Bransom's early career as an illustrator, and his relationships with authors, art editors, and publishers from the 1900s to the 1940s. Correspondence also contains a wealth of cards, many of which bear reproductions or original artwork by his many artist friends. Correspondence often bears notes made by Bransom about the correspondent. Further documentation of Bransom's career is found in Notes and Writings, including narrative writings and lists of artwork and contacts; and in Personal Business Records, which contain records of transactions with various clients and galleries, as well as bibliographies of works illustrated by Bransom, and an art inventory created posthumously by Mario Cesar Romero.</p>
<p>Printed materials include exhibition records, which are often annotated, and copies of Bransom's illustrations and cartoons as they appeared in print. Also found are clippings about Bransom and other artists he knew; newsletters, pamphlets, and other materials related to organizations with which he was involved; and a copy of his book on animal drawing technique. Photographs depict Bransom, his childhood and family, homes and studios, friends, travels, and other events. Many of the photographs bear identifications by Bransom. The collection has a voluminous Artwork series, which includes two sketchbooks and hundreds of original sketches, drawings, and designs by Bransom, as well as a series of prints and original artwork by others. </p>

<p>This series includes personal and professional correspondence of Paul Bransom from the beginning of his career until the end of his life. Correspondence includes letters from other artists, art directors and editors, writers, nature and wildlife conservators and zoologists, curators, collectors, printers, engravers, family, and friends. Also found are letters Bransom wrote to his wife, Grace Bond Bransom, early in their relationship, and scattered correspondence to Grace Bond Bransom and Althea Bond, Bransom's niece and heiress. Many illustrated letters are found among the correspondence, including several lavishly illustrated letters from Charles Sarka. Photographs, clippings, and other enclosures such as membership cards, are scattered throughout the series.</p>
<p>Correspondence is divided into three groups: that between Paul Bransom and his wife, general correspondence, and cards. General correspondence is arranged chronologically except for occasional instances where letters were originally grouped together by author or subject. Drafts and carbon copies of outgoing letters written by Paul Bransom are interfiled with general correspondence, and undated drafts are filed at the end of the general correspondence. Greeting cards with significant written messages are interfiled with general correspondence, and cards without messages are arranged alphabetically at the end of the series. Many of the cards are made with original artwork, as indicated in the folder notes below. </p>
<p>General correspondence contains letters and records of transactions with Bransom's publishing clients, as well as letters from many authors whose stories Bransom illustrated, especially between the 1900s and the 1940s. Among the authors are Albert Payson Terhune, Donald Culross Peattie, J. Frank Dobie, Dorothy Cottrell, Attilio Gatti, Charmian London (wife of Jack London), and Herbert Sass. Artists represented in Bransom's correspondence include Charles Sarka, Joe Back, Walter Biggs, Patricia Bott, Chen Chi, John Clymer, Paul Fair, Charles Hargens, Bob Kuhn, Dorothy and Gertrude Lathrop, Bob Lougheed, George McLean, Ugo Mochi, Bill and Rachel Scott, Donald Teague, and Clarence Tillenius.</p>
<p>Letters and envelopes are often annotated by Bransom giving the full name of the author and sometimes the nature of their relationship or other biographical information. Additional correspondence can be found in Personal Business Records, and some drafts of outgoing letters are found in the notebooks filed in Notes and Writings. </p>

<p>This series includes photographs depicting Bransom, his family, other artists, pets and other animals, homes and studios, landscapes, trips, events, and works of art. Many of the photographs in this series have identifications on them, some of which appear to have been made retrospectively by Bransom. Other identifications appear to be in the handwriting of his niece and heiress, Althea Bond; and Mario Cesar Romero, who signed his notes "MCR."</p>
<p>Wherever possible, photographs which appear to have been taken and printed together have been filed together. Numerous photographs of Bransom painting and drawing are found in this series. See folder notes below and notes on the photographs themselves for additional information about content. </p>
<p>The slide album has been re-housed for preservation, but the original arrangement of the slides in their sleeves has been preserved. Images in the slide album include Paul and Grace Bransom, their Canada Lake and Jackson Hole homes, landscapes in the Adirondack and Teton mountains, Bransoms' friends, Paul Bransom painting in the studio and outside, and nature photographs labeled "studies for paintings." Most of the slides are Kodachrome and have suffered very little fading.</p>
<p>Additional photographs are found in Scrapbooks, and scattered photographs are found in Correspondence. See the series description for further details. </p>

<p>This series consists of two scrapbooks containing clippings, photographs, and exhibition announcements. Neither volume appears to have been made by Bransom himself, and both were part of the donation of Mario Cesar Romero, who had access to the Bransom estate while curating a retrospective exhibition of Bransom's artwork and creating the artwork inventory in Series 4.</p>
<p>Volume I consists entirely of printed material, mostly clippings and one advertisement for a book illustrated by Bransom, <emph render="italic">The Argosy of Fables</emph> (1921). Clippings also include multiple obituaries. Many of the items in Volume I are duplicated in the Printed Material series.</p>
<p>Volume II contains exhibition announcements (1929-1931), clippings (1920s-1970s), and photographs (circa 1886-1970). Original photographs have been removed from the scrapbook as a preservation measure and to provide access to Bransom's notes on the backs of photographs. Pages containing the removed photographs have been replaced by photocopies reflecting their original arrangement in the scrapbook. Many of the photographs found in this scrapbook are not found elsewhere in Bransom's papers. Identifications on the scrapbook pages were made by Mario Cesar Romero. </p>

<p>The photographs of Edwin Burrage Child measure 2.2 linear feet and date from 1902-1936. Included in this collection are original photographic prints and copy prints; 101 negatives; 59 glass plate negatives; and one folder of miscellaneous papers including a sketch by Edwin Burrage Child. Photographs depict artwork, interiors, furniture, and people.</p>
<p>Photographs of people and other subjects depict several portrait images of Edwin Burrage Child, as well as many photographs and negatives of unidentified groups and events, children, men building a log cabin structure at Child's Dorset, Vermont home, and several models for painting.</p>
<p>Photographs of landscapes, buildings, and animals include a series of landscape photographs of Central Park, complete with the city in the background; many images of the Dorset, Vermont landscape with Child's house and barn structures depicted; landscapes with rainclouds and lightning, also in Dorset, Vermont; and images of horses attached to carriages and wagons, and cows and sheep, as well as several images of a dead horse on the streets of a small town.</p>
<p>Photographs of interiors, furniture, and lighting are made up primarily of copy prints and negatives, and include images of pieces of furniture, light fixtures and sconces, as well as entire interior rooms of what is probably Child's Dorset home. Additionally, photographs of Child's studio with paintings hung on walls are also found here.</p>
<p>Photographs of artwork make up the bulk of the collection, with original prints, copy prints, negatives, and glass plate negatives of primarily portrait paintings by Edwin Burrage Child. Many of the original photographic prints have been annotated on the backs with descriptive information about the portrait model, where they are from, and their occupation. Some annotations contain anecdotal information about Child's interactions or experiences with the sitters, and have been written by Child's youngest son, Sargent Burrage Child. While some of the descriptive information has been identified as written by both Edwin Burrage Child and Sargent Burrage Child, some writing could not be identified. A set of glass plate negatives without prints also depicts several of Child's landscape paintings. Additionally, a dismantled photograph album contains original prints of Child's portraits of men, women, and children, as well as containing the most descriptive information of all the prints in the collection.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous papers contains a sketch with note by Edwin Burrage Child; a handwritten letter in pencil, on Child's stationery, by Child; a typed exhibition inventory of portraits in the Washington, D. C. exhibit, "Portraits by Edwin Burrage Child," in 1930; and a copy of the 5 x 7 glass plate negatives box that previously stored glass plate negatives.</p>

<p>Included here are primarily images of Edwin Burrage Child's portrait paintings, of men, women, and children. A dismantled photograph album is also included, containing Child's portrait paintings. Many of the images have descriptive annotations identifying the portrait model, where they lived, and the nature of their primary occupation. Images within the photograph album sometimes contain more descriptive detail about the sitter. While some of the annotations were written by Edwin Burrage Child, most were written by Child's youngest son, Sargent Burrage Child, sometimes containing anecdotal information about the sitter or their relationship with Child, as well as many notes by unidentified authors. Also found here are images of Child's landscape paintings of Dorset, Vermont, only in glass plate negative format. Several of the portrait paintings were noted as "Washington, D. C. Exhibition," probably meaning they were included in Child's exhibit of work at the National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington, D. C. from February to March of 1930. One self-portrait image of Edwin Burrage Child is depicted in a photographic reproduction from "The National Cyclopedia of American Biography."</p>

<p>Business correspondence documents Dehn's career and professional associations. Files consist of letters from galleries, museum directors, collectors, publishers, researchers, greeting card companies, researchers, and government officials.</p>
<p>Gallery correspondence includes exhibitions lists, consignment lists, sales invoices and accounts and records galleries from across the United States that sold Dehn's prints and watercolors. Business correspondence documents early representation of his work by the Weyhe Gallery and his long association with both Associated American Artists, an art gallery that marketed art, primarily prints, to the middle class; and American Artists Group, a greeting card company, an organization created to provide work for artists during the Depression by commissioning original artwork. Generally, correspondence from museums and universities contains information about exhibitions of Dehn's work.</p>

<p>Series consists of Dehner's personal and professional correspondence, comprised of mostly incoming letters but also some early drafts or copies of outgoing letters in addition to some enclosures such as loan agreements, shipping receipts, manuscripts, and printed material. Correspondents include museums, galleries, art dealers, curators, scholars, students, artists, writers, friends, and relatives. Correspondence largely documents Dehner's various personal and professional relationships, her efforts to promote and exhibit her artwork and to facilitate art historical research (on David Smith, herself, and other artists), and her various creative activities.</p>
<p>Personal correspondents include David Smith, Smith's sister, Catherine, and his mother, Golda; Smith's second wife, Jean Smith Pond, and his two daughters, Rebecca and Candida; Dehner's second husband, Ferdinand Mann and stepdaughter, Abby (Mann) Thernstrom; friends and fellow artists, Edgar and Lucille Corcos Levy, Herman Cherry, and Louise Nevelson; and her heart surgeon, Elliott Hurwitt, among others. Dehner often established friendships with individuals who started out corresponding on a professional basis (such as curators, dealers, and students), so personal correspondence can often be found interspersed with professional correspondence.</p>
<p>Professional correspondence typically relates to the loan, exhibition, and sale of Dehner's work and the Smith work that Dehner owned. Notable exhibitions documented include the 1950s traveling show of her watercolors and drawings, and group and solo shows including at the Philadelphia Art Alliance, Storm King Art Center, and Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. Also documented are Dehner's dealings with Mildred Constantine and Marian Willard (of the Willard Gallery), among others. Correspondence with curators, scholars, and students relates to research inquiries primarily about Smith, but also about Dehner herself and other artists of her era, such as John Graham, Irene Rice Pereira, and Louise Nevelson. Professional correspondence also concerns the editing and publication of the foreword she wrote for the re-issue of John Graham's <emph render="italic">System and Dialectics of Art</emph>, and the publication of her poems in the journal <emph render="italic">Tracks</emph>; certain matters pertaining to David Smith's estate, such as the disposition of some items belonging to Dehner and the controversial alteration of the painted surfaces of certain Smith sculptures carried out by executor Clement Greenberg; donations of art works to various institutions, including Dehner's effort to raise funds from Jan Matulka's former students to purchase and donate one of his paintings to the Guggenheim Museum; and the donation of her papers to the Archives of American Art, and subsequent permissions to access and publish from them.</p>

<p>The Dorothy Weiss Gallery records measure 18.7 linear feet and date from circa 1964 to 2001 (bulk 1984-2000). Although the collection includes limited records overlapping from Weiss's dealings with some artists through Meyer Breier Weiss Contemporary Crafts, Inc., its primary focus is the activities of the Dorothy Weiss Gallery. The records provide fairly extensive coverage of the gallery's relationship with approximately thirty artists, and scattered documentation of Weiss's relationship with more than two hundred other artists whose work she represented, exhibited, or had an interest in at some time during the gallery's existence. Overall, the collection is an excellent source of information on contemporary ceramic and glass sculpture and includes artist files of correspondence, administrative records, printed matter, and photographic material, as well as exhibition files and subject files.</p>
<p>The bulk of the collection consists of Series 1: Artist Files, which includes correspondence with artists, biographical material, printed material relating to exhibitions at the Dorothy Weiss Gallery and elsewhere, photographs of artwork, and administrative records such as price lists, inventories, and loan and consignment documentation.</p>
<p>Series 2: Exhibition Files contains records of approximately twenty-five group exhibitions held at the gallery, such as the <emph render="italic">Teapot Invitationals</emph>, and various exhibitions of glass artists. Records relating to exhibitions for a single artist's work can be found in Series 1: Artist Files.</p>
<p>Series 3: Subject Files consists of a small group of general subject files maintained by the gallery, such as correspondence with different types of clients, and records relating to specific projects outside the gallery in which Weiss participated.</p>

<p>This series contains files for artists represented by the gallery, or featured in the gallery's exhibitions. There are also files for artists in whom Weiss had an interest but with whom she never pursued a business relationship. While some artists are represented by only a single file, others are represented more fully. The latter include Hank Murta Adams, Rudy Autio, Annette Corcoran, Philip Cornelius, Wouter Dam, Ruth Duckworth, Jack Earl, Tony Hepburn, Jun Kaneko, Michael Lucero, Beverly Mayeri, William Morris, Jay Musler, Barbara Bell Smith, Statom Therman, Yoshio Taylor, Robert Turner, Jamie Walker, and Stan Welsh.</p>
<p>Files typically include any or all of the following: announcements and press releases for exhibitions held at the gallery; correspondence with artists, buyers, collectors, museums and art institutions; biographical material such as résumés and artist statements; consignment, loan and shipping records; inventories and price lists; printed material; photographs of artists; and photographs of artwork.</p>
<p>Correspondence generally includes original incoming letters and drafts or copies of outgoing letters. To preserve the original order of the collection, records relating to a particular artist were broken down according to the system imposed by the creator. Consequently, files labeled "correspondence" may also include material such as price lists, inventories, consignment and loan records, invoices, and shipping records.</p>
<p>Photographic material generally consists of images of artwork and may also contain images of gallery installations or photographs of work in an artist's studio. Photographs of artists are filed separately and/or noted in the container list.</p>
<p>Additional slide transparencies of artwork by many of the artists represented here can be found at the end of the series. These were separated from the artist files in which they were originally housed for storage reasons. Researchers should check the list of transparencies for additional information about any artist of interest. "SB" next to the box number indicates the slide box in which particular slide transparencies are housed.</p>

<p>This series contains records of approximately twenty-five group exhibitions held at the gallery. Files typically contain announcements, press releases, correspondence with participating artists, price lists, and photographs of artwork. Researchers should note that records of other exhibitions can be found in the artist files.</p>
<p>For several exhibitions, such as the Alfred Show (1989), and some of the <emph render="italic">New Glass</emph> exhibitions and <emph render="italic">Teapot Invitationals</emph>, Weiss requested that participants submit black and white sketches, rather than photographs of artwork, for the exhibition announcements. She asked that the sketches "suggest the character and spirit of the work" to be included in the exhibition. Many of these original black and white drawings, with accompanying letters from the artists, can be found in this series. One oversized letter with accompanying teapot drawings by Juta Savage, is housed in Series 1: Artist Files, and can be found in OV 21.</p>

The collection includes scattered correspondence; writings; teaching files; subject files on exhibitions and projects; artists files; and printed materials. There are two folders of documents and photographs related to Faison's World War II work in the U.S. Art Looting Intelligence Unit. </p>
<p>Six folders of scattered correspondence relate to Faison's teaching, lectures, and writings. </p>
<p>Writings include bound student notebooks, lecture notes, typescript drafts, published articles, and material related to his book <title render="italic">Handbook of the Collection: Williams College Museum of Art</title>. Eighteen bound notebooks are filled with Faison's college class notes. There are typescript drafts of Faison's articles and speeches, as well as printed versions. Papers relating to Faison's book <title render="italic">Handbook of the Collection: Williams College Museum of Art</title> include several drafts, a correction copy, and a folder of illustrations to accompany the text. </p>
<p>Teaching files consist of course files containing miscellaneous notes for classes taught by Faison. The syllabi for classes he taught are filed separately. </p>
<p>Subject files are arranged into three groups: Monuments Men/ALIU files; projects and exhibitions files, and general research files. There are only two folders relating to Faison's World War II work in the ALIU. They contain photographs of looted artwork and documents about the controversial decision to ship recovered artwork to the U.S. for storage in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. Projects and exhibitions files document Faison's curatorial work on the Oberlin Project (a traveling exhibition of college art) and the Carnegie International Exhibition, and other miscellaneous collaborative projects. Research files contain documents organized according to Faison's original folder headings and include miscellaneous images and clippings loosely grouped together by topic: architecture, advertising, housing, poster design, etc. </p>
<p>Artist files are Faison's documents on specific artists that mostly contain images of artwork, clippings and articles. Artist files were mostly used for teaching and reference. </p>
<p>Printed materials include news clippings, exhibition catalogs, press releases, reports and other miscellaneous materials.</p>

<p>There are only two folders of papers documenting Faison's World War II work in the Art Looting Investigation Unit and related activities. There are documents related to a controversy regarding the shipment to Washington, D.C. of 202 recovered paintings stolen by the Nazis from Berlin museums. The shipment was protested by many prominent art historians, including Faison, who signed a petitition to stop the shipment. The folder includes a press release about the controversy, a list of signers of the resolution, a section of a U.S. State Department bulletin about the return of the paintings, and a few news clippings. The second folder in this subseries contains black and white photographs of what appears to be art looted from the Naples National Gallery by the Nazis for Hermann Göring's personal art collection.</p>

<p>These photographs were originally in an envelope that contained a note: "Hitler Coll. Goering: Karinhall." This likely indicates that the photographs depict items stolen from the Naples National Museum by Hermann Göring for his personal art collection at his Karinhall residence. One photo IT 42 appears to be missing from the set, but there is an index card with the following annotation that describes what was shown in the photograph: "IT 42 Jewelry: 2 rugs, a chair, Naples Natl.

<p>The Federal Art Project (FAP), Photographic Division collection dates from circa 1920-1965, with the bulk of the records spanning the active years of the FAP: 1935-1942. The collection comprises 12.4 linear feet of photographic prints and negatives, including photos of FAP artists and the artwork created by them, and other activities of the FAP in communities throughout New York City and other states. Photographers include Andrew Herman, Sol Horn, David Robbins, Leo Seltzer, and others.</p>
<p>Artist files comprise three-quarters of the collection and consist primarily of photographs of artwork, as well as scattered photos of artists at work, including: Charles Alston, Luis Arenal, Richmond Barthe, John Benson, Andrew Berger, Lucille Blanch, Lucienne Bloch, Ilya Bolotowsky, Luise Brann, Selma Burke, Letterio Calapai, Eugene Chodorow, Francis Criss, Stuart Davis, Adolf Dehn, Virginia Dehn, Jose de Rivera, George Pearse Ennis, Philip Evergood, Eugenie Gershoy, Bertram Goodman, Arshile Gorky, Marion Greenwood, Philip Guston, Donal Hord, Joseph Hovell, William Karp, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Edward Laning, Julian Levi, Audrey McMahon, Elizabeth Olds, Anton Refregier, Will Shuster, William Zorach, and others.</p>
<p>The remainder of the collection consists of files documenting related activities and programs of the FAP, arranged by subject. The bulk of these files document the activities of the New York City FAP, including free art classes and art exhibitions for adults and children, exhibitions at the Harlem Art Center, and the work of FAP branches including the Easel Division, the Graphic Arts Division, and the Poster Division.</p>
<p>Other subjects documented include federal and community art centers in eleven states, most extensively Washington State; other WPA projects such as the Federal Theater Project, the Federal Music Project, and the Federal Writers' Project; buildings decorated with FAP artwork; art processes as demonstrated by FAP artists; special events; and people involved with the FAP, including director Holger Cahill.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>This series consists primarily of photographs of artwork produced by FAP artists, in addition to scattered photographs of artists and other individuals engaged in FAP work, or attending FAP events. An attempt has been made to date photographs using dates provided on the back of the photos where these exist, although it should be noted that those dates may not accurately indicate the date on which copy prints were produced. In the case of undated material a date of "circa 1935-circa 1942" is assigned to the folder, since it can reasonably be assumed that most photographs were taken within that time period. A few items pre-date or post-date the existence of the FAP.</p>

<p>The exhibition records of the Contemporary Study Wing of the Finch College Museum of Art measure 20.9 linear feet and date from 1943 to 1975, with the bulk of records dating from the period its galleries were in operation, from 1964 to 1975. Over two-thirds of the collection consists of exhibition files, which contain a wide range of documentation including artist files, checklists, correspondence, writings, photographs, interviews, numerous films and videos, artist statements, printed materials, and other records. Also found within the collection are administrative records of the museum, artist files, and papers of the Contemporary Wing's director and curator, Elayne Varian, which were produced outside of her work at Finch College.</p>
<p>Administrative records include records relating to the general operation of the Contemporary Wing concerning fundraising, professional associations, budget, contact information for artists, donors, and lenders to exhibitions. Also found are records of the permanent collection of artworks acquired by the museum between 1964 and 1975 from contemporary artists and collectors of contemporary art. </p>
<p>Artist files contain basic biographical information on over 150 contemporary artists, with scattered correspondence, photographs, technical information about artworks, artist statements, and other writings. Artist files also include an incomplete run of artist questionnaires gathered by the New York Arts Calendar Annual for 1964.</p>

Many of the general artist files contain only one or two items, usually a résumé, exhibition announcement, and/or photograph of an artwork. A few of the files contain more substantial documentation, including multiple images of artworks, photographs of artists, correspondence, instructions regarding complex artworks, posters, publications by the artist, or artist's statements. Files for Jeff Dell contain 3 motion picture film reels (16 mm), two of which also have two videocassette access copies each (VHS and Digital Betacam). Where present, significant materials in the general artist files are noted in the folder listing.</p>
<p>Also found is an incomplete run of questionnaires for the 1964 New York Arts Calendar Annual, which were completed by artists and often accompanied with printed material relating to exhibitions scheduled for that year. A letter explaining the donation of these records to the Contemporary Study Wing for their research value is filed with this set of records. Questionnaires are found for artists with surnames beginning with A through E, and M through S. The rest of the Arts Calendar questionnaires are not found in the collection. Occasionally artists represented in this part of the series also have a file in the general artist files.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Series consists of records related to curatorial, teaching, and writing projects of Elayne Varian that were not undertaken in her role at Finch College. </p>
<p>Curatorial projects include the exhibition <title render="italic">Art Today</title> (1967), a juried show at the New York State Fair; a series of art film screenings held at the Everson Museum of Art of Syracuse University, and an exhibition at Guild Hall in East Hampton featuring local artists over the age of 60. </p>
<p>A single file of teaching materials consists of a syllabus and course schedule.</p>
<p>The bulk of writings in the series consist of recorded interviews, with corresponding transcripts, of art dealers and artists, which were conducted for a 1970 article Varian wrote for <title render="italic">Art in America</title> called "New Dealing," on the subject of artist-dealer relationships. Interviews, listed individually in the folder list, are on 11 sound tape reels and are typically around 40 minutes in duration. Photographs related to that project are also found depicting Virginia Dwan, Martha Jackson, and Leo Castelli with Andy Warhol. Other writing projects include published interviews with artists Brian O'Doherty and Babette Newburger, a manual on museum security, and an article on patented art. The original interview with Newburger is found on one sound tape reel with an edited transcript.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Series contains records documenting the creation and public exhibition of shows at the Contemporary Wing galleries from its inception in 1964 to its close in 1975, as well as records for several exhibitions that were in development but not yet realized when the college closed. Documentation includes artist files, checklists, correspondence, writings, exhibition catalogs, photographs, interviews, films and videos documenting exhibitions or created for exhibition, artist statements, loan documentation, insurance documentation, and publicity in the form of press releases, exhibition announcements, clippings, and posters. A run of exhibition catalogs filed at the beginning of the series represent about half of the exhibitions held in the Contemporary Wing. Catalogs are also found filed under each exhibition's title for most of the exhibitions in the series, often annotated with insurance values or in various drafts.</p>
<p>Unlike the artist files in series 2, artist files specific to exhibitions tend to contain richer documentation, including writings and original correspondence with the artist, artist statements, photographs, or information about particular artworks. </p>
<p>Interviews are found on 9 sound cassettes and 14 sound tape reels scattered in the exhibition files, all conducted by Elayne Varian and relating to the exhibition at hand. They include Alan Sonfist ("Alan Sonfist: Time Landscape"), Mel Bochner ("Art in Process IV), Hans Richter ("Hans Richter Retrospective"), Ruth Richards on Hugo Weber ("Hugo Weber Retrospective), James Brooks and Janet Katz ("James Brooks Retrospective," transcript only), Physicists Lloyd G. Cross, Allyn Z. Lite, and Gerald Thomas Bern Pethick ("N-Dimensional Space), Margaret Benyon ("N-Dimensional Space"), Irwin Hollander (transcript only, "Prints from Hollander's Workshop"), David Anderson ("The Private Collection of Martha Jackson"), Doris Chase ("Projected Art: Artists at Work"), and Will Insley, Michael Kirby, Les Levine, Ursula Meyer, Brian O'Doherty, Charles Ross, and Tony Smith ("Schemata 7"); Douglas Davis, Jane Davis, and Russ Connor ("Talk-Out!"); Les Levine ("The Troubles"); Michael Mazur and Paul Gedeohn ("Two Aspects of An Illusion"). An additional sound recording describing the installation and content of the exhibition "Towers" is found on one sound tape reel.</p>
<p>In addition to the recorded interviews, a number of moving image recordings are found. The video in <title render="italic">Artists' Videotape Performances</title> (1971) is a complex mix of recordings, ranging from simple, single-channel video works that were played in the gallery, to components of multi-channel installations, artifacts of interactive sound and video installations, and recordings of performances put on in the gallery. Other motion pictures found in the series include videos of artists Sam Weiner, Lynda Benglis, and Michael Singer working in <title render="italic">Projected Art: Artists at Work</title> (1971), and film of the installed exhibition <title render="italic">Art in Process: The Visual Development of a Structure</title> (1966). In total, motion pictures in this series are on 19 videoreels (1/2 inch), 2 film reels (16 mm, with VHS and Digital Betacam videocassette access copies).</p>
<p>Other artworks or components of artworks found include original writings by Dan Graham in <title render="italic">Art in Series</title> (1967-1968) and mail art by Richard Merkin and Ray Johnson in <title render="italic">Art in Process: The Visual Development of a Collage</title> (1967). Artists books found in the series include <title render="italic">Statements</title> by Lawrence Weiner and <title render="italic">Identikit</title> by Jim Brodey, found in Lynda Benglis' artist file; both of these publications are with records for <title render="italic">Art in Process IV</title> (1969-1970). Schematic drawings, floor plans, and installation instructions are found for Robert Morris for <title render="italic">Art in Process V</title> (1972) Douglas Davis and several other artists for <title render="italic">Artists' Videotape Performances</title> (1971), Michael Kirby for <title render="italic">Schemata 7</title> (1967), Stan Vanderbeek for <title render="italic">Projected Art</title> (1966-1967), and various works for <title render="italic">N-Dimensional Space</title> (1970).</p>

<p>The records of the Boston picture frame company Foster Brothers measure 13 linear feet and date from 1875 to 1973 with the bulk of the material falling between 1893 and 1942. Correspondence, stock records, financial records, writings, miscellaneous business records, printed material, scrapbooks, and photographs document the history of the picture frame company that operated a factory, retail store, and wholesale and mail order businesses between 1893 and 1942. A small number of family papers are included, including items from periods when Foster Brothers was not in business. Scattered throughout the collection are small slips of papers with explanatory notes and background information supplied by the donor, Helen Foster Osborne.</p>
<p>Correspondence mostly concerns routine business with suppliers, distributors, and wholesale and retail customers and is relatively sparse for 1897-1941. Foster Brothers' last year in business, 1942, is well documented and includes letters from S. W. Osborne (Margaret Foster's husband) written while traveling to meet with wholesale clients in cities throughout the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p>Stock records include stock cards, inventory records and price lists. Also found are a large number of paper stencils that were used to transfer carving designs to frames, and extensive drawings of frames and moldings including finished, colored drawings by master craftsman C. F. Richter.</p>
<p>Financial records consist mainly of routine accounting records, but also include annual financial reports, orders, and sales records. Among the writings and lists are an unsigned article concerning Foster Brothers' craftsmen and their early use of machinery. Notes include material for a history of mirrors by Helen J. Foster, and "The Art of Framing" by John R. Foster.</p>
<p>The majority of printed material relates to advertising and consists of catalogs and brochures about frames, mirrors, and published reproductions. Eight volumes of scrapbooks also contain printed material consisting of advertising, brochures and catalogs, form letters, and reproductions of miniatures and silhouettes published by Foster Brothers.</p>
<p>Family papers consist of a small number of personal papers of the founders, John Roy and Stephen Bartlett Foster, and also of Helen Foster Osborne (John's daughter). They include Foster Oborne's 1973 reminiscence of having her portrait painted by William Paxton in 1923, John R. Foster's personal account book and Foster Osborne's correspondence with Ernest Donnelley concerning the sale of printing plates and dies from the miniature reproduction business.</p>
<p>Photographs are of founders John Roy and Stephen Bartlett Foster, some of their employees, and early pictures of the first Foster Brothers frame factory on Cambridge Street.</p>

<p>Business correspondence with suppliers, distributors, and wholesale and retail customers concerns routine matters and special orders. The correspondence dated 1897-1941 is relatively sparse and primarily concerns copyright of artwork reproduced by Foster Brothers that was sold, framed, in gift shops, department and furniture stores.</p>
<p>The year 1942, the company's last year in business, is well documented. Of particular interest are letters from S. W. Osborne (Margaret Foster's husband) written while traveling to meet with wholesale clients in cities throughout the Northeast and Midwest.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>This series contains stock cards, inventory records, and price lists in addition to blueprints, drawings, and stencils and designs for wood carving.</p>
<p>Stock cards (mostly 8" x 10" pieces of mat board) describe merchandise produced or sold by Foster Brothers, including frames for pictures and mirrors, candlesticks, glove boxes, moldings, painted glass and stands. Each card contains at least one image (drawing, photograph, or printed reproduction) of the item and its stock or style number, and sometimes notes dimensions and prices. Some loose images are interfiled with the cards.</p>
<p>A large number of paper stencils that were used to transfer carving designs to frames survive, although many are fragile. Many stencils are annotated with the corresponding stock or style number; other designs for woodcarving are merely drawn on paper. In addition, there are extensive drawings of frames and moldings, loose and in bound volumes, including finished, colored drawings by master craftsman C. F. Richter.</p>
<p>One volume titled "Cost on Mirrors" (1929) analyzes the amount of time needed to carve, gild, and polish frames, the cost of materials, and prices of frames #1001-1308.</p>

<p>Family papers consist of a small number of personal papers of Foster Brothers founders, John Roy and Stephen Bartlett Foster, and also of Helen Foster Osborne (John's daughter). A letter from Edward Everett Hale, 1889, accepting an invitation addressed to Mr. Foster could have been intended for either Stephen or John Foster. Also included are a silhouette of John R. Foster cut by Doris Burdick, and his personal account book with some brief diary entries that pre-date the establishment of Foster Brothers by more than a decade. Of particular interest is Helen Foster Osborne's 1973 reminiscence of having her portrait painted by William Paxton in 1923. Helen Foster Osborne's correspondence with Ernest Donnelley, post-dating the closing of Foster Brothers, concerns the sale of printing plates and dies from the miniature reproduction business.</p>

<p>This series contains five volumes documenting the activities of Rehn Galleries and its associated artists, 1919, 1923-1941, that contain clippings and a small number of exhibition catalogs. An autographed photograph of Walter Griffin is in volume 1. Items on former reel NY59/17 (frames 165-293) were missing from volume 1 when inspected in October 1981. This material was thought to have been returned to the donor after microfilming, and reader-printer copies were inserted as substitutes in 1981. In 2003, these items were found and are now interfiled with the appropriate series (correspondence, printed matter, works of art, and miscellaneous items).</p>

<p>Photographs of people include both artists represented by Rehn Galleries and several not affiliated with the gallery. A 1945 group portrait of gallery artists includes Alexander Brook, Charles Burchfield, John Carroll, John Clancy, Edward Hopper, Morris Kantor, Peppino Mangravite, Reginald Marsh, Henry Mattson, George Picken, Henry Varnum Poor, Frank K. M. Rehn, Eugene Speicher, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Franklin C. Watkins. Another group portrait is of the 27th Carnegie International Jury of Award and American Committee of Selection. Noticeably absent are likenesses of Frank K. M. Rehn and John C. Clancy. Photographs of works of art are by Rehn Galleries' artists and others.</p>
<p>Reginald Marsh's photographs consist of family and personal photographs that were either given to Rehn Galleries or perhaps borrowed for research at the time of his memorial exhibition. Views of Marsh from early childhood through old age consist of studio portraits, informal photographs, and publicity shots of Marsh at work; also included are photographs of family and friends, and a small family album, with few individuals identified. Other photographs are of Marsh's childhood drawings executed between ages 4 and 8, and buildings, including two identified as mother's church and father's church.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous subjects are a dog and exhibitions. Exhibition installation views consist of an unidentified exhibition, circa 1923, probably Rehn Galleries, probably at 5 West 50th Street, and two views of the "Rehn Group," possibly at the Carnegie Institute, 1920.</p>

<p>The papers of graphic artist, muralist, and activist Hugo Gellert measure 6.9 linear feet and date from 1916 to 1986. They document his career as an artist and organizer for the radical left through an oral interview conducted by Sofia Sequenzia, legal papers, financial records, family papers, artifacts, correspondence, writings, organizational records, clippings, exhibition catalogs, various printed materials illustrated by Gellert, pamphlets, periodicals, mass mailings, photographs, and artwork.</p>
<p>Biographical Material includes an audio interview with Gellert; official documents related to memberships, property, and legal matters; financial documents that include bills, receipts, and contracts related to professional activities; papers of Gellert's brothers, Lawrence and Ernest; and artifacts.

Writings include essays, book projects, notes, and notebooks written by Gellert; and stories and articles by other authors, including typescripts of early twentieth-century Hungarian short stories collected by Gellert.</p>
<p>Organizational Records are related to political and art organizations in which Gellert was an active organizer, officer, and in some cases, a founder. Because of his central role in many of these organizations, records often contain unique documentation of their activities. Records are found for the American Artists Congress, the Art of Today Gallery, the Artists Committee of Action, the Artists Coordination Committee, the Artists Council, Artists for Victory, Inc., the Committee to Defend V.J. Jerome, Hungarian Word, Inc., the National Society of Mural Painters, and other organizations.</p>

Photographs contain a few personal photographs but are mostly news and publicity photographs, many of which depict prominent Communists and other newsmakers. Artwork includes sketches, drawings, designs, prints, and production elements for Gellert's artwork, as well as prints and drawings by Philip Reisman, Gyula Derkovits, and Anton Refregier. </p>

<p>This series consists of personal photographs, news and publicity photographs, and photographs of works of art. Most of the personal photographs are snapshots, and most are unidentified. There are also two sets of group portraits with Gellert pictured, but other individuals are unidentified.</p>
<p> The bulk of the photographs are publicity and news photographs, including photos from news agencies and file photos of public figures. Public figures include well-known American communists such as Earl Browder, Tom Mooney, Eugene Debs, Upton Sinclair, and Paul Robeson, as well as famous industrialists and mainstream politicians such as J.P. Morgan, Dwight Eisenhower, Herbert Hoover, and Robert Moses. Some of the photographs appear reproduced in the various publications Gellert helped to produce. Several news photographs are marked "D.W." or "Daily Worker." A few of those pictured were also subjects of Gellert's murals and illustrations. Others remain unidentified. Subjects with multiple photographs are listed in the folder headings, and single instances are filed in miscellaneous files.</p>
<p> Photographs of works of art include murals by Gellert at Seward Park, a mural by Pablo O'Higgins in Mexico, and Philip Guston's mural for the 1939 World's Fair. Set pieces with illustrations by Gellert are shown during a performance, which may have taken place at the 1945 San Francisco conference of the United Nations. </p>

The collection provides comprehensive documentation of Gross's career through biographical material, personal and professional correspondence with family, artists, writers, galleries, museums, educational institutions, and religious and philanthropic organizations, writings, personal business records, extensive printed and published material including motion picture film and video recordings of four documentaries, one hundred and fifteen sketchbooks spanning the bulk of Gross's career, and photographs of Gross, his family, many friends and colleagues from the art world, his studio, personal art collection, and works of art. </p>
<p>Biographical material includes records collated to document awards and honors given to Gross documenting the recognition he received for his lifelong achievements in the last two decades of his career, including from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Academy of Design. The series also includes Gross's birth certificate printed in 1920, some biographical notes and resumes prior to the 1970s, documentation of Gross's business and personal contacts through addresses and business cards, and a motion picture film of a documentary about Gross, <emph render="italic">Art and the Model</emph>, made in 1976 by Thea Bay and edited by Bob Worth. </p>
<p>Personal and professional correspondence constitutes the largest series in the collection and documents all aspects of Gross's prolific career including: personal letters from friends and family such as daughter Mimi Gross and Red Grooms; professional correspondence with galleries, museums, and other art institutions including the Jewish Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the Whitney Museum of American Art; correspondence documenting commissions, loans, and sales of Gross's artwork through galleries including Forum Gallery; and correspondence with synagogues including International Synagogue, Temple Sharaay Tefila, and Temple Sinai, Pittsburgh, and multiple other Jewish organizations such as Hadassah and State of Israel Bonds. Correspondence also documents publications by and about Gross including letters from Abe Lerner, the Jewish Publication Society of America, Chaim Potok, and Harry N. Abrams, Inc.; Gross's work as a teacher including at the Educational Alliance and the New School for Social Research; and the significance of Gross's personal collection of African art through correspondence with Warren M. Robbins, the Smithsonian Museum of African Art, and others. Gross's work for the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project and Treasury Relief Project, as well as for the 1939 World's Fair, is also documented in this series and includes contracts and correspondence with Ed Rowan.</p>
<p>Correspondence includes many letters from artist friends and colleagues including Isabel Bishop, Peter Blume, Eliot Elisofon, Eugenie Gershoy, Milton Hebald, Lewis Jacobs, Karl Knaths, Arnold Newman, Elias Newman, Saul Rosen, Moses Soyer, Raphael Soyer, Nicholas Sperakis, William and Marguerite Zorach, and many others. Writers and scholars who corresponded with Gross include Samuel French Morse, Jack C. Rich, Shea Tenenbaum, Roberta Tarbell, and others. </p>
<p>Writings primarily consist of a partial draft of Gross's book <emph render="italic">The Technique of Wood Sculpture</emph> but also include a copy of his first published article in 1938 in the American Federation of Arts <emph render="italic"> Magazine of Art</emph>, and a few short writings by Gross on other artists. Writings by others include a memoir of Gross's boyhood written by his brother, poet Naftoli Gross.</p>
<p>Gross's personal business records are scattered, as many transactional records are included with his correspondence. They do include lists of Gross's artwork and his personal art collection, two agreements for rights to use his work, appraisals of twelve of his works of art, and receipts of consignments, sales, loans, and gifts of artwork.</p>
<p>Printed material is a comprehensive and substantial record of Gross's exhibitions, and his prolific engagement in the arts and his community throughout his long career. This series includes announcements and catalogs for many of his exhibitions, brochures and programs for art organizations for which he exhibited, taught, donated to, or was otherwise represented in, notably the Educational Alliance, the New School for Social Research, the Sculptors Guild, Inc., and numerous other private and public museums, galleries, and institutions. Also found is circa one linear foot of clippings about Gross that span his career from newspapers, magazines, and journals, including some Hebrew and Yiddish publications. The series also houses video recordings of the documentaries <emph render="italic">Tree Trunk to Head</emph> and <emph render="italic">A Sculptor Speaks</emph>, and an NBC broadcast of an interview with Gross entitled <emph render="italic">The Two Chaims</emph>, as the motion picture film, <emph render="italic">A Sculptor Speaks</emph>.</p>
<p>Sketchbooks provide a unique visual record of Gross's development and the shifting focus of his subject matter from 1933 to right before his death in 1991. They record his early subjects of acrobatic models, family bonds, and landscapes, and the emergence of darker "fantasy" drawings in the wake of the Holocaust and World War II which brought the news of the murder of his brother and sister and her family by the Nazis. The sketchbooks document Gross's travels abroad during the 1960s, and his incorporation of Jewish iconography and Old Testament themes in the 1960s and 1970s. They also illustrate how the constant theme of the celebration of the human form persisted in his work to the end of his life. </p>
<p>Photographs of people and events, although only measuring 0.7 linear feet, provide a rich visual record of Gross's life and his professional and personal relationships from the time he arrived in the United States in 1920 to the late 1980s. The earliest photographs picture Gross with his brothers and with new friends at the Educational Alliance including Moses and Raphael Soyer, Peter Blume, and Elias Newman. There are many photographs of Gross working in his studios, and at the Bedi-Makky Art Foundry in Brooklyn, photographs taken at parties, exhibition openings, receptions, and other events, and photographs of Gross's art collection and exhibition installations. Photographs picture artists such as Hyman Brown, Jose de Creeft, Joseph Hirsch, Moses Soyer, and Raphael Soyer; and gallery owners and collectors including Bella Fishko, Joseph Hirshhorn, Sidney Janis, and Warren M. Robbins. The series also houses photographs of works of art, primarily sculpture, executed by Gross between 1922 and 1987.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This series comprises 115 sketchbooks produced by Gross between 1933 and 1991. The earliest sketchbooks are primarily figure and head studies interspersed with landscape sketches. Themes include the mother and child bond and models in acrobatic poses. There are sketches of Renee Gross with baby Mimi, Raphael Soyer, and Concetta Scaravaglione. </p>
<p>Beginning in 1944 Gross's sketchbooks take on a much darker tone with sketches characterized by bird-like and serpentine creatures of a mythological nature combined with human forms, images of war, Hebrew iconography, and recurring motifs of subjects pierced with long shards and nails, many dripping tears. A selection of Gross's sketches from this period were published in the book <emph render="italic">Chaim Gross: Fantasy Drawings</emph> by Beechurst Press, Inc. in 1956.
These types of images continue to dominate the sketchbooks through the mid-1950s, and begin to diminish thereafter. Sketchbooks from the 1960s are characterized by figure and head studies, Jewish iconography, and vibrant and colorful sketches of travels abroad. The sketchbooks from 1965-1966 includes sketches of William and Marguerite Zorach.</p>
<p>"Fantasy drawings" reappear in the late 1970s-1980s, and the bird and teardrop motifs are revisited, although the drawings are less violent in nature. The 1987-1988 sketchbook includes sketches indicative of self-examination in the face of grief and mortality, such as those expressing Gross's grief on the death of life-long friend Raphael Soyer, and self-portrait sketches.</p>
<p>Sketches are in pencil, ink and wash, and watercolor. Many are annotated with notes on art and addresses of friends and contacts. Sketchbooks include a handful of sketches by others including one by Eliot Elisofon and several by Raphael Soyer and Mimi Gross.</p>
<p>Also found at the end of the series is a 1977 signed and numbered print (2 of 100) by Gross, entitled <emph render="italic">Happy Mother</emph>.</p>

<p>The papers of artist and silent film actress Wilna Hervey and her lifelong companion painter Nan Mason date from 1883 through 1985 and measure 4.9 linear feet. The collection is comprised mostly of letters to Hervey and Mason from friends, colleagues, and Mason's father, Dan Mason, also a silent film actor. Also found are personal photographs and snapshots, Hervey's handwritten memoirs, as well as twelve folders of Dan Mason's papers.</p>
<p>Biographical materials include a personal narrative, notes on family history, newspaper clippings related to family, legal and financial records, and Wilna Hervey's notes on artwork.</p>
<p>Hervey and Mason were friends with many artists and their correspondence includes letters from artists such as Albert Heckman, Georgina Klitgaard, Manuel Komroff, Leon Kroll, Doris Lee, Fred Dana Marsh, Henry Lee McFee, William Pachner, Caroline and Paul Rohland, Andrée Ruellan, Eugene Speicher, and Dorothy Varian. There are very few letters written by Hervey or Mason, and the correspondence is mostly personal in nature. There are over 250 letters from Elsie Speicher, wife of portrait artist Eugene Speicher. Correspondence to Dan Mason has been separated and is filed in a separate series.</p>
<p>Wilna Hervey wrote a a number of handwritten memoirs of her days in the <emph render="italic">The Toonerville Trolley</emph> film series. She had hopes of publishing these one day and worked with writer Karin Whiteley on the project. Although her memoirs were never published, Hervey and Whiteley wrote and compiled materials for the book. Included in the Memoir Book Production series are handwritten memoirs by Hervey chronicling her years prior to and during the 1920s (many of the handwritten memoirs have been typed by Karin Whiteley). It also includes research materials, such as two typed synopses of <emph render="italic">The Toonerville Trolley </emph>scripts from Fontaine Fox's files, newspaper clippings, and playbills, seemingly intended to provide background and verification of the memoirs.</p>
<p>This collection also includes a few pieces of artwork; three small watercolor sketches by an unidentified artist, and a print by Edward Chavez.</p>
<p>Photographs are mostly snapshots of friends and family, life in Woodstock, New York and Anna Maria, Florida. Negatives originally housed in an un-postmarked envelope with a return address labeled "Betzwood Film Co.," appear to be from the filming of <emph render="italic">The Toonerville Trolley.</emph> In several of the negatives Wilna Hervey is dressed as The Powerful Katrinka, and in one negative Dan Mason is The Skipper.</p>
<p>The personal files of Dan Mason include letters from Hervey and Nan Mason, the bulk from their trip to Europe and North Africa in 1926-1927. This series also includes Dan Mason's own handwritten and typed memoirs, newspaper clippings, and financial records.</p>

<p>Correspondence is mostly personal letters and covers subjects such as personal matters, updates on the lives of Woodstock residents, and the careers of artist friends. Early correspondence highlights Wilna Hervey's film career and travels. Other than the letters written by Nan Mason to Wilna Hervey, there are very few letters in this series written by either Hervey or Mason.</p>
<p>Notable correspondents include artists and friends Albert Heckman, Georgina Klitgaard, Manuel Komroff, Leon Kroll, Doris Lee, Fred Dana Marsh, Henry Lee McFee, William Pachner, Caroline and Paul Rohland, Andrée Ruellan, Eugene Speicher, and Dorothy Varian. There are over 250 letters from Elsie Speicher, wife of portrait artist Eugene Speicher. The bulk of Elsie Speicher's correspondence is from the months of November - March; between April to October each year the Speichers were usually in Woodstock with Hervey and Mason. Speicher occasionally sends correspondence from friends in common, notably Louise Lindin, Daphne Mattson, Caroline Rohland, Jean Rosen, and Andrée Ruellan.</p>
<p>Early correspondence from Karin Whiteley concerns a project to publish Hervey's memoirs (which were never published). Whiteley's correspondence also includes numerous enclosed newspaper clippings regarding Dan Mason's acting career. Additional correspondence from Karin Whiteley regarding the memoirs is located in Series 3: Memoir Book Production, 1883-1959. Other items of interest in this series includes a letter from Robert Pollack (1918) that includes a Smileage Book (movie coupons from the Military Entertainment Service), a New York City subway ticket, and caricatures drawn by Wilna Hervey, illustrated letters by cartoonist John Striebel, and occasional snapshots of artists and friends. Correspondence to Dan Mason from Hervey and Nan Mason has been separated and is filed with the other personal files of Dan Mason in Series 6, 1919-1928.</p>
<p>This series also includes correspondence that was neither written by Hervey or Mason, nor sent to them. It may be that the letters were sent to Hervey and Mason as enclosures in other correspondence. Such correspondence is arranged at the end of this series as Miscellaneous Collected Correspondence.</p>

<p>The records of the Howard Wise Gallery in New York, and its predecessor the Howard Wise Gallery of Present Day Painting and Sculpture in Cleveland, Ohio, measure 11.4 linear feet and date from 1943-1989. Records consist of correspondence, artist files, exhibition files, business records, writings, and video recordings that document the activities of Wise's gallery in Cleveland from 1957-1961 and, to a lesser extent, his gallery in New York City from 1960-1970. Wise's activities following the closing of the Howard Wise Gallery are also found among the correspondence, artist files, business records, writings, and video recordings. </p>
<p>Correspondence documents the operations of Wise's galleries in Cleveland and New York. A few subject files and a small amount of Howard Wise's personal correspondence (some pre-dating and post-dating the galleries) are also included in this series.</p>
<p>Artist files contain varying combinations of correspondence, printed material, notes and writings, and photographs. Most artists represented in this series were affiliated with Howard Wise Gallery either in Cleveland or New York City, but some files are for individuals of potential interest to the gallery, and those of continued interest to Wise after the closing of the gallery. Exhibition files contain correspondence, printed material, guest lists, and notes. Exhibition files are not a comprehensive record of exhibitions held in Wise's galleries.</p>
<p>Business records include records of cash disbursements that are primarily for Howard Wise's travel and entertainment expenses. Business memoranda and correspondence between the Cleveland and New York galleries document sales, inventory, shipments and financial information. Also among the business records are photographs of the Howard Wise Gallery of Present Day Painting and Sculpture in Cleveland, a set of slides of artworks and installation views dating to the late 1950s, and inventories and loan documentation related to Howard Wise's personal art collection. Writings consist of essays and speeches by Howard Wise, writings on Howard Wise and the Howard Wise Gallery artists by Douglas MacAgy and Marita Sturken, and a typescript recollection of a dinner party conversation with Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger from 1973.</p>
<p>Video recordings include 41 videoreels and videocassettes, a log book of video shot by Wise in the early 1970s, and a program for a screening of his videos held in Wellfleet, Mass. Recordings are mainly unedited footage of interviews with artists and community figures, gallery openings, and other community events in Wellfleet, Mass. and the greater Cape Cod region. A log book and detailed labels on videos provide details about their content. Three edited works made by Wise from the raw footage include "video portraits" of Serge Chermayeff, Edwin Dickinson, and Jack Tworkov. Also found is footage from the premiere performance of Jean Dubuffet's Coucou Bazaar at the Guggenheim Museum, and a dinner party attended by Dubuffet. Video of works by other artists include footage from media and kinetic artworks shown in the Howard Wise Gallery from 1964-1967, as well as a video performance by Hannah Wilke from 1974.</p>

<p>The Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., records measure approximately 203.1 linear feet and date from between 1904 and 1978, with bulk dates of 1913-1974. The records include extensive correspondence files, reference material on American and European collectors and their collections, inventory and stock records, financial records, exhibition files, auction files, and the records of subsidiary companies, including de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc., and Modern Paintings, Inc.</p>
<p>Historians and researchers will find the collection an invaluable resource in tracing the provenance of particular works of art. Although in the early 1940s many records in the Paris office were destroyed by Seligmann staff to keep them from falling into the hands of the occupying German military forces, many records survive, as much of the firm's business had previously come to center in the New York office. In all, the remaining records provide a comprehensive view of the activities and transactions of collectors and art dealers in the years leading up to and following World War II.</p>
<p>Correspondence (Series 1) is the largest series of the collection (80 linear feet) and is comprised of extensive correspondence files, primarily between Germain Seligman and his New York office staff with domestic and foreign private clients, collectors, dealers, individuals representing public museums and collections, and international scholars. The New York Office Correspondence (Series 1.1) concerns a wide variety of topics, including routine business matters, but focuses primarily on potential and realized sales and purchases and provenance documentation. Also found is detailed information on financial transactions, commissions, stock inventory, and the travel of Germain Seligman and other staff. Paris Office Correspondence (Series 1.2) is separated into a small subseries and contains correspondence written primarily by Jacques Seligmann from Paris. The subseries General Correspondence (Series 1.3) is the largest subsection of the Correspondence series and contains letters written to and received from clients and other business associates concerning business transactions and inquiries. The subseries Museum Correspondence (Series 1.4) contains letters between the firm and art institutions and museums. The subseries Germain Seligman's Correspondence (Series 1.5), contains not only personal letters but a wealth of information concerning the affairs of the firm. Much personal correspondence was marked "private."</p>
<p>Also of note in the Correspondence series are the Legal Correspondence Files (Series 1.6) and the Inter-Office Correspondence (Series 1.9) and Inter-Office Memoranda (Series 1.13). The Legal Correspondence Files subseries houses correspondence with both U.S. and Paris attorneys and concerns legal affairs and specific lawsuits. Of particular interest are Germain Seligman's attempts to recover Seligmann family and Paris gallery artwork and other assets stolen or confiscated by the Germans in World War II. This small subseries also contains limited information on the stock and inventory holdings of several of the firm's and Germain Seligman's subsidiary corporations, family legal affairs and lawsuits, and other related legal matters. The subseries Inter-Office Correspondence and Inter-Office Memoranda (called <emph render="italic">fiches </emph>by Seligmann staff) include memos between Germain Seligman and his staff about clients, collectors, sales, acquisitions, and other matters. These offer interesting commentary clearly intended to be read by staff only.</p>
<p>Also prominent is Collectors Files (Series 2), which contains numerous reference files documenting the collections of existing and potential clients with whom Seligmann &amp; Co. maintained contacts. The files are arranged by either individual name or institution and reflect the wide scope of collector references maintained by the firm throughout its operating years. The files contain a variety of reference materials, such as photographs, provenance notes, and sales, purchase, and inventory information in cases where the collector purchased from the firm or the firm purchased from the collector. Researchers will find that many of the private and public names that appear in General Correspondence (Series 1.3) appear in the Collectors Files as well. Also found in this series are specific files relating to the Duc d'Arenberg Collection, the Clarence H. Mackay Collection, the Mortimer L. Schiff Collection, and the Prince of Liechtenstein Collection. The firm either handled substantial estate sales for these collections or purchased and sold important pieces from these collections.</p>
<p>Auction Files (Series 3) and Exhibition files (Series 4) trace the sales and exhibition activities undertaken by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc. In the Auction files, researchers will find documentation of auctions of individual works of art owned by the firm and handled by Christie's, Parke-Bernet, and other auction houses. Of particular interest is the 1948-1949 Parke-Bernet auction of the C. S. Wadsworth Trust, a "dummy" trust set up by the firm to dispose of a portion of its unsold inventory. The Exhibition Files house a variety of documentation, such as catalogs and correspondence, concerning the firm's active exhibition history. Many of the exhibitions featured works of art recently acquired by the firm, such as the 1937 exhibition, <emph render="italic">Twenty Years in the Evolution of Picasso, </emph>which included a number of Picassos the firm acquired from Madame Jacques Doucet that year.</p>
<p>Reference Files (Series 5) includes a card catalog to books and catalogs in the library maintained by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., and a photograph reference index of works of art. Inventory and Stock Files (Series 6) tracks the firm's inventory through a series of stock books and supporting documentation that include sales and provenance information.</p>
<p>Financial Files and Shipping Records (Series 7) consists primarily of records of the New York office, but some Paris office documents can be found scattered throughout. Found in this series is a wide variety of financial records including purchase receipt files, credit notes, invoices, consignment invoices and books, invoices, consular invoices, sales and purchase account books, ledgers, and tax records. The records appear to be quite complete and date from 1910 to 1977. Of particular interest are the purchase receipts and credit notes and memoranda that contain detailed documentation on acquisitions and sales. The consignment invoices provide information about works of art sold on behalf of other galleries and dealers, as well as which galleries and dealers were handling works of art for Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc. Although quite large and complex, the financial records offer a comprehensive overview of the firm's business and financial transactions.</p>
<p>The records of subsidiary companies that were part of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., such as Contemporary American Department, de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc., Modern Paintings, Inc., and Gersel Corp. are arranged in their own series. In 1935, the firm established the Contemporary American Department to represent young American artists. Under the direction of Theresa D. Parker, a longtime gallery employee, the department initiated an exhibition and loan program. Contemporary American Department (Series 8) includes mostly correspondence files and exhibition files.</p>
<p>The largest subsidiary company to operate under Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., was de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc. De Hauke &amp; Co., Inc., Records (Series 9) dates from 1925 through 1949 and contains domestic and foreign correspondence with clients, collectors, and dealers; inter-office correspondence and memoranda with Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc.; administrative and legal files; and financial records. Modern Paintings, Inc., records (Series 10) contains the legal and financial files of this subsidiary company, which was established in 1930 to incorporate most of the stock of the liquidated de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc. Gersel Corp. Records (Series 11) contains a small amount of material from this company.</p>
<p>Researchers should note that a scattering of records from most of the subsidiary companies may also be found throughout additional series, particularly Inventory and Stock Files (Series 6) and Financial Files and Shipping Records (Series 7). Records for the firms Tessa Corp. and Georges Haardt &amp; Co., which were also owned by Germain Seligman, are not part of the Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., Records, although scattered references to these two firms may be encountered throughout the collection.</p>
<p>German Seligman's Personal papers (Series 12) includes scattered family and biographical materials, his research and writings files, and documentation of his personal art collection. Found in Family and Biographical Material (Series 12.1) are photographs of family members, including Jacques Seligmann, and of the Paris gallery. Also found is a limited amount of correspondence concerning Germain Seligman's residency status and his desire to obtain an army commission during World War II. Germain Seligman's research and writing files are found in this series and include material for his books: <emph render="italic">Roger de La Fresnaye, with a Catalogue Raisonné </emph>(1969); <emph render="italic">Merchants of Art, 1880-1960: Eighty Years of Professional Collecting </emph>(1961); <emph render="italic">The Drawings of Georges Seurat </emph>(1947); and <emph render="italic">Oh! Fickle Taste; or, Objectivity in Art </emph>(1952). Documentation of Germain Seligman's private art collection is arranged in this series and includes provenance and research files and correspondence concerning his art collection.</p>
<p>Overall, the historical records of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., offer researchers a comprehensive and detailed resource for studying one of the most active dealers in decorative arts, Renaissance, and European contemporary art. The records clearly document the firm's numerous acquisitions and sales of important works of art to well-known European and American collectors and museums as well as Germain Seligman's extensive client contacts and references. The collection offers an insightful, intriguing, and often fascinating view into the complex field of art sales, trading, and acquisition during the first half of the twentieth century, when many major collections in the United States were formed.</p>
<p>Researchers interested in tracing the provenance of individual works of art should carefully check each series of the collection for information to obtain a complete history for any work. Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., staff set up many different files to cross-reference works of art from various angles, such as artist or creator; collector or collection; most recent owner or repository location; stock inventory number, if owned by Seligmann &amp; Co.; and photographic reference files. The task is made somewhat more difficult by the number of commission sales and joint ownership of works of art, often documented solely in the Inventory and Stock Files (Series 6) or the Financial Files and Shipping Records (Series 7). Only by tracing a name or date through the various series can one find all of the information relating to a particular work of art and its provenance.</p>

<p>The largest in the collection, the Correspondence series includes the general correspondence of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., with individuals and museums; the personal business correspondence of Germain Seligman; legal correspondence and other documentation concerning specific and general legal affairs; abstracts of letters sent; a small group of outgoing correspondence; correspondence of staff and agents Theresa D. Parker, Clyfford Trevor, and Rolf Hans Waegen; and inter-office memoranda.</p>
<p>The entire history of the firm, especially the years when the New York office functioned as the primary headquarters of the company, is well documented in this extensive series. The bulk of the correspondence reflects the period when Germain Seligman directed the firm and the New York office, although there is a small series of Paris office and gallery correspondence written mostly by Jacques Seligmann. Researchers will find correspondence with both U.S. and European clients, collectors, museums, dealers, galleries, shippers, U.S. and foreign government agents, bankers, and insurance firms in the General Correspondence (Series 1.3) and Museum Correspondence (Series 1.4). For additional documentation of the firm's business affairs, researchers should also consult Germain Seligman's Correspondence (Series 1.5), which includes not only personal invitations and announcements but also business correspondence that he considered to be of a more private nature. Legal Correspondence Files (Series 1.6) is arranged in a separate subseries and houses several interesting files concerning general legal affairs, specific lawsuits, and attempts to recover Seligmann family and gallery artwork stolen in Paris during World War II. Also of notable interest is the subseries housing the Inter-Office Memoranda (Series 1.13), which includes notations made by Germain Seligman and staff about clients, collectors, possible sales and acquisitions, and many other business matters. The interesting commentary was clearly intended to be read by staff only.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The letters are mostly written by Jacques Seligmann and Germain Seligman while in the New York office on frequent trips to the United States. Between 1920 and 1922, the firm was managed primarily by Jacques's colleague Eugene Glaenzer and nephew René Seligmann and depended on the Paris office for most of its inventory. When Germain Seligman completed his military service shortly after World War I, he became actively involved in the business affairs of the New York office and began to cultivate and increase the number of the firm's clients and collectors in the United States. Jacques Seligmann died in 1923, and Eugene Glaenzer a few months later, and in 1924 Germain became head of the company. Germain then began to dramatically increase the business of the New York office, thus marking the transition of the firm's headquarters from Paris to New York.</p>
<p>The subjects covered in the correspondence are diverse and primarily concern possible sales or purchases. Found are letters to clients, collectors, dealers, and business associates, most of them American. Many of the names appearing throughout the correspondence are also found in the Paris Office Correspondence (Series 1.2), General Correspondence (Series 1.3), and Museum Correspondence (Series 1.4) that follow.</p>

<p>This small subseries contains letters mostly written by Jacques Selignmann from the Paris office to U.S. clients, collectors, and business associates. Although the earliest date reflected is 1914 and the latest is 1930, the bulk of the letters date from 1921 through 1924 and document the firm's business when the Paris office was its primary headquarters. Many of the same names that appear in the New York Office Correspondence (Series 1.1) and General Correspondence (Series 1.3) are found here as well. Most of the letters are to or from clients, collectors, and dealers concerning possible and realized sales and purchases.</p>

<p>The largest subseries within the Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., records, General Correspondence dates from circa 1913 through 1978 (bulk 1923-1978) and measures 33 linear feet. The general correspondence thoroughly documents the firm's business in its most active New York years when it was directed by Germain Seligman after his father's death in 1923. Although focusing primarily on the business of the New York office, throughout there is scattered correspondence of the Paris office staff, agents, and shippers, particularly René Seligmann, Georges Seligmann, and A. O. Liechti. Also included is the correspondence of Germain Seligman and the firm's employees, partners, and agents such as César de Hauke, Theresa D. Parker, Georges Seligmann, René Seligmann, Clyfford Trevor, and Rolf Hans Waegen. Researchers should note that additional correspondence of Theresa D. Parker is found in the series housing the files of Contemporary American Department (Series 8). Additional correspondence files for Clyfford Trevor (Series 1.10) and Rolf Hans Waegen (Series 1.11) are arranged in their own subseries as well. De Hauke &amp; Co., Inc., Records (Series 9) is arranged in a separate series and also contains extensive correspondence with U.S. and European clients, collectors, dealers, and agents.</p>
<p>The General Correspondence covers a diverse range of the firm's business activities and focuses primarily on client contacts and potential and realized sales and purchases. Included are correspondence with regular and potential clients notifying them of acquisitions that may be of interest; correspondence with both American and European art collectors regarding complicated sales and purchase negotiations; correspondence with American and European agents, dealers, and galleries concerning possible acquisitions, commissions, and sales; correspondence with American and European shippers, insurance companies, and banking agents; and routine correspondence concerning travel plans, research requests, photograph and publication requests, letters of recommendation and introduction, exhibitions, and restoration and authentication of works of art.</p>

<p>The Museum Correspondence is almost identical in content to the General Correspondence (Series 1.3). But rather than correspondence with individual and private clients, collectors, dealers, agents, and other associates, this series houses Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co.'s correspondence files with art museums and public galleries. Of interest is correspondence regarding the firm's acquisitions, sales and purchase negotiations, overseas shipping arrangements, and provenance documentation and research.</p>
<p>Many of the museums and galleries listed below have corresponding files in Museum Files (Series 2.2), which provide information about the public collections of U.S. and European museums and art galleries.</p>

<p>Although designated by the firm as Germain Seligman's personal correspondence, the letters, invitations, notes, and memoranda arranged in these files reveal important information about sales, clients, and acquisitions. The files contain numerous notes and inter-office memoranda written by staff while Germain was traveling that discuss important events, visits, and phone calls to the firm. Information about legal affairs, investments, bank accounts and affairs, insurance, travel plans, and social matters may also be found.

<p>This subseries consists of correspondence and other material that focuses on the legal affairs of the firm. The bulk of the correspondence with the two law firms representing Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., reflect fairly routine legal matters, such as taxes, real estate, investments, corporate filings, license renewals, etc. The remaining files concern specific legal actions or issues, such as asset liquidations, lawsuits, and a partnership with Georges Seligmann. A particularly interesting subseries houses correspondence and other documents associated with the firm's attempts after World War II to recover the stolen artwork and assets of the Paris office and the Seligmann family.</p>

<p>This section of Subseries 1.6 includes correspondence with the New York law firms that represented the gallery in its legal affairs: Rose &amp; Paskus; Benjamin, Galton, &amp; Robbins; and Melvin C. Robbins. The files containing correspondence with the firm of Rose &amp; Paskus, dating from 1924 through 1929, document fairly routine legal matters such as real estate transactions and leases, insurance, taxes, corporate filings, and debt collection. The correspondence with the U.S. law firm of Benjamin, Galton, &amp; Robbins dates from 1938 through 1978 and also concerns routine legal affairs. In this set of correspondence files, however, researchers will also find revealing information about sales, consignments, family legal affairs, a partnership liquidation with Georges Seligmann, and the estate settlement of René Seligmann. The correspondence portrays a close legal and business relationship with Benjamin, Galton, &amp; Robbins. Between 1963 and 1978, Melvin Robbins, formerly of Rose &amp; Paskus, and Benjamin, Galton, &amp; Robbins, handled certain affairs of the firm exclusively; there are two folders of correspondence with Robbins only.</p>

<p>This small section of Subseries 1.6 includes contracts, agreements, financial statements, and supporting correspondence concerning the legal status and rights of Georges Seligmann, cousin to Germain Seligman. When the Paris firm liquidated its assets in the early 1940s, Georges claimed he owned a share of the stock and desired either commissions or a portion of the sales profits from the Paris inventory. These files document the numerous agreements between Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., and Georges Seligmann following the liquidation of the Paris office and the establishment of the "French Company" (in legal contracts this term was used to designate Jacques Seligmann et Fils and G. Seligman &amp; Cie, S.A., Successors in Liquidation), also known as the "Nouvelle Society.") All materials concern the percentages of Georges's commissions, ownership of particular stock and inventory, and the employment of Georges by the firm. Additional financial information about the inventory, sales, and commissions is arranged in Miscellaneous Financial Notes and Files (Series 7.18).</p>

<p>This section of Subseries 1.6 includes mostly letters to the U.S. State Department and Paris attorneys J. A. Tout, M. Chauveau, M. Besson, François Bazin, and Claude Perles concerning the recovery of family and company financial and art assets either frozen or stolen during World War II. The 1940 correspondence is with the U.S. State Department and concerns the filing of documents and affadavits in order for the State Department to afford protection to the firm's assets in Paris. The remaining files postdate World War II and concern the very complicated recovery of art stolen from the Paris office. Found here are interesting letters regarding the European state of affairs at the time, comments and notations about other dealers, names of individuals associated with the sales of stolen art, and detailed information about works of art belonging to the Seligmann family. The 1952 file also contains an interesting letter that outlines the firm's previous liquidations and family financial settlements. Two files at the end of the subseries provide further information regarding the recovery of specific works of art. They contain detailed lists of assets and relate to the importation into France of artwork from other European countries such as England and Switzerland. Much of the correspondence is in French.</p>

<p>This section of Subseries 1.6 includes correspondence and legal documents concerning the ownership and ensuing lawsuit over a series of Italian frescoes known as <emph render="italic">The Story of Griselda. </emph>The frescoes were originally acquired by the firm in the mid-1930s from Gabriel Dereppe and Ignatio (Ignace) G. Pollak in a very complicated legal agreement. Because the Italian government refused to let the frescoes leave the country, the firm entrusted their care to Mrs. Nanni Carla Politi and entered into a false sales transaction with her. Although Mrs. Politi did not actually buy the frescoes, documentation existed that made the transaction appear legitimate. Mrs. Politi then sold the frescoes to a Mr. Pelosi of Italy and kept the funds. These files document the complex trail and lawsuits surrounding the frescoes.</p>

<p>This subseries contains business and scattered personal correspondence of Clyfford Trevor, a modest collector and employee of the firm's New York office. Germain Seligman credited Trevor as a valued associate who helped foster the firm's interest in modern European art. Trevor's family established an art gallery, J. Trevor &amp; Sons, in London in 1896, where Trevor worked before joining the firm of Scott &amp; Fowles. He began his employment in the New York office of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., in 1924, where he stayed until returning to London in 1948 to work as an independent arts consultant. The majority of the correspondence documents Trevor's business trips to U.S. cities cultivating collectors and museums. Letters detail names of contacts made, recommendations on how to proceed with clients, and other pertinent business matters. Letters written in later years include some of Germain's handwritten notations on commissions for Trevor.</p>

<p>The files of Theresa D. Parker, sales associate of the firm, provide a chronological record of the company's activities from 1960 to 1972. Termed "diaries" by Parker, they were used as a communication tool between Parker and Germain Seligman, just as Seligman's Inter-Office Memoranda (Series 1.13) were used to provide instructions or information to the firm's staff. The "diaries" provided updates to Seligman on daily events that occurred when he was away from the office on business or vacation. Entries include notes on conversations with European and U.S. clients and may be supplemented by related documentation such as memoranda, telegrams, or correspondence.

<p>Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., maintained extensive files to track important clients and collectors in the art world. The files within this series reflect the wide scope of contacts and collector references maintained by the firm throughout its operating years. The series is further subdivided into several subseries based on type of reference file.</p>
<p>The first and largest subseries, titled Collectors (Series 2.1), traces artwork owned and sold by private American and European collectors and galleries, with descriptions and sale prices noted, present location of works of art, when known, along with photographs of art pieces and occasional physical descriptions and exhibition text. The Museum Files (Series 2.2) reflects a similar function and arrangement as the Collectors (Series 2.1) files but mainly concerns artwork held, donated to, or purchased by major American and European museums.</p>
<p>Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., acted as agents in the sales of several large and important art collections. Files in the Duc d'Arenberg Collection (Series 2.3) document the involvement in the late 1940s of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. in the sale of objects from the d'Arenberg family's manuscript collection and the firm's activities in arranging for treatment and eventual sale of a select group of paintings that included Jan Vermeer's <emph render="italic">Portrait of a Young Girl</emph> Antoine Watteau's <emph render="italic">Marriage Contract</emph> and Rembrandt van Rijn's <emph render="italic">Tobias Healing His Father. </emph>The firm also conducted sales for the executors of the Estate of Clarence H. Mackay (Series 2.4) in 1939. As a wealthy American collector of Renaissance art and antiquities, Mackay had amassed a large and impressive collection, but many of the items lacked complete documentation. Seligmann &amp; Co. undertook the task of describing, photographing, and documenting the collection in preparation for its dispersal through gallery sales and auction. The Mortimer L. Schiff Collection (Series 2.5) documents the 1937-1938 sale at Christie's of London auction house that was arranged by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., to handle the disposition of the vast art collection of American banker Mortimer L. Schiff. The collection consisted of important oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings by Flemish, French, and German masters, English drawings and watercolors, Beauvais tapestries, Gothic and Renaissance sculpture and bronze, Chinese porcelains, Gothic and Renaissance arms and armor, and decorative arts. The Prince of Liechtenstein Collection (Series 2.6) documents the 1953 purchase by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., of seven Italian marble sculptures from the Prince of Liechtenstein. The sculptures were subsequently sold to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1954.</p>
<p>Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., maintained a variety of records to track the location of important pieces of art as well as background material and addresses of collectors of note. Old Collectors of Interest (Series 2.7) consists of documents that were originally contained in two looseleaf volumes, generally compiled circa 1938-1952, but there are infrequent sales data from earlier dates. The information includes names and addresses of collectors, details of artwork or collections owned by the collectors, along with references to listings or reproduction in art catalogs. Most of this information appears to come directly from the catalogs, but some items record the observations and impressions of Germain Seligman after personally viewing the collection or object. Materials in the Blue Book of Collectors (Series 2.8) were originally contained within a blue-covered looseleaf notebook. Entries list collectors along with their address and occasional details of the artwork they owned. The entries date largely from 1956. Collections Books (Series 2.9) includes four looseleaf notebooks dating from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s that maintained information related to the holdings of art collectors, individual works of art, and negotiations related to the sales or purchases of works of art. The first volume serves as an index to the other three volumes and is arranged by artist and collector or collection. The other three volumes contain memoranda for the record by Germain Seligman, letters and telegrams, lists of works viewed by Seligman along with his opinions about them, and his accounts of conversations held with owners regarding their willingness to sell items. Prospective Clients (Series 2.10) consists of records from five looseleaf binder notebooks. The books contain entries made between the mid-1930s and the mid-1950s by Germain Seligman concerning people he viewed as potential clients, along with notations as to why he viewed them that way. File cards were subsequently made from these files and added to Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., mailing lists. Reserve Notebooks (Series 2.11) consists of records from four spiral notebooks that list client, artwork under consideration, and related material. Entries from the mid-1960s to early 1970s document clients who expressed an interest in a particular work or type of art as well as actual customer requests to reserve a particular work. People of Interest (Series 2.12) consists of additional files maintained on people viewed as potential clients that were largely compiled by Germain Seligman and other staff members during their trips to visit museums, collections, or individual owners or buyers of art. The information centers on American clients, but occasional European customers are also included. The records largely date from 1930 to 1950, with the records regarding Paris and the French provinces dating from 1963 to 1974. European Collectors (Series 2.13) has information similar to that in People of Interest (Series 2.12) but for European and South American regions and in a card file format. The records cover the period from the mid-1930s to the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The Collectors Files series is arranged into the following subseries. More detailed descriptions for each of the subseries follow with a corresponding box and folder inventory.</p>

Occasional correspondence and printed matter and photocopied material (which accounts for the few early dates in the span dates) are also encountered, along with data regarding the collections of the individual owners.</p>

<p>In 1939 Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., was retained by the Clarence H. Mackay Estate's executors to act as agent for the sale of the collection. Mackay was a wealthy American collector of Renaissance and eighteenth-century decorative arts, tapestries, and arms and armor, and he was a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A good portion of his collection was originally acquired through Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., and Mackay had also been a close friend of the firm's partner and associate, Eugene Glaenzer. As many items had no cataloged provenance, Seligmann enlisted the aid of Stephen V. Grancsay, curator of arms and armor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Carl Otto von Kienbusch to help with the authentication and cataloging of the collection.</p>
<p>This subseries is further divided into nine sections that consist of various categories of correspondence, reports, financial files, inventory and stock notebooks, lists, printed matter, and photographs. Of special note within the Paris office (Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co.) folder in Alphabetical Correspondence (Series 2.4.3) is a reply letter dated August 17, 1939, from the museum director and conservator of the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, Germany. It bears the swastika seal of the Nazi regime and is addressed to César M. de Hauke. The director cordially thanks de Hauke for information sent to him regarding the Clarence H. Mackay Collection but states that the museum is not interested in purchasing any of the artwork. Also of interest in the same folder is a letter, dated March 16, 1939, written by Germain Seligman to Georges E. Seligmann, François-Gerard Seligman, and César M. de Hauke, announcing his recent appointment as adviser for the Mackay Collection and detailing items in the collection and their importance. Germain further suggests they "start right away" contacting Marshal Hermann Goering, who he believes may be interested in acquiring armor for his collection.</p>

<p>Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., was contracted by John M. Schiff, son of American banker Mortimer L. Schiff, to handle the disposition of his father's vast collection of artwork. The 1937-1938 sale was arranged through the auction house of Christie's of London, as Germain Seligman believed that the type of artwork in the collection would generate more buyers in Europe than in the United States. The auction was held June 1938. The collection consisted of important oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings by Flemish, French, and German masters, English drawings and watercolors, Beauvais tapestries, Gothic and Renaissance sculpture and bronze, Chinese porcelains, Gothic and Renaissance arms and armor, and decorative arts. Included in the sale were a glazed terracotta, <emph render="italic">Madonna and Child </emph>, by Giovanni della Robbia, and Carlo Crivelli's <emph render="italic">Portrait</emph>. A collection of Italian majolica, not for sale, was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an exhibition.</p>

<p>This series houses reference and provenance files, correspondence, and catalogs relating to auctions, primarily of individual works of art owned by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc. Most of the auctions were handled by Christie's between 1957 and 1975, although there are a few files for auctions held at Parke-Bernet. There is also extensive documentation of the 1948 Parke-Bernet auction of the C. S. Wadsworth Trust, a dummy trust set up by the firm to dispose of a portion of its inventory consisting of Renaissance portraits, Old Masters, late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century French paintings, and French and British eighteenth-century works. Several drawings and paintings by Pierre Bonnard, Edgar Degas, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat, Edouard Vuillard, and other modern artists and masters were included. Although the firm tried to keep the true ownership of the works of art from the public, it was discovered and leaked to the press. Also found in this series are auction catalogs from Christie's, Parke-Bernet, and various auction houses for auctions featuring the firm's works.</p>

<p>Throughout its years of operation, Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., held numerous exhibitions in both the Paris and the New York galleries. This series houses the records related to those exhibitions.</p>
<p>Exhibition records deal with the general logistics of exhibition planning and document staff inquiries to collectors or museums about availability of artwork for loans and other exhibition business. Master artists from the Renaissance and from seventeenth- through nineteenth-century France, as well as Impressionist and early modern painters, were all represented in the exhibitions held in Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. galleries.</p>
<p>Scrapbooks served as a type of archival documentation of some of the exhibitions held in the galleries. Originally part of four large, oversized scrapbooks, the materials include brochures, exhibition text, printed material, and clippings.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous files includes clippings about selected exhibitions, information about competitions and annual shows, correspondence, administrative materials, and shipping materials related to loans of artwork for the exhibitions.

<p>Many of the exhibitions organized by Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., in the early 1930s helped develop Americans' taste for modern art and an interest in modern European painters, such as Juan Gris, Amedeo Modigliani, and Pablo Picasso. This subseries includes an 1936 exhibit of Picasso's works from his Blue and Rose Periods as well as a retrospective of his work. Another major exhibition project was the firm's participation in the 1940 World's Fair. Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. loaned artwork and antiques to the exhibition titled, <emph render="italic">Masterpieces of Art</emph>,which featured works by seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-century artists, such as Francesco de Goya, El Greco, and Diego Velázquez from the Spanish School. Other artists' works that were represented included Paul Cézanne, Honoré Daumier, Jean-Louis David, Edgar Degas, Eugène Delacroix, Paul Gauguin, Theodore Géricault, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh. This subseries includes attendance records, correspondence, memoranda, and minutes of advisory committee meetings, whose director general in charge was Walter Pach. Germain Seligman served on the Exhibition Committee, and another Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. staff member, Rolf Hans Waegen, served as secretary. Other exhibitions represented in this subseries featured important masters drawings and seventeenth- through nineteenth-century French artists. Also included are exhibitions by emerging American artists. Further information on American contemporary painters can be found in Contemporary American Department (Series 8), the records of a subsidiary department of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc.</p>
<p>Significant correspondents found in this series include Alfred H. Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art, and the well-known collector Duncan Phillips.

Inventory catalogs are arranged by location, inventory number, genre, and ownership for stock in New York and Paris.

It was quite common for the firm to remove part of an inventory catalog when an item had been sold and file the sheet in other files in the firm's records. Some of the inventory number sequences overlap due to copies of listings being filed in more than one place.

Although primarily the records of the New York office under the direction of Germain Seligman, a few records of the Paris office are scattered throughout many of the subseries. Most of the financial records of subsidiary companies, such as de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc., and Modern Paintings, Inc., are arranged with the appropriate series housing the records of those companies, except where ledgers and account books share entries for all the companies. Additional receipts, invoices, and other financial documentation are also interspersed throughout Correspondence (Series 1), Auction Files (Series 3), and the Inventory and Stock Files (Series 6).</p>
<p>Quite large and complex, the financial records contain comprehensive documentation of sales and purchases of both the New York and Paris offices. The records include fascinating and revealing information about sales, purchases, provenance, prices, clients, and shared commission sales with other dealers. Several subseries are of particular note. Purchase Receipts/Documentation (Series 7.1) houses a fairly complete set of documentation of the firm's purchases, including the 1937 acquisition of Madame Jacques Doucet's collection of Picassos, which included <emph render="italic">Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. </emph> Price Quote Notebooks (Series 7.3) is also interesting as it documents Germain Seligman's records of "sales calls," including commentary and notes about clients and their collecting interests. Many of the Invoice Books, Account Books and Ledgers (Series 7.8, 7.9, and 7.11, respectively) provide information about individual sales to clients as well as purchases. The earliest Invoice Book dates from 1910 and is from the Paris office; it contains lists of invoices detailing works of art sold to clients such as George Blumenthal, Condé Nast, Henry Walters, and other notable collectors.</p>

<p>This interesting subseries of financial records provides additional details concerning numerous sales and financial transactions of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., in the form of correspondence, notes, and memoranda to clients. Although not all the firm's sales are represented in these files, some very important sales and provenance information are documented in these credit notes.

The bound letterpress volumes were originally filed with Correspondence (Series 1) but were refiled in this subseries because of the similar nature of the documents. Scattered throughout the bound volumes, however, are a few notes and letters that are slightly different in nature. The first bound volume is labeled "Mr. Germain's Private Book" but contains the same type of information as found in the credit notes.

<p>This series documents the activities of the Contemporary American Department, a division of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. that was established in 1935 to represent young and upcoming American artists. Under the direction of Theresa D. Parker, the department initiated a contemporary American art exhibition program, exposing out-of-town artists to audiences in New York and circulating their work nationwide through loans to other galleries and art institutions.</p>
<p>The department was suspended during World War II but, in the years that followed, resumed its activities with a series of exhibitions featuring work primarily by young artists, many of whom had recently completed military service. Artists sponsored by the department were selected from recommendations made by colleges and art centers and included Kahlil Gibran, Arthur Kraft, Rico Lebrun, and Cleve Gray. Parker continued to operate the department until the late 1970s, when it was closed due to the deteriorating health of Germain Seligman.</p>

<p>In the 1920s César M. de Hauke was introduced by René Seligmann to his cousin, Germain Seligman, head of the American branch of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc. Germain Seligman was so impressed by de Hauke's knowledge, interest, and excellent taste in modern art that he decided to help de Hauke set up a new company that would specialize in selling contemporary European and French art in the United States. This was a business venture that Germain Seligman had long wished to try under the auspices of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., but other family members, who were silent partners in the firm, had been reluctant to support the proposition since it was outside the areas within which the company had traditionally dealt.</p>
<p>In 1926 Seligman personally financed the fledgling company, first called International Contemporary Art Company, Inc., and appointed César M. de Hauke its head, but even before the legal documents setting up the company were completed, the name was amended and changed to de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc. Athough the bulk of the new company's art purchases for stock took place in Paris and London, the majority of its sales occurred in the United States.</p>
<p>Seligman and de Hauke worked out an agreement that allowed de Hauke both to purchase works of art that he could sell privately within the de Hauke &amp; Co. gallery as well as to purchase works of art for Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. Ownership of paintings was often shared among various dealers, involving complicated commission transactions upon completion of sales. The two businesses were deeply intertwined, as evidenced by the fact that Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. financial records include a great deal of de Hauke material and many of de Hauke's records are written on Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. stationery. De Hauke &amp; Co. also shared addresses with Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. in New York at 3 East Fifty-first Street and in Paris at 9 Rue de la Paix or 57 Rue Saint-Dominique. By 1927, de Hauke had joined Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., as an employee of that firm.</p>
<p>De Hauke worked actively to bring the work of modern French artists to the attention of American buyers, exhibiting works by Pierre Bonnard, Amedeo Modigliani, Odilon Redon, Ker-Xavier Roussel, and Edouard Vuillard. He was equally interested in French School drawings and watercolors, and the scope of his exhibitions also included works by nineteenth-century masters such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, and Georges Seurat. De Hauke was an acknowledged authority on Seurat.</p>
<p>A Perusal of de Hauke &amp; Co. financial records reveals the wide range of its stock, from decorative arts and frames to paintings, sculptures, glassware, ceramics, leather bindings and writing pads, and prints and drawings by some of the most recognizable names in nineteenth- and twentieth-century art. Included in de Hauke &amp; Co.'s inventory were works by notable European artists such as Georges Braque, Paul Cézanne, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Honoré Daumier, Edgar Degas, Raoul Dufy, Constantin Guys, Fernand Léger, ?douard Manet, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Odilon Redon, Vincent van Gogh, and Edouard Vuillard.</p>
<p>Exceptionally well-known works of art, or studies for these works, are listed among the invoices and ledger books: <emph render="italic">The Palm </emph>by Bonnard; a <emph render="italic">Portrait of Madame Cézanne </emph>(Rewald, <emph render="italic">Paintings of Paul Cézanne: A Catalogue Raisonné</emph>,no. 606); a <emph render="italic">Self-Portrait</emph>,and <emph render="italic">Bathers </emph>(Rewald, <emph render="italic">Paintings of Paul Cézanne</emph>,no. 256) by Cézanne; <emph render="italic">Irises </emph>and <emph render="italic">Le Zouave </emph>by van Gogh; and <emph render="italic">Portrait of Monsieur Choquet </emph>by Renoir.</p>
<p>Even during 1929 and beyond, sales appeared to be brisk despite the general economic downturn. Sales were made to private individuals, such as Lillie P. Bliss, Frank Crowninshield, Duncan Phillips, Henry Reinhardt, Edith Wetmore, and Grenville L. Winthrop. Among the galleries that de Hauke dealt with were Bernheim-Jeune, the Downtown Gallery, and M. Knoedler &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The success that de Hauke &amp; Co. demonstrated in sales helped Germain Seligman to convince other family members of the profitability to be found in modern art, and in 1930 he established Modern Paintings, Inc., as the new modern paintings branch of the New York office. This change led to de Hauke's eventual resignation from Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. in 1931. Legal documents within the series records suggest that the relationship between de Hauke and Seligman had become strained. De Hauke's financial records after 1931 (with the exception of a few miscellaneous items) are not part of the Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. records.</p>
<p>The relationship between de Hauke and Germain Seligman continued to deteriorate after World War II, as evidenced by an exchange of letters in Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., (Series 9.1.6). Writing from liberated France on November 20, 1944, de Hauke asked Germain Seligman's help in obtaining a visa to return to the United States. In a letter from New York City, dated March 16, 1945, Germain Seligman replied, refusing sponsorship without giving specific reasons but hinting at concerns over de Hauke's role in the selling of company property seized by the German forces during the occupation of Paris.</p>
<p>Researchers may especially wish to note the provenance information that can be gleaned from study of the consular invoices, which established the value and authenticity of artworks. De Hauke documented company sales in many ways, including by name of the purchaser, as a daily transaction, and as a consignment. Much overlapping information on sales and provenance can be found in ledgers, invoices, consignment records, consular invoices, and shipping correspondence, so researchers are advised to look in all of these categories to gain a complete perspective on transactions involving specific works of art, individuals, or institutions.</p>

There are seven separate sections to this subseries. Bernheim-Jeune Correspondence (Series 9.1.1) includes letters, contracts, and business transactions between de Hauke &amp; Co. and Bernheim-Jeune, a leading European modern art dealer in the period between the wars. The two largest sections of this subseries, Domestic Correspondence (Series 9.1.2) and Foreign Correspondence (Series 9.1.3) reflect the efforts of de Hauke to cultivate and maintain international associates and clients. Museum Correspondence (Series 9.1.4) includes correspondence with art institutions and museums. Correspondence between staff of de Hauke &amp; Co. and staff of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. can be found in Inter-Office Correspondence (Series 9.1.5) and Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. (Series 9.1.6).

<p>This small series houses the legal and financial files of the subsidiary company Modern Paintings, Inc., which was established in 1930 to incorporate most of the inventory of the liquidated de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc. The stock consisted primarily of contemporary (late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century) European paintings. Modern Paintings, Inc., was not only a subsidiary of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., but also of Tessa Corp., a joint company established by various Seligmann family members who owned inventory of the Paris company when it was legally dissolved and became a branch office of the New York corporation. Modern Paintings, Inc., was liquidated between 1931 and 1934, and most of the stock became the inventory of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., or Gersel Corp., although many of the paintings remained jointly owned by family members or César de Hauke.</p>
<p>Found in this series are scattered correspondence and contracts regarding liquidation and shipping. One file of particular interest contains miscellaneous correspondence, notes, invoices, and other documentation of sales and purchases with dealers such as Bernheim-Jeune, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Inc., and others. There are also inventory lists; bound approval journals that list artwork sent out to potential clients on approval for sale and include names of the clients and lists of artwork; two purchases and sales bound ledgers; two bound general ledgers; consignment invoices for artwork on consignment either to or from the company for sale; and miscellaneous financial notes. Also included are a 1930-1932 bound journal containing an indexed and chronological group of credit and invoice notes; a 1926-1930 bound journal/ledger with reports of accounts, balance sheets, and inventory lists that predates Modern Paintings, Inc., and is primarily for de Hauke &amp; Co., Inc.; and bound shipping and insurance logbooks.</p>
<p>Researchers should note that this series houses information concerning several significant purchases, sales, and commission sales of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century European artwork that were handled through Modern Paintings, Inc., rather than the parent company of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co.</p>

<p>This is a very small series of records of the subsidiary Gersel Corp., which appears to have been in business from the mid-1940s through the late 1960s. The records do not provide any documentation on the establishment or liquidation of the company, but it appears that the company was established to handle the accounts of certain acquisitions and sales that Germain Seligman did not want handled by the main firm, although the firm usually took a commission for the sales. Gersel may have handled artwork acquisitions and sales for which Germain Seligman was the primary owner.</p>

<p>Records found here document research for, and publication of, four books by Germain Seligman. His 1969 edition, <emph render="italic">Roger de La Fresnaye, with a Catalogue Raisonné</emph>, received awards and was highly lauded by art scholars and curators. This work follows from an earlier 1945 monograph on the artist that Seligman wrote, but the 1969 version added more detailed information about the artist and his works and included many illustrations, of which thirty-two were reproduced in color and hand-mounted as plates in the text. <emph render="italic">Merchants of Art, 1880-1960: Eighty Years of Professional Collecting</emph>, published in 1961, provides a history of Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co., Inc., along with Germain's reminiscences about his father and important collectors and collections that were associated with the firm. <emph render="italic">The Drawings of Georges Seurat</emph> was published in 1947, followed thereafter by the 1952 publication of <emph render="italic">Oh! Fickle Taste; or, Objectivity in Art</emph>, in which Seligman addresses the importance of political and social climates in understanding the evolution of art collecting in the United States.</p>
<p>In addition to general research material, files relating to <emph render="italic">Roger de La Fresnaye, with a Catalogue Raisonné</emph> include correspondence with individuals such as Jean Cocteau, Victor and Jean Hugo, and Simone de La Fresnaye. Notes include documentation of interviews conducted with dealers and friends of de La Fresnaye. Some interviewees Germain consulted include Georges Auric, Suzanne de Balasy, Mme. Philippe Clement, Bernard Dorival, Jean Hugo, Valentine Hugo, Mme. Henry Kapferer, Mme. Klotz, M. Knoedler &amp; Co., Inc., Valentine de Miré, Georges Moos, Mme. E. Nebelthau, and André Dunoyer de Sagonzac. Also found are two working manuscripts of the publication with handwritten notes scattered throughout and an addendum to the catalog in the form of an article published in <emph render="italic">Revue de L'Art </emph>in 1972. An early draft of the same article translated into English is also included here.</p>
<p>Files relating to <emph render="italic">Merchants of Art </emph>begin with a draft of the publication, which is dated 1959 in the preface. This appears to be a later version of the 1955 draft of <emph render="italic">Our Business Is Their Pleasure </emph>(Seligman's original title for the book), which can also be found here. <emph render="italic">Our Business Is Their Pleasure </emph>was apparently translated into French as <emph render="italic">Le Musée Dispersé</emph>, and two working copies of a draft of this manuscript are also included here. The records also contain correspondence relating to publication and rights to reproduction of artwork, information that Seligman compiled about significant art collections, and reviews upon publication of the book. Two glass negatives and a photographic print of a painting of Jacques Seligmann (used as an illustration for <emph render="italic">Merchants of Art</emph>) can be found in Family and Biographical Material (Series 12.1).</p>

<p>The papers of architect, and interior designer and planner Florence Knoll Bassett, measure approximately 2 linear feet dating from 1932 to 2000. The collection selectively documents Knoll Bassett's education and her career at Knoll Associates, Inc. from the 1940s until her resignation in 1965, in addition to personal design projects and other activities after leaving the company.

<p>The collection documents the growth of Knoll's international reputation for its modern furnishings and interiors and the impact of a business philosophy that encompassed design excellence, technological innovation, and mass production. The material includes a chronology of Knoll Bassett's career; a portfolio of sketches, drawings and designs; photographs of Knoll Bassett and others; subject files containing sketches and photographic material; letters from friends, colleagues, clients and others; awards received by Knoll Bassett throughout her career; and printed material.</p>

<p>Thirty-four letters (1888-1890) pertain to the Milwaukee Industrial Exposition Association's attempt to raise funds to purchase Koehler's painting "The Strike" for the Layton Art Gallery in Milwaukee. At the time, the painting was on exhibit in the American section of the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris and the letters reflect Koehler's efforts to persuade the officials to permit the painting's removal from the exhibition. One letter (1916) written by George E. Vincent of the University of Minnesota, confirms Koehler's appointment as a lecturer on art history. One letter (1927) written by Marie Koehler to Karl W. Jones, explains why she is sending her husband's correspondence to Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>The Jacques Lipchitz papers and Bruce Bassett papers concerning Jacques Lipchitz measure 52.8 linear feet and are dated circa 1910-2001, with the bulk of the material from the period 1941-2001. Papers are comprised of sculptor Jacques Lipchitz's personal papers and filmmaker Bruce Bassett's papers relating to Jacques Lipchitz. Lipchitz's personal papers contain personal and professional correspondence, comprising nearly half of the series, along with biographical material, writings by and about Lipchitz, printed material, and photographs documenting Lipchitz's commissions, exhibitions, friendships, and interests. Also found are records relating to the compilation and production of <emph render="italic">The Sculpture of Jacques Lipchitz: A Catalogue Raisonné</emph> by Alan G. Wilkinson. The Bruce Bassett papers relating to Jacques Lipchitz consist mainly of Bassett's extensive audiovisual documentation of Lipchitz's life and art. Also found are paper records related to the audiovisual projects, including letters, business records, printed materials, and production records. A small quantity of material unrelated to Lipchitz is also found among the Bassett material, including video and sound recordings related to Sidney Lifchez, IBM, Isamu Noguchi, the Storm King Sculpture Center, and Auguste Rodin.</p>
<p>The Jacques Lipchitz biographical material includes an address book, biographical notes, membership cards, rent receipts and a lease, and a survey of Lipchitz's property in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY.</p>
<p>Correspondence is both professional and personal in nature. Approximately 20 percent is in foreign languages. French predominates, followed by Russian; German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Latvian, Hebrew, and Yiddish are also represented.</p>
<p>Professional correspondence documents business transactions with architects, potential clients, museum officials, art dealers, and others concerning commissions, exhibition plans, loans of artwork, jury service, etc. Art groups, Jewish organizations and charities wrote to solicit donations of artwork for fundraising events and issued invitations to speak or be a guest of honor. Scholars contacted Lipchitz about their research and requested information about specific works by him, items in his collection, and his opinions on a variety of subjects. Also found are fan letters from aspiring artists seeking advice, and from the general public asking for the opportunity to meet Lipchitz and visit his studio. After the 1952 studio fire, many friends and strangers sent letters of condolence and encouragement.</p>
<p>Correspondence with wife Yulla, nephew Gyorgy Hay, and close friends recounts personal and family news, activities, and sometimes touches on future plans. Among these correspondents are: Jenny Courtois, Varian and Annette Fry, Leo Gaspard, R. Sturgis Ingersoll, Gregorio Landau, Juan and Marianne Larrea, Camille Soula, and Joel and Celeste Starrels.</p>
<p>Eleven small pocket diaries, 1940-1965, contain brief, often sporadic entries noting appointments, events, addresses and phone numbers, notes of expenses, and include some sketches. Among the other writings by Lipchitz are: a notebook containing random notes on sculpture; a list of sculptures destroyed in the 1952 studio fire; short pieces and fragments of writings about sculptors Mary Frank, Natan Rapoport, Auguste Rodin, and William Zorach; a memoir of Amedeo Modigliani; and articles and reflections on contemporary art and the church.</p>
<p>Catalogue raisonné records concern the compilation and production of <emph render="italic">The Sculpture of Jacques Lipchitz: A Catalogue Raisonné</emph> by Alan G. Wilkinson, sponsored by Marlborough Gallery, Inc.</p>
<p>Among the financial records are statements of the sculptor's accounts with Buchholz Gallery and Curt Valentin Gallery, and receipts for Lipchitz Collection purchases. Also found are insurance and tax records, as well as receipts for routine professional expenses and miscellaneous personal expenses.</p>
<p>Artwork consists of a few rough sketches by Lipchitz and several geometric designs by an unidentified artist. Two scrapbooks, 1945-1946, consist of newspaper clippings and a few items from other periodicals that mention Lipchitz or contain reproductions of his work. Volume 2 includes typescripts of an interview and remarks delivered by Lipchitz, both very brief.</p>
<p>Printed material consists of exhibition catalogs and announcements, articles, press releases, books, programs, and reproductions concerning Lipchitz's exhibitions, sculpture, commissions, and events honoring him. Of particular interest are architectural prints showing sites and project details of several commissions. Also found are a variety of printed items about general art topics.</p>
<p>Photographs document people, artwork, project sites and models, exhibition installations, events, and places. People include Jacques Lipchitz, family members, and other individuals. Artwork represented is by Lipchitz and other artists. Views of Lipchitz exhibition installations mainly document solo shows. Photographs of events record a variety of occasions, among them: the opening of Lipchitz's studio in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY; a dedication ceremony for Philip Johnson's Roofless Church in New Harmony, IN, with ornamental gates and a sculpture by Lipchitz; and Lipchitz addressing an anatomy class at Albert Einstein Medical College. Among the pictures of places are Lipchitz's studios in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, and Pietrasanta, Italy, and a view of Picasso's Paris studio.</p>
<p>The Bruce Bassett papers relating to Jacques Lipchitz contain mostly audiovisual materials from sound and film documentation projects conducted by Bassett with Lipchitz. Found are original sound recordings and photographs from Deborah Stott's 200 hour oral history with Jacques Lipchitz, as well as detailed, typewritten summaries of its content. Records from Bassett's film projects about Lipchitz include original film and sound recordings from Bassett's 40 hours of interviews with Lipchitz from 1971, and film documentation of the posthumous installations of Lipchitz's large-scale sculptures in Philadelphia, New York, and Israel in the late 1970s. In addition to the raw footage from these projects, which is incomplete, the collection contains workprint and final, edited works Bassett created in multiple versions and formats, and paper records documenting the film projects' creation, production, and later use.</p>
<p>Among the papers related to the film projects are scripts, an index to original footage, programming notes, film lab records, exhibition materials, an extensive collection of questions about Lipchitz gathered from the public for the interactive project, and other production records. Other papers include letters from Lipchitz and his wife, business correspondence, financial records, contracts, project files, and printed materials. Other projects by Bassett, unrelated to Lipchitz, are documented in video and sound recordings related to Sidney Lifchez, IBM, Isamu Noguchi, the Storm King Sculpture Center, and Auguste Rodin.</p>

<p>Among those with whom Lipchtz corresponded regarding commissions are: The Brazilian Embassy ( <emph render="italic">Prometheus Strangling the Vulture</emph>, Ministry of Health and Education, Rio de Janeiro), Vicomte Charles de Noailles ( <emph render="italic">The Joy of Life</emph>) [photocopies of letters from Lipchitz], Jean Devémy (Nôtre Dame de Liesse, Nôtre Dame de Toute Grace at Assy, France), Jane Blaffer Owen (ornamental gates and a cast of <emph render="italic">Nôtre Dame de Liesse</emph> for Philip Johnson's Roofless Church in New Harmony, IN), and the University of Minnesota, Duluth ( <emph render="italic">Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Luth</emph>). There are numerous letters from Fairmount Park Art Association, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and R. Sturgis Ingersoll regarding multiple projects in Philadelphia; from the Emory Memorial and Robert Taft, Jr. about a memorial to Senator Taft; and from Eloise Spaeth concerning a bust of John F. Kennedy. Also documenting commissions are letters from architects, among them: Eero Saarinen and Associates, Kenneth Franzheim, Philip L. Goodwin, I. M. Pei and Associates, Philip L. Goodwin, and Vincent G. Kling and Associates.</p>
<p>Art dealers, galleries, and museums were frequent correspondents. They include: The Baltimore Museum of Art, The Bezalel Museum, Brussels Universal and International Exposition, Buchholz Gallery, Cincinnati Art Museum, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Curt Valentin Gallery, Fine Arts Associates (later Otto Gerson Gallery, Inc.), Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, Inc., Museé Bourdelle, Museé National d'Arte Moderne (Paris), Museum of Modern Art (New York), The Museum of Primitive Art, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Portland Art Museum (Oregon), Rijksmuseum Kröller Muller Otterlo, Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), Walker Art Center, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Worcester Art Museum.</p>
<p>Max N. Benoff, Bernard and Becky Reis, and Alan and Janet Wurtzburger were among the collectors who corresponded with Lipchitz. French artist Pierre Dubaut wrote over an extended period about his collection of Géricault paintings and plans for its eventual disposition. Other individuals who wrote frequently include: critic and writer, Waldemar George; Irene Patai, author of <emph render="italic">Encounters: The Life of Jacques Lipchitz</emph>; and Bert Van Bork, documentary filmmaker and author of <emph render="italic">Jacques Lipchitz, The Artist at Work</emph>; and art historian, Henry R. Hope, a professor active in the College Art Association. The America-Israel Cultural Foundation, Inc. and the International Rescue Committee were also frequent correspondents.</p>
<p>Of particular note is a lengthy letter (with drafts) to Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler in which Lipchitz explained in detail how the art dealer's writings about Cubist sculpture failed to adequately recognize his contributions to the genre. Extensive correspondence with Rabbi Schneerson includes thoughts about "graven images" in sculpture and contains lengthy religious discussions. Letters from Juan Gris and Josette Gris consist mainly of general news and pleasantries; they do, however, mention Juan Gris's health, and in one letter Gris states he is afraid of working too much and tiring himself out. While basically illegible, Gertrude Stein's letters seem to be short, quick notes about meetings.</p>
<p>Correspondence with wife Yulla, nephew Gyorgy Hay, and close friends recounts personal and family news, activities, and sometimes touches on future plans. Among these correspondents are: Jenny Courtois, Varian and Annette Fry, Leo Gaspard, R. Sturgis Ingersoll, Gregorio Landau, Juan and Marianne Larrea, Camille Soula, and Joel and Celeste Starrels.</p>

<p>This series comprises nearly half of the collection. Approximately 20 percent is in foreign languages, primarily French, with a fair amount in Russian; German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Latvian, Hebrew and Yiddish represent the remainder. Correspondence consists largely of incoming letters. Surviving copies of Lipchitz's outgoing letters are mainly drafts, and the earliest ones bear corrections by someone with a better command of English. Drafts of replies often appear on the backs of letters or their accompanying envelopes. Some drafts are written on separate sheets of paper, and multiple letters may appear on a single page.</p>
<p>Jacques Lipchitz's correspondence illuminates his professional career and personal life, with the substance of many letters combining both. Professional correspondence with collectors, galleries, and museum personnel concerns commissions, exhibition plans, loans, jury service, etc. Architects also corresponded about commissions, and dealers apprised Lipchitz of new inventory that might be of interest for his collection. Art groups, Jewish organizations, and charities wrote to solicit donations of artwork for fundraising events, and issued invitations to speak or be a guest of honor. Scholars contacted Lipchitz about their research requesting information about specific works, items in the Lipchitz Collection, and his opinions about various issues. Also found are fan letters from aspiring artists seeking advice, and from the general public asking for the opportunity to meet Lipchitz and visit his studio. After the 1952 studio fire, many friends and strangers sent letters of condolence and encouragement.

<p>Writings by Jacques Lipchitz include a notebook containing random notes on sculpture. The folder titled "Lists of Sculpture" includes a list of items lost in the 1952 fire that destroyed his East 23rd Street studio. Among the miscellaneous writings are short pieces and fragments about Rodin, William Zorach, Mary Frank, and Natan Rapoport; memories of Modigliani; articles and reflections on contemporary art and the church; and a completed questionnaire about <emph render="italic">The Struggle of Jacob with the Angel</emph>. Speeches, with the exception of a transcript of his talk with students at Boston University School of Fine and Applied Arts, March 12, 1965, are unidentified and undated.</p>
<p>Among the writings by other authors are catalog essays, student papers, and a speech about Lipchitz and his work. This series also includes transcripts and notes of interviews with Jacques Lipchitz.</p>
<p>A small number of writings, enclosed with letters, are scattered throughout the correspondence (Subseries 1.1). Most notable is "Homage to Jacques Lipchitz," a poem by John Ciardi, sent with his letter of June 18, 1958.</p>

<p>Photographs document people, artwork, project sites and models, exhibition installations, events, and places. Photographs of people include Jacques Lipchitz, family members, and others. Photographs of artwork include pieces by both Jacques Lipchitz and other artists. Views of Lipchitz exhibition installations in the United States and Europe mainly document solo shows. Photographs of events record a variety of occasions, among them: the opening of Lipchitz's new studio at Hastings-on-Hudson, NY; the dedication ceremony for Philip Johnson's Roofless Church in New Harmony, IN, with ornamental gates and a sculpture by Lipchitz; and Lipchitz addressing an anatomy class at Albert Einstein Medical College. Among the photographs of places are Lipchitz's studios at Hastings-on-Hudson, NY, and Pietrasanta, Italy, and a view of Pablo Picasso's Paris studio.</p>

<p>Photographs of Jacques Lipchitz include a small head shot taken during his early years in Paris, copies of two 1946 portraits by Arnold Newman, views of him in the Hastings-on-Hudson studio, at Modern Art Foundry, and with Yulla. Also found are views of the sculptor's hands.</p>
<p>The Lipchitz family is represented by images of his parents Abraham and Rachel Krinsky Lipchitz, sister Diana, youngest brother Rubin, nephew Georgy Hay, a niece and her daughter. Most were tentatively identified in 2010 by Loyla Lipchitz.</p>
<p>Among the other identified individuals are Josef Albers and Ken Tyler, Jane Blaffer Owen, and Fiore de Henriquez, a young sculptor who lived with the Lipchitz family in the mid 1960s. Photographs of Senator Robert A. Taft probably served as resource material for a bust commissioned circa 1958, and those of President Lyndon B. Johnson were likely used when Lipchitz designed the 1964 Presidential Scholar Medal.</p>
<p>Additional photographs of Lipchitz and others are found among photographs of events (Subseries 1.10.5), and some may be enclosed with letters, scattered throughout the correspondence (Subseries 1.2).</p>

<p>Photographs of The American Jewish Tercentenary Dinner feature President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the main speaker of the evening; Lipchitz does not appear in any views. At the award ceremony sponsored by the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, a citation was presented to Jacques Lipchitz "for the distinction brought upon his profession."</p>
<p>Posed by Lipchitz's ornamental gates are the participants in the dedication ceremony for the Roofless Church in New Harmony, IN: Philip Johnson, architect; Jacques Lipchitz, sculptor; Jane Blaffer Owen whose Robert Lee Blaffer Trust initiated and funded the project; and chaplain to Queen Elizabeth, Right Rev. George F. Macleod of the Church of Scotland.</p>
<p>The purpose of Lipchitz's talk to anatomy students at Albert Einstein Medical College was to share a new perspective on the subject of a practicing artist. From the early 1950s through the mid-1960s Lipchitz frequently appeared on "What in the World," a television show that featured experts who identified and discussed unusual items from the collection of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Bruce Bassett papers concerning Jacques Lipchitz measure 43.3 linear feet and date from 1961 to 2001. The series consists mainly of materials related to Bassett's extensive audiovisual documentation projects concerning the life and art of the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. Also found are paper records including letters, business records, printed materials, and paper production records related to the audiovisual projects. Other projects, unrelated to Lipchitz, include video and sound recordings related to Sidney Lifchez, IBM, Isamu Noguchi, the Storm King Sculpture Center, and Auguste Rodin.</p>
<p>Original sound recordings and photographs from Deborah Stott's 200 hour oral history with Jacques Lipchitz are found, as well as detailed, typewritten summaries of its content. Documentation used in Bassett's film projects about Lipchitz include original film and sound recordings from Bassett's 40 hours of interviews with Lipchitz from 1971, and film documentation of the posthumous installations of Lipchitz's large-scale sculptures in Philadelphia, New York, and Israel in the late 1970s. In addition to the raw footage from these projects, which is incomplete, the collection contains workprint and final, edited works Bassett created in multiple versions and formats, and paper records documenting the film projects' creation, production, and later use.</p>
<p>Among the papers related to the film projects are scripts, an index to original footage, programming notes, film lab records, exhibition materials, an extensive collection of questions about Lipchitz gathered from the public for the interactive project, and other production records. Other papers include letters from Lipchitz and his wife, business correspondence, financial records, contracts, project files, and printed materials.</p>
<p>Records of other projects, unrelated to Jacques Lipchitz, are also found, including video and sound recordings from Bassett's projects about the designer Sidney Lifchez, IBM, the Storm King Sculpture Center, Isamu Nogichi, and Auguste Rodin. Other projects not created by Bassett but found among his papers include two news films related to John F. Kennedy during his presidency, a screenplay entitled <emph render="italic">The Man with Two Sides to His Head</emph> by Anthony Cave Brown, the film <emph render="italic">Man Is My Name</emph>, by Pierre Dominique Guisseau, and a portion of the film <emph render="italic">Dream on Monkey Mountain</emph>.</p>

<p>This series contains tax records, correspondence, invoices, contracts, releases, and project files concerning the work Bassett produced under the auspices of the Jacques Lipchitz Art Foundation and Histor Systems, two organizations he founded. Both entities were concerned mainly with projects documenting the life and work of Jacques Lipchitz, and both contain materials related to the two main Lipchitz projects, namely the documentary and the interactive video installation. The Jacques Lipchitz Art Foundation was dissolved in part because of the Lipchitz family's concerns that its existence would confuse and complicate transactions involving Lipchitz artworks after his death.</p>

<p>Subseries includes financial records, organizational records, correspondence, contracts, and project files related to the major projects carried out through the Foundation. The Bylaws folder includes a list of the JLAF Board of Directors from 1971. Notable documents in Correspondence include a letter from Nelson Rockefeller to Lipchitz, and letters about the creation of a Jacques Lipchitz Sculpture Museum (which never came to pass). The Contracts and Releases folder includes the original media release signed by Jacques Lipchitz. The Brooks Memorial Art Gallery project files document the production of an audioguide in conjunction with a 1974 Jacques Lipchitz exhibition at Memphis, TN museum through correspondence, checklists, drafts of a script, and photographs. The documentary project files contain records of fundraising and distribution of the film, a list of music used, and correspondence describing changes to 1977 version of film. The interactive project files consist mainly of documents related to a demonstration of the interactive system in December, 1973.</p>
<p>Additional documentation of the interactive project is found in series 2.2, Business Records, Histor Systems, and in series 5.2, Film Projects, Interactive Project. A long interview with Lipchitz and a large collection of photographs, both produced under the auspices of the Jacques Lipchitz Art Foundation, are found in series 4, Interview with Jacques Lipchitz conducted by Deborah Stott.</p>

<p>Bruce Bassett founded Histor Systems to continue his work on the Jacques Lipchitz interactive project, as well as some work connected to the Lipchitz Documentary, after the Jacques Lipchitz Art Foundation was dissolved. Under this organization, Bassett also worked to promote the interactive system for use documenting other notable public figures, without success.</p>
<p>This series primarily contains records relating to the presentation of the Lipchitz interactive project, which was usually presented under the title "Conversations with Lipchitz." There are also records relating to the Lipchitz documentary and its later releases with French and Spanish subtitles. Other records in the series include invoices mostly addressed to Hanno Mott, records relating to a demonstration of the interactive system in Israel, and an interactive project file that includes informative and promotional letters about Histor Systems, most notably addressed to Bill Gates and President Jimmy Carter (at the time, a prospective subject for an interactive project). The Interactive Project Files includes a list of Histor Systems directors in 1996.</p>
<p>The last installation of the interactive system to be documented here was with the exhibition <emph render="italic">Lipchitz and the Avant-Garde: From Paris to New York</emph>, in 2001 at Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Krannert Art Museum records relate to the financial and logistical operation of the interactive system, as well as marketing and publicity for the exhibition.</p>
<p>Subseries 2.5, Film projects related to Jacques Lipchitz, contains the actual audiovisual content of the interactive project and the Lipchitz documentary, as well as records related to their production.</p>

<p>Deborah Stott, at the time a graduate student in Art History at Columbia University, recorded roughly 200 hours of conversation with the artist between 1968 and 1970 in Pietrasanta, Italy. The series contains a near-complete run of the sound recordings on 209 sound tape reels (1/4"), as well as detailed typewritten summaries of the subject content for each reel are available at the beginning of the series, and a 32 page transcript of the first reel. 183 of the reels are marked "first dub" and are presumably copies made from the original tape. 26 of the original sound reels are also found, for tape numbers 112-135 and 184-185, and are interfiled with their dubbed copies. Reels 137 and 165 are not extant, but typewritten summaries do exist for those reels. Also found are photographs that document Lipchitz's acquired collection of primitive and ancient art, which are often referred to by number in the interviews. Included are contact sheets, negatives, prints, and photocopies of prints.</p>
<p>This interview was carried out under the auspices of the Jacques Lipchitz Art Foundation and largely funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation.</p>

<p>This subseries contains paper records, artifacts, motion picture film, video, and sound recordings created and used in the production of Bruce Bassett's film projects related to Jacques Lipchitz. Bassett originally shot over 40 hours of motion picture film with synchronized sound recordings in 1971. From this footage he developed the first incarnations of his two main projects: the Jacques Lipcthiz interactive project, also known as "Conversations with Jacques Lipchitz," and a documentary about Lipchitz. Both projects debuted to the public at the 1972 Jacques Lipcthiz retrospective exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. After Lipchitz's death in 1974, Bassett shot additional footage documenting the casting of large-scale Lipchitz sculptures in Italy, and the installations of those sculptures in New York, Philadelphia, and Jerusalem, carried out by his widow, Yulla Lipchitz. This material was used in an updated version of the documentary, which was released around 1977. Subsequent releases occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The interactive project was also exhibited in multiple versions, in a variety of formats as video and computer technology evolved, between 1973 and 2001. See the subseries descriptions below for more detail.</p>

<p>This subseries contains original footage shot by Bassett and his crew and used as the source material for his two film projects documenting Jacques Lipchitz. Bassett's initial filming took place in Italy in August and September of 1971, and later in Philadelphia, Miami, New York, and Jerusalem between 1976 And 1978. Footage from the shoot in Italy contains several long interviews with Lipchitz and footage shot in his Italian studio and foundry. All numbered camera and sound reels from the Italy filming are described in detail in the script book at the beginning of the series. Film and sound footage from the later shoots contain mainly documentation of the posthumous large-scale sculpture installations overseen by Lipchitz's widow, Yulla Lipchitz, as well as multiple interviews with her.</p>
<p>120 of the 171 original sound reels from the Italy filming survive, but very little of the camera footage remains. In addition to original sound reels, a dubbed copy of all of the sound recorded in Italy is found on a smaller set of reels, so any missing original sound reels can be recovered from the dubbed copy. Four miscellaneous, sound-only reels of original sound recordings are also found. None of the original camera reels remain from the Italy shoot, but workprint copies of 20 of the 193 original camera and sound reels were made at a later stage in Bassett's work, possibly to edit new versions of his film projects. These workprints were named "archival prints" by Bassett and are the only remaining raw footage from the 1971 filming period in Italy. Some of them have splices, indicating portions were removed. Reels are listed by the new reel numbers assigned by Bassett when they were re-printed, but their original reel numbers, indexed and described in the script book at the beginning of the series, are also noted. Two unnumbered reels of original footage of Lipchitz working in his studio on the sculpture <emph render="italic">The Last Embrace</emph> are also found in this series.</p>
<p>For later filming in the US and Jerusalem, original camera reels, some with sound on film, and separate original sound reels are found. There is no paper record of these shoots in the collection. Material is arranged by subject and date. Other raw footage found includes four camera reels of sculptures by Lipchitz from the Metropolitan Museum.</p>
<p>Other source material in this series includes stock footage and stock soundtrack, produced by others but used in Bassett's Lipchitz projects, and a couple of short reels of sound effects and titles.</p>
<p>Note that the workprint is silent 16 mm picture unless otherwise indicated, original sound reels are ¼" tape, and soundtrack is 16mm fullcoat magnetic stock. Some of the later foundry and installation footage was shot on reversal positive film with a magnetic stripe soundtrack, identified in the container listing as sound on film.</p>

<p>This subseries contains the edited film and video created for the Lipchitz interactive project, as well as paper records documenting the production and presentation of its various installations.</p>
<p>Audiovisual materials include multiple versions of "answers" compiled from the Lipchitz interviews filmed in 1971, used in multiple interactive installations between 1972 and 2001. Each version exists in a group of 2 to 4 reels or tapes, in its source format of motion picture film, or its installation format of various video types. Each group and its elements is described using the reel names and numbers assigned by Bassett to maintain their connection to paper documentation, and groups are arranged chronologically. The item headings listed below are direct transcriptions of Bassett's labels. Six miscellaneous reels, which do not appear to belong to any of the main groups of film reels, are arranged after the dated reels. Although they may duplicate some of the dated material, these miscellaneous reels were found to be in better condition than some of their copies, so they were retained.</p>
<p>Also found are 117 small film and soundtrack reels of named segments whose titles correspond to segments listed in the source books. These may be outtakes or workprint of the edited Lipchitz answers.</p>
<p>Paper records in this series include the original questions generated by the public during installations of the interactive project. Questions exist in multiple forms including orignal handwritten cards and printouts in multiple sets, each with a different arrangement of data. Notebooks include mainly technical and shot notes, but also notes on an Andy Goldsworthy interview. Production files contain detailed notes on the assembly of segments and revisions to the reels, including a negative pull list for a recent revision. The Program Guide contains annotated indexes to segments on each reel or disc, and other technical notes.</p>
<p>Source Books, found in the paper documentation, provide a scene-by-scene content inventory and transcript of the audiovisual material in each version presented to the public between 1972 and 2001. They also contain notes related to the operation of the interactive program. Although all of the source books contain redundant and similar content, each version has its own annotations and a variety of interfiled production records specific to its particular installation. The 2001 source book from the Krannert Art Museum installation also includes a disc directory, photographs of sculptures in the Krannert exhibit, and an article on Lipchitz.</p>
<p>Technical drawings show the way the video equipment was set up in the installations, showing a user in relation to the interactive system display. The Transcript folder includes a collection of Lipchitz's comments on Pablo Picasso gathered from the footage, a portion of which appears to have been licensed to another production company in the 1980s.</p>

<p>This subseries contains audiovisual and a few paper records related to the documentary Bassett produced about Jacques Lipchitz. The first version was created in 1972 in tandem with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Lipcthiz retrospective exhibition. The documentary was updated in 1977 with footage added from the posthumous large-scale sculpture installations, and then revised again in 1991.</p>
<p>The subseries includes multiple finished versions of the documentary in their presentation and distribution formats (film and video), and pre-print master elements of the finished versions (A+B roll and internegative; master from which distribution copies are made).

<item>New York, 5 November 1888, to Hemy Whitney Cleveland (1836-1907, clergyman and author), Louisville, Kentucky. Bierstadt declines Cleveland 's request to exhibit pictures in Louisville. He cites the primary reason as the recent default of payment by some gentlemen of Louisville for pictures loaned to the Southern Exposition. This, in turn, had caused the collapse of the Art Union (the New York entity that organized the loan exhibition to the Southern Exposition), headed by Enoch Wood Perry (1831-1915). This catastrophe had severe pecuniary consequences for many lending artists, including Bierstadt, who reveals he lost "a thousand dollars out of pocket on the matter."</item>

<item>New York, 28 December 1868, to Samuel A. Coale Jr., St. Louis.Whittredge writes to Coale, a St. Louis merchant and arts patron, apologizing that the little picture Coale recently purchased, a scene in the Lebanon Valley, New York, was not ready to be shipped as a Christmas present to this wife, due to damage sustained to the frame, but it will arrive before New Year's day. He explains that since the price charged was well below cost, Coale will have to pay for the expense of the frame, as well as the boxing and shipping. The picture is a little dry in places, so Whittredge advises Coale to take it out of its frame and spread boiled linseed oil evenly over the surface, in preference to varnish, as the work is displayed under glass.</item>

<p>Correspondence between Mendelson and sculptor Saul Baizerman, 1948-1952, and few letters from others in Baizerman's circle, 1946-1957. Also included are two photographs of Saul Baizerman and one of his wife, painter Eugenie Baizerman (1899-1949). The correspondence stems largely from Saul Baizerman's move from New York to Arizona in late 1948 (in the hope that the climate might relieve Eugenie Bazerman's severe asthma attacks; they then moved in July 1949 to Los Angeles, where Saul taught at the University of California in Los Angeles). Along with over 60 letters from Baizerman, are Mendelson's letters about movies, books, and exhibitions. [Baizerman kept this side of the correspondence and later returned the letters to Mendelson.] Baizerman's letters show his conflicts with his fatally ill wife and the diminution of his creative strength. Mentioned in the correspondence are Louise Mendelson, Mr. Mendelson's first wife, Sylvia Norman, and the poet, May Swenson, who took classes from Baizerman.</p>

<p>The papers of painter and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse date from 1826-2009 (bulk 1826-1871), and measure 0.4 linear feet. This small collection documents Morse's role in the early years of the National Academy of Design through his correspondence as the academy's first president, and also includes scattered biographical material, Morse's writings and notes on art from that period, printed material including clippings about Morse and an exhibition catalog, eight photographs, including one of Morse, and a microfilm reel of one of Morse's sketchbooks.</p>

<p>Morse's biographical material records the $1000 gift to the National Academy of Design bequeathed in his will. Morse's correspondence as president of the academy details the conflicts with the American Academy of Fine Arts, and failed attempts to bring about a union of the two organizations. It also documents other academy business such as exhibitions and interactions with other arts institutions, as well as Morse's independent work as an artist receiving commissions. This correspondence is described in two itemized lists compiled by National Academy of Design staff members which are included in this series. Additional correspondence documents negotiations with Morse's son, Edward L. Morse, to secure the gift of the Morse papers that constitute this collection. </p>
<p>Morse's writings and notes on art, primarily in the form of lectures and lecture notes, can also be found here. They include his "Discourse" on the National Academy of Design delivered on the academy's one year anniversary, a criticism of that address, and Morse's response to the criticism. Some of the loose notes were assigned an alphanumeric identification system that does not appear to be explained in the collection, but has been left as is. </p>
<p>Printed material includes eleven articles about Morse, one 1871 edition of the publication <emph render="italic">Dots and Dashes</emph>, by the Morse Telegraph club, Inc., an obituary for Morse's granddaughter, Clara, and a catalog for the exhibition <emph render="italic">Samuel F. B. Morse: Paintings, Inventions, Documents</emph> (1956) at the Syracuse Museum of Art. Also found is a copy of Morse's 1835 book <emph render="italic">Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States</emph>.</p>
<p>Photographs include a copy print of a photo of Morse taken at fifty-nine years of age, shortly after he sent his first successful telegram between Washington and Baltimore on May 24, 1844; three photographs taken at the April 1968 dedication of a plaque by members of the Morse Telegraph Club; a photo of a tablet on Morse's house; and a photograph of a man, probably Morse's son, William Goodrich Morse. Also found is a photo of a charcoal sketch by Morse of his niece, entitled "Lottie," and a photo of a sketch of an unidentified woman, by Kalman Oswald.</p>

<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>Records of the National Arts Club, spanning the period 1898 to 1960, document the founding of the organization, and its governance, administration, finances, exhibitions, and social activities. There are large gaps in the records and many of those surviving are incomplete, which can be explained by a 1932 resolution of the Board of Governors that "old files and letters and bills in the storeroom prior to 1922 may be destroyed at the discretion of the Secretary and Treasurer."</p>
<p>Minutes and reports of the Board of Governors and Executive Committee are fairly complete through 1949, but sparse thereafter. Records do not exist for all standing and special committees, and those remaining tend to be concentrated in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Correspondence of the officers, for the most part, is routine and relates to administrative matters. Financial records cover the period 1917 to 1950, with a large number of gaps.</p>
<p>A small number of records of the Arts Realty Co. (later known as 15 Gramercy Park, Inc.) are extant. These include lists of stockholders, correspondence concerning mortgage bonds, and minutes.</p>
<p>Membership records, arranged alphabetically, are available for the years 1931 to 1959, and there are rosters arranged by membership category, 1940-1952; in addition, printed membership lists were issued circa 1900-1951.</p>
<p>More than four hundred exhibitions are known to have been held in the galleries of the National Arts Club between 1899 and 1960. Catalogs for 124 National Arts Club exhibitions are available at the Archives of American Art; 69 titles are to be found among the Club's records and an additional 55 were microfilmed previously as parts of other collections. Other exhibition documentation includes printed matter such as invitations, entry blanks, publicity, and photographs (see Appendix A). For some exhibitions, supporting documentation such as correspondence with exhibitors and collectors, sales and consignment records, and shipping receipts have survived. These files are mainly confined to Books of the Year exhibitions, Arts and Crafts/Decorative Arts exhibitions, and a smaller number of exhibitions of Living American Etchers, 1928-1957.</p>
<p>General social events, activities sponsored by Arts Club committees, and special commemorative occasions are documented by invitations, programs, publicity, calendars of events, and photographs. The majority of this material is contained in seventeen scrapbooks, 1898-1940. Programs of the Men's Open Table, 1915-1950, are particularly well documented by the Chairman's correspondence and three volumes containing meeting notices with signatures of members in attendance.</p>
<p>In addition to printed matter relating to exhibitions and events, scrapbooks, 1898-1940, contain general publicity, clippings concerning members, and samples of National Arts Club printed matter such as form letters to the general membership, brochures, ballots, house rules, published membership lists, year books, and the like. Loose printed matter augments that preserved in the scrapbooks. These sources combined provide a fairly complete set of the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph>, but the number of year books is small, and there are catalogs of only slightly more than a third of the exhibitions identified.</p>
<p>Photographs, in addition to those recording exhibitions and events, include portraits of governors, officers, distinguished visitors, speakers, and performers; views of Gramercy Park and the interior and exterior of the clubhouse; and works of art in the permanent collection.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous material includes information on the National Arts Club's first home on West 34th Street, and the Tilden Mansion, its current clubhouse on Gramercy Park; histories of the organization; unpublished speeches presented at Club occasions; and copies of legal documents, including the Club's charter and act of incorporation.</p>

<p>The papers of illustrator, xerography artist, filmmaker, and educator Esta Nesbitt measure 10.05 linear feet and date from circa 1942-1981. Found within the papers are biographical material, correspondence, writings, xerography research files, project and exhibition files, and printed material. Much of the collection relates to Nesbitt's xerography art work. Additionally, the collection includes motion picture film and sound recordings related to her film and performance work.</p>
<p>Nesbitt's primary collaborators, correspondents, and subjects of investigation are not concentrated in any one series but rather recur throughout the collection. Nesbitt worked closely with Anibal Ambert, Merle English at Xerox Corporation, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. She read and wrote about the accrual of information, Albert Einstein, Asian religion and philosophy, communication, computer technology, documentation practices, energy, psychology, Samuel Beckett, and states of consciousness. Chinese characters and an image of Allen Ginsberg appear repeatedly in Nesbitt's works. Subjects of study and experimentation include 3M and Kodak technologies, color, film, morphology, participatory and performance art, shadows, sound, street works, xerography, and Xerox machines. </p>
<p>Biographical material revolves mostly around Nesbitt's work as a professor at Parsons School of Design. Records include Nesbitt's resumé, an exhibition history, motion picture film of the inside of her studio, and teaching files.</p>
<p>Correspondence contains personal letters from family members, and professional correspondence with fellow artists and employees of Xerox Corporation. Much of the series is correspondence between Nesbitt and fellow artists Alan Leder, David Lyle, and R.E. Wood, and is philosophical in nature. Correspondence with Xerox Corporation documents her relationship with the corporation between 1970 and 1972, when they underwrote her experiments in xerography. </p>
<p>Writings include illustrated journals, journals, notebooks, loose notes, and transcripts. The content of the writings varies widely throughout the series and includes artwork, sketches, diagrams, annotated clippings, transcripts of conversations, Nesbitt's writings about her dreams and family, details about her daily life, and notes about artists' materials, film, and sound.</p>
<p>Xerography Research Files document Nesbitt's experiments with xerography, which she often refers to in her papers as "Xerox Xplore." Contents include Nesbitt's definitions of xerography terms; Xerox equipment brochures; clippings; xerography studies; notebooks about Nesbitt's plans, work with color, and xerography study details; and slides and transparencies of completed xerography prints. </p>
<p>Project and Exhibition Files consist of a variety of documentation related to Nesbitt's books, exhibitions, films, performance and participatory art, and other projects. This series contains the bulk of the collection's motion picture films and sound recordings. The film and sound performance piece titled "Everyman as Anyman, or Putting On, On, On, On, On," the piece <emph render="italic">Walk Up --Tape On</emph>, the film "Light Times 499," and exhibitions of Nesbitt's xerography work and her series of work called Shadow Paintings are the most prominent subjects of the series.</p>
<p>Printed Material includes books, clippings, magazines, exhibition announcements, catalogs, and press releases about Nesbitt's interests, artwork, exhibitions, and galleries that exhibited her work. Some of the material is annotated.</p>

However, the series also contains references to many other projects, people, equipment, materials, and techniques. Annotations exist throughout the series. </p>
<p>Brochures are for specific Xerox machine models, referred to throughout the series, and paper types. Clippings concern color, equipment, tools, and techniques related to film, photography, xerography, computer art, computerized communications, computer and video animation, copyrights, and patents.</p>
<p>Notebooks contain lists, ideas, plans, diagrams, sketches, artwork, handwritten tape and conversation transcripts, phone messages, inventories, printed materials, reading notes, and correspondence.TTitles listed below were derived from Nesbitt's handwritten titles appearing on the the covers. Notes mainly concern xerography materials, equipment, techniques, and processes, including the possibilities of working with color. Her work with color is most prevalent in the notebooks labeled: "Xerox Think-Bank Color," "Xerox Xplore 3 Chromacapsagraphics," and "Xerox Xplore Chroma-Capsagraphy." In addition to bound notebooks, there are two folders with loose notes, and some of the notebooks were unbound for preservation purposes.

Xerography studies contain photocopied images as well as source images and materials for Nesbitt's xerography experiments. Notes regarding materials, equipment, techniques, processes, and dates of creation are located on the back of images and loose notes between images. Inventory charts, located in the notebook labeled "Xerox Xplore 2," document many of the prints created for the xerography experiments with a short description of specific studies, date of creation, size, equipment, and technique used.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Projects and Exhibitions series contains a variety of materials related to Nesbitt's books, exhibitions, films, performance and participatory art, and other projects. The bulk of material in the series documents Nesbitt's major multimedia works, and her Xerography and Shadow Paintings exhibitions. Types of documentation are listed under the project or exhibition title, and include correspondence, annotated clippings, microfilm, notes, sketches and diagrams, tape transcripts, motion picture film, sound recordings, photographs, publicity, and source material. </p>
<p>The piece <emph render="italic">Walk up-Tape on</emph> is documented with notes, photographs, and xerography. The one reel of microfilm contains documentation mostly related to <emph render="italic">Walk up-Tape on</emph>. Many, but not all, of the documents reproduced in the microfilm are found in the collection. </p>
<p>Nesbitt's film and sound performance piece titled "Everyman as Anyman, or Putting On, On, On, On, On," was a multichannel projection of silent, super 8 mm films projected with as many as five stationary and moving film projectors alongside multilayered sound recordings. The motion picture film and sound recordings consist of 26 reels of Super 8 film and four sound tape reels. 23 of the film reels are numbered and one is labeled simply "GOD;" note that there is no reel 2 in the collection and the reel labeled GOD has two duplicate reels. Visual content is a wide array of abstract imagery, text, solid color frames, artwork, and split screen imagery, and ranges from three to five second shots to much longer shots. The sound track contains electronic music and spoken word recordings. Sound track reels consist of three reels of preliminary recordings and one master reel, which contains elements of the preliminary recordings compiled onto a single 2-channel track. Additional details about the content of the film and sound reels can be found in the notebooks for this project, and details about how the reels were projected for various performances are found in the notebook labeled "Everyman Projections." Source material for "Everyman" consists of words written on a variety of material, including paper towels, toilet paper, index cards, and foam boards.</p>
<p>The film "Light Times 499," created with Anibal Ambert, consists of a sequence of xerographic prints from Nesbitt's serial work of the same title. Film and sound recordings consist of two reels of 16mm film and one sound cassette. One of the film reels contains splices, and the other appears to be a print of the spliced film. The cassette is labeled "preliminary soundtrack." </p>
<p>The series also contains documentation about the film "Folding/Struck," but not the film itself.</p>
<p>Various materials related to exhibitions document the creation of works through the installation of exhibition to the exhibition itself. Exhibitions of Nesbitt's xerography work include "Electrostatic Structures: 'New Morphs,'" "Electroworks," "Esta Nesbitt: Xerography Prints," and "Xerography --Extensions in Art." Other exhibitions include the participatory exhibition "1000 Empty 49.3 Grams: A participatory environment" and Nesbitt's exhibition of Shadow Paintings.</p>
<p>Other projects documented in this series include a book entitled <emph render="italic">Poems of War and Revolution</emph>, a manuscript entitled "Sea of Movement," and an illustrated journal entitled "Shadow and Pathways."</p>

The rest of the material reflects Nesbitt's interests, dealing with Chinese and Japanese literature, color, communication, creation and duplication of images electronically, energy, film, hallucinogenic experiences, painting, street works, and xerography. In comparison to the rest of the collection, the material in this series has little to no annotations; however, the book and magazine on film are heavily annotated.</p>

<p>The papers of Louise Nevelson measure 30.5 linear feet and date from circa 1903 to 1988. The collection documents aspects of the life and work of the sculptor, focusing especially on her later career. Papers include correspondence, personal business records, writings, scrapbooks, some of Nevelson's early art work, photographs, interviews, awards and honorary degrees, books, and an extensive amount of printed material.</p>
<p>Interviews, awards, and honorary degrees comprise a series of biographical material, along with scattered personal papers such as a graduation program, wedding announcement, teaching certificate, invitations, miscellaneous notes, and material relating to Nevelson's family. Correspondence consists of letters and enclosures from a wide range of professional contacts, including museums and art centers, universities, art associations, women's and charitable organizations, artists, and philanthropists, among others, concerning the exhibition, sale, and donation of Nevelson's art work, and her various arts-related activities, as well as some letters from friends and family. Correspondence can also be found amongst the subject files, which also include clippings, notes, printed and other material organized according to subject and relating to certain exhibitions, and various artistic and professional activities. Whether this organization originates with Nevelson, one of her assistants, or Archives staff is unknown.</p>
<p>Found amongst Nevelson's business records are consignment receipts, statements, correspondence, inventories, disposition cards, notebooks, and lists, stemming from her business dealings with the Martha Jackson Gallery and related matters, usually carried out by her assistant at the time. Business records relate in particular to the large and complex project of inventorying Nevelson's art work undertaken sometime in the early-1960s. Nevelson's writings consist of poems and poem fragments, a short-lived dream journal, scattered writings on art, and drafts from <emph render="italic">Dawns and Dusks: Taped Conversations with Diana MacKown</emph> by Louise Nevelson and Diana MacKown. Also found are a large number of scrapbooks and an extensive amount of printed material, which likely stem in large part from Nevelson's concern to document and keep a record of her accomplishments. Scrapbooks contain clippings, exhibition announcements and catalogs, and other material documenting Nevelson's early career from roughly the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Also included are loose items comprising a scrapbook of sorts on son Mike Nevelson and various scrapbooks compiled by others as mementos of particular events. Printed material includes an extensive amount of clippings and publications, exhibition catalogs and announcements, and a variety of other printed material relating or referring to Nevelson or merely featuring her name in print. Also included are several books, some of which are about or feature segments on Nevelson. This material documents both her critical and commercial success, and her role as personality and minor celebrity in the mass media later in her career, especially during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Art work consists of early drawings and watercolors made by Nevelson as a child and adolescent and while studying art in high school and New York, which document her artistic tendencies as youth and her early development as an artist and which provide an interesting contrast to her later work in sculpture. Photographs include ones of the Berliawsky family and Nevelson as a child, adolescent, and young woman in the 1920s and 1930s before she became known as an artist; ones of Nevelson from the mid-1950s to the 1980s, once she had become known, and began to be honored, as an artist; and ones of Nevelson's art work, as well as of various exibitions and installations of her work. Also included are a number of slides of the artist and her art work, including photographs taken by Dorothy Dehner in the mid-1950s at Louise Nevelson's house on Thirtieth Street.</p>
<p>There is a 40.5 MB unprocessed addition to this collection donated in 2022 that includes digital photographs of a plaque commemoration installed in Louise Nevelson's birth town of Pereyaslav, Ukraine in 2019. Organizers of the event include Julie Gard, Associate Professor of Writing and Associate Director of the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Superior; Yuri Avramenko, Memorial Organizer in Pereyaslav-Ukraine and Maria Nevelson, Founder and Executive Director and Chair of the Board for the Louise Nevelson Foundation. Materials date from 2019.</p>

<p>Series consists primarily of Nevelson's professional correspondence, as well as some personal and family correspondence. Files are typically made up of letters, invitations, greeting cards, and telegrams received by Nevelson, copies of letters sent on her behalf (by lawyers and assistants) or shared with her by others, and photographs, press releases, clippings, and other printed material enclosed with correspondence. Correspondents include artists, dealers, museums, universities, art critics, collectors, arts-related and social organizations, admirers, along with some friends, colleagues, and family members in addition to her son. (See appendix for a select list of notable correspondents.)</p>
<p>General correspondence details the exhibition of Nevelson's work in various group and one-man shows; the consignment, sale, and disposition of her work, especially her dealings with the Martha Jackson Gallery and Daniel Cordier (in Europe); her donations of art work to museums and universities, and for auction by charitable organizations; and the various honors and awards received by her later in her career (including the Creative Arts Medal in Sculpture from Brandeis University and honorary degrees from the Philadelphia College of Art and Bowdoin College, among others). General correspondence also concerns Nevelson's various art-related activities, including her participation on various panels, and in workshops, conferences, and lecture series on art; her involvement in professional organizations, such as the Sculptor's Guild; and her service on various award juries and arts committees (such as the Arts and Entertainment Committee for the Rockefeller Team).</p>
<p>Correspondence is arranged chronologically. Correspondence in this series from the 1966-1979 acquisition has been scanned in its entirety, except for Louise Nevelson's correspondence with her son, Mike. The bulk of correspondence donated by the Farnsworth Art Museum includes an item-level inventory, and is mostly separated by personal and business subject matter.</p>

<p>Series consists of files stemming from Nevelson's business dealings with the Martha Jackson Gallery (her primary representative from 1958 to 1962) and other business matters, usually carried out by her assistant, Tom Kendall, on her behalf; scattered note cards and drawings kept by Nevelson, documenting certain early works and their disposition; and checks, accounting books, as well as loose financial papers. Files include consignment receipts, statements, memos, correspondence, notes, inventories, disposition cards, notebooks, lists, and dummy pages for a Nevelson book (compiled from the text of an interview by Tal Streeter and photographs of Nevelson) that was never completed. </p>
<p>The bulk of the files seem to relate to the large project of inventorying Nevelson's art work, including black wood constructions, white works, bronzes, etchings, and drawings, which was most likely carried out by Nevelson's assistant and gallery staff sometime in the early-1960s. Some inventories provide basic information about art works (including title, dates, dimensions, and so on). More detailed inventories, along with the lists, disposition cards, and notebooks which seem to have been used in compiling them, provide further information about the previous and/or current location, ownership, and disposition of art works. Some photographs and sketches of art work can be found on the disposition cards. Other files relate to the pricing, sale, and exhibition of Nevelson's art work.</p>

<p>Subseries consists of photographs of Nevelson's art work (primarily works in terra cotta, tattistone, and wood, as well as some drawings and paintings). Also included are scattered photographs of paintings by Louis Eilshemius (amongst the ones taken by John Schiff and Jeremiah Russell) and Ralph Rosenborg that Nevelson owned. At least some of the photographs by Schiff seem to have been created for the Nierendorf Gallery; photographs by Russell were likely created for Nevelson; photographs by Buckley Semley, Oliver Baker, and Rudy Burckhardt seem to have been created for the Martha Jackson Gallery (some of these, especially the ones by Semley, may have been used in the inventory of Nevelson's art work carried out by her assistants and gallery staff). Photographs of Nevelson's art work are typically undated, most lack any identifying information, and many are duplicates. Numbers on the verso of some seem to correspond to the art work pictured, however there is no further information about what exactly the number is meant to reference or signify.</p>
<p>Photographs are arranged in files according to photographer. Photographs of various works, art work by Ralph Rosenborg, and unidentified art work are arranged in separate files at the end of the series. Even though most photographs are undated, dates provided represent the decade in which the photographs were most likely created. Files are arranged in rough chronological order.</p>

<p>Subseries consists of glass slides and transparencies of Nevelson and her art work. The photographs on these slides typically do not duplicate those found amongst the artist and art work photographs above. Included are glass slides of photographs taken by Dorothy Dehner, primarily documenting the works of art in the rooms, studio, and garden of Nevelson's house on Thirtieth Street. Dehner's photographs also feature Nevelson at work and posed in front of certain works, outside views of the house, and the Eilshemius paintings and pre-Columbian sculptures owned by Nevelson. Dehner took the photographs on successive trips to Nevelson's house. The slides appear to be numbered in various sequences, perhaps corresponding to each trip. However, at this point, all the slides have been mixed together and it is difficult to reconstruct any meaningful order from the numbers.</p>
<p>Also included are various slides of Nevelson and her art work dating from the 1950s; slides of art work dating from circa 1961, three of which seem to have been used by Tom Kendall in a lecture; slides of Nevelson and her assistant in front of her house, and ones of Nevelson alone in her house and studio dating from the mid-1960s; slides featuring Nevelson posing in front of her art work, at home and in her studio, in her neighborhood, and at a foundry, and slides featuring different views of various outdoor installations of her metal sculptures, all of which date from the 1970s; and glass slides of Nevelson art work, along with some negatives.</p>
<p>Slides are undated; however the dates provided represent the decade in which they were most likely created. Slides are arranged according to type and photographer or subject of photograph.</p>

Many of the writings were originally presented by Nochlin during the 2004 Charles Eliot Norton Lecture Series and subsequently published in the 2006 book <emph render="italic">Bathers, Bodies, Beauty: The Visceral Eye</emph>. Earlier material titled "Bathers" or "Bathtime" is the product of her National Endowment for the Humanities award granted in 1993 to research the representation and practices of bathing in 19th-century France. The folders contain drafts, typescripts, lectures and presentation materials, correspondence, and research material. Additional material can be found within the teaching files in series 6, subseries 6.1.</p>

<p>Printed material produced by OK Harris Works of Art includes a complete set of exhibition announcements. Scattered among the announcements are a small number of invitations to gallery events including receptions, openings, a sock hop, a few performances, concerts, and parties. Although OK Harris presented as many as six concurrent exhibitions every six weeks, the number of exhibition catalogs and posters is very small, reflecting the tight schedule. Earlier printed material is particularly creative and unique, each announcement carving out an attention getting and occasionally humorous approach, some with modest shock value. The graphics are usually interesting as are the materials used. Over time, OK Harris's printed items became more traditional with postcard style announcements predominating. </p>
<p>Printed material produced by others consists of periodicals, books, exibition catalogs, guidebooks and clippings. Most are about or mention Ivan Karp, Marilyn Karp, gallery artists and exhibitions. Exhibition catalogs feature works by OK Harris artists and works loaned by the gallery; also included are catalogs of shows for which Karp was a juror. Miscellaneous items relate to events with Karp as a speaker or juror. Scattered throughout is general information about SoHo and Photo-realism. Exhibition Posters are: "Amerikanske Realister," Randers Kunstmuseum; "Ivan C. Karp Photographs," California State University, Long Beach; "Los Angeles Heute," Amerika Haus; and "Ivan Karp: The Face of Contemporary Art," Hong Kong Institute for Promotion of Chinese Culture. Miscellaneous posters are: "Walt Disney" by W.

<p>The majority of this series consists of photocopies of Ivan C. Karp's journals from the period 1950-2012 (bulk 1991-2012). The earliest are travel journals written during trips to Italy, Spain, France, and more unusual destinations such as Bulgaria, Tunisia, Egypt, Poland, and Guatemala. The observant and thoughtul young Ivan Karp included salient details of travel and everyday life. Some entries are accompanied by drawings, and his interest in wordplay is evident. Later daily journals, written when Karp was an established art dealer, are more organized and less personal. Photographs, clippings, maps, and wine labels are occasionally included to illustrate statements or add interest. He wrote about scheduled activities, food and wine, sports, music, politics, and often commented on the weather. While daily journals record travel experiences at home and abroad, little mention is made of family or friends.</p>
<p>Writings by Karp include articles, introductions and essays for exhibition catalogs, and a chapter in a book about the business of art. Among the writings by others is<emph render="italic"> I Married an Art Dealer</emph> by Marilynn Karp. Also found are an academic paper, "Reflections on American Super Realism and Photo Realism" by Michael Jucker, and a dissertation by Suzanne Pines, "Five Photo-Realists: Process and Perceptions" (Columbia University, 1979).

<p>This series documents Pach's relationships with artists, writers, collectors, museums and other noted art-world figures throughout his life. Early letters record Pach's role in the 1913 Armory Show and the fate of various artists during World War I. Among artists who corresponded with Pach are Arthur B. Davies, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Maurice Prendergast, Diego Rivera, Morton Livingston Schamberg, John Sloan, and Alfred Stieglitz. There are also circa 100 letters from Pach's lifelong friend, Jacques Villon and letters from Thomas Eakins's widow Susan.</p>
<p>Pach's role in the development of the art collections of Walter Arensberg and John Quinn is documented in letters from Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Raoul Dufy, Jean Le Roy, Georges Roualt, and Frederic C. Torrey. Also of note are letters from Bryson Burroughs, curator of painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Letters from art historians, critics and writers such as Bernard Berenson, Van Wyck Brooks, Elie Faure and Leo Stein document their responses to Pach's writings on art, and provide insight into the flow of avant-garde ideas from Europe and their reception abroad. These letters also provide documentation of the European and American art markets in the early twentieth century by referencing responses to, and sales of, work by individual artists.</p>

<p>The papers of sculptor, author, and poet, William Ordway Partridge, who was active in New York City and Washington, D.C., measure 0.2 linear feet and date from 1879-1920, and 1957. This small collection consists primarily of letters to Partridge from artists, political figures, art historians, and authors; drafts and typescripts of Partridge's poems; and two clippings about Partridge's sculpture.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_2d407e3a1ecf94abb7587e5168fe82e5">
<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Letters to Partridge mainly relate to Partridge's sculpture, invitations to events, and responses to invitations sent by Partridge. They include requests to visit his studio and view works in progress. Also found are two letters from Robert C. Winthrop, and Samuel Timmins to others which were probably collected by Partridge for the autographs of Winthrop and Timmins. Additional correspondents are noted in the container listing.</p>

One of the notebooks is illustrated by Pippin with six pencil and crayon drawings of war scenes. Also found are two letters written by Pippin in 1943 and circa 1943.

<p>Pippin recounts his World War I experiences in detail from the time he left the United States on November 17th, 1917 with the 15th N.Y. Infantry for France. Pippin writes of life in the trenches and dug-outs, night forays and traveling through enemy territory, details of days and nights of battles and getting shelled, gassed, and machine gun fire by the Germans, and his perceptions of fighting alongside French and Algerian soldiers. He also recounts the details of getting shot in the shoulder and right arm, lying in the trench too weak to get up, having a French soldier get shot and fall upon him dead and not being able to move out from under the dead man, getting some bread and water from the dead body, and finally being rescued and moved around in the field until being loaded onto an ambulance and taken to one hospital and being transferred to another one. </p>

<p>A second handwritten account of Pippin's World War I experiences in France.

In this notebook, Pippin again recounts a battle with the Germans in France, most probably the same battle as in the other two notebooks. Note, however, that he spells Argonne as Oregon in this notebook, which differs from the writing on the cover. In this account, he recalls more conversations with fellow soldiers and orders from his officers. Again, this notebook ends before his injury occurs.</p>

<p>One letter, circa 1943, is addressed to "My Dear Friends" and begins with "my life story of art. that is my art, and no one el[c]...." wherein Pippin recounts a childhood memory of creating artwork for a Sunday school sale and how the "war of 1917... brought out all of the art in me" and how he paints from it today.</p>
<p>A second letter dated February 1, 1943 is to Robert Carlen, his dealer. Pippin apologizes for Mr. Carlen thinking that he does not treat his friends or Mr. Carlen's friends "right, in my home, if anyone comes in to [see me] art." Pippin will see to it that Mrs. John D. Hamilton is treated as nice as possible. He goes on to say that he wants Carlen to send his Domino game painting to a show so Dr. Albert C. Barnes can see it.</p>

<p>The papers of New York painter Robert Reid measure 0.9 linear feet and date from circa 1880-circa 1930. The collection provides scattered documentation of Reid's career and family history through a certificate, letters, an essay of family recollections, scrapbooks containing letters, writings, printed material and family photographs, printed material about Reid, and photographs of Reid, his studio, travels, and works of art.</p>
<p>Letters are primarily from Robert Reid to his sister Sara Bigelow Reid and document a single year in Reid's life (1887) when he moved to Paris and traveled to Italy, serving as a diary of his activities through October of that year. Writings consist of an essay and journal entries entitled "Really Random Recollections of Charles D. Reid for Robert N. Reid" written by Robert Reid's brother Charles between 1918 and 1920. Scrapbooks 1 and 2 were compiled by Charles D. Reid and document Reid family history. Scrapbook 3 consists primarily of correspondence between Charles D. Reid and various schools concerning his interest in vocational education and a 1913 paper he wrote on that subject. Scrapbook 4 has had most entries removed and is inscribed by Charles D. Reid's father "Jared Reid Jr., Hartford Ct., Jan. 1880." Charles D. Reid presumably removed the entries to place in Scrapbooks 1-3.</p>
<p>Photographs of Reid include a group of men (circa 1880s) with Reid in the back row, of Reid working on a mural, and a 1927 portrait of Reid. Additional photographs of Reid are found in the scrapbooks. Also found is a copy print of Reid's studio, photographs of Europe, photographs of works of art by Reid, and a photograph of the stage and crowd at an unidentified event.</p>

<p>The papers of Cambridge sculptor and illustrator, Lilian Swann Saarinen, measure nine linear feet and date from circa 1909 to 1977. The collection documents Saarinen's career through correspondence with artists, architects, publishers, and gallery owners; writings and notes, including manuscripts and illustrations for children's books and publications; project and teaching files; financial records; artwork, including numerous project sketches; and photos of Saarinen and her artwork. Saarinen's personal life is also documented through diaries and correspondence with friends and family members, including Eero Saarinen, to whom she was married from 1939-1953.</p>
<p>Biographical material consists of resumes and biographical sketches, as well as a 1951 blueprint for the Eero Saarinen and Associates Office Building in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.</p>
<p>Correspondence documents Saarinen's personal and professional life through letters to and from Eero Saarinen and other family members, including six letters from Loja Saarinen; correspondence with artists and architects, including Merle Armitage, Charles and Ray Eames, Carl Koch, Henry Kreis, Carl Milles, Laszlo and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, Robert Venturi, and Harry Weese; and friends and colleagues at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and Knoll Associates. Also documented is Saarinen's business relationship with Midtown Galleries and Caresse Crosby, and publishers and publications including <emph render="italic">Child Life</emph>, <emph render="italic">Interiors</emph>, Otava Publishing Company, and Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, Inc. </p>
<p>Writings and Notes document Saarinen's work on several children's publications, including <emph render="italic">Picture Book Zoo</emph> (1935) and <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> (1946), through correspondence, notes, manuscript drafts, and extensive sketches. This series also includes Saarinen's ideas for other publications and incorporates some early writings and notes, as well as typescripts of her reminiscences about Eliel Saarinen, the Saarinen family, and the Cranbrook Academy of Art. </p>
<p>Diaries consist of bound diary volumes, loose-leaf journal entries, and heavily annotated engagement calendars, documenting Saarinen's personal life, artistic aspirations, and career development from the 1930s-1970s. This material provides a deeply personal view of the emotional landscape of Saarinen's life, her struggles to balance her identity as a working artist with the roles of wife, mother, and homemaker, and the complex, and often competing, relationships within the renowned architectural family into which she married.</p>
<p>Project files document Saarinen's work on book cover designs, federal and post office commissions in Bloomfield, Indiana, Carlisle, Kentucky, and Evanston, Illinois, reliefs for the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois, and other important commissions including the Harbor National Bank Clock in Boston, Massachusetts, the KLM Airlines installation at JFK Airport, the <emph render="italic">Fountain of Noah</emph> sculpture at the Northland Center in Detroit, Michigan, and the interior of Toffenetti's restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Also documented is her role in designs for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, with Eero Saarinen.</p>
<p>Teaching files document Saarinen's "Language of Clay Course" which she taught at Cambridge Art Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>Financial records document exhibition and sales expenses for two exhibitions, including her show at G Place Gallery in 1944.</p>
<p>Printed material consists of clippings about Saarinen and her family, exhibition announcements and catalogs for herself and others, and reference files from the 1930s-1940s, primarily comprising clippings of animals. </p>
<p>Additional printed material documenting Saarinen's career can be found in one of two scrapbooks found in the collection. An additional scrapbook consists of clippings relating primarily to Saarinen's parents.</p>
<p>Artwork comprises extensive sketches, particularly animal and figure sketches, in graphite, crayon, ink, pastel, and watercolor. The sketches demonstrate in particular Saarinen's developing interest in and skill with animal portraiture from her childhood to the 1960s.</p>
<p>Photographs are primarily of artwork and Saarinen's 1944 exhibition at G Place Gallery. Also found are one negative of Saarinen, probably with Eero Saarinen, and a group photo including Lilian, Eero, and Eliel Saarinen with the model for the Detroit Civic Center, circa 1940s.</p>

<p>Saarinen's correspondence files document her personal life and career. Incoming letters form the bulk of the series, but are interspersed with outgoing letters, often in the form of drafts handwritten by Saarinen. Personal correspondence includes letters written between Lilian and Eero Saarinen, which provide insight into their relationship during the 1940s and early 1950s, and their decision to divorce in 1953. These letters also reference professional projects, including Eero Saarinen's involvement in the design of the Antioch College residence halls. Other letters describe Saarinen's planning meetings for the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, and enclose sketches of his preliminary ideas for the project. </p>
<p>Many letters from Susan Hammond, Saarinen's mother, chronicle events in the Swann and Sedgwick families. Hammond frequently enclosed letters sent to her by others about Saarinen in her letters to Saarinen. Family correspondence includes letters from Saarinen's son, Eric, her sister Lucy Livingston Schwartz, letters from other members of the Swann family, and a letter from her cousin, Edie Sedgwick.</p>
<p>Letters which document Saarinen's professional life include correspondence with publishers and publications such as <emph render="italic">Child Life,</emph> for which Saarinen provided illustrations; <emph render="italic">Interiors</emph> regarding the publication of an article by Saarinen about her and her work; Otava Publishing Company, including the 1956 contract for the Finnish edition of <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph>; Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, Inc., relating to the original publication of <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> in 1946; and Rutgers University Press regarding Saarinen's proposed jacket design for the cover of <emph render="italic">A Short Chronology of American History 1492-1950</emph> (1952) by Irving S. and Nell M. Kull. Additional correspondence relating to Saarinen's writings can be found in Series 3: Writings and Notes.</p>
<p>Also found is correspondence with Caresse Crosby regarding the consignment of Saarinen's artwork to Gump's and other galleries in the 1940s, and referencing Crosby's <emph render="italic">Portfolio: An Intercontinental Quarterly</emph>, for which Saarinen provided illustrations. Correspondence with Alan D. Gruskin of Midtown Galleries, who Saarinen contracted to represent her nationally from 1943-1948, includes Saarinen's sketches for her 1944 exhibition at G Place Gallery in Washington D.

<p>The series includes substantial correspondence with other artists and architects, many of whom were personal friends of Saarinen, including Merle Armitage, Walter Baermann, Alexander Calder, Charles and Ray Eames, Carl Koch, Henry Kreis, Carl Milles, Laszlo and Sibyl Moholy-Nagy, Robert Venturi, and Harry Weese. Also found is correspondence with the design firm Knoll Associates, Cranbrook Academy of Art directors and artists Soltan Sepeshy, Maija Grotell and Marianne Strengell, six letters from Loja Saarinen, and a telegram from Eliel Saarinen.</p>
<p>The bulk of the correspondence relating to Saarinen's sculpture commissions can be found in Series 5: Project Files, but related correspondence is scattered throughout this series.</p>

<p>Saarinen was a prolific journal writer and her diaries are in bound volume and loose leaf form. Bound diary volumes from 1930/1931 to 1942 document her life from her "coming out year" and continue through the early years of her marriage to Eero Saarinen. Her 1939 diary opens in Florence, Italy, in August 1939, days before Germany's invasion of Poland, and describes the tenuous situation the newlyweds found themselves in and their difficulties finding passage back to the United States. The diary labeled 1936 and 1937 also contains a series of entries for 1958-1959. Written on the page at the front of the 1939 December-1942 January is the inscription: "Diary-Cranbrook from Sept 1939 To:" and "The new Mrs. E. E. Saarinen!" but any original pages that existed from September-November are missing. The months August-October 1939 are included in the previous diary.</p>
<p>Loose diary entries, beginning around circa 1934 and continuing to 1953, with scattered additional entries in the 1950s-1970s, focus primarily on Saarinen's marriage to Eero Saarinen. They document in depth her emotional struggles as a working mother attempting to forge her own artistic identity, maintain a healthy family environment for her children, and support Eero Saarinen's growing international success, while not allowing that to stymie her own artistic ambitions. These folders include many handwritten notes and drafts of "letters" to Eero Saarinen which are journalistic in nature and include dream journals, "writings and ravings just before wedding," and notes found with her diaries. </p>
<p>Saarinen's engagement calendars are heavily annotated with notes documenting her professional appointments, progress on works of art and commissions, and Saarinen's leisure activities. </p>

<p>Project files document Saarinen's work on a variety of commissions including those for book cover designs, federal government buildings, post offices, schools and playgrounds (particularly the Crow Island School reliefs), companies such as KLM (then Royal Dutch Airlines), businesses such as Toffenetti's restaurant in Chicago, and private clients, including sister-in-law, Pipsan Saarinen. The majority of the projects documented here resulted in fully realized commissions for Saarinen, although several represent ideas and proposals. </p>
<p>Project files typically contain any and all of the following: correspondence and notes, many preliminary sketches, plans and blueprints, and photographs of artwork and project sites, with the bulk of the material being in the form of sketches. Sketches are primarily in graphite, although some are hand-colored with ink and/or paint.</p>
<p>Crow Island school sketches are arranged alphabetically by subject, primarily animals.</p>

<p>The papers of artist Kenneth Snelson measure 21.8 linear feet and date from 1947-2016. While primarily known for his sculptures incorporating the structural principle of tensegrity, Snelson was also a prolific photographer and forerunner of computer art. The collection document's the artist's life and work through chronological files, correspondence, project files, gallery and exhibition files, photographic material, and printed material. </p>
<p>Chronological files detail seven decades of personal and professional activities, beginning with Snelson's summers at Black Mountain College where he studied with Buckminster Fuller. Files contain a diverse array of material including personal photographs, photographs of artwork, printed material, correspondence, life documents, resumes, exhibition records, drawings and sketches, supply receipts, and professional files. </p>
<p>Correspondence in Series 2 is primarily with artists and friends. Notable correspondents include artists Buckminster Fuller, Anthony Hill, Todd Siler, and Shinkichi Tajiri.</p>
<p>Project files comprise nearly half of the collection and extensively document Snelson's sculptures, towers, atom model, computer art, patents, and cataloging and publishing projects. Files include a great deal of photographic material of artwork, models, and installations, as well as sketches, notes regarding specifications, material samples, supply receipts, invoices, and correspondence with dealers, contractors, institutions, and companies commissioning work.</p>
<p>Exhibition and gallery files document dozens of exhibitions and galleries that have represented Snelson over the years in the Unites States, Europe, and Japan. Items include correspondence, photographic material of artworks, installations, and openings, exhibitions lists, floorplans, shipping receipts, invoices, contracts, and printed material including exhibitions catalogs, announcements, and clippings.</p>
<p>Photographic material includes photographic prints, slides, negatives, contact sheets, and transparencies, as well as notes that Snelson kept about camera types and photographic processes. Although personal photographs are included here, the bulk of the material pertains to Snelson's fine art photography in which he experiments with panoramic photography and stereoscopic photography. </p>
<p>Printed material is predominantly comprised of exhibition catalogs, although a few articles and clippings are filed here as well.</p>

<p>The Jack Stewart papers are dated 1926-2010 and measure 9.9 linear feet and 7.31 GB. A significant portion of the collection concerns Stewart's dissertation, "Subway Graffiti: An Aesthetic Study of Graffiti on the Subway" (New York University, 1989), related research, writings, and exhibitions on the subject. Biographical materials, correspondence, writings, printed and digital material, artwork, sketchbooks, and photographic materials document his career as a painter, muralist, designer, educator and administrator.</p>
<p>Biographical materials include a "Video Archive" in digital format, consisting mainly of Jack Stewart being interviewed on several occasions by Nancy Gold for her television show, "What It Takes." In addition to discussions about Stewart's career, the shows include examples of his paintings and murals along with views of him at work.</p>
<p>Correspondence mostly documents Stewart's artistic career and work as an educator and administrator; there is some personal correspondence, as well. Of particular note are letters to Rodman Townsend who commissioned a mural about the human brain; they discuss the details of the project and its evolution, brain research, and subsequent exhibitions of related paintings. Illustrated letters and greeting cards with original artwork are from Violet Baxter, Lorrie Goulet, Wolf Kahn, Clare Romano, Anthony Toney, and Sam Weiner. Herbert Brooks Walker sent several pieces of mail art and, while in Italy, collected graffiti information for Stewart. Letters Stewart wrote to his mother span decades; the best represented periods are the years he served in the U.S. Army and studied at Yale University.</p>
<p>Writings and notes consist of Stewart's dissertation ("Subway Graffiti: An Aesthetic Study of Graffiti on the Subway"), miscellaneous writings and notes, and art and architecture notebooks. Dissertation documentation includes the manuscript, drafts, and related records. Among the miscellaneous writings and notes - published and unpublished - are shorter pieces, articles, student papers, and teaching notes. Of particular interest are notes/instructions for a performance piece titled "Endless Subway," "Memories of Steffan Thomas" and "My Recollection of Charles Egan." Also found are minutes of Cooper Union adjunct faculty meetings (1965-1966), and reports written when provost of the Rhode Island School of Design. Art and architecture notebooks (5 volumes) were compiled while at Yale University.</p>
<p>Research files on graffiti contain many sound recordings and some transcripts of interviews with graffiti writers, voluminous lists of graffiti writers' names/tags, correspondence, notes, photographs, and a wide variety of printed material. Some of the material is in digital format. Stewart began collecting these materials as his interest in graffiti developed. They were used for his dissertation and material continued to be added after the dissertation was completed.</p>
<p>Printed material mentioning Stewart or containing reproductions of his work includes exhibition catalogs, posters, and newsletters.</p>
<p>Artwork by Jack Stewart consists of drawings, paintings, and one etching; also found are designs and plans for tables, murals, and other projects. Drawings include figure studies, heads, and landscapes; most are in pencil and some in ink. The small number of paintings are oil on canvas (removed from stretchers), and gouache on paper and board. Sketchbooks (44 volumes) contain mostly pencil drawings and sketches, and a few studies for paintings and murals. Two volumes include writings about travels and events; of particular interest are "Notes on Kline's funeral May 1962," "Visit to Roman Bronze Art Foundry," and "Notes on My Development."</p>
<p>Photographic materials consist mainly photographs, but also include digital images and 35-mm color slides. Images of Stewart include views of him with paintings and working in his studio. Identified individuals with whom he appears are: Regina Stewart (wife), Brandon Stewart (son), Lil Stewart (mother), Ninalee Craig, Irving Sandler, and students in Urbino, Italy.

<p>A high percentage of the items are dated circa 1975-1988, the years when Stewart was a graudate student at New York University. Items continued to be added after his dissertation was completed. Material added after 2004 largely concerns posthumously published writings. On occasion, these files have been referred to and possibly cited as Jack Stewart's "Mass Transit Art Graffiti collection."</p>
<p>Published posthumously, <emph render="italic">Graffiti Kings: New York Mass Transit Art in the 1970s </emph>by Jack Stewart was based on his dissertation. Of particular note are the interviews (on 30 sound cassettes, 3 sound tape reels, and in digital format), transcripts, lengthy lists of graffiti writers' names/"tags," and Profile of a Common Offender compiled by the New York City Police Department. Interviews consist mainly of graffiti writers looking at slides and identifying graffiti and their writers. Also found in an interview with an official of the New York City Transit Authority. Many of the recordings have transcripts. Some of the transcripts identify slides that were being viewed during the conversation. Other transcripts do not appear to have recordings associated with them in the collection. Some transcripts are handwritten, some are typewritten, and others are simply notes from conversations. Where transcripts have been identified as directly documenting recordings in the collection it is noted in the folder listing. </p>
<p>Also among the research files on graffiti is a copy of the first known instance of graffiti appearing in advertising - a Volvo ad showing the car parked in front of a graffiti covered wall.</p>

<p>Abbott Handerson Thayer's correspondence consists primarily of letters to Thayer, but includes a few handwritten copies or drafts of his outgoing letters. Found here are numerous personal letters to and from family members, including his daughters Mary and Gladys (Galla), his son Gerald (Gra), and his wife Emma (also known as Addie), as well as nephews, nieces, sisters, cousins, and other extended family. There is correspondence with his patrons Charles L. Freer and John Gellatly; with many artists, several of whom were close friends, including Samuel Colman, Thomas Millie Dow, Daniel Chester French, Richard Meryman, Everton Sainsbury, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and E. M. Taber; and former students, such as Ben Foster and Barry Faulkner; with other friends, many of them prominent members of society, such as Samuel Clemens, Royal Cortissoz, Edward Waldo Emerson, and Stanford White. A large amount of Thayer's correspondence concerns his research on protective coloration in nature and the publication of his book <emph render="italic">Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom</emph>. To pursue and defend his theories on concealing coloration, especially as applied to birds, he corresponded with many notable naturalists, biologists, ornithologists, and collection curators. Most notable is his extensive correspondence with Sir Edwin Bagnall Poulton, a British zoologist, and draft letters to Theodore Roosevelt, in defense and promotion of his work. He corresponded with many, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and the War Office in London, promoting his theory on the value of concealing coloration for warships and the military. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent and chronologically within each folder.</p>

<p>The Abraham Joel Tobias papers date from 1913 to 2000 and measure 2.8 linear feet. Through project and exhibition files, printed material, correspondence, and photographs, the collection provides an overview of Tobias's career as a painter and muralist in New York City.</p>
<p>General correspondence regards mural proposals, exhibitions, professional activities, and museums' acquisitions of artwork by Tobias. A file of correspondence with the Fine Arts Federation of New York concerns efforts to recognize murals by Irving Block, James Brooks, Philip Evergood, Abraham Lishinsky, José Clemente Orozco, and Max Spivak as landmarks; it also includes minutes of meetings, 1988-1995, that reflect Tobias's service as a board member. Other correspondence is with friends and artists including Edward Caswell, George Gaber, Filia Holtzman, Vincent La Gambina, and Alton S. Tobey.</p>
<p>Project files document murals such as: <emph render="italic">The Four Freedoms</emph>, Midwood High School, Brooklyn, New York, honoring students and teachers who died in World War II (circa 1946); <emph render="italic">Birth</emph> for the maternity ward at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City (1951-1953); and <emph render="italic">Medical Science</emph> and <emph render="italic">Medical Research</emph>, Long Island Jewish Hospital (1954). The <emph render="italic">Science</emph> and <emph render="italic">Engineering</emph> project file (1958) contains a patent certificate for striated plastic, a material Tobias used in two murals. Also of interest is correspondence with the Harman Foundation regarding a documentary film about Tobias's use of ethyl silicate for outdoor murals. Among the exhibitions documented are: "Plastics U.S.A.," "New York WPA Artists Then and Now," and "Abraham Joel Tobias: Sculptural Paintings of the 1930s."</p>
<p>Printed material consists of announcements, invitations, solo and group exhibition catalogs, and clippings relating to Tobias's artistic career. Also found are pamphlets he designed for the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Photographs are of Tobias's artwork and the artist with friends and family. There is a video recording of an interview with Tobias conducted by Brendan Gill in 1995.</p>
