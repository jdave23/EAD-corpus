      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Daniel Varney Thompson (1902-1980) was an art conservator and historian, professor, engineer, and writer. A noted authority on medieval painting, Varney lived and worked primarily in the Boston area and London. </p>
      <p>Daniel Varney Thompson was born in New Jersey in 1902. He was the son of Grace Randall Thompson and Daniel Varney Thompson, Sr., a classics teacher at the Lawrenceville School and later headmaster of Boston Latin School. American composer Randall Thompson was his older brother. Following family tradition, Thompson attended Harvard, earning the A.B. in 1922 and A.M. in 1926, focusing his attention on fine arts, physical chemistry, and literature. Daniel V. Thompson stopped using the designation Jr. after his father's death in 1932.</p>
      <p>Between 1922 and 1925 Thompson was employed in the Fogg Museum's laboratory devoted to analyzing art materials for the purposes of detecting forgeries, preserving works of art, and devising methods to aid working artists. During this period, Thompson went to Italy as a Sheldon Fellow in Fine Arts, to learn medieval fresco painting techniques from Edward W. Forbes, Director of the Fogg Museum. He also had an opportunity to study medieval and Renaissance painting techniques with Inicio Federico Joni, and while in Italy began life-long friendships with the Forbes family and Bernard Berenson. Thompson served as a technical advisor to the 1924-1925 Second Harvard China Expedition; he traveled to China by way of India, where he studied wall paintings in caves at Ajanta and Elura and researched newly discovered scrolls.</p>
      <p>Daniel Varney Thompson was on the faculty of Yale from 1926-1933, where he taught art history, and tempera painting courses, and laid the foundation for the Department of Fine Arts when Yale became a university in 1932. During his time at Yale, Thompson married Cecile [Cecily] de Luze Simonds.</p>
      <p>When The American Council of Learned Societies awarded Thompson a research fellowship for the academic year 1933/34, he returned to Europe and surveyed major libraries for materials concerning the history of technology of the arts. Thompson was then invited to be Professor of the History of Technology at the University of London. He was on the faculty from 1934-1946, and also served as research and technical advisor, developing a laboratory at the Courtauld Institute for analysis of art materials.</p>
      <p>During World War II, the Courtauld's laboratory - which had facilities for emission, absorption, and x-ray spectrography - was offered to the Ministry of Aircraft Production. To avoid compromising the University's tax-free status, Thompson formed and served as managing director of Daniel Varney Limited, a private company which leased the premises and equipment. From 1940 to 1945, the company was operated in the name of the Courtauld Institute, employing 200 people in tool making, gauge making, fine mechanisms, and development and production of optics instruments. After the war, Daniel Varney Limited shifted its interests to high vacuum diffusion pumps, gas manipulation, and glassblowing.</p>
      <p>Upon returning to the United States in 1947, Thompson settled in the Boston area, becoming a technical consultant. He worked on projects for E-Z Mills, Inc., Sylvania Eloctronics, Comstock &amp; Wescott, Inc., and other corporations. He was chief engineer of Jarrell-Ash Co., 1953-1955, redesigning optical instruments, spectrography, and schlieren systems. Between 1955 and 1957, Thompson served as Vice President of Swett &amp; Sibley, involved with the design and development of optical instruments, scanning spectrometers, and densistometers. He then moved to Avco Corporation, where for the next decade he was a Senior Staff Consultant working on optical design in rocket instrumentation. Thompson retired from his engineering career in 1967.</p>
      <p>Daniel V. Thompson wrote and published extensively. Art-related writings include translations and a monograph published by Yale University Press, and numerous articles and reviews. Translations are: Cennino Cennini's <emph render="italic">Il Libro dell'Arte</emph> (3 volumes: Text of <emph render="italic">Il Libro dell'Arte</emph>, 1932; <emph render="italic">The Craftsman's Handbook</emph>, 1933; and <emph render="italic">The Practice of Tempera Painting</emph>, 1936), and <emph render="italic">An Anonymous Fourteenth Century Treatise</emph> ( <emph render="italic">De arte illuminadi</emph>) (with his student George Heard Hamilton), 1936. A monograph, <emph render="italic">The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting</emph> (foreword by Bernard Berenson) appeared in 1936.</p>
      <p>Most of Thompson's scientific and technical writings are unpublished and relate to projects for which he served as a consulting engineer.</p>
      <p>Soon after retiring, Thompson began a new career that he continued for the remainder of his life. A serious cook and long-time gardener, he began writing about these topics, producing weekly columns that were published by newspapers from Maine to Chicago and contributing articles to <emph render="italic">Gourmet</emph>, <emph render="italic">Horticulture</emph>, and similar periodicals. Thompson also lectured to garden clubs and judged garden and flower competitions.</p>
      <p>Daniel Varney Thompson died on January 4, 1980, following an automobile accident in Malaga, Spain.</p>

          <p>Correspondence documents Daniel Varney Thompson's personal and professional life. Mr. Thompson's brief notes about major correspondents immediately pecede the correspondence. Personal correspondence with friends and family includes many letters exchanged with his wife during their courtship and, later, when absent from home. Among the other family correspondence are a small number of letters from his parents, children, and brother, the composer Randall Thompson. Professional correspondence documents Thompson's academic career, research, and writing, and his later work as a technical consultant and engineer.</p>
          <p>Correspondence concerning Thompson's food and garden writing career and additional personal and professional correspondence is scattered among the Subject Files (Series 3).</p>

            <p>Personal and professional subject files include many relating to engineering consulting projects and research interests. Of particular interest are the files on Bernard Berenson consisting of many letters to Thompson dated 1933-1957 and letters from Nicky Mariano, 1959-1966, and Creighton Giilbert, 1968. All of these items appear on microfilm reel 888. Also of note are a file titled Belle da Costa Greene concerning background information and the circumstances surrounding the death of her adopted son. Extensive correspondence, notes, photographs, and research materials (much photocopied) document Thompson's interest in Kermes beetles, the source of crimson dyes in the Middle Ages.</p>

            <p>The personal and professional writings of Daniel Varney Thompson are on art-related topics, science and technology. An index to medieval manuscripts on craftsmanship in major European libraries was compiled by Thompson in 1935 (2 card files). His work on the subject remains unpublished and his notes are extremely valuable since some of the materials noted were lost in World War II. In addition, there are notes and research materials relating to Thompson's translation work. His scientific and technical notebooks (10 vols.) and various writings and reports document projects undertaken as a technical consultant and engineer from the late 1930s through 1960s. Also extant are two diaries, poems, and student writings.</p>
