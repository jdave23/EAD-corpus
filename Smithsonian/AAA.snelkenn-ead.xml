      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Kenneth Snelson (1927-2016) was a New York City based artist best known for his sculptures incorporating the structural principle of tensegrity, or tensional integrity. </p>
      <p>Born in Pendleton, Oregon, Snelson enrolled in college in his home state, studying painting, sculpture, and engineering. In the summers of 1948 and 1949, he attended Black Mountain College and studied with Buckminster Fuller and Joseph Albers. Snelson then attended the Chicago Institute of Design from 1949-1950, and moved to New York City in 1952. </p>
      <p>For the next decade, Snelson worked as a cameraman for documentary films, often travelling internationally. In the early 1960s, Snelson began exhibiting his sculptures, and gained representation by Dwan Gallery. Snelson completed several commissions and installations of his sculptures over the next decade, including 
<emph render="italic">Tower of Light</emph>, a contribution to the 1964 World's Fair, and <emph render="italic">Needle Tower</emph>, first erected in New York's Bryant Park in 1968. While continuing to work in sculpture throughout his career, Snelson began experimenting with panoramic and stereoscopic photography in the 1970s, and became a forerunner of computer art in the 1980s, using the Silicon Graphics computer to create digital sculptures. </p>
      <p>In addition to Dwan Gallery, Snelson has shown with Sonnabend Gallery, Zabriskie Gallery, Marlborough Gallery, and the artist-run ConStruct Gallery.</p>
      <p>Snelson has been the recipient of numerous awards and prizes including an Honorary Doctorate from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and a prize for sculpture from the National Academy of Design.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The papers of artist Kenneth Snelson measure 21.8 linear feet and date from 1947-2016. While primarily known for his sculptures incorporating the structural principle of tensegrity, Snelson was also a prolific photographer and forerunner of computer art. The collection document's the artist's life and work through chronological files, correspondence, project files, gallery and exhibition files, photographic material, and printed material. </p>
      <p>Chronological files detail seven decades of personal and professional activities, beginning with Snelson's summers at Black Mountain College where he studied with Buckminster Fuller. Files contain a diverse array of material including personal photographs, photographs of artwork, printed material, correspondence, life documents, resumes, exhibition records, drawings and sketches, supply receipts, and professional files. </p>
      <p>Correspondence in Series 2 is primarily with artists and friends. Notable correspondents include artists Buckminster Fuller, Anthony Hill, Todd Siler, and Shinkichi Tajiri.</p>
      <p>Project files comprise nearly half of the collection and extensively document Snelson's sculptures, towers, atom model, computer art, patents, and cataloging and publishing projects. Files include a great deal of photographic material of artwork, models, and installations, as well as sketches, notes regarding specifications, material samples, supply receipts, invoices, and correspondence with dealers, contractors, institutions, and companies commissioning work.</p>
      <p>Exhibition and gallery files document dozens of exhibitions and galleries that have represented Snelson over the years in the Unites States, Europe, and Japan. Items include correspondence, photographic material of artworks, installations, and openings, exhibitions lists, floorplans, shipping receipts, invoices, contracts, and printed material including exhibitions catalogs, announcements, and clippings.</p>
      <p>Photographic material includes photographic prints, slides, negatives, contact sheets, and transparencies, as well as notes that Snelson kept about camera types and photographic processes. Although personal photographs are included here, the bulk of the material pertains to Snelson's fine art photography in which he experiments with panoramic photography and stereoscopic photography. </p>
      <p>Printed material is predominantly comprised of exhibition catalogs, although a few articles and clippings are filed here as well.</p>

          <p>The correspondence here dates from 1948-2009 and is primarily with artists and friends. Notable correspondents include artists Buckminster Fuller, Anthony Hill, Todd Siler, and Shinkichi Tajiri. Several letters from Tajiri are illustrated and include photographic material. Correspondence with Fuller also includes printed material, photographic material, and letters between Snelson and Fuller's estate. Some of the letters pertain to an ongoing intellectual property dispute that Snelson raises against Fuller. Also found here is a sequence of printed email correspondence, which Snelson organized by subject. Correspondence is also found in Series 1, 3, and 4.</p>

          <p>Project files date from 1947-2016 and comprise nearly half of the collection at 10.8 linear feet. Projects include Snelson's sculptures, towers, columns, atom model, computer pictures, patents, and cataloging and publishing projects. Files pertaining to the sculptures, towers, and columns contain a great deal of photographic material of the artwork, models, and installation. Also found are sketches, notes regarding specifications, material samples, supply receipts, invoices, and correspondence with dealers, contractors, institutions, and companies commissioning work. When known, the artwork's creation date is expressed in parentheses, while the expanded date range reflects Snelson's reworking, ongoing research, and documentation of certain projects over a period of years.</p>
          <p>In Snelson's atom model project, he explores parallels between the atom and one of his work processes in which simple forms are combined to create more complex forms. His research led him to communicate with scientists and write several essays expanding on the idea of his atom model. Items found here include correspondence, writings, research, notes, printed material, and photographic material depicting his atom model. Snelson worked with this model for several decades.</p>
          <p>Computer pictures document the artworks that Snelson created in the 1980s and 1990s using the Silicon Graphics 3130 computer and Wavefront software. Files contain correspondence, notes, and printed material pertaining to the computer and software program, as well as photographs and transparencies of dozens of artworks generated with the software.</p>
          <p>Patents include drawings, correspondence, notes, writings, and documents related to the patent process for several inventions, including the atom model and the concept of tensegrity. Cataloging and publishing projects seek to document life events and bodies of work. Items include writings, correspondence with publishers, a chronology, and an inventory that incorporates thumbnail images.</p>
          <p>Snelson's photography and panoramas can be found in Series 5.</p>

          <p>Photographic material dates from 1951-2004 and includes photographic prints, slides, negatives, contact sheets, and transparencies, as well as notes that Snelson kept about camera types and photographic processes. Primary subjects include artwork, New York City, studio spaces, and travel destinations. Although personal photographs are included here, a bulk of the material pertains to Snelson's fine art photography in which he experiments with panoramic photography and stereoscopic photography. Snelson organized many photographs by the type of camera he used, which can be found under the "Camera Type" heading.</p>
