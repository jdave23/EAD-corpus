      <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
      <p>Material on reel 2727 lent for microfilming 1982 by the Moore College of Art. Material on reel 4235 lent for filming in 1989 by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which had received the papers from the Harriet Sartain estate and through descendants of the Sartain family, 1959 and 1988. The Historical Society of Pennsylvania lent the material on reels 4562-4565 in 1991. These papers had been previously microfilmed in 1955 on reels P19-P20, P24 and P27-P28 but were reprocessed for microfilming. A few items filmed in 1955 were missing in 1991. Items not microfilmed in 1991 include manuscript notes for John Sartains's "Reminiscences," and some lecture notes which were unfilmable; 0.3 linear ft. of mss. for articles by various authors appearing in Sartain's magazine; and Samuel Sartain's minute book of the Republican Convention. Rembrandt Peale's "Notes of the Painting Room" was not refilmed in 1991, and is only available on reel P28.</p>
