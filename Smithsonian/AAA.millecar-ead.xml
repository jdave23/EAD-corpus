      <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
      <p>Carl Milles was a sculptor. His wife, Olga, was also an artist. Milles was born in Lagga, Sweden, the son of Major Emil ("Mille") Andersson. He derived his name from the inversion of his father's nickname "Milles (Mille's) Carl". He was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker and studied for 3 years at the Technical School in Stockholm, during which time he befriended sculptor John Borjeson. Between 1897 and 1900, Milles studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. While in Paris, he met artist Olga Granner, whom he married in 1905. In 1902, Milles gained recognition in Sweden with his design for the Sten Sture monument. Milles also studied at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and became a citizen of the United States in 1945.</p>
