<p>Lawrence Leo King, the youngest child of Clyde Clayton and Cora Lee Clark King, was born January 1, 1929 in Putnam, Texas. He fixed on a career as a writer early in his childhood, inspired by the Mark Twain his mother read to him. As early as grade school, King pursued publication of his works. He wrote regularly for the student newspaper at high school where he found a mentor in Aubra Nooncaster, football coach, English teacher and poet. From high school, King joined the army where he was a reporter for his base paper. He wrote professionally as a sports and crime reporter for the <emph render="italic">Hobbs (N. M.) Daily Flare</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Midland Reporter-Telegram </emph>and the <emph render="italic">Odessa American</emph> after a brief stint at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) as a journalism major. In 1954, King moved to Washington, D.C. as the Administrative Assistant to Representative J. T. Rutherford. After Rutherford was defeated in 1962, King joined the staff of another Texas congressman, future House Speaker Jim Wright. In 1964, King quit Capitol Hill to become a free-lance writer.</p><p>The novel, <emph render="italic">The One-Eyed Man</emph>, was published in 1966, but King's chief livelihood as a writer during this time came from his magazine articles. From 1964, King wrote for <emph render="italic">The Texas Observer</emph>, an iconoclastic liberal magazine "then the only voice of dissent (constant) or reason (occasionally) to be found in my native state" (King, <emph render="italic">Blockhead</emph> 20). At the same time, Mississippian Willie Morris, a University of Texas graduate and former editor of the <emph render="italic">Observer</emph>, encouraged King's writing ambitions. Morris gave King his first national exposure in <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph>, where Morris was an editor. In 1967, Morris was named editor-in-chief of <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph> and under his leadership, the magazine became famed for its' exciting and innovative writing. Morris published the brightest literary lights of the day as represented by an impressive list King catalogues in <emph render="italic">The Old Man and Lesser Mortals</emph>: "James Dickey, Jules Feiffer, Robert Penn Warren, Justin Kaplan, Sara Davidson, Jack Richardson, Elizabeth Hardwick, Norman Podhoretz, Arthur Miller, Tony Lucas, George Plimpton, Bud Shrake, Michael Arlen, Joe McGinnis, Alfred Kazin, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, Jeremy Larner, Ward Just, Truman Capote, Herbert Gold, Tom Wicker, Gay Talese, Larry McMurtry, Joan Didion, Philip Roth, John Fowles, Irving Howe . . ." (286). Not to be left out are William Styron, Norman Mailer, Bill Moyers and David Halberstam. King's best magazine work, as witnessed by the dominance of Harper's pieces in King's published collections, was done under Morris's editing. Examples of their collaboration are "Requiem for a West Texas Town", "My Hero LBJ", "The Old Man", and "The Whole World's Turned On."</p><p>King went on to write for numerous, well-known publications including <emph render="italic">Life, Holiday, Cosmopolitan, The Progressive, Playboy</emph> and <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph>. His topics were, in the main, Texas ("Requiem for a West Texas Town," "The Old Man," "The Lost Frontier," "Playing Cowboy") and politics ("My Hero LBJ," "God, Man and William F. Buckley," "The Trial of John Connally"), but he also treated other subjects such as sports, travel, and music.</p><p>In 1978, King penned the book for the hit Broadway musical <emph render="italic">The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas</emph>, based on an article he wrote for <emph render="italic">Playboy</emph>. The success of <emph render="italic">Whorehouse </emph>allowed King to get off what he had come to feel was the magazine treadmill and develop his talent in a different form. He has subsequently seen his plays <emph render="italic">The Night Hank Williams Died, The Kingfish</emph> and <emph render="italic">Golden Shadows Old West Museum </emph>produced.</p><p>During his career, King's work has received much praise. He earned a National Book Award Nomination in 1972 for <emph render="italic">Confessions of a White Racist</emph>. He received a Stanley Walker Journalism Award from the Texas Institute of Letters in 1973 for the article "The Lost Frontier." A television documentary, <emph render="italic">CBS Reports: The Best Little Statehouse in Texas</emph>, earned him an Emmy. He received the Mary Goldwater Award from the Theatre Lobby Trust in 1988 for <emph render="italic">The Night Hank Williams Died</emph>. This same work brought him the Helen Hayes award for best new play in 1989.</p><p>Though a college dropout, King's journalistic talent brought him to Harvard University in the 1969-1970 academic year as a Nieman Fellow. (He chronicled this experience in the October 1970 issue of <emph render="italic">Harper's,</emph> "Blowing My Mind at Harvard".) From Fall 1973 through Fall 1974, King taught as a Ferris Professor of Journalism and Political Science at Princeton University. He was a Duke Fellow of Communications from 1975 to 1976. </p><p>King has lived the majority of his life away from his home state but he continually returns there in his writing. In his own words, "That time and place of my youth -- which, I had been thoroughly convinced contained no story material, has merely provided me with the stuff of a career." (King, National Geographic Speech 1988) By chronicling the Texas that formed him, a Texas that is passing if not past, King, who believes "understanding of the past is vital to the lessons of the present" (King, The Old Man 46) has come to see himself as a leaver of "literary signposts. Those signposts say, simply . . . this is how it was, in my time and my place, when I passed this way . . . . Pass it on!" (C.A.S.T. Speech 1993, SWWC).</p><p>King married Wilma Jeanne Casey (d. 1991) in 1950. They had three children, Alexandria, Kerri Lee King Grandey, and Bradley Clayton. King, divorced in 1964, married on February 20, 1965 Rosemarie Coumaris Kline, who died of cancer June 8, 1972. Since May 6, 1978, King then married Barbara S.

<p>Billy Lee Brammer was born April 21, 1929, in Dallas, Texas. He graduated from North Texas State College in 1952 with a degree in journalism. Brammer was a reporter for the <emph render="italic">Corpus Christi Caller Times</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Austin Statesman</emph>, where he won a press award for excellence in writing in 1952. In 1954, he won the Texas Associated Press Managing Editors Contest for a feature sports story written for the same paper (newly titled the <emph render="italic">Austin American-Statesman</emph>). As the <emph render="italic">Statesman</emph> reported in its January 10, 1954 issue, the prize-winning story was written in Brammer's "usual unusual style."</p>

<p>In 1955, Brammer became an associate editor of the <emph render="italic">Texas Observer</emph>, a magazine of liberal dissent at a time when in Texas "the impulse for dissent scarcely existed" (<emph render="italic">Texas Observer</emph>, August 25, 1961). There he attracted the attention of Texas Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who invited him to join his staff. While employed by Johnson in Washington, D.C., Brammer began working on his first and only published novel, <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph>. The book was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1961 to wide critical acclaim.</p>

<p><emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> (reissued by Texas Monthly Press in 1978 and by Vintage Press in 1984) is where Brammer's literary reputation rests. The book consists of three novellas, all revolving around politics, all dominated by the larger than life, omniscient, manipulative Governor Arthur Fenstemaker. Brammer told friends Fenstemaker was a composite, but the character is largely reminiscent of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Willie Morris calls <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> a "symphony of politics and sex and ambition and the immense Texas landscape [that] remains the great authentic modern novel we have yet of the state" (<emph render="italic">Texas Observer</emph>, Mar 3, 1978).</p>

<p>In 1959, after the still-unfinished <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> had been bought by Houghton Mifflin, Brammer left Johnson's staff to work for the economist Eliot Janeway. <emph render="italic">Time</emph> hired him in 1960 to cover civil rights issues from the magazine's Atlanta office. Brammer quit the <emph render="italic">Time</emph> job in 1961 and thereafter never held sustained employment. He began a sequel to <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> titled <emph render="italic">Fustian Days</emph>, but it was never completed. Though he did write several articles, Brammer never followed up the promise of his first book. Several reasons have been put forth for his writing block: disappointment at being barred from access to Johnson, who was displeased with <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph>; the overwhelming success of his first novel; and drug abuse. Brammer at one point gave his own explanation in a letter dated August 23, 1968 to Larry L. King - the problem was "getting hanged-up with attempts at over-perfection, compounded by uptight-making realization that [one] is really on [one's] own and has to be-god-effing mother produce as fulltime free-lance typewriter fella." (King Papers, The Wittliff Collections)</p>

<p>Various friends tried to help Brammer produce again. Fellow Texan and writer Larry L. King lobbied magazine editors into giving Brammer assignments. Texas columnist Jay Milner hired him as a journalism professor at Southern Methodist University in 1969 and then got him a position as a writer-in-residence at Bowling Green. William Broyles signed him on as a contributing editor for <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>. In 1976, Brammer's former wife, Nadine Eckhardt, asked him to help her write a memoir. Brammer took these offers in earnest, but after an initial spurt of activity he always drifted off. He held numerous other jobs for short periods of time, among them rock and roll promoter, dishwasher, and cook. </p>

<p>Those who knew Brammer remember him fondly and with admiration. Filmmaker Robert Benton testified, "Bill was one of the most charming, charismatic people I've ever met in my life. And he could talk about anything … "(<emph render="italic">Austin Chronicle</emph>, March 26, 1993). Jay Milner, in his syndicated newspaper column, portrayed Brammer as having been a "soft-spoken, gently lecherous, incredibly widely read, avid rock aficionado, ultimately rather seedy bon vivant, neurotic little man ("Remembering Billy Lee Brammer, a man of the Sixties" 1993). Willie Morris reminisced that he was "kind, unselfish, and giving of the things he knew - a sweet, gentle man, a teller of stories who never knew how to attitudinize" (<emph render="italic">Texas Observer</emph>, Mar 3, 1978). Brammer, tongue-in-cheek, did his own summing up in 1976: "Bestowed from birth with a lucy-in-the sky twinkle and irreverence for everything, Brammer bounced around the sub-culture after leaving LBJ, writing unfinished masterpieces by the score, ingesting hogsheads of drugs and acquiring a local image as the best approximation of guru and human wonder around" (Brammer Papers, The Wittliff Collections).</p>

<p>Brammer married Nadine Ellen Cannon (Nadine Eckhardt) on April 22, 1950 while both were students at North Texas State College. They had three children, Sidney Gail, Shelby Ellen, and William Raoul. The two were divorced in 1961. In 1963, Brammer married Dorothy Brown; they were divorced in 1969. Brammer died of a drug overdose on February 11, 1978.</p>

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Edwin "Bud" Shrake Jr. was born to Ruth and Edwin Shrake Sr. in Fort Worth, Texas on September 6, 1931. He was their first child, and took an early interest in writing and painting. By the fifth grade, Shrake had written his first short story, an adventure about World War II fighter pilots. In 1946 he entered Paschal High School in Fort Worth, and quickly became good friends with junior Dan Jenkins. The two future sportswriters, lifelong buddies and sometime-collaborators got their start writing for the <emph render="italic">Paschal Pantherette,</emph> the school newspaper. </p><p>Following high school Shrake enrolled for a year at Texas Christian University, then transferred to The University of Texas at Austin. After two semesters at UT, he returned to Fort Worth and with the help of Jenkins, found part-time work at the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Press</emph>. Soon Shrake was working full-time at the <emph render="italic">Press</emph> alongside Jenkins and under the tutelage of sports-page editor, Blackie Sherrod. Shrake also returned to TCU, this time majoring in English and philosophy, and married Shakespearean scholar, Joyce Rogers. </p><p>In 1953, Shrake, having graduated from TCU, went to New York City to try to land a journalism job there. The <emph render="italic">New York Herald-Tribune </emph>showed interest in his writing, but then Shrake was called up to active duty in the army reserves. Shrake served stateside for two years, and in that time divorced and remarried Joyce. In 1955 he returned to Fort Worth, looking to pick up where he left off.</p><p>The <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Press</emph> hired Shrake back, but this time as a police reporter. Working his beat, he met another life-long friend and collaborator, Gary Cartwright, who reported for the rival newspaper, the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</emph>. Over the next few years, Shrake honed his skills at writing fiction and secured a literary agent. In 1958, Sherrod, having moved to the <emph render="italic">Dallas Times Herald,</emph> convinced Shrake to return to sports writing there. Shrake found success as a sportswriter at the <emph render="italic">Times Herald</emph>, and began to find some as a fiction and script writer too, selling his first short story and teleplay around this time. He also was determined to finish and publish his first novel, a western set among the Comanche and early settlers of Texas.</p><p>That novel, titled <emph render="italic">Blood Reckoning</emph>, was published by Bantam in 1962, and found some success in the pulp paperback market. Shrake by this time had moved to the <emph render="italic">Dallas Morning News</emph> as a sports columnist. His marriage to Joyce deteriorated a second time, and she left him, taking their two young boys with her. Shrake was hard at work on a second, more serious novel, when he met Doubleday editor Ken McCormick, who expressed great interest in the partial manuscript he had read on the sly in Shrake's apartment. </p><p>Shrake worked out a deal with the <emph render="italic">Morning News</emph> to be their "foreign correspondent" so he could travel Europe and finish the novel, which he did. In January 1964 Doubleday published <emph render="italic">But Not For Love</emph> and later that year he rejoined Dan Jenkins, this time in New York City at <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph>. The magazine's editor, Andre Laguerre, recognized Shrake's literary talents and sent him on more in-depth assignments as well as having him do the typical game reportage. Again Shrake used these traveling assignments to spend time researching and writing his fiction. His travels to the Southwest and Mexico in 1966-67 coincided with his work on a black-humor western set in the same locals.</p><p>Doubleday, wanting a book from Shrake on Dallas at the time of the Kennedy assassination, did not support his new novel, <emph render="italic">Blessed McGill</emph>. Although the book, published in January 1968, received favorable attention from literary writers and respected critics, Doubleday did very little to promote it, and the book soon disappeared from the bookshelves. Around this time Shrake made an arrangement with Laguerre that he could keep his job at <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph> and live somewhere else. Shrake chose Austin, Texas as his new home base, and moved there with Doatsy Shrake (nee Sedlmayr), whom he had married in 1966.</p><p>The next novel Shrake wrote, while on assignment in Asia for Sports Illustrated, was a Satyricon-inspired romp set among Texas oil barons, but he had trouble finding a publisher. In the spring of 1971, he went to London to write Strange Peaches, set in Dallas just before and after the Kennedy assassination. Largely autobiographical and based on actual events, Strange Peaches was published by Harper's Press in May 1972, but again disappeared quickly due to almost total lack of marketing effort by the publisher. </p><p>Around this time Shrake started turning his attention outside <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph> to screenwriting. His first two scripts, "Dime Box" and "J.W. Coop" (co-written with Gary Cartwright) were both produced, although the former was released (as <emph render="italic">Kid Blue</emph>) almost two years after production, with very little studio support behind it, and the latter resulted in a high-publicity court case versus the star, Cliff Robertson. This manner of frustrations and near-misses would follow Shrake for the next fifteen years or so as he wrote or co-wrote at least forty-two screenplays and teleplays, many of which were sold to studios but only seven of which actually made it to the screen, including <emph render="italic">Kid Blue</emph> and <emph render="italic">J.W. Coop</emph>.</p><p>Shrake did get two books published in the 1970s: <emph render="italic">Peter Arbiter</emph>—the Texas Satyricon novel—by Encino Press in 1973; and <emph render="italic">Limo</emph>—co-written with Dan Jenkins—by Atheneum in 1976. Much of the decade was spent on writing screenplays, partying with fellow members of Mad Dog Inc. (a satirical company he founded with Cartwright in 1970), and traveling on assignments for <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph>. However, by 1978 Shrake parted ways with the magazine to focus on an ambitious new novel about the early days of the Republic of Texas, and to keep pursuing a breakthrough in Hollywood. In 1979 and 1980 he saw two of his scripts turned into feature films: <emph render="italic">Nightwing</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Tom Horn</emph>, respectively.</p><p>Two more productions of Shrake's scripts followed in 1984: <emph render="italic">Songwriter </emph>and Pancho Villa's <emph render="italic">Wedding Day</emph>. <emph render="italic">Songwriter</emph>, starring Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, was released by Tri-Star. Yet again, however, marketing mishaps and neglect doomed the work to near-oblivion, despite being well-received by the critics. <emph render="italic">Pancho Villa's Wedding Day</emph> was a movie script (under various versions and titles) that Shrake turned into a stage play. The play had two successful runs in Austin that year, first at the Zachary Scott Theatre then at the Austin Opry House.</p><p>That same year a doctor warned Shrake that he would have to clean up his lifestyle or he would be dead within six months. Shrake decided he better follow the doctor's orders, and in 1985 he returned to fiction again. His epic novel about the Republic of Texas, titled "Plum Creek," had been put aside due to lack of publisher interest. Instead he worked on a novel (<emph render="italic">Night Never Falls</emph>) about an alter-ego foreign correspondent who finds himself at Dien Bien Phu and revolutionary Algeria, among other locals. Shrake made a pact with himself to not only write the book without drinking booze, smoking cigarettes or snorting cocaine, but to not even mention Texas in it. Random House published the book in 1987. Then good friend Willie Nelson proposed something new: help him write Nelson's autobiography. Bud set out interviewing numerous acquaintances of Willie's, as well as Willie himself, and crafted a book that was told from both subject's and acquaintances' perspectives. Simon &amp; Schuster published <emph render="italic">Willie</emph> in 1988, and it quickly became a best-seller. Bud Shrake had his first commercial hit on his hands, and it wouldn't be his last, or his biggest.</p><p>Another as-told-to biography immediately followed in 1990, this time of football coach Barry Switzer. The book was another best-seller, but it wasn't until <emph render="italic">Harvey Penick's Little Red Book</emph>, published in 1993, that Shrake really hit the big-time. As with Willie and Barry, Harvey was Bud's longtime friend who had a book deal and asked Shrake to collaborate with him. In this case, what Bud was working with was Harvey's lifetime of golfing wisdom, rather than his life story. The resulting <emph render="italic">Little Red Book</emph> was an instant phenomenon among golfers and became the best-selling sports book of all time. Three sequels quickly followed, along with an anthology and a boundless number of spin-off products.</p><p>Meanwhile, another movie collaboration with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson was completed, this time for television. <emph render="italic">Another Pair of Aces</emph>, based on a script titled "RIP," co-written with Cartwright and dating back to the seventies, was produced in Austin and aired on CBS. Having been divorced from Doatsy for about ten years by now, Shrake became serious with old friend Ann Richards, shortly before she was elected governor of Texas in 1990. Bud accompanied Ann to many state functions during her four-year tenure. They remained close friends and companions until her death in 2006.</p><p>His foray into non-fiction having paid-off handsomely, Shrake returned once again to his first love, fiction. In 1996 he dusted off the "Plum Creek" novel after having let it sit untouched for almost 15 years. Numerous name changes and rewrites followed, and <emph render="italic">The Borderland </emph>was finally published, by Hyperion, in 2000. The next year Scribner published <emph render="italic">Billy Bud</emph>, a shorter, coming-of-age novel about a young golfer in 1950s Fort Worth. </p><p>In 2002, Shrake's writing returned to the stage, this time in London for <emph render="italic">Benchmark</emph>, a collaborative effort with stage writer and director Michael Rudman, another long-time friend. Starting around 2005, Shrake worked on a play eventually titled <emph render="italic">The Friend of Carlos Monzon</emph>, based on his experience in prison in Argentina in 1972 while on assignment there for <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph>. This play eventually was performed posthumously as an experimental, multi-media stage reading in 2010 at the Long Center in Austin. Also in the mid-2000s and in collaboration with Rudman, came <emph render="italic">Jack,</emph> a play set in Jack Ruby's nightclub in Dallas the night after the JFK assassination. To date, this play has yet to be produced. </p><p>While recuperating from kidney-removal surgery in late 2001, Shrake died and had an out-of-body experience with silent visitors who took him away, before being revived by hospital personnel. This life-changing experience would resurface in what would become his last-published novel, <emph render="italic">Custer's Brother's Horse</emph>. Set amid the chaos of post-Civil-War Texas, the book completed a trilogy of early Texas history that Shrake had written, with <emph render="italic">The Borderland</emph> and <emph render="italic">Blessed McGill</emph> being the other two. Another late-period novel that Shrake completed was a pseudo-memoir called "Malibu Zulu," written under a pen name and based on his experiences in Hollywood while working with Steve McQueen on <emph render="italic">Tom Horn</emph>. This novel was published in 2020 as <emph render="italic">Hollywood Mad Dogs</emph> as part of The Wittliff Collections Literary Series.</p><p>Shrake enjoyed a double round of press attention with <emph render="italic">Custer's Brother's Horse</emph> in late 2007 and <emph render="italic">Land of the Permanent Wave </emph>in the spring of 2008, an anthology of his writing that covers his entire career. In the fall of 2008, Shrake found out he had inoperable lung cancer. Over the past seven years he had beaten cancer twice before, so he began chemo treatment optimistically, and true to form, kept busy writing. He was working on a crime caper set in Fort Worth and Mexico in the 1950s at the time, but his health quickly deteriorated from the chemo, and he passed away on May 8, 2009. He is buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, next to Ann Richards. </p><p>Although Shrake enjoyed the respect of critics and peers from New York to Hollywood, his talents have been most recognized by those in his home state. In 1987 he received a star on the Texas Walk of Fame, in Austin, along with Jenkins, Cartwright and Larry L. King. Later in life, he received two awards for his career in letters: the Texas Bookend Award from the Texas Book Festival, in 2002, and the Lon Tinkle Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Institute of Letters, in 2003. </p><p>In 2004, TCU Press published The Wittliff Collections' curator Steven L. Davis'<emph render="italic">Texas Literary Outlaws</emph>, a biography of Shrake, Cartwright, King, Jenkins, Billy Lee Brammer and Peter Gent. The book also serves as an invaluable chronicle and critique of these six men's literary achievements and intertwining friendships. In the concluding chapter, Davis addresses Shrake's talents and legacy: </p><p>"Shrake's refusal to be typecast alienated New York publishers because it kept them from building a market for his work. But the artistry apparent in each novel endures. The relative paucity of critical attention on Bud Shrake has deflected understanding of the sophisticated narrative techniques employed in his best work" (Texas Literary Outlaws, p. 455).</p><p>Davis then goes on to highlight what he considers Shrake's four best novels, and contends they deserve to stand beside the works of celebrated writers like Terry Southern, Leslie Marmon Silko, Ken Kesey and Kurt Vonnegut.</p><p>Many of Shrake's early books have been republished and remain in print to this day.<emph render="italic"> Blessed McGill</emph> and <emph render="italic">Strange Peaches</emph> were both republished by Texas Monthly Press in 1987, and again by John M. Hardy Publishing Company in 2007. <emph render="italic">But Not For Love</emph> got a second chance by TCU Press in 2000. <emph render="italic">Limo</emph> was also republished in 2000, by Duane Press. <emph render="italic">Willie, The Borderland, Billy Boy,</emph> and the Harvey Penick books remain in print. </p><p>As for his films, <emph render="italic">J.W. Coop, Nightwing, Tom Horn</emph> and <emph render="italic">Songwriter</emph> are all available on DVD, Shortly before he passed away, Shrake recorded a commentary track with Gary Cartwright for an American DVD release of <emph render="italic">Kid Blue</emph>. </p><p>A.C. Greene named <emph render="italic">Blessed McGill</emph> in 1981 as one of Texas' fifty best books, describing it as having "an appreciation for the absurdities of existence, a recognition of irony's major role in the world, [and] highly suggestive humor" (<emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>, Aug. 1981). The same compliment could be said for much of Shrake's work through the years, whether writing about crime on the police beat in Fort Worth, boxers and poker players on assignment for <emph render="italic">Sports Illustrated</emph>, filthy-rich and eccentric Dallasites in his novels, old-west and country-music outlaws in his movies, or a famous country singer, a football coach and a golf guru in his non-fiction.</p><p>

<p>Playwright Preston Jones is best remembered for <emph render="italic">A Texas Trilogy</emph>, an evocative depiction of small town Texas life.  Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on April 7, 1936, Preston developed an interest in the dramatic arts while attending the University of New Mexico.  Though he graduated with a BA in education in 1960 and took a teaching position, drama professor Eddie Snapp continued to encourage Preston to study theater and steered him toward Baylor University in Waco, Texas.  At the time, the Baptist school's Drama Department was headed by Snapp's former Yale classmate, Paul Baker, a nationally known figure in regional and experimental theater.  Preston applied successfully to Baylor and while waiting to enroll, worked for the highway department in Colorado City, Texas, the place that later formed the basis for Bradleyville, the setting for <emph render="italic">A Texas Trilogy</emph>.</p><p>Preston completed his coursework at Baylor but before he could receive his degree, Paul Baker and the Baylor University administration had a falling out over the production of Eugene O'Neill's <emph render="italic">Long Day's Journey Into Night</emph>.  Baker moved his entire department to Trinity University in San Antonio in 1963 and Preston followed, receiving his Master's there in 1966.  His thesis was a dramatization of the novel by David Grubb, <emph render="italic">The Night of the Hunter</emph>.</p><p>In 1959, Paul Baker became director of the newly formed Dallas Theater Center (DTC), which he headed in conjunction with his position as a drama department chairman.  Baker invited Preston to join the DTC during his first year as a student at Baylor thus beginning the association with an important regional theater that lasted until the end of his life.  In line with Baker's philosophy of non-specialization, Preston performed all duties in the theater:  actor, director, stage manager, ticket taker, etc.  As an actor, he appeared in <emph render="italic">Julius Caesar</emph>, <emph render="italic">Journey to Jefferson</emph>, <emph render="italic">Medea</emph>, <emph render="italic">A Streetcar Named Desire</emph>, <emph render="italic">What Price Glory</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Girl of the Golden West</emph>.  He played the stage manager in <emph render="italic">Our Town</emph> and Henry Drummond in <emph render="italic">Inherit the Wind</emph>.  Preston's directing projects included <emph render="italic">Under the Yum-Yum Tree</emph>, <emph render="italic">Barefoot in the Park </emph>and <emph render="italic">The Knack</emph>.  Preston was to credit this varied experience in the theater for his success in writing material for the stage.</p><p>It was through the Dallas Theater Center that Preston met his second wife, Mary Sue Birkhead Fridge.  The two worked together in many Dallas Theater productions where Mary Sue was assistant director to Paul Baker as well as a popular actress and designer.  Mary Sue, for her part, provided Preston with encouragement and support in his writing endeavors.  Preston's admiration for his wife's talent was oft expressed.  "I never belonged on the same stage as that woman," he told John Anders of the <emph render="italic">Dallas Morning News</emph> (July 5, 1992).</p><p>In 1972, Baker appointed Preston managing director of Down Center Stage, a smaller workshop theater in the Center.  Jones wished to provide a stage for new works but the lack of good material inspired him to begin writing what became the <emph render="italic">Trilogy</emph>.  The first of the three plays, <emph render="italic">The Knights of the White Magnolia</emph>, premiered at the Down Center Stage on December 4, 1973.  <emph render="italic">Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander </emph>followed on February 5, 1974 and <emph render="italic">The Oldest Living Graduate</emph> in November of that year.  Baker chose <emph render="italic">Knights</emph> and <emph render="italic">LuAnn</emph>  (<emph render="italic">Graduate</emph> had not yet been completed) along with other original plays by resident playwrights to be presented in a spring showcase, Playmarket 74.  Producers, agents and critics from around the world were invited to view these works, among them literary agent Audrey Wood and director Alan Schneider.  Wood, who had discovered, among others, Tennessee Williams and William Inge, became Preston's agent and Schneider eventually directed the <emph render="italic">Trilogy </emph>in Washington, D. C. and New York City.  In 1975, the three plays were performed together for the first time on the main stage of the Dallas Theater Center under the title, <emph render="italic">The Bradleyville Trilogy</emph>.  That same year the American Playwright's Theater, which promotes the production of new works in theaters around the country, chose <emph render="italic">Knights</emph> as one of their offerings.  In 1976, the renamed <emph render="italic">A Texas Trilogy</emph> played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. to popular and critical acclaim.  Preston received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to write a play for the American bicentennial and the Golden Apple Award from Cue magazine.  After these initial successes, the <emph render="italic">Trilogy </emph>opened September 1976 on Broadway to a lukewarm response, closing after three weeks.</p><p>Preston returned to Dallas reassuming the varied tasks required of members of the company but by no means resting on his laurels as a playwright.  His <emph render="italic">A Place on the Magdalena Flats</emph> played at the Dallas Theater Center in 1976 while the <emph render="italic">Trilogy </emph>wound its way from Washington to New York.  <emph render="italic">Santa Fe Sunshine</emph> premiered at the Dallas Theater Center April 9, 1977.  That same year, Preston won the Outer Critics Circle Award for the <emph render="italic">Trilogy </emph>and staged a tribute to Lady Bird Johnson on her 65th birthday.  In 1978, Preston created the one-act <emph render="italic">Juneteenth</emph> for the Actors' Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, forming the plot around Black Texans' annual celebration of emancipation.  This play was later presented with other one-acts on PBS's "Earplay" series under the title <emph render="italic">Holidays</emph>.  In 1979, <emph render="italic">Remember </emph>was on the boards.  While working on rewrites, Preston was also crafting a screenplay of the <emph render="italic">Trilogy</emph> for producer Hal Wallis.</p><p>Preston was slated to appear as the Duke of Norfolk in the Dallas Theater Center's production of <emph render="italic">A Man For All Seasons</emph> under Mary Sue's direction when he was suddenly taken ill and hospitalized.  He died September 9, 1979 after surgery on a bleeding ulcer.</p>

<p>Born August 6, 1920 in Fort Worth, Texas, John Alexander Graves III grew up in that city until moving away to attend college in 1938. He graduated from Rice Institute (now Rice University) with a B.A. in English in 1942, then entered the Marine Corps and served in the Pacific theater until being wounded by a Japanese grenade on the island of Saipan. After the service, Graves traveled to Mexico for a few months then attended Columbia University, earning an M.A. in English from there in 1948. He began his professional writing career while still a graduate student by publishing a short story, titled "Quarry," in <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph> in 1947. </p><p>Graves taught English from 1948 to 1950 at The University of Texas at Austin, but left academia and Texas behind to spend a year freelance writing in New York City. From January 1953 to July 1955 he spent abroad, living mostly in Spain, including the Canary Islands for some months on a resident colony of writers and artists. During these years he wrote articles for publications like <emph render="italic">Holiday</emph> and <emph render="italic">Town and Country</emph> but also worked on fiction, including a semi-autobiographical novel, <emph render="italic">The Spotted Horse</emph>. Graves concentrated on finishing the novel after returning to the United States, but his agent rejected the final manuscript and Graves soon came to realize the novel was not publishable as a whole.</p><p>In the spring of 1957 Graves returned home to help care for his ill father. In November of that year, Graves completed a three-week canoe trip down part of the Brazos River that he feared was about to be changed forever by dams. His narrative chronicle of the trip was first published as a magazine article in <emph render="italic">Holiday</emph>, and later Graves added history, philosophy and folklore which resulted in his first major book, <emph render="italic">Goodbye to a River</emph> (1960). The book attracted national attention and critical praise for its original style. It won the Carr P. Collins Award of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1961 and was nominated for a National Book Award that year. In the meantime, Graves took a teaching job at Texas Christian University, married Jane Cole (his second marriage) and purchased the first of his limestone acres in Somervell County near the town of Glen Rose. </p><p>After three years assisting in and writing for a U.S. government study of pollution of the Potomac River, Graves returned to Texas and focused on converting his country acreage from a weekend getaway into a permanent home with a manageable farm and cattle ranch. In that time he also contributed to journals, magazines and books with introductions, articles, and essays—work that has continued to the present day. His observations and ruminations about his relationship with the land as a farmer and rancher led to the publication of his second major book, <emph render="italic">Hard Scrabble: Observations on a Patch of Land</emph> (1974). Hard Scrabble describes both the promise and adversity of country life, touching on subjects like animals, tools, construction, weather, water, ecology, agriculture, and migrant workers.</p><p>Starting in 1976, Graves again focused on life in the country in a series of essays that were published in <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> magazine. The essays examined topics such as fences, meat, tobacco, cows, chickens, dogs, and bees, and were collected and published for Graves' third major book, <emph render="italic">From a Limestone Ledge: Some Essays and Other Ruminations about Country Life in Texas</emph> (1980). Some essays follow up topics which he discussed in <emph render="italic">Hard Scrabble,</emph> but all focus on the "more or less country things which came to interest" Graves. <emph render="italic">From a Limestone Ledge</emph> was nominated for an American Book Award.</p><p>Although Graves has not published an extensive number of books, his contributions to magazines, books and anthologies spans over five decades. He has written introductions and narratives for a number of books and reports, often on Texas history and Texas environment, such as <emph render="italic">Cowboy Life on the Western Plains</emph>, <emph render="italic">Texas Heartland: A Hill Country Year</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Water Hustlers</emph>. Two of Graves' most famous magazine pieces, "The Last Running" and "Blue &amp; Some Other Dogs," later became their own books, published first by Encino Press. Another well-received essay, "Recollections of a Texas Bird Glimpser," written for the art book, <emph render="italic">Of Birds and Texas</emph> (1986), transformed into a limited edition book, <emph render="italic">Self-Portrait, With Birds</emph> (1991). </p><p>In 1996 the University of Texas Press published <emph render="italic">A John Graves Reader</emph>, which gathered together fiction and non-fiction pieces, both published and unpublished, including a long, reworked excerpt from his failed novel, <emph render="italic">The Spotted Horse</emph>. More recently, Graves wrote text for the photography books <emph render="italic">Texas Rivers</emph> (2002) and <emph render="italic">Texas Hill Country</emph> (2003), and in 2004 Knopf published his memoir, <emph render="italic">Myself and Strangers</emph>, which focused on his years abroad as a freelance writer. </p><p>John Graves is one of the most important Southwestern writers. Three of his early short stories were collected in the O. Henry award series. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1963 and a Rockefeller fellowship in 1972. Numerous awards and recognitions have followed him throughout his writing career. Although he is generally considered a regional and nature writer due to his settings and subjects, his style, which incorporates fiction, folklore, autobiography, philosophy, and observation, defies provincial or topical boundaries. Perhaps the best example of this is <emph render="italic">Goodbye to a River</emph>, which has never gone out of print since first being published in 1960, and is still celebrated for its keen ruminations on the historical, attitudinal and natural worlds that intertwined around Graves as he canoed down the river.</p><p>Graves was married to the former Jane Cole of New York, and they had two daughters, Helen and Sally. John and Jane lived and worked on Hard Scrabble near Glen Rose until Graves' death in 2013.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Stephen Harrigan was born on October 5, 1948, and grew up in Oklahoma City, Abilene and Corpus Christi. After receiving a degree in English from The University of Texas at Austin in 1971, Harrigan briefly attended graduate school and worked as a yardman and as an ad writer for the <emph render="italic">University Co-op.</emph> He contributed articles to a number of magazines, including <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Texas Observer</emph>. He became a regular writer for<emph render="italic"> Texas Monthly</emph> shortly after its inception and co-founded and edited <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph>, a journal of poetry, which published 10 issues between 1974 and 1978.</p><p>
Harrigan received a Dobie-Paisano fellowship in 1977, which allowed him to complete his first novel. <emph render="italic">Aransas</emph>, published by Knopf in 1980, tells the story of Jeff Dowling, an alienated young man who comes to terms with himself and the world as he trains two dolphins for a circus in Port Aransas, Texas. The <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> named the novel one of the notable books of 1980, and reviewers praised its realism and style. His second novel, <emph render="italic">Jacob's Well</emph>, also focused on man's relationship with nature, following the lives of three people who are drawn together to explore an artesian well in Central Texas. The book was named one of the best books of 1984 by <emph render="italic">The Washington Post</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Dallas Morning News</emph>.</p><p>
Harrigan's recent books, until the publication in 2000 of <emph render="italic">Gates of the Alamo</emph>, have been nonfiction. As a freelance writer and later staff writer and editor for <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>, Harrigan displayed a talent for journalism, contributing interviews and other investigative pieces, but he also focused on the natural environment, writing about rivers, Big Bend, Padre Island and other Texas landmarks. Many of these essays were collected in Harrigan's third book, <emph render="italic">A Natural State: Essays on Texas</emph> (1988), which was recently republished by the University of Texas Press.  His 1992 book <emph render="italic">Water and Light: A Diver's Journey to a Coral Reef</emph> combined research on aquatic life with his own experiences scuba diving off a coral reef in the Caribbean. The <emph render="italic">New York Times Book Review</emph> called <emph render="italic">Water and Light</emph> "moving, intelligent ... literary," and praised Harrigan's "remarkable ability to discuss the metaphysical and spiritual aspects of underwater exploration." Harrigan has also published a book of poetry and written screenplays, one of which, <emph render="italic">The Last of His Tribe</emph>, was broadcast on HBO.</p><p>
Harrigan's works are characterized by an intense interest in humans and their relationship to the environment around them. He once wrote of his interest in natural subjects: "I don't know what nature is exactly--whether it is a category that includes human beings or shuts them out--but for me it has always contained that hint of eeriness, the sense that some vital information--common knowledge to all the universe--has been specifically withheld from me. Sometimes, as with the snake, this secrecy has seemed malevolent, but far more often it has been wonderfully tantalizing. For much of my life I have been obsessed with nature, but not in the way a naturalist would be obsessed with it--driven to classify, to define relationships, to comprehend the world's marvelous intricacy. I have simply wanted to feel more fully a part of that intricacy, to see something other than neutral scorn in the eyes of that half-imagined snake." (Introduction to<emph render="italic"> A Natural State</emph>, UT Press, 1994)</p><p>

<p>Hart Stilwell was born in 1902 in Yoakum, Texas. When he was two, his large family relocated to the Rio Grande Valley, an area they would roam throughout Stilwell's childhood as his father sought undeveloped farmland and the freedom of the frontier. Stilwell's upbringing was marked by psychological and physical conflict with his father, a former Texas Ranger prone to sudden mood-swings and threats of violence.</p><p>
At the age of seventeen Stilwell entered The University of Texas at Austin, where he worked for <emph render="italic">The Daily Texan</emph> and graduated with a degree in journalism in 1924. One of his first jobs was as a reporter for <emph render="italic">The Brownsville Herald</emph>, a paper he also edited for two years. In the late 1920s Stilwell lost interest in working full-time and turned to free-lance writing, although for the rest of his life he regularly contributed articles to newspapers across Texas, including <emph render="italic">The San Antonio Light, The Houston Chronicle</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Austin American-Statesman</emph>.</p><p>
Stilwell's first novel was published in 1945. An indictment of race relations in the Rio Grande Valley, <emph render="italic">Border Town</emph> was narrated by a cynical reporter in love with a Mexican woman who had been raped by a wealthy Anglo businessman. Two years later, Stilwell published his most critically acclaimed novel, <emph render="italic">Uncovered Wagon</emph>, which included a thinly fictionalized account of Stilwell's relationship with his father, called "The Old Man" in the book. <emph render="italic">Uncovered Wagon</emph> was named one of the fifty best books of Texas by A.C. Greene, who wrote "you don't find many Texas writers who can face the bitter reality of rural poverty in a changing society as Stilwell does." Stilwell published a third novel, <emph render="italic">Campus Town</emph>, which was less successful than the others. All of his novels draw heavily from personal experience (Stilwell's daughter called <emph render="italic">Uncovered Wagon</emph> an "autobiography" and said that Stilwell changed names and place names only after his mother objected to the harshness of his narrative) and are marked by a fierce liberalism and hatred of intolerance.

Stilwell was also known for his nonfiction. He collaborated with Slats Rogers on Rogers' autobiography and helped write a book on neglected children, titled <emph render="italic">The Child Who Walks Alone</emph>, with his social worker wife, Anne Stilwell. He was an avid sportsman and published two well-known books on hunting and fishing in Texas and Mexico. <emph render="italic">Field and Stream, Outdoor, Hunting Yearbook</emph>, and other outdoor sports magazines also published articles by Stilwell. In the early 1970s he began work on a full-length book on human interference in the natural world; he was particularly concerned about the domestication of wild animals and the increasing use of biological engineering on animals and plants consumed by humans. Stilwell was working on this book, tentatively titled <emph render="italic">The Great White Immaculate Bird and Other Toys</emph>, along with a manuscript on fishing, a children's book on wolves, and a number of short essays when he died on May 13, 1975 in Austin.</p><p>
Stilwell married twice and had two children. His daughter, Mary Gray Hughes, is also a writer.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Novelist, essayist, and screenwriter Larry McMurtry was born June 3, 1936 in Wichita Falls, Texas. He grew up on a ranch just outside of Archer City and graduated from Archer City High School in 1954. He attended North Texas State University (B.A. 1958), then Rice University (1954, 1958-60, M.A. 1960), and studied for one semester outside of Texas at Stanford University as a Stegner Fellow (1960-61).</p><p>McMurtry published his first novels while working as an English instructor at Texas Christian University (1961-62), Rice University (1963-65), George Mason College (1970), and American University, (1970-71). In 1962, he won the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse M. Jones award, and in 1964, he won a Guggenheim grant. In 1970, he bought a rare-book store in Washington D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood, named it Booked Up, and relocated to run the store. A second Booked Up was opened in Archer City, Texas, in 1988.</p><p>His first seven novels were all set in Texas, some in the country, some in urban settings. The first three were made into movies. Despite the critical and popular success of "Hud" (<emph render="italic">Horseman Pass By</emph>) and "The Last Picture Show," for which McMurtry wrote the Academy award winning screenplay (1972), he perceived a lack of appropriate recognition for his work in general. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he wore a t-shirt which read "Minor Regional Novelist," to help make this point.

McMurtry's urban trilogy, set in contemporary Houston, <emph render="italic">Moving On</emph> (1970), <emph render="italic">All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers </emph>(1972), and <emph render="italic">Terms of Endearment</emph> (1975), all deal with love and marriage, and are examples of McMurtry's ability to consistently create a strong sense of place, characters, and dialogue. <emph render="italic">Terms of Endearment</emph> would later be translated into Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish, and made into a very popular movie by the same name (1983), starring Jack Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine, John Hurt, and Debra Winger.

Following this trilogy, McMurtry looked outside of Texas for settings: <emph render="italic">Somebody's Darling</emph> (1978) set in Hollywood, California, <emph render="italic">Cadillac Jack</emph> (1982) set in Washington D.C., and <emph render="italic">The Desert Rose</emph> (1983) set in Las Vegas. These novels involve characters seeking meaning in urban life and were not as critically or commercially successful as McMurtry's novels set in Texas.</p><p>In 1985, McMurtry published <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph>, the story of two ex-Texas Rangers who take on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana. This novel won McMurtry a Pulitzer Prize, as well as widespread critical and commercial success. The novel was brought to the small screen in 1989, in a very popular television mini-series of the same name, making McMurtry even more of a household name.

Since writing <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph>, McMurtry has continued to write novels set in both contemporary and historical Texas with characters grappling with old and new lifestyles and values. These novels have been commercially successful, although not to the same degree as <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph>. McMurtry announced that he would retire from novel writing with the 1999 novel <emph render="italic">Duane's Depressed</emph>, however he published a biography on Crazy Horse and an autobiographical reminiscence, <emph render="italic">Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen</emph>, in the same year.</p><p>McMurtry passed away March 25, 2021.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>J. Frank Dobie, teacher, storyteller, folklorist, historian, and author, was born September 18, 1888 on a ranch in the South Texas brush country of Live Oak County.  Raised in the toughening, physically bracing traditions of a remote ranching region, Dobie nonetheless developed an early love for language and literature.  His mother encouraged reading, providing her children with mail-ordered books, and his father developed the boy's narrative sense with nightly readings of the King James version of the bible.  Dobie's mother saw to it that he and his siblings were sent away to relatives in the small town of Alice so that they could obtain the requisite schooling to pursue higher education.</p><p>Dobie received his BA from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas.  There, under the influence of Professor Albert Shipp Pegues, he became enthralled by the English romantic poets.  There too he met the poetry-loving Bertha McKee, who would become his wife, lifelong companion, adviser, booster and critic.  After Dobie received his degree in 1910, he taught at a high school in Alpine, Texas and worked summers as a newspaper reporter.  Deciding he wished to teach poetry at a more advanced level than high school, Dobie pursued a Masters at Columbia University.  He later admitted to being only a lackluster student who learned more from New York and the New York theater than he did from the university.</p><p>Returning to Texas, Dobie joined the English Department of the University of Texas at Austin.  In his first year there, he officed with Stith Thompson who introduced him to the organization with which he became so closely identified, the Texas Folklore Society  World War I soon wrested Dobie from the classroom and he was sent overseas shortly before the armistice.  While he missed the fighting, he took the opportunity to acquaint himself with Europe.</p><p>Dobie returned to the University of Texas English Department after his discharge from the army.  Still ambivalent about his life's direction, he left UT in 1920 to run an uncle's ranch.  The ranching stint was unsuccessful and he returned to teaching, writing his wife that "in the university I am a wild man; in the wilds I am a scholar and a poet" (Tinkle 102).  He began to settle on a scholarly pursuit that could make use of both environments.  Dobie had enjoyed listening to the stories of one of his uncle's vaqueros, Santos Cortez.  "It came to me that I would collect and tell the legendary tales of Texas as Lomax had collected the old-time songs and ballads of Texas and the frontier.  I thought that the stories of the range were as interesting as the songs.  I considered that if they could be put down so as to show the background out of which they have come they might have high value" (Tinkle 102).  From that point, Dobie actively pursued the folk legends of the Southwest in his travels, readings, and writings.

Dobie became editor of the Texas Folklore Society in 1921.  He took a strong hand in the independent direction of the organization, which still follows the standards he set.  Under Dobie, the Texas Folklore Society broke from the practices of the American Folklore Society.  The national branch examined the subject from an objective scholarly viewpoint while Dobie and his followers instead collected and presented folklore as a living, breathing, participatory endeavor.</p><p>Dobie's second book, <emph render="italic">Coronado's Children</emph>, received national attention and broadened substantially the Texas writer's audience.  In 1932, Dobie ventured into broadcasting with the radio program "Longhorn Luke and his Cowboys."  He also published articles in magazines and continued to put out his folklore books.  He frequently traveled in search of material for his books, and he became a popular speaker on the lecture circuit.  In 1939, he began his syndicated newspaper column "My Texas." Successful in each medium, Dobie came to symbolize the essence of Texas in the popular mind.</p><p>Through all this activity, Dobie remained based at the University of Texas in Austin. In 1930, he introduced his course Life and Literature of the Southwest, and it became the most popular offering on campus. Its curriculum was copied in universities across the state.

Dobie had always had a prickly relationship with the University of Texas based partly on his refusal to seek a PhD and partly on his belief that the Southwest was a sufficient scholarly focus in its own right. In 1943, Dobie left UT to serve a two-year stint as lecturer on American History in Cambridge, England.  Upon his return, Dobie jumped right into a heated controversy when he spoke out in defense of Homer Price Rainey, president of the University of Texas, in the fight with the Board of Regents. In 1947, when then University president Theophilus Painter refused to grant Dobie another leave, Dobie resigned with the administration's acquiescence.  He remained at his home in the University area and was always associated with the University of Texas though his formal days as a teacher were over.</p><p>Dobie endeared himself to the public both through his personality and his brand of tale telling. He boldly used his popularity to speak out on social issues and other causes that captured his attention.  An ardent individualist, he constantly railed against censorship, demagogic religiosity, and those who would impede freedom of thought. "I have come to value liberated minds as the supreme good of life on earth"  (<emph render="italic">Some Part of Myself </emph>6).  He championed black voting rights in 1945 and supported organized labor's right to strike.  He considered certain college departments unsatisfactory as programs of learning.  Journalism, he said, was the unctuous elaboration of the obvious. Of education-trained teachers he commented, "I have never encountered one possessed of a first class mind, though I have encountered a few fairly good ones.  Many are dull well-meanders, cunning climbers, exponents of the paltry, and, worst of all, duelers of eager searching intelligence--especially of intelligence lodged in teachers not willing to knuckle" (Tinkle 170).</p><p>After Dobie's death in September of 1964, his wife Bertha, who had worked so closely with him throughout their life together, saw to the publication of two books under Dobie's name based on his notes. The Dobies had no children of their own but were particularly fond of Bertha's nephew, Edgar Kincaid. Kincaid moved in with the Dobies when he became a student at the University of Texas, and he remained in their Austin house on 26th Street to tend to them in their old age.  Kincaid was an avid ornithologist and editor of <emph render="italic">The Bird Life of Texas </emph>(1974).</p><p>The Dobie name today is often spoken in the same breath with that of his two University of Texas contemporaries, the historian Walter Prescott Webb and the naturalist Roy Bedichek.  The three friends have been titled Texas' intellectual triumvirate and are considered the forerunners to Texas literature. "[They] were living proof that serious persons could do independent cultural work in Texas" (<emph render="italic">Texas Observer</emph> 18).</p><p>Joe Frantz remarked that Dobie was "Texas' first liberated mind to achieve a wide audience and the first truly professional writer produced by the state" (<emph render="italic">Third Coast </emph>1983). Many Texas writers openly credit Dobie with giving them the inspiration not only to be a writer but also to feel comfortable using their home state as a subject.  Billy Lee Brammer admitted, "It never occurred to me--ever--until I read Frank Dobie, that I could be a writer. There simply were no writers in Texas" (<emph render="italic">Texas Observer </emph>21). Fred Gipson confided that he had never realized it was possible to live in Texas and be a writer until Dobie set the example (<emph render="italic">Austin American Statesman</emph> B5).  Publisher and screenwriter Bill Wittliff wrote Bertha on Dobie's death that "Dobie was the prime moving force of my life."  Bertha and friends established a most fitting memorial to Dobie in light of his contribution to Texas letters, the Dobie-Paisano fellowship.  The award provides money for writers and artists to work on their projects during a six month stay on Dobie's Paisano ranch in the hill country outside of Austin.</p><p>

<p>Novelist, essayist, and short story writer Rick Bass was born March 7, 1958 in Fort Worth, Texas. He was raised in Houston and graduated with a B.S. in Geology from Utah State University in 1979. Employed as a petroleum geologist in Mississippi from 1979 to 1987, Bass has since written full time on environmental issues and the vanishing wilderness. Bass has been an active environmentalist and member of the Sierra Club, Montana Wilderness Association, Cabinet Resources Group, Round River Conservation Studies, and the Yaak Valley Forest Council. He regularly publishes articles in magazines such as <emph render="italic">Field and Stream, Sports Afield, Gray's Sporting Journal, Outdoor Life</emph>, and others. Bass and his wife Elizabeth moved to Montana's Yaak Valley in 1987, where Bass finds the isolation he requires to write.</p><p>
Describing Bass's storytelling voice, Leigh Tillman Partington writes that Bass tells a story "true, strong, and intimate; the details of his language are lush and pure, providing just the right amount of landscape and inner turmoil. Above all, his stories are about precarious balances: between men and women, children and adults, friends, lovers, and between humans and the natural world. His language reflects that balance. Like Eudora Welty, to whom he is often compared, Bass plays close attention to inner and outer surfaces, watching where and how they meet, and he captures those meeting places on the page" (<emph render="italic">Contemporary Southern Writers</emph>, 1999).</p> </bioghist>

<p>Willie Hugh Nelson was born April 30, 1933.  After his parents separated, he and his older sister Bobbie were raised by their musically inclined grandparents in Abbott, Texas.  The children were started early on instruments--Bobbie on piano and Willie on guitar.  By age 10, Nelson was playing in Central Texas communities with a polka band.  After high school and many odd jobs, Nelson sold his songs "Family Bible" and "Night Life" and made his way to Nashville in order to establish himself in the cradle of country music.  Nelson's talents were quickly recognized by other Nashville artists.  They recorded his songs and helped him to get jobs.  But Nelson's own recordings received little notice by the public.  When promoter Crash Stewart told him his lyrics were ahead of his time he answered that "he wished the world would hurry and catch up with him as he needed the money" (Family Album).  After a little more than 10 years struggling in Nashville, Nelson's ranch house burned to the ground and he decided to return to his home state.</p><p>In 1971, back in Central Texas, Nelson found himself suddenly in the right place at the right time.  Nelson's eclectic style and warm stage presence found a receptive audience in a music scene that came to be labeled progressive country.  At a time when a suit, a tie, and a clean-shaven face were the signature look of the country and western singer, Nelson adopted the more informal style of the younger members of his audience--long hair, beard, jeans, and a bandanna.  A Nashville colleague told him "No one ever heard of you till you got ugly."

In 1973, Nelson held his first annual 4th of July picnic in Dripping Springs, Texas and the sweltering Independence Day celebrations became a huge event into the 1980s.  During these years, Nelson became a nationally successful country and western singer who secured his status as a popular mainstream artist with the 1975 release of the concept album, <emph render="italic">The Redheaded Stranger</emph>.</p><p>Established as a major star in the music world, Nelson then branched into acting beginning with a small part in <emph render="italic">The Electric Horseman </emph>(1979).  He starred in his next film, <emph render="italic">Honeysuckle Rose</emph> (1980), which was co-written by fellow Texan Bill Wittliff.  The two collaborated again in <emph render="italic">Barbarosa</emph> (1982) and in the dramatization of Nelson's album <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph> (1986).</p><p>In 1985, Nelson's concern for failing family farms led him to organize Farm Aid concerts in which he and other entertainers raised money to help small farmers keep their land.  The effort provided welcome relief to thousands but did not stem the tide of disappearing family farms.  By 1995, with seven Farm Aid concerts behind him, Nelson commented "all the money we raise these days is going to farmers who are already out of business.  The [agribusiness] corporations are the only guys making money" (<emph render="italic">Parade, </emph>August 20, 1995, 14).</p><p>Nelson found himself owing the Internal Revenue Service millions in back taxes for the years from 1975 through 1981 due to what he avowed was bad advice and bad investments.  In 1990, much of Nelson's property was seized and auctioned off.  Nelson's friends and fans helped him by taking up collections and buying up his property so that he would be able to eventually buy it back.  Nelson committed himself to paying off the monumental debt of taxes, interest, and penalties.  He worked hard, doing a full schedule of road shows and selling an album, <emph render="italic">Who'll buy My Memories:  The I.R.S. Tapes</emph>, through an 800 number.  By mid-1994, Nelson had settled his obligation.</p><p>Nelson has recorded a prodigious body of work including the best selling albums <emph render="italic">Shotgun Willie</emph> (Atlantic, 1973), <emph render="italic">Phases and Stages</emph> (Atlantic, 1974), <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph> (Columbia, 1975), <emph render="italic">The Outlaws</emph> (RCA, 1976), <emph render="italic">Stardust</emph> (Columbia 1978), <emph render="italic">Waylon and Willie</emph> (RCA, 1978), <emph render="italic">Honeysuckle Rose</emph> (Columbia, 1980), <emph render="italic">The Highwaymen</emph> (Columbia, 1985) and <emph render="italic">Across the Borderline</emph> (Columbia, 1991).  He has received many honors and numerous awards throughout his career.  He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Association Hall of Fame in 1973.  In 1975, he received his first Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain."  In 1978, he received the same award for "Georgia on My Mind."  In 1976, the Country Music Association named <emph render="italic">Wanted: The Outlaws</emph> the album of the year and "Good Hearted Woman" the single of the year.  The CMA awarded him the coveted Entertainer of the Year award in 1979.  He received a Grammy for the Best Country Song for "On the Road Again" in 1981 and the Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 1989.  He was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame in 1993.  Now in his sixties, a recognized living legend, the singer/songwriter continues to perform, write songs, and record.  "All I do is make music and play golf and I wouldn't want to give up either one" (<emph render="italic">Contemporary Musicians</emph> 173).</p> </bioghist>

<p>Bill Wittliff was born in Taft, a small town in south Texas, in 1940. After his parents divorced, he and his brother Jim moved with their mother to Gregory, Texas, where Mrs. Wittliff ran a small telephone office during World War II (these experiences provided the basis for "Raggedy Man," Wittliff's feature film). Later, when his mother remarried, the family moved to a ranch in Blanco, a rural community of 700 in the hill country of central Texas.</p><p>In 1964, shortly after graduating from the University of Texas, Wittliff, with his wife Sally, founded a book publishing company, The Encino Press, which specialized in regional material about Texas and the Southwest. To date, Encino has won over 100 awards for quality of design and content. The press operated out of a 19th-century Victorian house in Austin in which O. Henry once lived and wrote.</p><p>An accomplished photographer, Wittliff's photographs documenting the life of the Mexican vaquero (taken 1969-71) have been exhibited in numerous galleries and institutions throughout this country and in Mexico, including the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, and the Texas Capitol. In Japan, they represented the United States during its bicentennial year. After twenty years, the exhibit is still shown as a traveling display in the U. S. and Mexico under the auspices of the Institute of Texan Cultures.</p><p>At 29, Wittliff was elected to the Texas Institute of Letters. He served as president during 1974-78, and sat on the Executive Council until 1990. In 1993, he was elected Fellow of the the Institute. He is a member of the historic Texas Philosophical Society, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences; and he served for six years on the Executive Board of Trustees of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute.</p><p>In 1985, with the donation of their lifelong collection of original manuscripts and books, Bill and Sally founded the Southwestern Writers Collection at Southwest Texas State University. Since that time the collection has grown rapidly, supported by donors from all over the country. It features original manuscripts by J. Frank Dobie, John Graves, Larry McMurtry, Walter Prescott Webb, Bud Shrake, Larry L. King, Horton Foote, Preston Jones, Sam Shepard, Willie Nelson, and many others. It also includes paintings by numerous regional artists including William Lester, Tom Lea, John Groth, Jerry Bywaters, Kermit Oliver, Robert Wade. Expanding the scope of the current facility, in 1996 the Wittliffs endowed the Wittliff Gallery of Southwestern and Mexican Photography which already includes works by Russell Lee, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Ansel Adams, Keith Carter, Henri Cartier Bresson, Lola Bravo, Laura Gilpin, Edward Weston, Graciela Iturbide, Edward Curtis, Nacho Lopez, Erwin E.

He was valedictorian of Johnson City's LBJ High School Class of 1972, and attended Southwest Texas State University from 1972-1974 as an English major.</p><p>From 1974 until 1986 Sublett lived in Austin, where he played a dominant role in defining the live music scene as bass player and/or lead singer for a number of bands, most notably The Skunks, who recorded three records between 1978 and 1983.</p><p>During this time, Sublett began writing short pieces for the <emph render="italic">Austin Chronicle,</emph> including record and restaurant reviews, and in 1984 he was assigned to write a short piece on the club circuit which bands like The Skunks played. Instead, he submitted a semi-parodic music mystery entitled "Traveling the Hardboiled Highway," which imitated the style of a hardboiled detective novel. This marked the birth of Martin Fender, the central character in Sublett's first three novels. He submitted a second Fender piece, "The Nature of the Crime," which the <emph render="italic">Chronicle's </emph>editorial staff declined to publish but which they encouraged him to re-work as a novel. After finishing the re-titled <emph render="italic">Capitol Crimes, </emph>he wrote <emph render="italic">Rock Critic Murders</emph> with the intention of selling the two novels as a series. While waiting for the attention of publishers on the first two books, he began work on a third novel, <emph render="italic">Blunt Instrument.</emph>

In 1987 he moved to Los Angeles in order to be closer to the spirit of his hero Raymond Chandler. He continued to play music on the West Coast while awaiting responses from publishers and re-writing <emph render="italic">Blunt Instrument.</emph> Shortly thereafter, Lisa Kaufman at Viking took an interest in his work and agreed to publish <emph render="italic">Rock Critic Murders.</emph>

Sublett has written several screenplays, and served as story editor for the Disney series <emph render="italic">Adventures of the Old West.</emph> During 1994-1995 he ventured into nonfiction, writing a history of the Texas Turnpike Authority.</p><p>Sublett now lives in Austin with his wife Lois Richwine, their son Dashiell, and two cats.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Perhaps best known for her bestselling historical romance novel, <emph render="italic">Love Is a Wild Assault</emph>, Elithe Hamilton Kirkland was also a poet, songwriter, playwright, schoolteacher, and journalist. She was born a third generation Texan in 1907, in Coleman, Texas. Both sets of her grandparents were pioneers. Her father was a farmer, and Ms. Kirkland grew up riding a horse to Coleman's one teacher schoolhouse. She was very active in her high school years, participating in the Silver Valley School District debate team, and graduating as Salutatorian in 1924. She then went on to study English and history at North Texas State University, in Denton, Texas, where she received her B.A. and her Teacher's Certificate in 1928.</p><p>Kirkland then began her career in writing and teaching with a series of jobs which included teaching high school and writing for newspapers, often at the same time, through the 1930s. From 1928-1929, Kirkland taught high school English, drama, and journalism at Mineral Wells, Texas. At the <emph render="italic">Coleman Democrat-Voice</emph>, Coleman, TX, from 1929-1930, she edited news, features, the editor's front page column, and headlines, many of which dealt with the oil boom and bank robberies. In 1930, Kirkland served as Features writer for the <emph render="italic">Brady Standard</emph>, Brady, TX, researching and photographing major farm and ranch projects in McCulloch County. Also during this time period, from 1930-1932, she taught high school English and journalism in Crane, TX, a ranching center and oil boom town. In 1935, Kirkland served as the Austin correspondent for the Dallas based <emph render="italic">Texas Weekly.</emph> From 1935-1936, she was the State Director of School Publicity (for the Texas Commission for Centennial Celebrations), authoring pamphlets on Texas history and editing the songbook, <emph render="italic">Songs Texas Sings</emph>. From 1937-1939, she was a high school teacher in the State Laboratory School, Iraan, TX, teaching speech arts, journalism, and script writing for radio. Also while at Iraan, she was state correspondent in West Texas for the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Star Telegram</emph>, writing news stories, often centering on the oil boom.</p><p>In 1931, Kirkland married Roy Folk Beal, an interior decorator. A year later, Kirkland's only son was born, James Benjamin Beal. This marriage ended in divorce in 1936. During the summers 1938 of 1939, and during the long term 1939-1940, she was Curriculum Assistant in Department of Educational Administration at the University of Texas at Austin, working with the state on high school curriculum revision. She also attended UT Austin, studying under J. Frank Dobie, and writing a folk-drama series for the Texas State (Radio) Network which was narrated by Dobie. In 1940, she earned a Masters degree from UT Austin in English and Educational Administration.</p><p>In the 1940s, Kirkland continued her work as a print journalist, and became very involved in radio journalism. She was the Austin correspondent for the business and financial section of the <emph render="italic">The Dallas Times Herald,</emph>also writing business articles under the name L.E. Hamilton.</p><p>From 1940-1947, she was a script writer and acting director for UT Austin's radio department, Radio House, and wrote more than 500 dramatic documentaries for state and national radio networks, many of which were broadcast live from the studios on campus. At the time, Radio House was considered the only complete radio production facility in the southwest. Kirkland traveled to Mexico, among other places, to pursue stories. It was during her tenure at Radio House that Kirkland covered the story of Nazi intrigue surrounding Peck Woodside, an American pilot and businessman in Mexico, a story she would return to again and again over the years.</p><p>In 1944, she was the associate editor of <emph render="italic">Southwest Review,</emph> a quarterly publication of University Press in Dallas at Southern Methodist University.</p><p>In 1946, she wrote educational film scripts for the Commission on Motion Pictures in New Haven, Conn., including the films "Now is the Seedtime", on Tom Paine, and "Man with a Mission", on Samuel Gompers. In 1948, she married Dr. R. D. (Roy Defoe) Kirkland, an osteopathic surgeon. Also in this year, she mailed her short story "The Realm of Silence" to Pearl Buck, who praised it but described it as ahead of its time and not yet commercially viable. In fact, this story did not come to light until 1984, when it was published as the ending of her novel, <emph render="italic">The Edge of Disrepute</emph>. </p><p>As she turned her attention toward creative writing, Kirkland chose Evelyn Oppenheimer, of Dallas, as her literary agent. Oppenheimer helped direct Kirkland to writing historical romance, a genre in which Kirkland would write bestselling novels. Two of these were published in the 1950s, <emph render="italic">Divine Average</emph>(1952) and <emph render="italic">Love Is A Wild Assault</emph>, (1959), the latter being included in A. C. Greene's <emph render="italic">The 50 Best Books on Texas</emph>.</p><p>A prolific writer, Kirkland also wrote short stories, songs, poetry, musical dramas, speeches, and television scripts, on a variety of subjects. While her novels tended to be historical romances set in the Republic of Texas era, her other work reflects her broad interests in folk traditions and in the future. She described herself as a "futurist", and often wrote about space travel and parapsychology. She was a member of the Texas State Historical Association, and the national non-denominational Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship of Laymen and Clergymen. In 1982, her short story involving alien kidnapping, <emph render="italic">The Disappearance of Widow Ellen, </emph>was published in a collection of short stories by Texas women writers called <emph render="italic">Her Work,</emph> (Bryan, Texas: Shearer Publishing, 1982).</p><p>In 1984, Kirkland's last novel, <emph render="italic">The Edge of Disrepute, </emph>was published. In the next year, her husband, Dr. R.D. Kirkland, passed away, and she moved out of Austin to Wimberley. She published "Leet's Christmas", a Christmas short story including songs and verse. Kirkland remained a very sought after speaker, speaking around the state on the "Texas Voices" program for the Texas Sesquicentennial, as well as for groups such as Daughters of the American Revolution, MENSA, East Texas State University, and Western Writers of America.</p><p>In January 1987, her musical drama entitled <emph render="italic">Precious Memories </emph>was performed at the White Elephant in Fort Worth, TX, in collaboration with the Hip Pocket Theater and the Salt Lick Foundation. Kirkland wrote both the drama and lyrics, and acted as narrator. Shortly thereafter, her musical drama, <emph render="italic">Hear the Flute : An Untold Story of the Civil War in the Western Territories</emph>, was performed. Kirkland wrote the script and lyrics, Conrad Fath wrote the music.</p><p>On Nov. 12, 1987, Kirkland was inducted into Texas Women's Hall of Fame, one of many honors she received during her lifetime. Kirkland died at her home in Wimberly on Jan. 2, 1992, and was buried in her family cemetery at the David Allen Ranch known as "New Tracks", near the Blanco River, in Kyle, Texas.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Katherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning author, was born Callie Russell Porter in Indian Creek, Texas, in 1890. She was one of five children. Her mother, Mary Alice Jones Porter, died during childbirth in 1892, leaving the Porter children to be raised by their father, Harrison Boone Porter.  Mr. Porter took the children to Kyle, Texas, in his native Hays County, to live with him and his mother, Catherine Anne Skaggs Porter.  The young Ms. Porter attended Kyle public schools. The family was very poor, but her grandmother proved to be a very strong and resourceful woman, making a deep impression on Ms. Porter. In 1901, when Ms. Porter was eleven years old, her grandmother died. Not long afterwards, in 1904, the family moved to San Antonio, where Ms. Porter attended the Thomas School. She studied acting at this time, and performed in several summer stock productions.</p><p>In 1906, at sixteen, Porter married John Henry Koontz of Inez, Texas. Mr. Koontz' family was Roman Catholic, and Ms. Porter converted to that faith in 1908. The marriage did not last. Ms. Porter left Mr. Koontz and Texas in 1914, heading north to Chicago to pursue her interests of writing and acting. Apparently it was around this time that she took her grandmother's name, Katherine Anne. The divorce from Mr. Koontz became final in 1915, the same year in which she became very ill with tuberculosis. She returned to Texas, recovered from her illness, and in 1917, worked for the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Critic</emph> , covering theatrical and social events. Soon afterwards, in 1918, Ms. Porter moved to Denver, Colorado, not to return to Texas for close to fifteen years. In Denver, she reviewed books and theatrical performances for the <emph render="italic">Rocky Mountain News</emph>. During this period she became nearly fatally ill with an influenza which was sweeping the nation. This experience with grave illness served as the background for her short novel, <emph render="italic">Pale Horse, Pale Rider</emph>.</p><p>During 1919-1920, she worked in New York City as publicist for a motion picture company, wrote stories for the children's magazine <emph render="italic">Everyland</emph>, and met several Mexican artists who encouraged her to write journalistic works on Mexico.  She traveled to Mexico for the first time in 1920, during the time of the Obregon Revolution, and she made many more trips to Mexico during the 1920s. Her first published short story, "Maria Concepcion", appeared in 1922, and was soon followed by other short stories and essays, poetry and book reviews. She was married briefly to Ernest Stock, an English World War I pilot, from 1925-1926. In 1927, she became very interested in the Sacco and Vanzeti case in Mexico, but she would not publish the story of this experience until 1977, in "The Never-Ending Wrong".</p><p>"Flowering Judas", one of her most well known short stories, was published in 1930. She was living in Mexico at this time, and met Eugene Pressly, whom she married in Paris in 1933. Around this time, she returned to Texas for a family visit. She also traveled to Paris and Germany during the turbulent 1930s. In 1936, she moved back to America and finished "Noon Wine" and "Old Mortality", and began work on "Pale Horse, Pale Rider". The next year, she and Mr. Pressly separated. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Porter went to New Orleans and became involved with Albert Erskine of <emph render="italic">The Southern Review</emph>. She and Mr. Erskine were married in April, 1938.</p><p>
In 1939, J. Frank Dobie's <emph render="italic">Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver</emph> and Porter's <emph render="italic">Pale Horse, Pale Rider</emph> were both nominated for fiction awards by the Texas Institute of Letters. Dobie won the prize, leaving Ms. Porter feeling insulted and bitter. (Porter was later awarded the Texas Institute of Letters fiction prize for her 1962 novel, <emph render="italic">Ship of Fools</emph>.) In 1940, Porter and Erskine separated, and Ms. Porter moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, to continue her writing, beginning what would become <emph render="italic">Ship of Fools</emph>. In 1945, she began taking work as a Hollywood scriptwriter, and in 1948 began teaching at various universities including Stanford, the University of Michigan, Washington and Lee, and the University of Liege.</p><p>In 1958, rumors circulated to the effect that Harry Ransom, of the University of Texas at Austin's Humanities Research Center, was planning to name a building or at least a room for her at the University. Ms. Porter was very enthusiastic about these reported plans, and accepted an invitation to visit the University. She even considered moving to the area, but the agreement with UT fell apart. Ms Porter was once again disappointed in Texas.</p><p>In 1959, Ms. Porter, supported by Ford Foundation grant, moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where she continued to work on <emph render="italic">Ship of Fools</emph>, which was published in 1962.</p><p>
In 1965, she published <emph render="italic">The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter</emph>, which won a Pulitzer Prize Award. She also received honorary doctorates from many universities, and was very much in demand for lectures and teaching positions. In 1966, she received an honorary degree from the University of Maryland at College Park, and in that same year she made the decision to donate her personal papers and library to UMCP.  The university named a room for Ms. Porter, which was opened on May 15, 1968.

In the Spring of 1976, Ms. Porter was again given an opportunity to return to Texas. Dr. Roger Brooks, President of Howard Payne University, in Brownwood (close to Ms. Porter's birthplace), organized a literary conference of Porter scholars. The university also presented Ms. Porter with an honorary degree. Dr. Brooks and Ms. Porter became close friends in the last years of her life, and during this visit, Dr. Brooks took Ms. Porter to visit her mother's and brother's grave in her hometown cemetery. It was at this time that Ms. Porter decided to be buried next to her mother in her home town.  Later that year, she suffered a series of strokes.

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Jovita González was born near the Texas-Mexico border in Roma, Texas, on January 18, 1904. Her father was a teacher and her mother a housewife. Her family moved to San Antonio so that the children could be educated in English. After high school, González earned a teaching certificate and taught in Rio Grande City while earning money for college. She attended The University of Texas at Austin for a year, but due to a lack of funds returned to San Antonio to attend Our Lady of the Lake College where she was able to obtain a scholarship. In the summers she continued to study Spanish at The University of Texas, and it was in the summer of 1925 that she met J. Frank Dobie. Dobie shared González's interest in the folklore of the Texas-Mexican border and encouraged her to write down the stories. She did so, and some were published in the <emph render="italic">Folklore Publications</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Southwest Review</emph>. </p><p>
Dobie was not only supportive of González's writing, but he provided references for her scholarships, underwrote bank loans for her, and he and his wife invited her to dinners in their home. González was also very involved with the Texas Folklore Society which Dobie helped resurrect in 1922. She gave several lectures at the annual meetings and published articles in some of the journals. With Dobie's endorsement, González was elected to served as the Texas Folklore Society's vice president in 1928, and as president for two terms from 1930 to 1932. After receiving her B.A. from Our Lady of the Lake in 1927, she taught for two years at Saint Mary's Hall, an Episcopal school for girls, until she was awarded the Lapham Scholarship to conduct research along the border and to work on an M.A. at The University of Texas. Her M.A. research resulted in a Rockefeller grant award in 1934. It was during this time that she may have started work on her novel <emph render="italic">Caballero </emph>which was published posthumously in 1996<emph render="italic">.</emph></p><p>
While at UT Austin, González met her future husband, Edmundo E. Mireles.</p><p>E. E. Mireles was born in La Ciudad de Hidalgo del Parral, Mexico on December 28, 1905. He was raised by his grandmother in Sacramento, Coahuila, Mexico and came to the United States at the age of seven to live with his father in San Antonio. He later returned to Mexico with his father to fight in the Mexican Revolution, and was wounded. Back in Texas he attended the San Antonio Junior College, and The University of Texas at Austin where he received a B.A., with a Greek major and Latin minor. He obtained his masters in Spanish in 1953 from the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.</p><p>
E. E. Mireles and Jovita González were married in 1935 in San Antonio, and then moved to Del Rio where he was principal of San Felipe High School and she taught English. In 1939, they relocated to Corpus Christi where Mr. Mireles organized the Spanish program in the elementary grades of the public schools. Working together, Mr. and Ms. Mireles wrote two sets of books, <emph render="italic">Mi libro español</emph> and <emph render="italic">El español elemental</emph>, for the teaching of Spanish in the grade schools. In 1943, Mr. Mireles helped to create the Pan American Council dedicated to the study of Spanish, Latin America and its people. The Council supported the public schools in the organization and functioning of their own Pan American Clubs. Mr. Mireles also served as president of the LULAC Council No. 1. Ms. González Mireles continued until her retirement to teach Spanish and Texas History at W.B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi. During this time she also directed <emph render="italic">pastorelas</emph>, pageants and Christmastime <emph render="italic">posadas</emph> with Mexican children in the community. E. E. Mireles is considered by many to be the father of bilingual education, because of his role as an advocate for teaching Spanish in the public schools of Corpus Christi. Both Mr. and Ms. Mireles continued as educators and advocates of Spanish language teaching in public schools until they retired. Jovita González Mireles died in 1983, and E. E. Mireles died in 1987.</p><p>
Few scholars took notice of Jovita González Mireles' work until Teresa Palomo Acosta and Cynthia Orozco helped to renew interest in her at the 1990 "Mexican Americans in Texas History" conference in San Antonio. This renewed interest lead to the posthumous publication of her two novels <emph render="italic">Caballero</emph> in 1996 and <emph render="italic">Dew on the Thorn</emph> in 1997.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Poet, novelist, playwright, and short story writer Russell G. Vliet was born in Chicago, on November 4, 1929. His father was a Naval medical officer, and the family lived in many parts of the U.S., largely in the south, and in American Samoa. R.G. Vliet attended Central High School (Class of 1948) in Texas City, Texas, just south of Houston, and attended Southwest Texas State University beginning in the Fall of 1948, where he wrote and acted in his own plays. While at the university, he met Vida Ann Rutherford, of New Braunfels, a fellow Speech and Drama major. The couple married on March 1, 1951, and had a daughter, Brooke, in 1957. The Vliets received their B.S. degrees in Education in 1952, and R.G. Vliet went on to complete his Master's at SWT with the thesis, "Experiment in lyric and dramatic verse", in 1953. Vliet then taught English for one year at Brown's School in Austin, and one year at Rock Springs High School in the Texas Hill Country. Even though many of Vliet's novels, plays, and poems would be set in Texas and would win awards from Texan literary institutions, Vliet would not live in Texas again, except for a six-month period near the end of his life, in 1983.</p><p>In 1955, Vliet went from teaching English to attending Yale University School of Drama, where he studied playwrighting with Robert Penn Warren and others for one and a half years. He left Yale to start his own writing career, which began with a string of award winning plays. In 1957, his play, "The Arid Spell", won the Wisconsin Award. In 1959, his play, "The Regions of Noon", was named Southeastern Theatre Conference New Play of the Year. In 1960, while working as a Ford Foundation Fellow, his play, "Rockspring", won the University of Nebraska Award. This play would later be worked into Vliet's first novel, of the same name. During this time, Vliet and his family lived in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Morelos, Mexico, traveling and relocating as his wife's college English teaching career, the family's financial mainstay, required.</p><p>In 1966, at the age of 37, Vliet published his first book of poetry, <emph render="italic">Events and Celebrations</emph>. It contained the poem "Clem Maverick : The Life and Death of a Country Music Singer", which would later be individually published by Shearer Publishing, accompanied by woodcut illustrations by Barbara Whitehead. His second book of poetry, <emph render="italic">The Man with the Black Mouth</emph>, was published in 1970. Each of these books of poetry won the Voertman Poetry Award from the Texas Institute of Letters.</p><p>From 1971 to 1982, Vliet wrote, and worked a small farm in Stamford, Vermont. He published his first novel, <emph render="italic">Rockspring</emph>, in 1974, at age 44, which sold only a few thousand copies. Despite the novel's relatively low sales, <emph render="italic">Rockspring</emph> earned Vliet $25,000 from the sale of movie rights to the work, the most money he would receive for any of his literary efforts. His 1977 novel, <emph render="italic">Solitudes</emph>, (later reprinted under the name <emph render="italic">Soledad </emph>) won the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse Jones Award. At a time when large publishing houses rarely took on poetry, Random House published his next book of poetry, <emph render="italic">Water &amp; Stone </emph>(1980). In 1983, he won a literary fellowship which allowed him to spend six months writing at the late J. Frank Dobie's ranch, Paisano. This brief period was essentially the only time Vliet spent in Texas after his schooldays and early teaching days. While there, he began writing what would be his last novel, <emph render="italic">Scorpio Rising</emph>.</p><p>Vliet was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 1972, and after a brief illness, the disease went into remission. In 1982, Vliet learned that the lymphoma had come out of remission, and had taken a strong grip on his health. The following year, he was recognized with a Distinguished Alumni Award from his alma mater, Southwest Texas State University. Despite serious illness from chemotherapy as well as from the symptoms of the disease itself, Vliet continued work on his last novel, <emph render="italic">Scorpio Rising</emph>, completing it just days before his death. This novel, set in both Massachusetts and Texas, is widely considered to be his best. Russell Gordon Vliet died of lymphoma in North Adams, Massachusetts, in May, 1984.</p><p>Since his death, Vliet's novel <emph render="italic">Solitudes</emph> was reprinted by Texas Christian University Press as <emph render="italic">Soledad</emph>, (1986), and cited in James Ward Lee's <emph render="italic">Classics of</emph> <emph render="italic">Texas Fiction</emph>, in 1987. <emph render="italic">Rockspring</emph> was reprinted by Southern Methodist University (1992), the play "Regions of Noon" was published in William Martin's <emph render="italic">Texas Plays</emph>, (Southern Methodist University Press,1990), and Vliet's poetry will be featured in a forthcoming anthology edited by Dave Oliphant. Malcolm Cowley, who served as editor for Vliet and many other award-winning authors at Random House, describes Vliet's prose as "a joy and a continual surprise. There is nobody else with talent for evoking Texas as it was in the 1880s, nobody else who gives us the same sharp feeling for landscape, animals, birds, changing skies, and above all for people, as they lived out their solitary, violent lives full of kindness, resentments, and hardships accepted without complaint. Vliet's writing is close to becoming a national treasure."</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Noted theater director and educator Paul Baker was born in 1911 in the West Texas town of Hereford to Retta Chapman Baker and William Morgan Baker. He was the son and grandson of Presbyterian ministers, and the youngest of five children. When Baker was eight years old, his father moved the family to Waxahachie, Texas where Baker and his older siblings would eventually attend Trinity University, then located in Waxahachie.</p><p>In 1932, Paul Baker earned a bachelor's degree in drama at Trinity University. Baker then spent a year at Yale University working toward a master's in drama, but for financial reasons he was unable to continue his studies. He spent the summer of 1934 in England, and while there, he received the offer of a teaching position at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He began teaching there in 1934. At Baylor, Baker met Sallie Kathryn Cardwell (Kitty), a college math professor and artist. Kitty Cardwell had received her undergraduate degree at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. She always had an interest in art, but chose math as her major, and went on to receive her Masters of Science in Math from the University of Chicago, where she spent a year working toward her doctorate before coming to Baylor. On December 21, 1936 – three months after they met – Paul and Kitty were married.</p><p>The Bakers had three daughters, Robyn Cardwell Baker in 1938, Retta Chapman Baker in 1942, and Sallie Kathryn Baker in 1947. Kitty Baker began teaching a children's art and drama class for Robyn and her friends in 1941, basing her teachings on the same ideas that Paul Baker was using in his drama classes at Baylor. This class would eventually grow into the Baylor Children's and Teenage Theater.</p><p>In 1939, with the help of a Rockefeller Foundation Scholarship, Baker returned to Yale and completed his master's degree in drama. In 1941, Baker received a Rockefeller Grant to write about his travels during the summer of 1936 to England, Germany, Russia, and Japan where he studied theater design and production. Also in 1941, Baker returned to Baylor and helped design a new theater called Studio One. In Studio One, the audience was seated in swivel chairs and surrounded by six stages. Five of the stages formed a semi-circle around the audience and the sixth was located in the rear. This marked the beginning of Baker's many innovative contributions to theater and theater education.</p><p>Paul Baker was one of the first theatrical specialists to join the United States Army during WWII, serving as a Special Services Entertainment Officer in Iceland and Paris, France. He directed theatrical performances at the Iceland base. Baker had no trouble finding a variety of men who were talented actors, but he needed actresses. He put in a request for four actresses to perform at his theater. His request led to the formation of the Civilian Actress Technician Corps (CATS), which continued to provide actresses for performances throughout Special Services. In 1945, Baker was awarded the Legion of Merit for the re-organization of the Entertainment Branch of the European Theater of Operation.</p><p>Back in the United States, Baker continued to receive recognition for his involvement in education and drama. Baker was the recipient of two more Rockefeller grants in 1946 and 1959. He received the first of these to make a study of leisure time problems as related to community. In 1958, Baker received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Trinity University. Baker also served as President of the Southwest Theater Association in 1956 and as President of the National Theatre Conference from 1958 to 1961.</p><p>In 1952, Baker took a group of Baylor acting students and staff to present <emph render="italic">Green Grow the Lilacs </emph>by Lynn Riggs at the Theater Babylone in Paris. While visiting the Paris Museum of Modern Art, Baker became interested in the works of the Cubists. During this time, Baker was beginning to feel that the progress of theater was lagging behind the other arts. Inspired by the idea of translating modern art techniques into drama, Baker went back to Baylor to produce an updated version of <emph render="italic">Othello</emph> in which these new ideas were expressed. He translated the Cubist technique of presenting subjects from more than one point of view into drama by having three actors play the different parts of one character's personality. Henry Hewes, Drama Critic for the <emph render="italic">Saturday Review,</emph> said that Baker had "accomplished what Orson Wells' motion picture tried and failed to do – applied the visual arts to a great play without allowing them to inundate it" (Cory, 23). Charles Laughton called Baker's production of <emph render="italic">Othello</emph> "the most exciting piece of theater in America," and called Baker "a man absolutely without fear" (Cory, 23). In 1956, Baker used this method again in <emph render="italic">Hamlet</emph> with actor Burgess Meredith playing the main speaking role of Hamlet and three other actors representing the war-like, jovial and introspective sides of the character.</p><p>In 1959, while still teaching at Baylor, Baker helped found the Dallas Theater Center, which acted as the graduate school for the Baylor Drama Department. Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Dallas Theater Center, his last building and the only public theater ever built from his design. Baker also contributed to the design of the theater, working closely with Wright and sometimes disagreeing with him over such issues as lighting installation and backstage ramps. Playwright Gene McKinney described his own response to the designs for the Dallas Theater Center the first time he saw them, by saying "I realized this was going to be a different kind of theater. The whole approach to the total space, with its lack of right angles, gave freshness to the idea of theater." (Cory, 88) Baker would stay with the Dallas Theater Center for twenty-three years.</p><p>Baker's innovations in theater continued to receive praise from across the nation, and in 1961, he was given the first Rogers and Hammerstein Award for outstanding contribution to theater in the Southwest. However, Baker was not without critics. In 1962, he obtained the amateur rights from Eugene O'Neill's widow to produce O'Neill's play <emph render="italic">Long Day's Journey into Night</emph> at Baylor. The contract with Mrs. O'Neill was to do the play intact with no editing of the script. A local Sunday school teacher, who brought her class to see the play, was offended by some of the language. She began a campaign against the production, and the Baylor President ordered Baker to close the play. In response, Baker and his entire department, including assistant professor Robert Flynn and graduate student Preston Jones, moved to Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. Baker split his time between Trinity and the Dallas Theater Center, which then began to serve as the graduate school for the Trinity Drama Department.</p><p>Preston Jones not only followed Baker to Trinity, but also worked with him at the Dallas Theater Center. While there, Jones took to heart Baker's philosophy of non-specialization, and worked in a variety of positions, including actor, director, stage manager, and ticket taker. Jones credited these experiences with making him a successful playwright. As an actor Jones appeared in several plays at the Dallas Theater Center, including Journey to Jefferson by Robert Flynn, a stage adaptation of William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying. Under Baker's direction, this Dallas Theater Center production of Journey to Jefferson, won the jury prize at the Theater of Nations in Paris in 1964.</p><p>In 1972, Baker appointed Preston Jones managing director of Down Center Stage, a smaller workshop theater within the Dallas Theater Center. Jones' desire to present new works, combined with a lack of good material available, led him to begin writing his own plays, the first of which was <emph render="italic">The Knights of the White Magnolia</emph>. In 1973, it was produced at the Dallas Theater Center under Baker's guidance, and inaugurated Jones' classic Texas Trilogy. Jones and Baker would continue to have a close working relationship at the Dallas Theater Center until Jones' death in 1979.</p><p>In 1972, Baker wrote the book <emph render="italic">Integration of Abilities,</emph> in which he illustrated the teaching techniques he had used in a class of the same name at Baylor and Trinity. In class, Baker taught his students to use all five senses to experience and express their surroundings. Believing that a theater artist should be introduced to all facets of the arts, Baker gave his students assignments in painting, writing, and music composition. During the process of producing a play, he strove to involve the members of the production -- including playwrights -- in all aspects of theater work, such as taking tickets and helping in areas outside their usual sphere, in order to round out their experience of the theater. Baker explained that with this teaching philosophy he was trying to help students "discover their creative abilities," and at the same time "help the theater catch up with the progress made in the other arts" (Cory, 20).</p><p>Baker retired from his position as Professor of Drama and Chairman of the Drama Department at Trinity University in 1976, but continued his work as Director at the Dallas Theater Center. In 1978, he received both a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Trinity University and an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from the Texas Christian University.</p><p>By 1982, Baker and the Board of Directors at the Dallas Theater Center had begun to hold different views about the direction the Center should take. Baker wanted it to remain an educational theater, maintaining a resident company of actors, writers and directors as it had since its inception. The Board was interested in making the Center a more commercially dynamic venue, and envisioned touring productions featuring nationally-known actors who could attract audiences simply by the presence of their names on the marquee. In March 1982, Baker, after twenty-three years of service as Artistic Director, turned in his resignation. After Baker's resignation, the Center slowly moved away from its former experimental educational approach, and its role as a graduate school came to an end. However, Baker's methods in drama continued in the Dallas Children's Theater, founded by his daughter Robyn Baker Flatt, and at Dallas' Booker T. Washington School for the Performing Arts, founded by Paul Baker himself in 1976, at the request of the Dallas Independent School District.</p><p>After leaving the Dallas Theater Center, Baker continued to receive awards for his work in theater, and he remained busy directing plays and writing books and articles. In 1983, Baker received the Tomas De Gretani Award for outstanding service to American Theater. He directed a variety of plays, including Preston Jones' <emph render="italic">Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia</emph> in 1984 at the New Mexico Repertory Theater in Santa Fe. Baker also directed a professional production of Preston Jones' <emph render="italic">The Oldest Living Graduate</emph> for Paramount Theater of Austin in 1986, and his own adaptation, <emph render="italic">Hamlet ESP,</emph> for the Hyde Park Theater in Austin in 1987. In August of 1990, Baker's work in drama and education was celebrated by ex-students from Baylor University (1934-63), Trinity University (1963-1975), and the Dallas Theater Center (1959-83), with "The Paul Baker Festival – Second Harvest," which ran for three days in Waco.</p><p>In 1994, Baker was the recipient of the Texas Commission on the Arts Special Merit Award, and in that same year he wrote <emph render="italic">Making Sense with Five Senses</emph>, a textbook featuring his Integration of Abilities Technique. Paul and Kitty Baker currently live on a 132-acre ranch near Waelder, Texas, where they are both active in encouraging the application of their Integration of Abilities Technique at the Waelder elementary school. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Cormac McCarthy, author of award-winning and best-selling novels including <emph render="italic">All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain</emph>, was born Charles McCarthy, Jr., on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island. The McCarthy family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in 1937. McCarthy later attended the University of Tennessee, completing one year. He then served four years in the U.S. Air Force, and then returned to the University of Tennessee for an additional 3 years, leaving without a degree in 1960 to pursue his writing career. </p><p>
Early on, McCarthy won fellowships and awards, though not a wide readership. In 1960, he won an Ingram-Merrill Foundation grant for creative writing, and in that same year, published his first novel, <emph render="italic">The Orchard Keeper</emph>, for which he won the William Faulkner Award in 1965. Also in 1965, he won an American Academy of Arts and Letters travelling fellowship to Europe. The next year, he won a Rockefeller Foundation grant. In 1968, his second novel, <emph render="italic">Outer Dark,</emph> was published, followed by <emph render="italic">Child of God</emph>, in 1974. He won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1976. His fourth novel, <emph render="italic">Suttree</emph>, was published in 1979. Two years later, he won a MacArthur Foundation Grant, also known as a "genius award," upon which he moved out of the motel where he was living in Knoxville, and purchased a home in El Paso, Texas. </p><p>As McCarthy tends to set his novels only in places of which he has first hand knowledge, his earlier novels were set in Tennessee, and novels written after his 1981 move to El Paso have been set in the Southwest and Mexico. In 1985, he published <emph render="italic">Blood Meridian</emph>, considered by many to be one of his finest works. In 1992, <emph render="italic">All the Pretty Horses</emph>, the first of the Border Trilogy, was published, winning the National Book Award for fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. In 1994, <emph render="italic">The Crossing</emph> became the second of the trilogy, followed in 1998 by <emph render="italic">Cities of the Plain</emph>. All three of the Border Trilogy novels have been very successful both critically and commercially. Also in the 1990s, McCarthy published a play, <emph render="italic">The Stonemason,</emph> a work he had begun writing in the 1970s. </p><p>McCarthy has been compared to writers such as William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Herman Melville, sharing with such writers a "rustic and sometimes dark humor, intense characters, and violent plots," (Dianne Cox, <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Literary Biography</emph>). <emph render="italic">New York Times </emph>reviewer, Sara Mosle, describes his works as having always been "drenched in blood, much of it spilled in the South and the Southwest in the latter half of the 19th century," and McCarthy's vision as one of "bleak timelessness," (May 17, 1999). In one of a very few interviews, McCarthy said he had "always been interested in the Southwest. There isn't a place in the world they don't know about cowboys and Indians and the myth of the West," continuing on to say that there "is no such thing as life without bloodshed…The notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is really a dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous," (<emph render="italic">New York Times Magazine</emph>, April 19, 1992).</p> </bioghist>

<p>Singer-songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker was born Ronald Clyde Crosby on March 16, 1942, in Oneonta, New York. In the early 1960s, he hitchhiked cross-country, singing in bars and on street corners, adopting the name Jerry Jeff Walker in 1966. While performing in Texas, Walker met songwriter Bob Bruno, with whom he formed a band called the Lost Sea Dreamers (and later Circus Maximus), and relocated to New York City.</p><p>In 1968, Walker wrote the song he would become famous for, "Mr. Bojangles", which enabled him to embark on a solo career, this time based in Austin. Although Walker's recording of the song barely broke the charts, artists such as Tom T. Hall, Sammy Davis, Jr., Harry Belafonte, George Burns, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band covered it, making Walker and his music known to a national audience.</p><p>Walker became a central figure in the burgeoning alternative country scene in Austin beginning in the early 1970s. In 1973, he recorded the album "Viva Terlingua" in Luckenbach, Texas, a ghost town which was memorialized by Waylon Jennings' 1977 hit song of the same name. Walker began to celebrate his birthday in Luckenbach, an event which has grown to legendary proportions. From the early 1970s to 1978, he played with the Lost Gonzo Band, which was known for its skilled musicians, including singer-songwriter Gary P. Nunn.</p><p>In 1986, Walker formed his own production company, Tried and True Music, and began to take more time with each of his recording projects. In 1991, he began hosting the television show "The Texas Connection", on the Nashville Network (TNN).  In that same year, he played at the inauguration of Texas Governor, Ann Richards, and two years later at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.

<p>In July, 1991, a team of photographers and oral historians from Texas State University set out to retrace the steps of Farm Security Administration photographer, Russell Lee (1903-1986). Fifty years after Lee visited and photo-documented the living and working conditions of the Depression era communities of San Augustine, Texas, and Pie Town, New Mexico, this group was inspired by Lee's FSA images held at Texas State's Wittliff Collections. The group visited these same two towns Lee visited, in some cases the same people, taking photographs and conducting oral histories. The team was funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation, and was led by Francine Carraro and Eric Weller. Students included Tom Anderson, Kathleen Dolan, Homero Garcia, Kerri Madden, Darryl Meyer, Stephanie Shaddock, Karen Sorenson, Mark Edward Smith, Russell Smyth, and Sondra Talbert. </p><p>The oral histories and photographs taken by this team led to an exhibit and accompanying catalog featuring selected photographs and portions of the oral histories. The exhibit was first shown at Texas State in September, 1992, and traveled to Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX) and Stephen F. Austin University (Nacogdoches, TX) in 1993. </p><p>Jean Lee, widow of Russell Lee, and Bill Wittliff donated a significant collection of Russell Lee's vintage FSA prints and field notes, as well as cameras, personal papers, and photographs spanning Lee's entire lifetime and career, to the Wittliff Collections beginning in 1986.

<head>Biographical or Historical Information</head>
<p>Widely considered one of America's greatest living playwrights, Sam Shepard is also an accomplished actor, director, screenwriter, and musician. Born Samuel Shepard Rogers IV on November 5, 1943 in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, Shepard is the oldest of three children. His family traveled extensively before settling in Duarte, California, outside of Pasadena, where his childhood experiences informed themes that mark much of his later playwriting. Shepard described Duarte as a "weird accumulation of things, a strange kind of melting pot – Spanish, Okie, Black, Midwestern elements all jumbled together. People on the move who couldn't move anymore, who wound up in trailer parks." (<emph render="italic">Rolling Stone, </emph>1986). Shepard told biographer Don Shewey that his alcoholic father "had a real short fuse," and that he was often the target of his father's anger. In high school he began acting and writing poetry. He also worked as a stable hand at a horse ranch in Chino, California from 1958-1960. Thinking of becoming a veterinarian, Shepard studied agriculture at Mount Antonio Junior College for a year; but when a traveling theater group, The Bishop's Company Repertory Players, came through town, Shepard joined them and left home. After touring with them from 1962-1963, he moved to New York City and worked as a bus boy at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village.</p><p>In New York, Shepard spent much of his time reading the works of playwrights and writing short "rock and roll" plays which frequently focused "on a single event, the characters often talking past one another or breaking into long monologues. However puzzling the action, these plays already ring out with Shepard's deft rhythms," (<emph render="italic">Contemporary Dramatists </emph>1999). Shepard disavowed the narrative convention that required consistent character motivations, preferring instead to see his characters as capable of a wide variety of roles and actions. Shepard once told an interviewer that, "I preferred a character that was constantly unidentifiable, shifting through the actor, so that the actor could play almost anything, and the audience was never expected to identify with the characters," (Shewey, <emph render="italic">Sam Shepard, </emph>1997, p. 51). Shepard reconsidered this initial approach to his writing as a result of the influence of New York director and acting teacher Joseph Chaikin. As Shepard said, Chaikin helped him understand that there's, "…no room for self indulgence in theater; you have to be thinking about the audience." (Kevin Berger, salon.com, January 2, 2001) Chaikin also convinced Shepard to begin re-writing his plays in order to discover the essence of the experience. Prior to that, Shepard said, his "tendency was to jam, like it was jazz or something." (Berger, salon.com, January 2, 2001)</p><p>Shepard's playwriting debut took place at Theater Genesis on October 16, 1964, with a double bill of <emph render="italic">Cowboys</emph> and <emph render="italic">Rock Garden</emph>. In 1966, he received a grant from the University of Minnesota, the first of several he would receive in the coming years. Also in 1966, he won an unprecedented trio of Obie awards for <emph render="italic">Chicago, Icarus' Mother, </emph>and <emph render="italic">Red Cross. </emph>The awards, presented by off-off Broadway champion <emph render="italic">The Village Voice</emph>, helped Shepard's career gain momentum at a time when critics remained wary of his works. </p><p>In 1967, Shepard wrote <emph render="italic">La Turista, </emph>his first full-length play, which won an Obie the same year. More Obies for his early works followed, including <emph render="italic">Melodrama Play</emph> and <emph render="italic">Cowboys #2</emph> in 1968. Shepard also received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1967 and the Guggenheim Foundation in 1968. Also in 1968, Shepard joined a rock band, the Holy Modal Rounders, playing drums and guitar. Although he played with the band for three years, he continued to write and received a second Guggenheim Foundation grant in 1971.</p><p>Shepard married O-Lan Jones Dark, an actress, on November 9, 1969, with whom he had one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard. Shepard and Dark divorced in 1984. In 1971, Shepard had a much-publicized relationship with rock singer Patti Smith. Together they wrote <emph render="italic">Cowboy Mouth, </emph>acting the parts on stage in the first night's performance.</p><p>In 1971, Shepard and family traveled to England, where four more plays premiered (<emph render="italic">The Tooth of Crime, Blue Bitch, Geography of a Horse Dreamer, </emph>and <emph render="italic">Little Ocean</emph>). <emph render="italic">Tooth of Crime</emph> was later presented in the U.S., winning an Obie in 1973. The next year, Shepard returned to the United States and served as the playwright in residence for The Magic Theater in San Francisco, a post he held for the next ten years. It was during this time that Shepard made his mark on mainstream American drama, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play <emph render="italic">Buried Child</emph> and producing his best-known plays, among them, <emph render="italic">True West</emph> in 1980.</p><p>In 1975, he took part in Bob Dylan's "Rolling Thunder Review," a nationwide touring group that included Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs. Shepard eventually published an account of the experience in 1987, titled <emph render="italic">Rolling Thunder Logbook.</emph> In 1978, Shepard began his film career, appearing in Bob Dylan's <emph render="italic">Renaldo and Clara</emph> and later that year in <emph render="italic">Days of Heaven, </emph>directed by Terence Mallick. Also in 1978, Shepard began his collaboration with Joseph Chaikin, with the theater piece, <emph render="italic">Tongues. </emph> Chaikin and Shepard would also collaborate on <emph render="italic">Savage/Love </emph>(1979), and <emph render="italic">The War in Heaven, </emph>which was presented on WBAI radio in 1985.</p><p>In the 1980s, his works continued to win awards. He won his eleventh Obie for <emph render="italic">Fool for Love</emph> (1984.) <emph render="italic">A Lie of the Mind</emph> won the New York Drama Critics Award in 1986. Also during the 1980s, Shepard's screenwriting and acting career began to grow. Screenplays included <emph render="italic">Me and My Brother, Zabriskie Point, and Fool for Love. </emph>His most popular and critically acclaimed film, <emph render="italic">Paris, Texas, </emph>won a Golden Palm Awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. This screenplay was commissioned by German director Wim Wenders, and was based loosely on Shepard's <emph render="italic">Motel Chronicles. </emph>His acting roles included <emph render="italic">Resurrection </emph>(1980), <emph render="italic">Raggedy Man</emph> (1981)<emph render="italic">, Frances </emph>(1982), <emph render="italic">The Right Stuff </emph>(1983), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, <emph render="italic">Country </emph>(1984), <emph render="italic">Fool for Love </emph>(1985), <emph render="italic">Crimes of the Heart </emph>(1986), and <emph render="italic">Steel Magnolias </emph>(1989). He wrote and directed <emph render="italic">Far North </emph>(1988), which starred Jessica Lange.</p><p>Shepard continued to write new plays in the 1990s, though his output has slowed from the dizzying pace of the 1960s-1970s. <emph render="italic">States of Shock</emph> premiered in 1991, and in 1992 a revised version of <emph render="italic">True West </emph>was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Drama. <emph render="italic">Simpatico </emph>opened in 1994, and his revision of <emph render="italic">Buried Child</emph> opened on Broadway in 1996 and received a Tony Award nomination. Another collaboration with Joseph Chaikin, <emph render="italic">When the World Was Green (A Chef's Fable) </emph>also premiered in 1996.</p><p>Shepard's collection of stories, <emph render="italic">Cruising Paradise, </emph>was published by Knopf in 1996. <emph render="italic">Curse of the Starving Class</emph> opened in 1997 and <emph render="italic">Eyes for Consuela </emph>(based on an Octavio Paz short story) was produced in 1998. In 2001, Shepard returned to San Francisco's The Magic Theater for the premier of his new play <emph render="italic">The Late Henry Moss.</emph></p><p>Shepard's acting career also flourished through the 1990s and 2000s, with appearances in <emph render="italic">Defenseless </emph>(1991), <emph render="italic">Thunderheart </emph>(1992), <emph render="italic">The Pelican Brief </emph>(1993), and <emph render="italic">The Good Old Boys </emph>(1995), among others.

From 1983 to 2010, Shepard was in a committed relationship with actress Jessica Lange, with whom has two children, Hannah Jane Shepard and Samuel Walker Shepard.</p><p>Shepard's impact on modern theater can be gauged by the numerous scholarly books and articles devoted to his work, as well as the hundreds of productions of his plays, both in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p><emph render="bold">Further readings:</emph></p><p><emph render="italic">American Dreams : The Imagination of Sam Shepard</emph>.

<p>Novelist James Crumley was born in Three Rivers, Texas, on October 12, 1939 and spent most of his childhood in south Texas. He maintained a straight-A average in high school while also playing football. After graduation he attended the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta on a Navy ROTC scholarship, but soon left to enlist in the U.S. Army, where he served from 1958 to 1961. Crumley then returned to Texas and enrolled at Texas A&amp;I (now Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville), where he had received a football scholarship. Crumley completed his BA in History in 1964, and was accepted into the University of Iowa's prestigious creative writing program, where he earned a MFA in 1966. Immediately after graduating he joined the English faculty at the University of Montana at Missoula. His masters thesis was eventually published as the novel, <emph render="italic"> "One to Count Cadence</emph>, in 1969, a popular and critically acclaimed look at the Vietnam War. After his novel was published, Crumley left Montana to hold a series of visiting professorships: the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville (1969-70), Colorado State University (1971-74), Reed College in Portland, Oregon (1976-1977), Carnegie-Mellon University (1979-1980) and the University of Texas at El Paso (1981-1984.)</p>

<p>During a two-year stretch as a freelance writer (1974-1976) Crumley published the first in a series of crime novels for which he would become known. <emph render="italic">The Wrong Case</emph> (1975) featured a detective named Milo Milodragovitch, who would also appear in later novels. "I always introduce my work by explaining that I am a bastard child of Raymond Chandler – without his books, my books would be completely different. We cover some of the same ground, his dark streets in LA, my twisted highways in the mountain west. But because of the events surrounding the Vietnam War, my detectives are not as comfortable with traditional morality as Philip Marlowe seems to be," (Contemporary Authors, 2000). </p>

<p>In 1978 <emph render="italic">The Last Good Kiss </emph>(1978) was published, which introduced Crumley's other detective protagonist, C.W. Sughrue. His third crime novel,<emph render="italic"> Dancing Bear</emph> (Milodragovitch series), was published in 1983. After leaving his last teaching job in 1984, Crumley has worked full-time as a writer. He's made his home base in Missoula, Montana since the mid-1980s. He has worked on film screenplays, which remain unproduced, and has continued to write and publish fiction. <emph render="italic"> The Muddy Fork and Other Things: Short Fiction and Nonfiction</emph> was published in 1991, featuring many of Crumley's short stories. The detective series continued with <emph render="italic">The Mexican Tree Duck</emph> (Sughrue series) in 1993, and <emph render="italic">Bordersnakes </emph>(1996), which brought together Milodragovitch and Sughrue for the first time. </p>

<p>According to Robert E. Burkholder in the <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook</emph> (1984), Crumley's crime novels stand "the genre on its head by creating an antiheroic protagonist plagued by the weakness and vice of the corrupt world in which he lives and works and endowing him, nevertheless, with the sort of noble instincts that motivate him to sift through the scum in order to identify right from wrong. Crumley's detectives are curiously amoral moralists."</p>

<p>Crumley's final published works include <emph render="italic">The Putt at the End of the World </emph>(2000); the Milodragovitch series novel, <emph render="italic">The Final Country</emph> (2001); and one in the Sughrue series, <emph render="italic">The Right Madness</emph> (2005). He passed away September 17, 2008 from complications from kidney and pulmonary disease. </p>

<p>Poet and writer Tino Villanueva was born on December 11, 1941, in San Marcos, Texas, to a family of migrant workers. Because of the demands of traveling to harvest crops, Villanueva was never able to attend school regularly. Despite the hardships, he managed to graduate from San Marcos High in 1960 and began working on an assembly-line at a local furniture factory. In 1963, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1963 and spent two years in the Panama Canal Zone. There he became immersed in Hispanic literature, reading the works of poets such as Rubén Darío and Cuban revolutionary José Martí.

<p>Writer Jan Reid was born on March 18, 1945, in Abilene, Texas. After graduating from high school he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, 1964-1970. He received his BA from Midwestern University in 1968 and then went on to receive his MA from the University of Texas in 1972. Reid began to write for the <emph render="italic">Mt. Pleasant Tribune</emph> and soon after quit to seek another job as the sports editor for the <emph render="italic">New Braunfels Herald</emph> in 1972. His break came in 1973 when an editor at <emph render="italic">Texas Parks and Wildlife</emph> magazine suggested he contact a publication that was just getting started in Austin. <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> needed young, hungry contributing writers. Along with Stephen Harrigan, Shelby Hearon, Prudence Mackintosh and others, Reid joined in on the ground floor in 1973 and became one of the upstart publication's first writers. He wrote countless stories for <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> and soon after became a contributing editor for the magazine. </p><p>
In 1974 Reid published <emph render="italic">The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock</emph>, which tells the story of "the movement that changed the face of traditional country music. It traces the development of the exuberant music community in Austin, Texas, from its formative years in the early sixties up to the flourishing activities of the present." "Like many Americans of my generation, I had fantasized my share of guarded moments over the turn my life would have taken had I been one of those lucky fellows with guitars slung like machine guns on their hips, mowing the audiences down." </p><p>
He also started up Look Away Books, a small publishing company. While visiting Mexico, along with three friends, on April 20, 1998 he was shot by two robbers. Soon after Reid began to write a book, <emph render="italic">The Bullet Meant for Me</emph>, about his ordeal, describing how the shooting left him a paraplegic and his subsequent struggle to regain as much physical control of his body as possible.</p><p>
Texas A&amp;M University Press recently published <emph render="italic">Close Calls: Jan Reid's Texas</emph>, a collection of some of Reid's best-loved magazine pieces. Also, the March 2001 issue of <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> included a story, by Reid, about legendary Texas author Billy Lee Brammer and <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph>, Brammer's equally legendary novel about politics.</p><p>Reid passed away on September 19, 2020.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Elizabeth Crook was born in 1960 in Nacogdoches and raised in San Marcos, Washington DC, where her father directed VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) under Lyndon B. Johnson, and Australia, where her father served as ambassador. Crook went on to Baylor University, and received her B.A. in English from Rice University.</p><p>
In 1985, she began intensely researching what would become an article in the <emph render="italic">Southwestern Historical Quarterly</emph> (July, 1990), focused on the 1828 marriage of Tennessee governor Sam Houston and the 20 year old Eliza Allen. This article became the touchstone of her best-selling first novel, <emph render="italic">Raven's Bride</emph>, published in 1991 by Doubleday. The 750 page manuscript was accepted by the publisher after fifteen publishing houses had rejected it; Crook's soon-to-be editor at Doubleday, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, called her personally to accept it. Journalist and author Bill Moyers writes that in <emph render="italic">Raven's Bride</emph>, Crook "brought to life the great events of Texas past and turned them into a robust novel. The characters, the descriptions, and the drama are a panorama that only a fine historian or inspired novelist could handle to the reader's delight, and Ms. Crook is both."</p><p>
In 1993, Crook was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters. A year later, she published her second novel, <emph render="italic">Promised Lands: A Novel of the Texas Rebellion</emph>, also edited by Ms. Onassis at Doubleday. "At a time when war is sanitized, televised, and intellectualized, Crook's most important contribution may be her reminder of the insanity and sheer waste of it all… Though she probably did not intend it that way, her account of the slaughter at Goliad is one of the most powerful anti-war statements I've read" (Joyce Slater, <emph render="italic">Houston Post</emph>).</p><p>

<p>Beverly Lowry was born August 10, 1938, in Memphis, Tennessee, and moved with her family at age six to Greenville, Mississippi. She attended the University of Mississippi (1956-58) and graduated with a B.A. from Memphis State University in 1960. She married Glenn Lowry in June 1960, and moved with him to Manhattan. There, she pursued acting and experimented in writing. After relocating to Houston in 1965, Lowry began to write stories, some of which became novels. Lowry began teaching fiction writing as an associate professor at the University of Houston in 1976, while also pursuing acting, and serving on boards for the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, and for Houston Festival. Her fiction writing has typically been set in Texas and Mississippi. Her first two novels, <emph render="italic">Come Back, Lolly Ray</emph> and <emph render="italic">Emma Blue</emph> were both set in Eunola, Mississippi a fictional town much like her hometown of Greenville. Her next three novels and one work of non-fiction were set in Texas, with her most recent novel, <emph render="italic">The Track of Real Desires</emph>, being again set in the fictional Eunola, Mississippi.</p><p>The Lowrys lived just outside San Marcos along the San Marcos River from 1981-1991. One of the Lowrys' two sons, Peter, died in a hit-and-run accident on the highway from San Marcos to their home in 1984. This experience and other personal losses in the early 1980s "caused a marked change in the tone of Lowry's fiction. Gone is her unqualified faith in the future; present is a new preoccupation with fate or chance, even a hint that felicity may invite disaster," (<emph render="italic">Contemporary Southern Writers</emph>, St. James Press, 1999). These themes of isolation and alienation appear in <emph render="italic">The Perfect Sonya</emph>(1987), <emph render="italic">The Track of Real Desires</emph> (1994), and clearly in <emph render="italic">Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir</emph> (1992). Beginning in 1989, Lowry approached and visited convicted pickaxe murderer Karla Faye Tucker, on death row in Hunstville, Texas. <emph render="italic">Crossed Over </emph>relates the story of Karla Faye Tucker as well as some of Lowry's own personal story, resulting in "far more than the usual true-crime tale. Lowry interwove the story of her own troubled son with a chilling account of Tucker's dangerously out-of-control life to achieve an understanding of the human being behind an ostensibly inhuman act; her leap of imagination and empathy enabled her, at last, to make peace with Peter's death," (<emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>, Feb. 2001). Lowry moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and currently teaches at George Mason University, in Virginia. She continues to write essays and non-fiction, and has been working on a biography of Madame C. J. Walker, the first Black woman to become a self-made millionaire.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Austin City Limits, a television program showcasing musicians in concert performances, was founded in 1974 by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) affiliate station KLRU-TV in Austin, TX. The show's creators were Bill Arhos, then program director, as well as Paul Bosner and Bruce Scafe, who subsequently produced and directed programs for the series. Their aim was to develop a locally produced program that could attract national attention through distribution to PBS affiliates. Capitalizing on the growing Austin music scene of the 1970s, Arhos received PBS funding for a pilot show featuring Willie Nelson and Family.</p><p>Station executives across the country liked the pilot and funded filming for Austin City Limits first season, thirteen shows that were taped in 1975 and premiered in 1976. Austin City Limits continues to follow that filming schedule with each season taped during one calendar year and aired the next. The one-hour programs usually pair two musicians, each given thirty-minute segments in which to deliver an uninterrupted, concert-style performance to a studio audience. Nationally known artists are often paired with lesser-known regional or local performers, giving those lesser-known artists a chance to be seen by the whole country. Although the mainstream country and progressive country genres have been staples of the program, Austin City Limits has also featured an eclectic mix of American music: jazz, blues, folk, pop and rock. Studio 6-A in the Communications building on The University of Texas (UT) campus is the permanent home for the show. Some members of the production crew have been with the show since the beginning. In November 2003, Austin City Limits became the first television program ever to be awarded the National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p><p>The donor of this collection, Bill Arhos, was co-creator of Austin City Limits and executive producer of the show until his retirement in 1999. A Texas native and graduate of Rice University, he received his Master of Educational Administration from Texas A &amp; M. A semi-pro baseball player and a schoolteacher for part of his career, Arhos began working at KLRN-TV, now KLRU, in 1961. He was an instructor in Radio/TV/Film at UT from 1965-1970. He served six years on the PBS Board of Directors and completed two terms on the Country Music Association (CMA) Board of Directors in 1994. Over four decades in public television, Arhos produced and directed educational and entertainment programs, series and specials, and served as program director, general manager, and president of KLRU. He passed away on April 11, 2015 at the age of eighty. </p> </bioghist>

<p>William Broyles, Jr. was born October 8, 1944 in Houston, Texas, and was raised in Baytown. He attended Rice University, earning a B.A. in History in 1966. While at Rice, Broyles was an active member of the student body and a contributing editor to the student newspaper, <emph render="italic">The Rice Thresher</emph>. As early as 1966, Broyles was also contributing articles to the <emph render="italic">Houston Post</emph>. Broyles served as president of the Rice student association during the 1965-1966 academic year, and was awarded the Hugh Scott Cameron award for outstanding community service. He has remained a strong supporter of the University throughout his career, delivering the commencement speech in 1983, and receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1993. </p><p>After graduating from Rice, Broyles was invited to study as a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University where he earned an M.A. in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics in 1968. While at Oxford, Broyles pursued his interests in both journalism and public service. He wrote political columns for the Oxford University magazine and contributed articles to the Economist of London. He also spoke throughout England for the United States Information Service. He later worked briefly for Leo Kramer, Inc., a Washington, D.C. social sciences consulting firm as a consultant on Model Cities, Manpower, and VISTA training programs. </p><p>In 1968, Broyles's career was put on hold when he was drafted into the United States Marine Corps. Between 1969 and 1971, he rose to the rank of First Lieutenant and served in Vietnam, first as an infantry commander, and later as an aide-de-camp to the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Marine Division. Due to his education background and experience, his assigned duties included social issues with an emphasis on the refugees in the Quang Nam Province. Broyles received the Bronze Star and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star. </p><p>Broyles's experiences in Vietnam inspired two of his most critically acclaimed projects. In 1984, he was one of the first veterans to return to Vietnam, and his book <emph render="italic"> Brothers in Arms: A Journey from War to Peace</emph>, recounts his visit and his impressions of the aftermath of war on himself and his fellow soldiers, as well as on the country he fought against in battle. In 1988, Broyles once again drew upon his memories in Vietnam when he co-created the award-winning television series, <emph render="italic">China Beach</emph>, a weekly drama for ABC about the doctors and nurses stationed at an American military base in Danang.</p><p>Upon returning from Vietnam in 1971, Broyles picked up his professional career. He taught Philosophy and Political Science at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis before returning to Texas as Chief Public Relations Officer for the Houston Independent School District. After a brief period of time in public service in Houston, Broyles was provided the opportunity to pursue his other primary interest, journalism. He became the founding editor of <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> magazine in 1972. </p><p>Broyles's and <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> publisher Michael R. Levy's goal was to create a magazine of national quality in Texas, and Broyles spent eight years doing just that. Within its first year, the publication won a National Magazine Award for excellence; and during Broyles's tenure it quickly gained recognition as a "writer's magazine," offering intelligent and entertaining articles on Texas life ranging from politics, culture, art, sports, the environment, social issues, and entertainment. The award-winning magazine continues today as an example of quality journalism with a regional focus and a national readership. </p><p>In 1980, Broyles and business partners, including Michael Levy, purchased <emph render="italic">New West</emph> magazine from Rupert Murdoch. Broyles served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1980-1982, and saw it through its redesign and re-naming as <emph render="italic">California</emph>. By 1982, Broyles's impressive track record in the magazine publishing world had caught the attention of Katherine Graham who recruited him to serve as editor of <emph render="italic">Newsweek</emph> magazine. He held that position from 1982-1984 when he resigned to pursue other interests. </p><p>During the next few years, Broyles made one more foray into the magazine publishing world, serving as editor-in-chief of <emph render="italic">Cable Guide</emph>, but he focused primarily on developing his writing career. In addition to <emph render="italic">Brothers in Arms</emph>, he wrote a three-act play titled <emph render="italic">Boot</emph>, about three soldiers in a bunker in Vietnam joined by a new recruit that they nickname "Boot". The plot follows the four young men as they struggle to cope with the realities of war. </p><p>In 1988, Broyles found critical success with the television series <emph render="italic">China Beach</emph>. In addition to co-creating the show with John Sacret Young, Broyles also wrote or co-wrote several of the early episodes, and remained producer and creative consultant throughout the run of the show. In 1991, the Golden Globe-winning <emph render="italic">China Beach</emph> went off the air, but Broyles was well into production on his second television project, <emph render="italic">Under Cover,</emph> a political espionage series following the adventures of husband-and-wife secret service agents, Dylan and Kate Del'Amico. The series was short-lived, and Broyles next adapted the Nigel Hamilton novel, <emph render="italic">J.F.K.: Reckless Youth,</emph> for a 1993 television mini-series of the same name starring Patrick Dempsey as the young future president. </p><p>Also in 1993, Broyles turned his attention from television projects to writing feature films. He shares his first screenwriting credit with former <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> writer, Al Reinert for <emph render="italic">Apollo 13</emph>. The film, based loosely on the novel <emph render="italic">Lost Moon</emph>, co-authored by astronaut James Lovell and Jeffrey Kruger, was directed by Ron Howard. It was met with both critical and box office success, and Broyles and Reinert were nominated for the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay. </p><p>After <emph render="italic">Apollo 13</emph>, Broyles began work on <emph render="italic">Cast Away</emph>, an original screenplay about a FedEx executive stranded on a deserted island. Released in 2000, the film was produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it features Tom Hanks as the resilient Chuck Noland. <emph render="italic">Apollo 13</emph> and <emph render="italic">Cast Away</emph> secured Broyles's place as an A-list Hollywood screenwriter, and he holds writing credits on several other motion pictures including <emph render="italic">Entrapment</emph> (1999), <emph render="italic">Planet of the Apes</emph> (2001), <emph render="italic">Unfaithful</emph> (2002), <emph render="italic">Polar Express </emph>(2004), and <emph render="italic">Jarhead</emph> (2005).

<p>Born in Duluth, Minnesota on March 16, 1890 to Henry S. Mahon and Helen Brooks Mahon, Winifred Mahon Sanford enjoyed a brief but noteworthy literary career from 1925 to 1931. Her 15 short stories appeared popular magazines of the day such the <emph render="italic">American Mercury</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Woman's Home Companion</emph>. She has been called an "unjustly forgotten" Texas author whose work realistically captures the social transition in post-World War I Texas brought about by the oil boom.</p><p>Educated for a year at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts (1909), she received a degree in English from the University of Michigan in 1913. Before marrying law student and naval officer Wayland H. Sanford in 1917, Winifred Mahon taught high school in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and in Idaho, then worked as a librarian in New York City. In 1920, the Sanford's first daughter, Emerett, was born in Duluth. Soon after that, Winifred Sanford followed her husband to Wichita Falls, Texas, where he had found employment as an oil and gas attorney. Their second daughter, Helen, was born in their new home in 1922.

Although she is known primarily for her short stories, Sanford's first published work, "England and the Home-Rule Question," appeared in the<emph render="italic"> South Atlantic Quarterly</emph> in 1913 when she was still at the University of Michigan. Her early work includes unpublished, possibly autobiographical stories she wrote as a child and portraits of family members.

Once established in Wichita Falls, Sanford joined The Manuscript Club, a literary group that met for the first time in 1922 and included published authors Anne Pence Davis and Fay M. Yauger. Along with three other members of The Manuscript Club, Sanford was elected as a member of the Texas Institute of Letters. The women belonging to this club encouraged each other's writing aspirations, providing a forum in which to discuss and critique members' works. By January 1925 Sanford's story "Wreck" was published in the <emph render="italic">American Mercury</emph>, edited by H. L. Mencken. Sanford and Mencken established a regular correspondence in which he encouraged her writing endeavors. She went on to publish eight more short stories in the <emph render="italic">American Mercury</emph>, as well as others in the <emph render="italic">Woman's Home Companion</emph>, <emph render="italic">The North American Review</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Household</emph> until 1931. In addition, three of her works were listed in J. O. O'Brien's <emph render="italic">The Best Short Stories of 1926</emph>, which brought her to the attention of several literary agencies. One such agency was the Paget Literary Agency, which represented Sanford for several years. Sanford began working on a novel in 1925 that she submitted to Paget two years later.

In 1931 the Sanford family moved to Dallas, where Winifred Sanford continued to work on her novel but had little success publishing it, nor is there any record of short stories written during this time. Because no copy of her novel appears in her Papers, it is assumed that she disposed of it. The Sanford's third daughter, Mary, was born in 1933. The next year an article entitled "Derrick Jargon," co-authored with Clyde Jackson, was published in 1934 by Southern Methodist University in <emph render="italic">The Southwest Review</emph>.

Winifred Sanford suffered a long-term illness in 1937 which kept her bed-ridden for over a year, after which no other new articles, novels, nor stories were published. In 1938 Sanford submitted a detective novel to the Paget Literary Agency with no success. She attempted to sell one last short story, "Deep C," to three magazines in 1945, but none of the editors thought the story would appeal to their readers.

Sanford's story "Windfall" was reprinted in several anthologies and textbooks from 1928 to 1988, and other stories appeared in collections in 1982 and 1998. However, no collection was dedicated solely to her works until 1980. She and her family privately published <emph render="italic">Windfall and Other Stories</emph>, a collection of 13 of her 15 short stories originally printed between 1925 and 1931, as well as two stories not originally intended for publication.

Winifred Mahon Sanford died at the age of 93 on March 24, 1983, but she left a distinguished legacy. <emph render="italic">Windfall</emph> had caught the attention of Suzanne Comer, senior editor at Southern Methodist University Press, who in 1987 began the process of securing permission to reprint the collection as a part of the Southwest Life and Letters Series of SMU Press. The family agreed to the reprinting, and in November 1988 it appeared and gained regional acclaim, with reviews appearing in newspapers and such publications as <emph render="italic">Legacies</emph>, <emph render="italic">Belles Lettres</emph>, <emph render="italic">Southwestern Historical Quarterly</emph>, <emph render="italic">Western American Literature</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Texas Books in Review</emph>. *. Her writing skills have been compared to Katherine Ann Porters', and one critic claimed that Sanford's fiction was "some of the best creative work to date on Texas during the oil boom of the 1920s." **

This flurry of attention to Sandford's work led to a film entitled <emph render="italic">The Stars Fell on Henrietta</emph> in 1995. The screenplay, based on Sanford's story "Luck," was written by Sanford's grandson Philip Railsback and produced by Clint Eastwood's production company. In early 1997 The Dallas Museum of Art and the Friends of the Dallas Public Library hosted a program called "Arts and Letters Live: A Literary Celebration," in which Sanford's "Windfall" was read by Sheriden Thomas. In 2004, Helen Sanford donated her mother's literary papers to the Southwestern Writers Collection.</p><p>

<p>Mary Gray Hughes, the daughter of Texas author and newspaperman, Hart Stilwell and his first wife, Mary Gray Seabury, was born in Brownsville, Texas on August 25, 1930. A prolific and respected author in her own right, Hughes wrote and was published almost continuously for nearly three decades from 1969 until dying from cancer in Chicago, IL in September, 1999. Throughout her life, she received numerous awards for her writing. She received the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Writing (1978), was Illinois Writer in Residence from 1977-1980, had her stories anthologized in <emph render="italic">Best American Short Stories</emph> (1962, 1972), had her stories mentioned in <emph render="italic">Best American Stories</emph> (1974-1975), and was elected a member of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1983.</p><p>

<p>Author Rick Riordan was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1964. He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in English and History, and in 1988, he received his teaching certification from The University of Texas at San Antonio. He began graduate studies in English and Medieval Studies at San Francisco State University and then pursued a career in education in Oakland, California, where he taught middle and high schools. He continued teaching English for fifteen years in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Texas. Riordan has since retired from teaching to focus his energy on writing full-time. </p>
<p>Like many successful authors, before writing and publishing full-length novels Riordan honed his craft by writing short stories. "The Sheet Cave" and "Out on 1040" were featured in <emph render="italic">Cactus Alley</emph> in 1988. "A Small Silver Gun" was featured in <emph render="italic">Family Circle Mary Higgins Clark Mystery</emph> in the summer of 1998. His short stories have also appeared in <emph render="italic">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.</emph> </p>
<p>Riordan is perhaps best known for his popular series of mysteries books featuring Tres Navarre, a San Antonio private detective, martial arts master, and English Ph.D. in Medieval literature. In 1997, <emph render="italic">Big Red Tequila</emph>, the first in the Navarre mystery series was published. It won the Anthony Award for best original paperback and the Shamus award for the best first private investigator novel. He followed this early success with the second in his series, <emph render="italic">The Widower's Two- Step</emph> in 1998. This novel also won Anthony and Shamus awards, as well as the Edgar award for best original paperback. <emph render="italic">The Last King of Texas</emph> (2000) was a featured alternate for the Mystery Guild, and <emph render="italic">The Devil Went Down to Austin</emph> (2001) was also critically acclaimed. His newest mystery, and the fifth in the Tres Navarre series, is <emph render="italic">Southtown</emph>, which was published in 2004. Riordan also writes novels outside of the Tres Navarre series. <emph render="italic">Cold Creek</emph> was published in 2003 and placed on the American Library Association's top-ten suspense novels list. In 2003, he was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters.</p>
<p>Riordan uses his native South and Central Texas as locations for many of his novel's settings, and his admiration for this area is apparent. However, he had not always anticipated that he would write about the region. <emph render="italic">At The Scene of the Crime</emph>, a panel discussion held in the Wittliff Collections in 2004, Riordan reflected that distancing himself from the area helped him to appreciate it: "I didn't have any desire to write about San Antonio at all until I moved to California…I had to move away, and I had to appreciate what I knew before I wanted to write about it."</p> </bioghist>

<p>Artist Edward "Buck" Muegge Schiwetz (1898-1984) was born in Cuero, Texas on August 24, 1898 to banker William Berthold and his wife, Anna (Reiffert) Schiwetz. He inherited his artistic talents from his mother, whose pencil drawings served as a model for the young Schiwetz. Further influenced by a local china painter, Mary Louise Gramann, Schiwetz's early paintings depict his subjects in clear, precise strokes. <emph render="italic">Cabin in the Woods</emph>, his earliest work, reflects this style.</p>
<p>Schiwetz graduated from high school in 1916, and although he was unable to realize his dream of attending art school, he made the best of his education, and it provided a strong foundation for would later develop into a very successful artistic career. He attended college at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, what is now Texas A&amp;M University, receiving his degree in architectural design in 1921.  In 1922, after a year of graduate studies in Architecture at Texas A&amp;M, Schiwetz moved to Dallas in search of work as an architectural drafter. To supplement his income initially, he created advertisement sketches, working under John Doctoroff and Guy Cahoon. He then landed a job with the architectural firm Thompson and Swaine, where he worked for two years.</p>
<p>On January 30, 1926, Schiwetz married fellow artist, Ruby Lee Sanders, a sculptor and ceramist. The couple moved to Houston in 1928 where Schiwetz did freelance rendering and advertisement art for a year before they moved to New York City.  While in New York, Schiwetz further pursued his craft and enrolled in the Art Student's League where he studied etching and lithography. It is during this time period that he sold his art work to magazines, including <emph render="italic">Pencil Points</emph>, a volume of which contains an interview with E.M. Schiwetz and is part of this collection.  According to that interview, Schiwetz admired and studied the work of Otto Eggers, Joseph Pennell, and Louis Rosenberg, among others.</p>
<p>After their brief stay in New York, the Schiwetz couple moved back to Houston where E.M Schiwetz became a partner in what was to become Wilkinson – Schiwetz and Tips, which later became McCann-Erickson.  While in Houston, he and his wife had a daughter, Patricia, in 1931.</p>
<p>Schiwetz won many awards for his sketches and paintings of Texas buildings, landscapes and oilfields throughout the 1930s and 1940s. He also won the Houston Popular Prize in 1951-1952. His work was exhibited throughout the country, including the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. and the Art Institute of Chicago. Other honors bestowed upon him include his selection as the official state artist of Texas for 1977-1978 and as the artist-in-residence at his Alma Mater, Texas A&amp;M during the school's centennial celebration in 1976. Various books of his sketches have been published, including <emph render="italic">Buck Schiwetz' Texas</emph> in 1960 which contains an introduction written by Walter Prescott Webb, one of Schiwetz' former high school teachers.</p><p>Schiwetz suffered a heart attack and stroke in 1974 causing temporary paralysis on his right side and then had surgery to remove cancer in 1976.  Despite these health setbacks, Schiwetz continued to work, always experimenting with and perfecting his art.  He died on February 2, 1984.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Grover Virgil Lewis, Jr. was born November 8, 1934, in San Antonio, Texas. Tragedy struck the Lewis family when Grover was eight years old during an encounter between Grover's mother and his estranged father that led to a double-homicide with each parent allegedly murdering the other by gunshot. Lewis was soon removed to Fort Worth, Texas, where he lived with the blight of, in his own words, a "haunted" and "painful" existence while in the abusive household of his maternal aunt and her husband. After five years, he fled to live with his uncle, "Spook" Bailey, in the Fort Worth suburb of Oak Cliff. </p><p>At Oak Cliff, Lewis attended W.H. Adamson High School and worked at the Texas Theater, a site made infamous some years later as the location where Lee Harvey Oswald was taken into custody. He graduated from Adamson in 1953 and moved to Denton to attend North Texas State College where he majored in English and Drama. It was around this time that Lewis married and fathered a son and a daughter with his first wife, Peggy. At North Texas he also found a "kindred spirit" in future Pulitzer Prize-winner Larry McMurtry.

Together Lewis and McMurtry —"each being the only aspiring writer the other knew"— found their way around the back roads and byways of Texas. And Lewis, like McMurtry, began his career as a writer while attending North Texas. He and McMurtry both won various student writing awards for poetry, fiction, and nonfiction in <emph render="italic">Avesta</emph>, the school's literary magazine; and Lewis's creative work was soon published in other literary magazines and journals such as <emph render="italic">Carolina Quarterly</emph>, <emph render="italic">New Mexico Quarterly</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. Samuel French Inc. published his play <emph render="italic">Wait for Morning, Child</emph>, after winning the company's national collegiate writing contest.

Also while at North Texas, Lewis and McMurtry and a third North Texas student, John Lewis (no relation to Grover) self-published two issues of <emph render="italic">The Coexistence Review</emph>, a literary magazine full of original poetry, short fiction, and essays that became notoriously controversial on campus. Knowing that after graduation they were both headed in different directions —both moving away from Denton— Lewis and McMurtry intended the magazine as a token of gratitude devoted to several inspiring professors at North Texas.

The school's administration, however, was not as enthusiastic about the project as the 200-plus students who eagerly bought-out the magazine. According to Lewis's book proposal for his unfinished memoir <emph render="italic">Goodbye If You Call That Gone</emph>, "The administration sent out growls of disapproval via channels. Somebody had to explain the 'political error' of the red lone-star cover to us. It began to be whispered around that there would be a loyalty investigation of some sort…whether conducted by the school or the state legislature, nobody would say."</p><p><emph render="italic">The Coexistence Review </emph>was interpreted as a thinly-veiled attempt to broadcast communist propaganda; and Lewis and McMurtry were thus prohibited from publishing in the school's accepted literary magazine, <emph render="italic">Avesta</emph> (although the two had been named winners of the semester's literary awards). But the threatened investigations never materialized, and Lewis and McMurtry both graduated on schedule from North Texas State College in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in English. Lewis left Denton but remained in Texas, contributing book and music reviews to several of the state's metropolitan newspapers such as the <emph render="italic">Dallas Times Herald</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</emph>.</p><p>In 1960, Lewis was named a National Defense Act fellow and moved to Lubbock to pursue a Ph.D. at Texas Technical College (now Texas Tech University). While a graduate student at Tech, he again wrote for the school newspaper and edited Tech's literary magazine, <emph render="italic">The Harbinger</emph>. Lewis also worked as a graduate teaching assistant, and his students included Ponty Bone and Jimmie Dale Gilmore — both of whom became acclaimed Texas musicians.</p><p>While in Lubbock, Lewis found himself frustrated by the conservative culture, lifestyle, and politics of the South Plains. Around 1960, he made plans to leave and set out to find and write about blues musician Lightnin' Hopkins. Lewis traveled to Houston's Third Ward and spent a week with Hopkins writing what eventually became a 5-part series published years later in <emph render="italic">The Village Voice </emph>(1968) and winner of a Sigma Delta Chi writing award.</p><p>It was during this time, circa 1963, that Lewis discovered his passionate interest in film journalism. Accepting an invitation from McMurtry, Lewis spent a week on the film set of <emph render="italic">Hud</emph> in Amarillo, a motion picture adaptation of McMurtry's novel <emph render="italic">Horseman, Pass By</emph>. Lewis's unrealized notes from his experience in Amarillo became the blueprint from which he would work seven years later, with his famous <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph> article about the filming of <emph render="italic">The Last Picture Show</emph>.</p><p>After returning from Houston to his graduate studies at Lubbock, Lewis met fierce resistance to his scathing review in the school paper of a Christian, anti-communist tract written by Billy James Hargis. He was subsequently dismissed from his duties as columnist for the school paper, abandoned by his professors, and received death threats by phone and mail. Lewis's appeals for help — to, among others, the Students for a Democratic Society - fell on deaf ears. Lewis, in turn, not only dropped out of graduate school, but divorced his wife and signed away parental rights to his two children.</p><p>Out of school and without his doctorate, Lewis returned to the copy desk of the <emph render="italic">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</emph>, where he slipped into the life of a hard-drinking newsman. During his three-year tenure at the <emph render="italic">Star-Telegram</emph>, he contributed frequent reviews to the book page and began the first pop music column for a daily newspaper in the state of Texas. In 1966, Lewis moved to Houston as a reporter for the <emph render="italic">Houston Chronicle</emph>, but quit two years later to write copy for a Houston advertising and public relations firm. A year later, in 1969, Lewis moved to San Francisco, California, to work as a West Coast correspondent for <emph render="italic">The Village Voice</emph>.</p><p>Although his term at the <emph render="italic">Voice</emph> was brief (1969-1970), Lewis was able to utilize his unique position at the epicenter of youth-culture activity by covering such milestones as the Native American takeover of Alcatraz Island and the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont Speedway. It was Lewis's coverage of the Altamont murder that caught the eye of Jann Wenner, founder, editor-in-chief, and publisher of one of the nation's newest and most unpredictable magazines, <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph>. </p><p>From 1970 to 1973, Lewis worked as Associate Editor of <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph> magazine, in charge of features on film and books. <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph>'s independent spirit proved auspicious for Lewis. He was allowed to self-assign stories and follow his own initiative; and in doing so, produced electrifying pieces of New Journalism, notably his "Splendor in the Short Grass" — a piece <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph> later called "extraordinary" — which revolved around the wealth of in-house drama running throughout the big-budget motion picture production of director Peter Bogdanovich's <emph render="italic">The Last Picture Show</emph>, a film adaptation of yet another Larry McMurtry novel. Due to the praise and popularity of that reportage, Lewis was able to continue producing on-location features for <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph>, interviewing such eminent talents as Robert Mitchum, Sam Peckinpah, Robert Redford, and Paul Newman.</p><p>Although Straight Arrow Press, the publishing arm of <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph>, published two books featuring Lewis's work—<emph render="italic">I'll Be There In the Morning, If I Live</emph> (poetry) and <emph render="italic">Academy All The Way </emph>(collected <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph> coverage)—his relationship with Jann Wenner soured, in large part due to a baulked agreement between Wenner and Lewis over a book Lewis was contracted to write with friend Sherry Kafka about Texas politician John Connally. Lewis describes Wenner — dubbing him "Citizen Wenner" — as a capricious and manipulating editor, a "bottom-feeder" with a personality "exacerbated by cocaine." Lewis sued Wenner over the Connally deal for breach of contract and was awarded $10,000 in an arbitration proceeding. </p><p>After marrying <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph> employee Raona Ence Seavey in 1973, Lewis quit the magazine and moved with Rae to her home state of Utah where he found work despite Wenner's attempt to blacklist him professionally. Lewis worked briefly as a freelance writer for <emph render="italic">Playboy</emph> and <emph render="italic">Oui </emph>magazines before moving back to California—Los Angeles, this time—in late 1976 to write for <emph render="italic">New West </emph>(later named<emph render="italic"> California</emph>), a nascent publication at the time.</p><p>At <emph render="italic">New West</emph>, Lewis continued where he left off at <emph render="italic">Rolling Stone</emph>, writing pieces about Bette Midler, Elisha Cook, Jr. (from <emph render="italic">The Maltese Falcon</emph>), and <emph render="italic">Hustler</emph> publisher Larry Flynt. Lewis was walking with Flynt outside the county courthouse in Lawrenceville, Georgia, when the publisher was shot in an assassination attempt. The article, "The Shooting of Larry Flynt: An Eyewitness Account by Grover Lewis," was published as a cover feature for the March 27, 1978, issue of <emph render="italic">New West</emph>. In addition to celebrity profiles, Lewis wrote opinion-driven pieces for <emph render="italic">New West</emph>, such as his "Buried Alive in Hype: My Years Among The Reality Vultures," which was nominated for a National Magazine Award in 1979.</p><p>During the 1980s, as freelance magazine work became more elusive, Lewis turned to newsprint, contributing stories and book reviews for <emph render="italic">The Washington Post</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Los Angeles Times Book Review</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The St. Petersburg Times</emph>. It was also during this time that Lewis worked as book editor of <emph render="italic">Movieline</emph> magazine and began copious research for his unrealized novel, <emph render="italic">The Code of the West</emph>, based on the Western cinema-heroes of Old Hollywood. </p><p>In 1992, Lewis began to confront the troubling memories of his childhood with his <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> article "Farewell to Cracker Eden," nominated for a PEN West award for journalism in 1993. On the strength and poignancy of that well-received article, he was awarded a contract with HarperCollins to write a memoir under the editorial guidance of Judith Regan. Unfortunately, the memoir—which was to be titled <emph render="italic">Goodbye If You Call That Gone</emph>—remained unfinished due to Lewis's untimely death from lung cancer on April 16, 1995. His widow, Rae Lewis, began donating his literary archives to the Wittliff Collections in 2001.</p><p>
In 2005, University of Texas Press published <emph render="italic">Splendor in the Short Grass: The Grover Lewis Reader</emph>, a collection of Lewis's journalism and poetry spanning his nearly forty-year career. The collection preserves Lewis's work—and reputation—as one of New Journalism's founding fathers and most fearless mavericks. In his <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> book review of <emph render="italic">Splendor</emph>, Roy Blount, Jr., calls Lewis's work "Impressive" and "worth preserving." "Lips were loose in those days," as Blount recalls, "and Lewis took every advantage."

<p>John Wesley Hardin was born on May 26, 1853 in Bonham, Fannin County, Texas, the second of James Gibson and Elizabeth Cartwright Dixon Hardin's eight children. Hardin's father was a circuit-riding Methodist preacher and named his son after the founder of the Methodist sect. </p><p>J. G. Hardin moved the family frequently during Hardin's childhood. They settled in Moscow, Polk County, in 1855, then moved in 1859 to Sumpter, Trinity County, where J. G. Hardin taught school. In 1861, J. G. Hardin passed the bar and moved the family to Livingston, Polk County, Texas where he taught school and practiced law.</p><p>After the war, in 1865, the family returned to Sumpter. In 1868, the 15 year old John Wesley Hardin killed his first victim, a former slave. Texas was ruled by the military according to congressional reconstruction policies and Hardin believed that he would not receive a fair trial. He fled and later claimed to have killed three soldiers who were sent to arrest him and that his relatives and neighbors helped him bury and hide the evidence. In 1869, his father sent him away from the area to teach school in Pisga, Navarro County, where other relatives lived. He left the school after one term to take up more lucrative pursuits. He developed his skills in gambling and became enamored of horse racing. By the end of 1869, Hardin by his own admission had killed a freedman and four soldiers. In December of that year he killed Jim Bradly in a fight after a card game. His life subsequently became a pattern of gambling, saloons, fights, and killing.</p><p>In 1871, Hardin visited his relatives, the Clements, in Gonzales County. J. G. Hardin's sister Martha Balch had married Emmanuel Clements and Hardin was close to his first cousins, Mannen (or Manning), Joe, and Gip. They convinced him to go with them on a cattle drive to Abilene, Kansas. Hardin used his gun often on the drive. Among his victims were an Indian who shot at him with an arrow and five Mexicans with whom he had argued for crowding his herd. In rough and ready Abilene, Hardin fraternized and sparred with Wild Bill Hickock and Ben Thompson. When his cousin Mannen Clements was jailed for the killing of two of Clements' cowboys, Hardin made arrangements with Hickock for Mannen to escape. Later Hardin killed a man at his hotel and fled Abilene fearing arrest by Hickock. </p><p>Hardin returned to Gonzales County, Texas, where he and the Clements piled up indictments (Marohn 44). Hardin married Jane Bowen on February 29, 1872. Jane was fully aware of Hardin's way of life and remained totally loyal to her husband through all the vicissitudes of their married life. Hardin was frequently apart from Jane, often to avoid the law. In August 1872, Hardin was wounded after being shot by Phil A. Sublett who had lost money to Hardin in a Trinity City Saloon. Hardin tried to hide out while he recovered but finally gave himself up when his whereabouts were discovered. Along with an indictment for assaulting Sublett, Hardin had several other indictments outstanding when he was arrested. He was sent to Gonzales County at the request of Sheriff W. E. Jones who held warrants against him (Marohn 56). He broke out of the Gonzales County jail with the help of Mannen Clements.</p><p>On February 6, 1873, Hardin's first child Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) was born. In April, he killed J. B. Morgan in a Cuero barroom, one of the two killings for which he would ultimately be convicted. The same year, he became embroiled in the Taylor-Sutton feud as a leader of the Taylor faction. Hardin was related by marriage to the Taylors and both Taylors and Suttons relied on the loyalty of kin. Hardin and Jim Taylor killed the powerful and ruthless Sutton supporter, Jack Helm. In March of 1874, Hardin and his older brother Joseph aided Billy and Jim Taylor in their assassination of the leader of the Sutton faction, Bill Sutton, as he boarded a boat in Indianola on his way to New Orleans. After Bill Sutton's murder, Hardin put together another cattle drive and journeyed to Comanche to say goodbye to his family. On May 26, he was celebrating his winnings from a horse race, drinking at the Comanche saloons, when he met up with deputy sheriff Charles Webb from neighboring Brown County. Webb was killed and the crowd turned against Hardin and his companions. Hardin escaped but his father, brother Joseph, and other kinsmen were arrested. Joseph Hardin and two cousins were taken from jail at night and lynched. Hardin, vowing to avenge his brother's death, fled Texas followed by his wife and daughter. Under the name of J. H. Swain he relocated in Florida among his wife's relatives. He later moved his family to other Bowen relatives in Pollard, Alabama across the Florida border. John Wesley Hardin, Jr. was born August 3, 1875. A daughter, Callie, (later renamed Jane Martina and called Jennie) was born July 15, 1877. </p><p>In 1873, Reconstruction had ended in Texas with the election of Richard Coke over radical Republican E. J. Davis. As soon as the former confederates were returned to power, the populace was eager to see an end to the violence and lawlessness which had been rampant since the end of the war. Coke re-established the Texas Rangers in 1874, in part to reinforce local law enforcement in their ineffectual fight against cattle thieves, gangs and feudists. He created a Special Force whose first duty was to end the Sutton-Taylor feud. In 1877, John B. Armstrong, a second Lieutenant in the Special Force, requested that he be commissioned to find and arrest the fugitive Hardin. A Dallas detective Jack Duncan was hired to live undercover among Jane Hardin's relatives in Gonzales County in order to learn where Hardin was. Jane's brother, Brown Bowen, also a fugitive hiding in Alabama, betrayed their whereabouts when he wrote his father and told him that his sister Jane sends her love. Armstrong and Duncan went to Pensacola Junction in Florida and made arrangements with the sheriff to arrest Hardin on the train as he was returning home to Alabama on August 23, 1877. They overpowered Hardin and transported him back to Texas where they lodged him in the Austin jail. Under heavy guard by the Texas Rangers, Hardin was taken to Comanche County and tried for the murder of Charles Webb in September of 1877. He was convicted to 25 years in the state prison but appealed the sentence on technical grounds. He was returned to Austin October 6, 1877 to await his hearing. Hardin's brother-in-law, Brown Bowen, was also in the Austin jail sentenced to die by hanging for the murder of Thomas Haldeman. The Bowens asked Hardin to take the blame for the Haldeman murder. Hardin refused maintaining his innocence. Jane Hardin stood by her husband, thereby estranging herself from her father. Brown Bowen was hung proclaiming Hardin was the guilty one to the very last.</p><p>In June 1878, Hardin's conviction was upheld. He entered prison in Huntsville on October 5, 1878. He made several unsuccessful attempts to escape and was harshly punished each time. Eventually he settled into prison life, joined the debating society, attended Sunday school and studied law. In January 1892, Hardin was sent to Cuero, Texas where he plea bargained a 2 year concurrent sentence for the 1873 murder of J. B. Morgan. He was released from prison February 17, 1894 after 15 years and 5 months with time off for good behavior. He rejoined his children in Gonzales County. His wife Jane had died November 6, 1892.</p><p>Hardin's attorney wrote Governor Hogg for a full pardon based on the fact that Hardin had completed his sentence and was "behaving in an orderly manner." (Marohn 180) The pardon was granted on March 16, 1894. Hardin then passed a law examination and set up practice in Gonzales. He became embroiled in a controversy with W. E. Jones in Jones' campaign for Gonzales County sheriff. Hardin supported Jones' opponent and charged that Jones had helped him escape from prison in 1872. When Jones won a close election, an embittered Hardin left Gonzales and moved to Junction where his brother Jeff was living. By December, he opened a law office there. In January he married the 15 year old Callie Lewis but she left him soon after.</p><p>A relative, Jim Miller, asked Hardin to come to Pecos in far West Texas to give legal assistance in his feud with the Pecos County Sheriff, Bud Frazer. Miller was suspected of several murders himself, and when Hardin consented to help him, he was walking straight back into his old way of life. The Miller case ended with a hung jury and Hardin drifted to El Paso. He set up a law office there but soon let his practice slide. He again frequented saloons, gambled, drank to excess and got into fights. On August 19, 1895, John Selman, with whom Hardin had been arguing, shot Hardin in the back of the head as he threw dice at the bar of the Acme Saloon.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Pulitzer Prize winning novelist and playwright, Cormac McCarthy, was born Charles McCarthy, Jr., on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the third of six children born to Charles and Gladys McCarthy, preceded by sisters Jackie and Bobbie, and followed by Bill, Maryellen, and Dennis. In 1937, his parents moved the family to Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father was employed as a lawyer with the Tennessee Valley Authority.
McCarthy spent much of his life in Tennessee, and his early works are clearly influenced by that region. His first four published novels, The Orchard Keeper (1965), Outer Dark (1968), Child of God (1973), and Suttree (1979), reflect the culture, myth and character of East Tennessee and Appalachia. </p><p>McCarthy briefly attended The University of Tennessee (UT) from 1951 to 1952 before serving four years in the U.S. Air Force, including two years in Alaska where he hosted a radio program. In 1957, he returned to UT where he published the short stories "A Drowning Incident" and "Wake for Susan" in the student literary magazine, The Phoenix. His literary talent did not go unrecognized at UT, and McCarthy received the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960, firsts in a long list of literary accolades to come. </p><p>In 1960, McCarthy left UT without his degree and moved to Chicago where he worked part time in an auto parts warehouse and pursued his writing. He married poet and former UT student, Lee Holleman; the couple had one son, Cullen. In 1961, they moved to Sevier County, Tennessee, where the marriage ended in divorce in 1962. McCarthy left Tennessee again, this time moving to Asheville, North Carolina, and then New Orleans where he continued work on his first novel, The Orchard Keeper. Set in rural Tennessee between the two world wars, it is the story of a boy, John Wesley Rattner, and the bootlegger, Marion Slyder, who has killed the boy's father.
McCarthy has notably kept his distance from reporters, but in 1992 he granted Richard Woodward a rare interview published in The New York Times Magazine. In that interview, he confessed that he sent the manuscript for The Orchard Keeper to Random House because, "it was the only publisher I had heard of." At Random House, McCarthy was paired with renowned editor, Albert Erskine, who had worked with literary giants such as Robert Penn Warren, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner. McCarthy's Southern Gothic novels continue to be compared with those of the latter, and McCarthy's debut novel earned him the William Faulkner Foundation Award in 1965. Erskine remained McCarthy's editor for over twenty years - until his retirement in the mid 1980s. Blood Meridian (1985) was their final collaboration. </p><p>In the same year The Orchard Keeper was published, McCarthy received the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters traveling fellowship, and he used the funds to go to Ireland. En route on the ocean liner, Sylvania, he met English dancer and singer, Anne De Lisle, and the two were married in England in 1966. A Rockefeller Foundation grant McCarthy received that same year supported the couple as they traveled through Europe and lived briefly on the Spanish island of Ibiza where McCarthy began work on his second novel, Outer Dark. They eventually moved to Tennessee, settling in Rockford, near Knoxville. </p><p>Outer Dark was published in 1968. It tells the story of brother and sister, Culla and Rinthy Holme, who have a child together. He lies, claiming the child has died, and leaves to search for paying work. She then searches for her "littlest chap." Like McCarthy's debut novel, Outer Dark was a critical, if not popular, success. The selection committee for the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation agreed with the critics, and McCarthy was awarded a Fellowship for Creative Writing in 1969. </p><p>McCarthy's third novel, Child of God, was published in 1973. The story of the isolated mass murderer and necrophile, Lester Ballard, is loosely based on an historical figure in Sevier County, Tennessee. Like his previous works, Child of God could not be considered a commercial success, but a steady following of devoted readers and critics grew. </p><p>Following Child of God, McCarthy departed from the novel format to write the script for The Gardener's Son, an episode in the PBS series, Visions. It first aired January 6, 1977 and starred Brad Dourif, Ned Beatty, and Kevin Conway as members of two feuding South Carolina families, the wealthy Greggs, and the blue-collar McEvoys. </p><p>Suttree, McCarthy's fourth novel, was published in 1979. Written over the span of twenty years, the semi-autobiographical novel set in the early 1950s follows Cornelius Suttree, a fisherman on the Tennessee River who lives on the fringe of society after severing ties with his family and abandoning his wife and son. Many of the characters are reflections of people that McCarthy knew in Knoxville and the surrounding area. </p><p>
By the time Suttree was published, McCarthy was living in El Paso, Texas. He had separated from De Lisle in 1976, and the two divorced in 1978. In 1981, McCarthy won a coveted MacArthur Fellowship, commonly referred to as a "genius grant." The five-year grant provides recipients with "flexibility to pursue their creative activities in the absence of specific obligations or reporting requirements," and it allowed McCarthy to concentrate on his next writing project.</p><p>McCarthy's move to the southwest brought a shift in the settings of his novels. He began work on what he termed his "western," which was published in 1985 as Blood Meridian. In his 1992 interview with Woodward, McCarthy states, "I've always been interested in the Southwest. There isn't a place in the world you can go where they don't know about cowboys and Indians and the myth of the West." In Blood Meridian, McCarthy tackled the myth of the West head-on with his mid-nineteenth century border story of "the kid" and a band of American mercenaries hired to kill and scalp Indians in Mexico. The novel firmly thrust McCarthy into the center of the American literary canon. Critic Harold Bloom declared Blood Meridian, "the authentic American apocalyptic novel," stating, "The fulfilled renown of Moby-Dick and of As I Lay Dying is augmented by Blood Meridian, since Cormac McCarthy is the worthy disciple both of Melville and of Faulkner. I venture that no other living American novelist, not even Pynchon, has given us a book as strong and memorable."</p><p>McCarthy followed Blood Meridian with three novels set on the Texas-Mexico border in the mid-twentieth century, and which reveal the dreams and coming-of-age of two remarkable characters, John Grady Cole and Billy Parham. All the Pretty Horses (1992), The Crossing (1994), and Cities of the Plain (1998), known collectively as "The Border Trilogy," were McCarthy's first novels published after Erskine's retirement and McCarthy's move from Random House to Knopf. They also mark another significant shift in McCarthy's career -- for the first time, his novels were bestsellers. </p><p>McCarthy continued to receive praise from critics; All the Pretty Horses won the National Book Award in 1992 and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1993. And he received personal accolades with his induction into the El Paso Herald-Post Hall of Fame in 1991 and his reception of the Texas Institute of Letters Lon Tinkle Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. In 2000, All the Pretty Horses was released as a film directed by Billy Bob Thornton and starring Matt Damon as John Grady Cole. Ted Tally wrote the screenplay. </p><p>While McCarthy is best known for his novel writing, he has also written in other formats. The Stonemason, a play about an African-American family in Louisville, Kentucky that he wrote in the 1970s was revised and published by Ecco Press in 1994. And in 2006, Sunset Limited, a novel in dramatic form originally performed by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, was published in paperback by Vintage Books.</p><p>McCarthy initially began No Country for Old Men as a screenplay in the 1980s, but he eventually abandoned the format. Instead, the suspenseful story of sociopathic killer Anton Chiguhr's pursuit of Llewelyn Moss was published in 2005 as his ninth novel. Ethan and Joel Coen adapted it for film in 2007, starring Javier Bardem as Chiguhr, Josh Brolin as Moss, and Tommy Lee Jones as sheriff Ed Tom Bell. In interviews supporting the film's release, the Coen brothers joked that in adapting the novel for the screen, one of them simply held the book open while the other typed. The film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, and best screenplay adaptation. </p><p>McCarthy's tenth novel, The Road, was published in 2006. The post-apocalyptic story of a father and son's journey across a ruined landscape was dedicated to his son John Francis, from his third marriage to Jennifer Winkley. The novel won McCarthy the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for fiction as well as the United Kingdom's oldest literary award, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. In March 2007, Oprah Winfrey selected The Road as a reading for her popular book club, and the reclusive McCarthy made his first televised interview on her show that year. </p><p>McCarthy currently resides in the Santa Fe, New Mexico area, where he enjoys an affiliation with the multi-disciplinary Santa Fe Institute and continues to write.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Book collector and bibliographer, J. Howard Woolmer, wrote to Cormac McCarthy praising both Outer Dark (1968) and McCarthy's first novel, The Orchard Keeper (1965) after reading Robert Coles' review of Outer Dark published in the March 22, 1969 issue of The New Yorker. In his July 29, 1969 letter, Woolmer states his intent to begin collecting all of McCarthy's work and asks if the author would be willing to sign copies of his books. In his August 16 reply, McCarthy agrees. These letters mark the first of over 120 sent between the two men from 1969 to 2006.</p><p>By 1969, Woolmer had been in the book selling business for almost ten years. Operating out of the literary Mecca of New York City, he issued his first catalogue in 1961. His early catalogues were of modern first editions and on the works of literary giants such as James Joyce. Woolmer soon began issuing catalogues based on single subjects; the first on the Imagist Poets (1966) and then, in 1969, on the novelist Malcolm Lowry, author of Under the Volcano. He has since published a bibliography on Malcolm Lowry; A Checklist of the Hogarth Press; and a bibliography of the Leonard L. Milberg Irish Theatre Collection. </p><p>In a 2007 interview, Woolmer stated that he had initially moved away from modern firsts because "I didn't get enough of a kick from the books of contemporary writers." However, with Cormac McCarthy he had discovered an exception, and over the next thirty years he amassed a remarkable collection of signed first editions, advance proofs, and foreign imprints of McCarthy's books. The Wittliff Collections purchased these books in 2006 along with the collection of letters between McCarthy and Woolmer. </p> </bioghist>

The 288-page script was written by McMurtry with Peter Bogdanovich in 1972. The project failed to materialize and McMurtry eventually chose to expand the idea into a sprawling 843-page novel eulogizing the Texas past, both factual and mythical, as represented by the horseman and cowboy. Motown Productions contracted with CBS Television to air the western as an eight-hour miniseries. Bill Wittliff, who had scripted the westerns <emph render="italic">Barbarosa</emph> (1982) and <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph> (1986), was signed to write the teleplay. He also served as Executive Producer. Filming began March 1988 in Austin, Texas; moved to Del Rio, Texas in April and then to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in May, wrapping in July after 88 days of shooting. The film, directed by Simon Wincer and starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Urich, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston and Diane Lane, aired on CBS in February 1989 to high ratings and critical acclaim. </p><p>Among <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove's</emph> many awards were seven Emmys for directing, sound editing, sound mixing, makeup, costume, music, and casting. It also received a Peabody Award and two Golden Globe Awards, one for best miniseries and one to Robert Duvall for best actor in a miniseries. Duvall, already a celebrated actor noted for a distinguished career, reported that the character Gus was a favorite role, and he remarked "When I was doing <emph render="italic">The Godfather,</emph> I knew we were doing something big. When I was doing <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph>, I got the same feeling. I've only felt that a couple of times in my life." (<emph render="italic">New York Tribune</emph>, Feb 6, 1989) Bill Wittliff reminisced "sometimes something just takes over and is a good example of that. I think every element works, from cast to crew to wardrobe to Jerry [sic] White's art design and the production design . . . it was just a beautiful combination of enormously talented people . . . [and] the final project was larger than all the people." (<emph render="italic">Austin Chronicle,</emph> March 11, 1994)</p> </bioghist>

<p>Jerry Retzloff was born in San Antonio, Texas, on January 4, 1940 to Walter (Red) and Celia Retzloff. He was raised on the Southeast side of town, proudly attending Central Catholic High School. Upon graduation, Jerry decided to join the U.S. Coast Guard and was stationed in San Francisco, California. He enjoyed the USCG and often spoke pridefully of being the only coasty to have never gotten seasick on his ship despite numerous significant storms on his watch. During one storm, he wagered everyone their once-a-week ration of steak that he would not get seasick – he won the bet and ate steaks daily for over a month.</p><p>Upon returning from the USCG, he came back to San Antonio and joined Lone Star Brewery in 1963. He loved his job at Lone Star Beer, working on the dock, the accounting office, and ultimately ending up in marketing and special promotions. While at Lone Star in his early years, he also earned his bachelor's degree in marketing from St. Mary's University. In the mid 1970s, he became the district manager for Lone Star in Austin, Texas. He worked passionately to grow the brand through the burgeoning Austin music scene. Jerry identified with the younger crowd and made connections quickly - enjoying music, meeting people, building relationships and promoting the "National Beer of Texas". He developed many bonds with musicians from the area including Kinky Friedman, Red Stegall, Charlie Daniels, and, among others, his lifelong friend, Willie Nelson.</p><p>Jerry originated the concept of calling beer bottles "long necks" and promoted the idea of "Long Live Long Necks". He was especially proud to have been featured in an article for Texas Monthly (2014) entitled "Bottle Rocket" - an amazing article on how Jerry built the Lone Star brand through music, unique promotions and his travels from Austin to Nashville to Hollywood. To cap his legendary career in the beer/music business, a phenomenal exhibit was created in his honor at Texas State University's Wittliff Collections.</p><p>After retiring with 34 years at Lone Star Beer, Jerry pursued his hobby of fishing and telling stories on frequent trips to the Rockport area. He also served in the hospital ministry at the downtown Baptist Hospital for 26 years. Having built a vast network of friends over the years, he genuinely enjoyed people, had a servant's heart, was kind to all and never encountered a stranger. His trademark phrase of "Not to Worry" stuck with him until the end. He passed away March 10, 2020.</p><p>[From obituary, March 2020]</p> </bioghist>

Perez's credits as a dramatist also include <emph render="italic">Speaking of Cats</emph>, inspired by Tejana activist Emma Tenayuca and the 1938 pecan shellers strike in San Antonio.</p><p>Perez's 1995 film, <emph render="italic">…and the earth did not swallow him</emph>, is adapted from Tomás Rivera's classic 1971 Chicano novel, <emph render="italic">…y no se lo tragó la tierra</emph>, and follows the lives of a South Texas family of migrant farmworkers in the 1950s. Perez's nuanced, powerful film beautifully evokes the substance and spirit of Rivera's work, and it has won international critical acclaim, including top honors at film festivals worldwide. Some of these honors include the Gold Medal at the 12th Annual Television Movie Awards in 1997, Jury Award at Vina del Mar (Chile) International Film Festival in 1996, Sol Award CineSol at the 1995 Latino Film Festival, Best Feature at the San Diego Independent Film Festival in 1994 and the Minneapolis Rivertown Film Festival in 1995, Best of the Fest Audience Award at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1994, and Jury Award for Best Director at the Cairo International Film Festival in 1994.</p><p>In 1998, Perez finished a documentary, <emph render="italic">Willa Brown: An American Aviator</emph>, about a remarkable woman—a pioneering African American pilot who took to the air in the 1930s and defied Jim Crow laws. Her efforts led to Congress forming the renowned Tuskegee Airmen squadron. The film is currently distributed by Filmakers Library.</p><p>Perez's other films include a documentary on artist Carmen Lomas Garza: <emph render="italic">Carmen Lomas Garza: Looking Back</emph>; a family drama about a high school girl's desire to attend college, <emph render="italic">Dreams of Flying</emph>; a documentary about dancer-choreographer Rudy Perez, <emph render="italic">Countdown: Reflections on a Life in Dance</emph>, an adaptation of Mark Twain's <emph render="italic">The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</emph>; a feature film on Tejano hero Juan Seguin; a documentary about immigrants in Southern California, <emph render="italic">There Goes the Neighborhood</emph>; an animated film about the history of writing, <emph render="italic">Astronauts and Jelly Beans</emph>; a drama about AIDS for young teens, <emph render="italic">Between Friends</emph>, a documentary about four retired African American men, <emph render="italic">Elders</emph>; as well as short documentaries on a wide range of subjects, including La Raza Unida's 1960s political uprising in Crystal City, Texas. He also negotiated the deal at Universal Studios that allowed Luiz Valdez to direct the film version of <emph render="italic">Zoot Suit</emph>.</p><p>In 2012 Perez published his first novel, <emph render="italic">The Challengers Aero Club</emph>, inspired by his documentary on aviator Willa Brown and other pioneering African American pilots in the early 20th century.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Overview</emph></p><p>Naomi Shihab Nye, acclaimed poet who also writes essays, songs, novels, and children's books; edits poetry anthologies, and teaches poetry writing to youth and adults, was born in 1952 in St. Louis, Missouri to Aziz Shihab, a journalist and immigrant from Palestine, and Miriam Shihab, a Montessori teacher with a fine arts degree in painting. Nye has won numerous awards, including her first major recognition for <emph render="italic">Hugging the Jukebox</emph> as a National Poetry Series selection in 1982, critical acclaim for her 2011 short story collection <emph render="italic">There Is No Long Distance Now: Very Short Stories</emph>, Best Books for Young Adults several times from the American Library Association, and the gratitude of San Antonio Independent School District teachers for her poetry teaching packets. Nye is a Lannan Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and Poetry Foundation Young People's Poet Laureate for 2019-2021. Nye referred to herself as an "itinerant writer," referring to the twelve years from 1974-1986 she spent teaching poetry in schools around Texas, while also writing and publishing. Nye lists her early influences, starting at age five, as Carl Sandberg, Margaret Wise Brown, Emily Dickinson, William Blake, and Louisa May Alcott. High School and college influences include Henry David Thoreau, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Gertrude Stein, and William Stafford; the last of whom Nye was able to work with, and she became friends with Stafford and his family.</p><p>Nye began writing early in life, publishing poetry at age 7 and continuing throughout her childhood. She wrote a column for teens in high school, and while teaching across Texas and the country she continued to write and publish. While teaching children poetry during the Gulf War, which began in 1991, Nye read the students poetry written by Iraqi writers, and ultimately edited <emph render="italic">This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from Around the World</emph>, which includes 129 poets from 68 countries. Her young adult novel <emph render="italic">Going Going</emph>, 2005, is an attempt to recognize and document her neighborhood in San Antonio, Texas as it changed due to gentrification. This attention to the connection of people across the world, and their local daily realities, imbues Nye's work. For Nye, the best audience is children, and she does not recognize a distinction between adult and children's writing. While writing poetry for adults in the 1970s and 1980s, Nye searched for cross-over texts to use with the young people she was teaching. In the 1990s her editor Virginia Duncan suggested she write for children, which she did with <emph render="italic">Sitti's Secrets</emph>, and continues today. To date, Nye has published audio recordings of songs she wrote and sang; children's books, including picture books, poetry, poetry anthologies, and young adult novels; written and edited poetry for adults; served as a columnist for <emph render="italic">Organica</emph> and poetry editor for <emph render="italic">The Texas Observer</emph>; and contributed to numerous poetry anthologies and periodicals.</p><p><emph render="bold">Early Life and Family</emph></p><p>Naomi Nye and her family moved to Jerusalem when she was in high school, around 1965, where she met her father's family for the first time. Nye attended a school that instructed in Arabic, Armenian, and English, though she only knew English. After the 6-Day War in 1967, she moved with her parents and brother to San Antonio, Texas, where she still resides. Nye graduated from high school in Texas without ever having attended a football game, and in honor of this accomplishment the football players bought her a mum. Nye attended Trinity University in San Antonio and lived with her parents. She graduated summa cum laude in 1974 with a degree in English and World Religions. In 1978, Nye married Michael Nye, a lawyer-turned-photographer, and in 1986 they had a son, Madison Cloudfeather. After college, Naomi and Michael traveled extensively in Mexico and Central America, which produced many unpublished poems from this time period, and in response to the Mexican American culture in San Antonio but lack of Mexican culture, the anthology <emph render="italic">The Tree Is Older than You Are: A Bilingual Gathering of Poems and Stories from Mexico with Paintings by Mexican Artists</emph>, decades later in 1995. Nye continued her high school work of essayist, writing numerous articles on topics from poetry to politics to housework for various newspapers, served as a columnist for <emph render="italic">Organica: A Magazine of Art and Activism</emph>.</p><p><emph render="bold">Non-Writing Work</emph></p><p>Nye was the most active employee at the Texas Commission on the Arts Writers in the Schools Project, working across Texas and publishing chapbook and poetry. She stopped this work in 1986 when her son was born. Nye also worked as a visiting instructor or writer in residence across US colleges and schools, as well as internationally, including at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Hawai'i Manoa, the University of Texas at Austin and at San Antonio, and Texas State University in San Marcos.
Nye also contributed to two PBS television series, the "Language of Life" with Bill in 1995, and "The United States of Poetry" in 1996. As a young woman in the late 1970s, Nye wrote songs and played guitar and sang in coffee shops and for schoolchildren. She recorded an album of children's songs, <emph render="italic">Rutabaga-Roo</emph> in 1979, and an album of folk songs, <emph render="italic">Lullaby Raft</emph> in 1981. Nye writes for adults and children, is adept in multiple genres, finds home in her backyard and wherever in the world she travels, and teaches and edits anthologies as well as writes poetry. Similarly, she is both loving and accepting of all people, and a fierce activist for peace and justice.</p><p><emph render="bold">Sources</emph></p><p>

<p>Frank Waters was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado on July 25, 1902. He felt a deep connection with the geographic area known as the American Southwest that could be seen in many of his writings. His works were inspired by this deep connection of this geographic area in addition to many other topics and themes related to the American Southwest. Over the course of his lifetime, Waters wrote and published over 25 books, in addition to other works, beginning early on his life, when his short story "How It Was Settled" was first published in 1916 when Waters was fourteen. While Waters wrote many influential books and other written works, he is probably best known for his book The Man Who Killed the Deer, which was published in 1942. </p><p>Waters spent most of his life in New Mexico, particularly in Arroyo Seco, where he moved to after working for the office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington D.C. in the early 1940s. In addition to his writings, Waters was also the editor of El Crepusculo, a Spanish-English newspaper that operates out of Taos, New Mexico from 1949 to 1951 and book reviewer for the Saturday Review of Literature from 1950 to 1956. In 1992, the Frank Waters Foundation was established in his name with the idea of encouraging literary and artistic advancement in the spirit of Frank Waters and for the American Southwest. Much of the Frank Waters Papers is related to the efforts of this organization. Waters died at the age of 92 in Arroyo Seco, New Mexico on June 3,1995.</p> </bioghist>

<head>Ramón Hernández Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Ramón Hernández (1940-)became an authority on Tejano music through his work as a journalist, photographer, publicist, collector, and musicologist. Hernández was born on the West Side of San Antonio. He grew up loving music, and during his teenage years he formed a band with some classmates, but soon realized that his skills were better suited behind the scenes (the band later became The Monsanto Band). After he graduated from San Antonio's Brackenridge High School in 1960, he joined the U.S. Navy, where he became a naval intelligence officer and learned to speak five languages. It was during his military career that he found his interest as a photographer and writer. By 1968, while still in the Navy, he was freelancing as a photographer on the sets of the popular The Lawrence Welk Show and The Andy Williams Show. In 1983, he retired from the military and returned to San Antonio.</p><p>In 1985, Hernández was hired by the <emph render="italic">San Antonio Express-News</emph> to write about the local Tejano and conjunto scene. He soon began writing for other publications, including <emph render="italic">Full Tilt Boogie</emph>,<emph render="italic">La Prensa de San Antonio</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Billboard Magazine</emph>. There are many of his drafts as well as published articles in the collection.</p><p>At the same time, he started doing publicity and photography for many of the musicians he wrote about. His clients included some of the most popular names in Tejano music: Selena, Little Joe Hernandez, Patsy Torres, Los Desporadoz, Emilio Navaira, Ram Herrera, among many others. He also collected artifacts and ephemera from the early days of Tejano, conjunto, and orquesta music, preserving material from such influential artists as Lydia Mendoza, Isidro "El Indio" Lopez, Rosita Fernandez, Juan Gaytan, Narciso Martinez, and Beto Villa.</p><p>By 1990, his collection became known as the Hispanic Entertainment Archive and Research Center. Hernández wanted to create a museum that honored the legacy of Hispanics in all areas of entertainment. That goal never materialized; however, he loaned out many items from his collection for display at events and at museums including the Bob Bullock Museum, Institute of Texan Culture, and in 2017, at The Wittliff Collections with the exhibit "The Legends of Tejano Music - Highlights from the Ramón Hernández Collection." </p><p>Hernández's desire to promote Hispanic entertainers can also be seen in his 1990 creation of the National Hispanic Entertainment Directory, a massive undertaking where he published the contact information of bands, vocalists, venues, record labels, record stores, and most areas of the Tejano music industry. There are quite a few records related to this venture in the collection.</p><p>During the 1990s through the early 2000s, Hernández also worked as a publicist and promoter for many of the prominent Tejano record labels including Hacienda, CARA, and Tejano Discos (Little Joe Hernandez's label). Hernández continues to be a prolific writer with regular columns in <emph render="italic"> Street Talk </emph> and online blogs.

<head>Biographical Information</head>
<p>Sergio Troncoso (1961-) was born to Mexican immigrants in the Ysleta neighborhood of El Paso, Texas. The family lived in a colonia near the border in a house that Troncoso's parents built, but without electricity or running water for their first two years in Ysleta. </p>

<p>His family had a long history of writing and storytelling. Troncoso's paternal grandfather, Santiago Troncoso, was the editor and publisher of <emph render="italic">El Dia</emph>, the first daily newspaper in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Santiago was arrested multiple times, and even had his office firebombed several times, for reporting on government corruption. Sergio's maternal grandmother, Dolores Rivero, was a gifted oral storyteller who would tell him stories of being a teenager during the Mexican Revolution.</p>

<p>From an early age, Troncoso loved reading. On weekends he would often ride his bike the 15 miles to El Paso Public Library to check out books for the week. Troncoso attended Ysleta High School, and following in his grandfather's footsteps, he became the editor of the high school newspaper, the <emph render="italic">Pow Wow</emph>(full issues can be found in the collection).</p>

<p>In 1979, Troncoso began his studies at Harvard College, which he describes as a complete cultural and linguistic shock. It was there that Troncoso became profoundly aware of his Mexican roots in a way that hadn't been possible in El Paso. As he puts it in a 2004 profile in the <emph render="italic">Houston Chronicle</emph>, "Suddenly I was brown against this white background." After never feeling like a minority in El Paso, he used this new outsider status to delve into Latin American and Mexican history. In 1983, he graduated magma cum laude with a degree in Government, with a Latin American Certificate. After he graduated, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to Mexico where he studied economics, politics, and literature. </p>

<p>From 1985-1992, Troncoso earned graduate degrees in International Relations and in Philosophy from Yale University, where his interests included questions of the self, philosophy and psychology, and philosophy in literature. But before he earned his doctorate, he realized that his academic work was isolating, and that while he couldn't necessarily discuss the details of what he was learning with his family, he could tell stories. His first published short story "The Abuelita" (1987), was a fictionalized account of the intersection of the knowledge that he was learning at Yale with the people and places of Ysleta. This exploration of deep philosophical questions in a border setting is a theme that runs throughout his career. </p>

<p>Troncoso's first book of collected work, <emph render="italic">The Last Tortilla and Other Stories </emph>(1999) was published by University of Arizona Press, and includes "The Abuelita." It won the Premio Aztlán Literary Prize for the best book by a new Chicano writer, and also the Southwest Book Award from the Border Regional Library Association. </p>

<p>Troncoso's debut novel,<emph render="italic">The Nature of Truth</emph>(2003), was first published by Northwestern University Press and later revised and re-released in 2014 by Arte Público. In this philosophical thriller, a Yale graduate student finds out that his boss, an internationally renowned German professor, is hiding a Nazi past. </p>

<p><emph render="italic">Crossing Borders: Personal Essays</emph>(2011) contains sixteen autobiographical essays, exploring how Troncoso navigates a life full of literal and metaphorical borders. It won the Bronze Award for Essays from ForeWord Reviews, and Second Place for Best Biography in English in the International Latino Book Awards.</p>

<p><emph render="italic">From This Wicked Patch of Dust </emph>(2011) is a novel that chronicles the lives of the Ysleta-based Martinez family over the span of forty years. It won multiple awards and was named as one of the best books of the year by Kirkus Reviews, and was shortlisted as runner-up for the biannual PEN/Texas Southwest Book Award for Fiction. </p>

<p>On July 29, 2014, the El Paso City Council voted unanimously to rename the Ysleta public library branch in honor of Troncoso. At the dedication ceremony, he announced the creation of the annual Troncoso Reading Prizes to encourage students in the Ysleta area to read. </p>

<p>In 2019, Troncoso published a collection of linked short stories on immigration,<emph render="italic">A Peculiar Kind of Immigrant's Son</emph>(Cinco Puntos Press) to critical acclaim. In 2020, it won First Place in the category of Best Collection of Short Stories (English/Bilingual) at the International Latino Book Awards.</p>

<p>In 2020, Troncoso was elected President of the Texas Institute of Letters. Other honors include being inducted into the Hispanic Scholarship Fund's Hall of Fame as well as serving as a judge for multiple literary awards such as the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.

As of 2020, Troncoso lives in New York City with his wife Laura and their two sons. He teaches writing at Yale Writers' Workshop. </p>

<p>Texas Monthly magazine was founded in 1972 by its publisher, Michael R. Levy, a 26 year-old native Dallasite who was "convinced that my state was ready for a really first class magazine that will appeal directly to the sophisticated, cosmopolitan folks that Texans have become." (Texas Monthly, Feb. 1973). Levy brought aboard 27 year-old William Broyles, Jr. as editor. Broyles assembled an editorial staff that was short on journalistic experience but imbued with curiousity, intelligence, irreverence, and literary skills. Many of Texas Monthly's early staffers were friends of Broyles from Rice University, where the intellectual climate helped set the tone for the magazine. As Broyles later wrote, "If any one quality unites these farflung efforts, it is a boundless curiosity. Most of our stories began with one of us saying "I wonder..." (The Best of Texas Monthly: The First Five Years.)</p><p>Texas Monthly's first issue was published in February 1973, and it was not an immediate commercial success, selling only about 35,000 copies. But the magazine quickly gained recognition for offering a significant departure from the rest of the state's media. Texas Monthly contained intelligent and entertaining examinations of Texas life ranging from politics, culture, art, sports, personalities, lifestyles, the environment, fashion, crime, business, education, entertainment, and travel. Along the way, the magazine began to define how Texas was emerging as a contemporary urban state while still clinging to its rural mythic past.</p><p>From its beginnings, Texas Monthly developed a reputation as a "writer's magazine," and it helped develop new generations of writing talent while also offering a welcome forum for established voices. Texas Monthly hired many young writers as full-time staff members with benefits, creating a community of professional writers centered near the magazine's home base in Austin.</p><p>In 1974, after only one year of existence, the editorial staff's efforts were rewarded with a National Magazine Award (the industry equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize) for Specialized Journalism. Since then Texas Monthly has established a solid reputation for editorial excellence, winning eight National Magazine Awards and 38 nominations- a record surpassed by only The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and Esquire.</p><p>Over the next several decades, Texas Monthly has evolved and changed under new editorships and owners, but it remains the "National Magazine of Texas," chronically life in the Lone Star State, exploring its politics and personalities, barbecue and business, true crime and tacos, honky-tonks and hiking. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Beverly Lowry was born August 10, 1938, in Memphis, Tennessee, and moved with her family at age six to Greenville, Mississippi. She attended the University of Mississippi (1956-58) and graduated with a B.A. from Memphis State University in 1960. She married Glenn Lowry in June 1960, and moved with him to Manhattan. There, she pursued acting and experimented in writing. After relocating to Houston in 1965, and sending the younger of her two sons to nursery school Lowry began to write stories, some of which blossomed into novels. Lowry began teaching fiction writing as an associate professor at the University of Houston in 1976, while also pursuing acting, and serving on boards for the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, and for Houston Festival. Her fiction writing has typically been set in Texas and Mississippi. Her first two novels, Come Back, Lolly Ray and Emma Blue were both set in Eunola, Mississippi a fictional town much like her hometown of Greenville. Her next three novels and one work of non-fiction were set in Texas, with her most recent novel, The Track of Real Desires, being again set in the fictional Eunola, Mississippi.</p><p>The Lowrys lived just outside San Marcos along the San Marcos River from 1981-1991. One of the Lowrys' two sons, Peter, died in a hit-and-run accident on the highway from San Marcos to their home in 1984. This experience and other personal losses in the early 1980s "caused a marked change in the tone of Lowry's fiction. Gone is her unqualified faith in the future; present is a new preoccupation with fate or chance, even a hint that felicity may invite disaster," (Contemporary Southern Writers, St. James Press, 1999). These themes of isolation and alienation appear in The Perfect Sonya (1987), The Track of Real Desires (1994), and clearly in Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir (1992). Beginning in 1989, Lowry approached and visited convicted pickaxe murderer Karla Faye Tucker, on death row in Hunstville, Texas. Crossed Over relates the story of Karla Faye Tucker as well as some of Lowry's own personal story, resulting in "far more than the usual true-crime tale. Lowry interwove the story of her own troubled son with a chilling account of Tucker's dangerously out-of-control life to achieve an understanding of the human being behind an ostensibly inhuman act; her leap of imagination and empathy enabled her, at last, to make peace with Peter's death," (Texas Monthly, Feb. 2001). Lowry moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and currently teaches at George Mason University, in Virginia. She continues to write essays and non-fiction, and has been working on a biography of Madame C. J. Walker, the first African-American woman to become a self-made millionaire.</p> </bioghist>

<p>In a career that has spanned almost half a century, Benson has established himself as the modern king of Western Swing by being the driving force behind Asleep at the Wheel. In 1970 the Philadelphia-born Benson co-founded the band in Paw Paw, West Virginia along with Lucky Oceans and Leroy Preston. The band relocated to the Bay Area in 1971 upon the urging of musician Commander Cody, whose own band The Lost Planet Airmen was gaining prominence on the West Coast. Asleep at the Wheel quickly attracted fans, one of which was legendary rock and soul artist, Van Morrison. Soon after Morrison mentioned the band in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Asleep at the Wheel were offered a record contract by United Artists, and in 1973 their first album "Comin' Right At Ya" was released.</p><p>Not long after that, the "cosmic cowboys" of Texas came calling, and on the advice of artists like Willie Nelson and Doug Sahm, Benson moved the band to Austin.

<p>Russell Lee was born on July 21, 1903, in Ottawa, Illinois.  His parents' divorce, the death of his mother, and supervision by three successive guardians created an unsettled childhood for Lee.  In 1917 he was sent to Culver Military Academy (CMA), which provided some stability in his life.  He attended CMA until 1921, then enrolled at Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania.  He graduated in 1925 with a degree in chemical engineering and joined the Certainteed Products Company in Marseilles, Illinois.</p><p>In 1927 he married painter Doris Emrick.  The following year, Lee was transferred to Kansas City, where he became so bored with his job he resigned to pursue painting. After moving to San Francisco in 1929, the Lees resettled a year later in an artists colony in Woodstock, New York. Lee subsequently became increasingly frustrated with his limitations as a painter. In 1935, at the suggestion of a friend, he bought his first camera and his enthusiasm for photography quickly grew. He explored the technical aspects of the craft, experimenting with developing chemicals, exposure speeds, and flash photography techniques.</p><p>Lee began taking documentary photographs in Woodstock in 1935 and went to Pennsylvania to photograph bootleg coal miners. The winter of 1935 found him in New York City documenting the poor and their living conditions. Shortly after, he acquired an agent and began selling his work to magazines. In 1936, Lee joined the photographic staff of the Resettlement Administration, later renamed the Farm Security Administration (FSA), where he worked under the creative supervision of Roy Stryker, director of photographic projects. His colleagues included Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein, Walker Evans, and Carl Mydans. During his FSA years, Lee traveled throughout the United States, documenting life in rural and urban communities. He developed a flash technique that enabled him to take innovative and candid interior photographs.  He also specialized in taking pictures in series, most notably those shot in Pie Town, New Mexico, and San Augustine, Texas.</p><p>The long periods away from his wife while working for the FSA contributed to their divorce in 1938. On assignment in New Orleans the same year, he met Jean Smith, a Dallas journalist. They began working together and eventually married.</p><p>In 1943, Lee received a captain's commission in the Air Transport Command (ATC).  He traveled military transport routes taking aerial photographs, visiting the West Indies, North Africa, India, and China. Lee was promoted to major and received the Air Medal.</p><p>About a year after leaving the ATC, in 1946, Lee was hired by the Department of the Interior's Coal Mines Administration to take photographs for a major report on health and safety conditions in bituminous coal mines.</p><p>The Lees moved to Austin, Texas, in 1947. At the request of his former FSA chief, Roy Stryker, Lee worked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, documenting the oil industry at home and overseas. Lee continued with industrial photography projects throughout the 1950's, visiting Saudi Arabia and Europe. He contributed to <emph render="italic">Fortune</emph> magazine and was an associate staff member of the prestigious Magnum photographic cooperative.</p><p>Between 1949 and 1962, Lee conducted a photographic workshop at the University of Missouri. In 1950, Lee worked with The University of Texas on a study of Spanish-speaking people in Texas. He contributed to the <emph render="italic">Texas Observer </emph>and between 1952 and 1957 covered Ralph Yarborough's election campaigns.  His coverage of a 1956 Texas primary campaign appeared in <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>.  The September, 1961, issue of <emph render="italic">Texas Quarterly </emph>published 150 of some 4,000 photographs taken during a two-and-a-half month visit to Italy.   </p><p>In 1965, The University of Texas at Austin presented an exhibition of Lee's photographs and he was invited to join the university's art faculty as an instructor in photography. He taught until his retirement in 1973. Russell Lee died on August 28, 1986.</p> </bioghist>

In January of 1963 Judge Ben H. Rice ruled that SWT could not deny admission to an African-American student based solely on race. After the ruling, in the fall of 1963, 18-year-old Dana Jean Smith, a graduate of Anderson High School in Austin, Texas, enrolled at SWT. The registrar personally assisted Smith in registering along with four other African American students — Georgia Hoodye, Gloria Odoms, Mabeleen Washington, and Helen Jackson.</p><p>This Common Experience theme explores the trials of segregation and the impact of integration, raising the question of how we internalize change in this 50-year celebration of the desegregation of Texas State. A closer exploration of desegregation reveals a long and difficult struggle to achieve one of modern democracy's great promises, equal access to a quality education. Specifically, we use this 50-year anniversary of the desegregation of our institution as an opportunity to examine issues related to equal access to higher education and the role of laws, litigation, and civil rights movements in helping students obtain higher education. This theme also makes a connection to the 2008-2009 Common Experience theme, "Civic Responsibility and the Legacy of LBJ," celebrating our most famous alumnus, Lyndon Baines Johnson.

<p>The glass plate negatives in this collection are of the "dry" type, which was a significant innovation. Before their invention in 1871, photographers had to prepare the glass plates and apply emulsions, expose, and develop them while still "wet." To process, or develop, the images, photographers needed a place that was free from light, a "darkroom." Thus, wet plate photographers needed either to remain close to their darkrooms or recreate them in the field.</p><p>Dry plate emulsions did not have the same time limitations as wet plate. Their stability allowed for greater mobility and convenience. Photographers could wait to expose their plates and then store them back in the box until they could be developed. Nevertheless, glass plates remained fragile and surprisingly heavy.</p><p>While dry glass plates allowed the practice of photography to spread to a larger number of people, it was the invention of roll film (1887) and Kodak's Brownie box camera (1900) which made photography widely accessible to the general public. Roll film was stable, lightweight, and a roll could be mailed to Kodak for developing and printing. </p><p>The photographer for this collection was using dry plates, we know they carried these heavy and fragile plates to locations to expose them, then carried them back to the darkroom to process them. The photographer likely needed considerable chemical and technical knowlege, specialized darkroom materials and equipment, and a dedicated work space to develop their plates and print photographs.</p><p>The glass plates arrived in Cramer's Lightning Dry Plate negative boxes. Mr. Cramer was a national supplier of dry plates beginning 1883. </p> </bioghist>
