<scopecontent id="aspace_92ca2f0cbafde5e11d3085be1bf40e44"><head>Series Description</head><p>Nadine Eckhardt (nee Nadine Ellen Cannon) was the first wife of Billy Lee Brammer and the mother of his three children. The two met as students at North Texas State College and married on April 22, 1950. Nadine Brammer worked for a time on the Lyndon Baines Johnson staff along with her husband, but later returned with her children to live in Austin while Brammer remained in Washington. In 1961, the Brammers were divorced and in 1962, Nadine married Texas Congressman Bob Eckhardt. Her papers contain Brammer's school records, his Air Force application, correspondence, and a file on <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph>. The bulk of the correspondence comes from those times during the Brammers' marriage when they lived separately - while Nadine lived in her parents' home in McAllen during her first pregnancy, and while she lived with the children in Austin when Brammer worked as a Johnson staff member in Washington. Their letters discuss their marriage, their children, work, and Brammer's writing. Brammer writes about his Washington staff job, Johnson, and other staff aides. There are also letters to and from Brammer's McAllen in-laws, the Cannons. Photographs and clippings are interspersed throughout the correspondence. The final folders contain <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> file, which contains a wide range of information related to the book and the author. In the divorce settlement, Nadine received one-half interest in <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph>; and the collection of these materials is related to that interest. It consists of reviews, sales records, examples of Brammer's newspaper writing, clippings about Brammer, Brammer memos to Johnson, etc. In 1976, Nadine Eckhardt considered writing an autobiography and she asked Brammer to collaborate with her, hoping to spark Brammer back into writing. This project produced a chronology and a few notes from Brammer. There is also a chronology of Johnson's activities from 1955 to 1956, which Nadine Eckhardt was given by government oral historian Michael L. Gillette to help her remember events for an interview. The material is in chronological order except for <emph render="italic">The Gay Place</emph> file, which is in the original filing order.</p></scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_cd90e180986498353a481b6e854fe064"><head>Series Description</head><p>Arranged chronologically, this series includes photocopies and printouts of articles and columns written by Shrake and published in newspapers and magazines, from 1953-2006. These folders do not contain all of Shrake's published work in periodicals, particularly regarding his years as a sportswriter and police beat reporter in Fort Worth and Dallas. Most notably missing is anything from his work at the <emph render="italic">Dallas Times Herald</emph>.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_9c2961036190beae25cfcc49a94acdc6"><head>Series Description</head><p>The series is composed of two sub-series Published and Unpublished material. </p><p>Published material starts with the first short story Shrake published, in 1959, and ending with his last novel to be published, in 2006, this sub-series is arranged chronologically according to publication date. It contains handwritten, typewritten and computer-generated drafts, proofs of all kinds, correspondence, contracts, promotional materials, research files, and press clippings. The book with the most copious files is The Borderland, started in 1976 but not published until 2000. In general, the files for the earlier novels, being before the advent of computers, contain more materials like corrected drafts and proofs.</p><p>The Unpublished sub-series is arranged alphabetically, this is a much smaller sub-series than its predecessor, contains mainly early short stories and unfinished novels. One of the unfinished novels, "These Unhappy Occasions," led directly to <emph render="italic">Blessed McGill</emph>. Also included is a finished novel titled "Malibu Zulu" that Shrake completed in 2008 and intended to publish under a pen name. (It was published as <emph render="italic">Hollywood Mad Dogs</emph> in 2020).</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_519cee02c43736f23e8e95650ba53e22"><head>Series Description</head><p>This series is also divided into Produced and Unproduced work. </p><p>The Produced sub-series is arranged by production date. It contains similar materials: drafts, correspondence, contracts, promotional materials and press clippings. The three projects Shrake was most closely involved with — <emph render="italic">Kid Blue, Songwriter</emph> and <emph render="italic">Pair of Aces</emph> — contain the most materials. The <emph render="italic">Beverly Hills Cop II</emph> folders contain documents related to the unsuccessful arbitration Shrake and Dan Jenkins initiated in order to get writing credits on the movie.</p><p>The Unproduced sub-series is the most voluminous, reflecting Shrake's prolific work as a screenwriter from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. Except for the three film treatments at the beginning, the files are arranged alphabetically. Contents are typically drafts and treatments, with some correspondence and research. Those works that contain more materials than others often reflect that they were closer to being produced, such as with "The Big Mamoo," the various Pancho Villa projects,and "Slim and None." Shrake collaborated with Dan Jenkins in the 1970s and 80s on many of the unproduced screenplay efforts. Two of Shrake's attempts to turn his novels into films are also contained here: <emph render="italic">Strange Peaches</emph>and <emph render="italic">Limo</emph>, the latter written with Jenkins.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_9050861cff4edc589ed7468187ffe073"><head>Series Description</head><p>Again, this series is divided into Produced and Unproduced material.</p><p>The sub-series of produced works is arranged by production date. The bulk of the sub-series consists of <emph render="italic">Pancho Villa's Wedding Day</emph>, which, after Shrake turned it from a film script into a play script, underwent more incarnations, including as a musical. Numerous, corrected drafts are included, from 1977 to 1994, when he stopped revising it. The play was staged in 1984. The last play in the series, <emph render="italic">The Friend of Carlos Monzon</emph>, was staged posthumously, and materials from that production, though not directly donated by Shrake, are included.</p><p>The Unproduced sub-series contains only one untitled playscript,and notes, correspondence, research and a corrected draft for "Jack," a play Shrake co-wrote with Michael Rudman, but failed to get produced.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_6f38504c9ec55ef518ff9a6913a51350"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Though essentially consisting of only three projects, all published, this sub-series contains a voluminous amount of research on its subjects, especially Willie Nelson. Included in the Willie materials are numerous tapes and transcripts of interviews Shrake and others did with Nelson and his acquaintances. Also included are clipping files on Nelson and country music going back to 1978 (when Shrake was writing the <emph render="italic">Songwriter</emph> screenplay), and many files of corrected draft fragments. Notably, the opposite is true for the Barry Switzer book, <emph render="italic">Bootlegger's Boy</emph>—no research files are present in the papers, except for some clippings on Switzer gathered post-publication. The sub-series Harvey Penick Books contains drafts for all five Penick/Shrake books, plus research on Penick and golf, interviews, contracts, photographs, and all kinds of marketing materials. As with the files on Willie Nelson, the Harvey Penick files are ample with biographical information on their subject and insight into their subject's craft.</p></scopecontent>

This arrangement reflects Shrake's, in that he filed some of his letters by correspondent, and some by year. Most correspondence in the Alphabetical sub-series are with friends, collaborators, and family members. The Chronological sub-series contains correspondence from a far wider range of addressors, some strangers to Shrake and others intimate friends. </p><p>A name index for the chronological lettersis available in a separate document.

<p>The Preston Jones papers span the years 1940 to 1988.  The archive contains typescripts, set designs, playbills, props, clippings, magazines, articles, letters, photographs, personal items (pipes, glasses, keys, a stuffed bear collection, etc.), mementos (World War I items, ticket stubs, "good show" gifts, etc.), awards, posters, school records, sculptures, scrapbooks, audiotapes, videotapes, T-shirts, and athletic equipment.  Most of the material was saved by Preston's widow, Mary Sue Jones.  Mary Sue kept files on Preston and his career in several different file groups.  These file groups have been rearranged and consolidated into chronological order within subjects.  The records are comprised of five series: Early Years and Dallas Theater Center, Plays, Professional Files, Publicity Files, and Illness and Death.  The series chronicle Preston's personal and professional life, from his childhood in New Mexico through his days as a successful playwright.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_86af4137455273e82ba37b131fb31433"><head>Series Description</head><p>This series outlines Preston Jones' life before he became known as a playwright. It begins with photographs, articles and memorabilia of his father, James "Jawbone" Jones. It continues with boyhood photographs, yearbooks, memorabilia and drawings from his elementary school, high school, and college in New Mexico. Class notes, designs, school records, and diplomas represent his master's work in playwrighting from Baylor University in Waco and Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas.

<scopecontent id="aspace_0ccc80ea6c15fb0071a8f9b59860a437"><head>Series Description</head><p>This series is organized into 3 subseries: Unproduced Writings; A Texas Trilogy; and Post-Trilogy plays. Many of the files reflect Mary Sue's filing system but the material has been consolidated and reorganized by play in chronological order.

The group Unproduced Writings contains manuscripts of Preston Jones' unproduced plays. Included is his thesis adaptation of The Night of the Hunter.

The three plays of the trilogy in the second subseries were performed together for the first time at the Dallas Theater Center in 1975 as the Bradleyville Trilogy. They played again as A Texas Trilogy in May 1976 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D. C. and at the Broadhurst Theater in New York in September 1976. The first set of files refers to the three plays as a unit and contains playbills, posters, set designs, reviews, clippings and screenplay drafts. There is considerable documentation of the Washington and New York productions--promotional articles, photographs, reviews, playbills, congratulation notes, memorabilia (t-shirts, Algonquin hotel mementos) and interviews. Preston's Teddy Bear collection is included here. His favorite was a small teddy bear named Fred, an ever-present good luck talisman that was buried with him.

<emph render="italic">Knights </emph>was the first completed play of the Trilogy, premiering at the Down Center Stage in the Dallas Theater Center on December 4, 1973. This subseries contains the handwritten versions of the play along with successive drafts and rewrites. Also included are props, costumes, playbills, programs, clippings, reviews, and interviews. The material is arranged by format (scripts, props, programs, clippings) in chronological order.

Preston Jones began <emph render="italic">LuAnn</emph>before the other two plays of the Trilogy, inventing as he did so the connecting thread, the town of Bradleyville. <emph render="italic">LuAnn </emph> was the second of the three plays to be completed, premiering in February of 1974. This subseries contains scripts and rewrites, programs, clippings, reviews, photographs and a video of the University of Minnesota 1980s production.

After <emph render="italic">Knights </emph>and <emph render="italic">LuAnn</emph>had been presented, Preston Jones wrote the final play of the Trilogy,<emph render="italic"> The Oldest Living Graduate</emph>. It premiered at the Down Center Stage November 1974. In 1980, Graduate was presented live on television costarring Henry Fonda, Cloris Leachman, George Grizzard, and Harry Dean Stanton. This set of files contains the scripts and rewrites, clippings, reviews, and photographs. Included is a video of the 1980 telecast along with clippings and reviews.

Preston Jones turned to his native New Mexico as the inspiration for the three plays written after the Trilogy. In 1975, Jones began writing <emph render="italic">A Place on the Magdalena Flats</emph>, also titled <emph render="italic">The Plains of St. Augustine</emph>, which examines the relationship of two brothers working their New Mexican ranch during the 1956 drought. <emph render="italic">Santa Fe Sunshine</emph> is a comic play about an artist's colony. Remember concerns an actor reminiscing on his past during a visit to his boyhood home. Included here also are records on <emph render="italic">Juneteenth</emph>, a one-act play commissioned by the Actor's Theatre in Louisville, and a tribute to Lady Bird Johnson on her 65th birthday, scripted and staged by Preston. This subseries contains handwritten and typed drafts and rewrites, programs, photographs, set designs, memorabilia, clippings of reviews and publicity, and audio and videotapes.</p>

<p>Forty-nine boxes of typescripts, galley proofs, correspondence, printed material, photographs, scrapbook material, notes, and artifacts, among other items, document almost the entire writing career of John Graves (1920-2013). </p><p>The collection has been arranged into seven series: Writings(1946-2004, undated), Correspondence (1943-2006, undated), Institutional Activities (1960-1998), Awards and Honors (1961-2004), Personal Materials (circa 1920-2002, undated), Clippings (circa 1940-2004, undated), and Writings by Others (1942-2002, undated). </p><p>The author's original order has been maintained where possible.The collection gives an overview of Graves' literary career, and with numerous drafts of many of his books, essays and short stories, it is particularly strong in illustrating his writing process. Another strength of the collection lies in its documentation of the editorial process, illustrated by the correspondence with publishers and agents found in both the Works and Correspondence series. Numerous letters between Graves and fans, family and friends were added to the collection in 2007, making the Correspondence series at ten boxes the second most voluminous. Other highlights of the collection are personal photographs and journals in the Personal Materials series.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_723065655f215863813c4e22595859d1"><head>Series Description</head><p>The Monograph series includes research notes, typed manuscripts, galley proofs, printed materials, correspondence, and other materials chronicling Graves' literary contributions from his earliest short stories to his more recent essays and memoir. Materials from all of his books are included. Many of these materials were annotated by Graves with personal comments when he donated the materials to Bill Wittliff.</p>
<p>Manuscript materials relating to the books Graves is credited as writing or co-writing make up the first series. Materials are arranged alphabetically by book title. Of particular interest in the files pertaining to his first book <emph render="italic">Goodbye to a River</emph> are photographs taken by Graves during his trip down the Brazos River, the plate proofs of the first edition, and two printed articles written before the publication of the book. There are also drafts of his second book, <emph render="italic">Hard Scrabble</emph>, and his 2004 memoir,<emph render="italic"> Myself and Strangers.</emph> The materials relating to <emph render="italic">From a Limestone Ledge</emph> have to do with the publication of the book itself; materials relating to the essays that were previously published in Texas Monthly are in the following sub-series. Likewise, materials under<emph render="italic"> Blue and Some Other Dogs</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Last Running,</emph> and <emph render="italic">Self-Portrait, With Birds</emph> have to do with the book versions of these writings, not the original versions, which can be found in the next sub-series.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_61e3b002c09be948288baee21e2e2716"><head>Series Description</head><p>The Other Writings series is devoted to the many short stories, essays, book introductions, tributes, and unpublished pieces written by Graves, and spans almost six decades. This series is also the largest in the collection, filling eleven document boxes, plus oversize. The works within it arearranged alphabetically by title, usually according to the official published title, but sometimes by a book title if Graves' piece is an untitled introduction, or a draft title if the piece is unpublished. Many of these files contain correspondence, notes and research as well as typescripts and drafts. Some files also include or are limited to the publication itself that published it, or a clipping or photocopy of the published piece.</p><p>Graves' work for <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> is thoroughly documented in this series, including the typescripts, galleys, clippings and correspondence he kept in two binders, covering ten years of published essays in the magazine. The manuscript of Graves' first published short story, "Quarry," can be found in this series, as well as one of his most famous pieces, "The Last Running," in both fiction and screenplay formats. </p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_a58f13ea0c785fb2f9eddb15a1cea766"><head>Series Description</head><p>The third series covers speeches that Graves wrote and delivered, arranged alphabetically by the event or occasion.

<scopecontent id="aspace_bbb888fa232ac65ac27157be85a896a6"><head>Series Description</head><p>The Correspondence series contains letters that highlight Graves' writing career, with letters to and from publishers, agents, fellow writers, fans, event organizers and others. Insights into Graves' personal life and thoughts are also found in letters between Graves and longtime friends and family members. Graves kept carbon copies and later computer printout copies of many of his letters to others, so the researcher gets both sides of the letter-writing dialogue, in these folders and elsewhere in the collection where correspondence is included.</p><p>The vast majority of the correspondence is filed alphabetically by last name, though in a handful of cases by institution name, event name, or subject. Within the folders that are labeled with a range of names the correspondence is arranged and labeled in smaller folders. Folders that have just one name written on them means the volume of letters warranted its own folder (or in some cases, more than one folder).</p><p>The correspondence in the John Schaffner file is notable for chronicling the agent-writer relationship. Schaffner was Graves' agent until 1979, and this file, covering eighteen years, highlights their personal and professional association during that time. Writers Rick Bass, Angus Cameron, Nick Lyons and John N. Cole have considerable amounts of correspondence with Graves, as does writer and photographer Bill Wittliff, who has also been a close friend of and sometime collaborator with Graves through the years. Though less voluminous, the letters between Graves and Cormac McCarthy reveal a respect and kinship between the two men. </p><p>Daughters Helen Graves and Sally Jackson also have a considerable amount of correspondence in this series. Fleet Lentz and Abe Rothberg each have multiple folders, making evident their important friendships with Graves. Another significant friendship documented in letters is that of Graves and Samuel Hynes, who have been close friends since their days together at Columbia University. These letters are arranged in two parts, one restricted and one not. Letters donated by Mr. Hynes himself for inclusion in the John Graves Papers are restricted from access until after the deaths of both gentlemen. There are also two other, unrelated letters placed at the end of the series that are restricted until 30 years after the death of Mr. Graves.</p></scopecontent>

The former sub-series deals with Graves' membership in and activities with T.I.L., including two folders of his 1971-73 presidency of the organization; while the latter sub-series contains syllabus information and notes related to two courses and one workshop taught by Graves. The files in these two sub-series are arranged chronologically. The last part in Institutional Activities is a file relating to the "John Graves Essay Contest," conducted by The University of Texas Press.

Of particular interest in this series is the notebook Graves used while traveling in Europe and his journal of a trip down the Rio Conchos, as well as many copy prints of family photographs. Objects of note include Graves' Royal Standard typewriter and the paddle and tent he used during his canoe trip down the Brazos River in 1957.

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection is composed of 21 boxes of manuscripts, galley proofs, notes, clippings, correspondence, artwork, financial and legal papers, screenplays, photographs, and artifacts, from 1971 to 2000 that document Stephen Harrigan's writing career. It has been arranged into six series: Works (1971-2000, undated), Correspondence (1976-1991, undated), Personal Materials (undated), Works by Other Authors, (1971-1972, 1992-1993, undated), Texas Institute of Letters (1982-1983, 1985-1986), and Clippings (1971-1983).</p><p>
The Works series comprises the largest part of the Harrigan collection. It thoroughly documents Harrigan's methodical writing process. Most of the books and articles can be traced from the earliest notes taken by Harrigan to a proof copy or published work. The other series relate generally to his writing career. The materials are arranged in chronological order. Largely absent from the collection are personal papers or correspondence.</p><p>
Books in the Stephen Harrigan Collection have been cataloged separately. </p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_0dea9459910e079758dceea016eed56a"><head>Series Description</head><p>This series surveys Harrigan's creative works from his work as ad writer at the <emph render="italic">University Co-op</emph> to the publication of his book, <emph render="italic">Water and Light</emph>. It includes manuscript drafts, notes, notebooks, galley proofs, correspondence, magazines, clippings, financial and legal papers, screenplays, photographs and artifacts. In some cases Harrigan added notes and inscriptions describing the materials and providing background information. This series is further divided into six subseries: Early Works, Books, Screenplays, Songs, Contributions to <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>, and General Works. </p><p>The first subseries, Early Works, contains notes, clippings, manuscripts, correspondence, artwork, financial papers and forms documenting Harrigan's writing before the publication of his first book. It contains clippings of the ads Harrigan wrote for the <emph render="italic">University Co-op</emph> and materials from <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph>, the journal of poetry that he helped found and edit. Both are introduced by notes written by Harrigan in 1988 giving additional information and background about his job at the <emph render="italic">Co-op </emph>and his association with <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph>. The <emph render="italic">Co-op</emph> clippings are arranged chronologically, and the <emph render="italic">Lucille</emph> files have been grouped by type of material, having lost their original order. Of particular interest in the Lucille files are the three folders of submissions of aspiring poets, some of whom have gone on to literary success, such as Naomi Shihab (Nye), R. S. Gwynn and Vassar Miller.</p><p>The second subseries, entitled Books, contains research notes, background materials, legal papers, handwritten and typed manuscripts, galley proofs, correspondence, reviews and artwork for four of Harrigan's published books. There are multiple drafts of each book, and the handwritten notes and early drafts of <emph render="italic">Aransas, Jacob's Well, Water and Light</emph> and <emph render="italic">Gates of the Alamo</emph> provide an overview of Harrigan's writing process. His attention to detail and in-depth organization are demonstrated in his research for <emph render="italic">Water and Light</emph>, which includes two boxes of index cards with notes about the sea and the history of diving as well as his personal notes from his trip to Grand Turk Island. The materials are arranged alphabetically by book. </p><p>Screenplays, the third subseries, contains research notes and multiple drafts of Harrigan's screenplay <emph render="italic">ISHI,</emph> which was filmed for HBO in 1992 as <emph render="italic">The Last of His Tribe.</emph> Many of these drafts were maintained in notebooks and materials found in the pockets of these notebooks have been placed at the back of each folder. The drafts are arranged chronologically, from the earliest draft to the final production script and shooting notes. Also found in the subseries is the script "Moonwalker," co-written by Harrigan and Lawrence Wright.</p><p>The fourth subseries, Songs, contains various typed and handwritten drafts of a song written by Harrigan entitled "The Old Three."</p><p>The fifth subseries, Contributions to <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph>, contains research materials and notes, manuscript drafts, galley proofs, correspondence, photographs, artwork, and published articles written by Harrigan for <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> magazine. Harrigan's talent as a journalist is well documented here, showing the broad range of his interests, from an interview with Governor Bill Clements to research on the sculptor Pompio Coppini to essays on the natural wonders of Texas. Some of these articles were later published in Harrigan's third book, <emph render="italic">A Natural State: Essays on Texas</emph>. Also included are a number of complete issues of <emph render="italic">Texas Monthly</emph> in which Harrigan's articles appeared. </p><p>Within the final subseries are general materials relating to Harrigan's writing career. It includes multiple handwritten and typed drafts on broadcasting, a typed essay on the exploration of Texas, an application for the NASA "Journalist in Space" program, a press release, and a clipping about the author. Also included are handwritten notebooks of Harrigan's poetry and prose.</p></scopecontent>

<p>The bulk of this archive was acquired through Bill and Sally Wittliff, who purchased the material in an estate sale in 1985. (See Richard Holland's article in <emph render="italic">Corners of Texas</emph> cited above for a fuller description of the acquisition.) Dobie had already donated much of his library and papers to the University of Texas at Austin. The material at Texas State was what remained in his Austin house at the time of his death in 1964. It is divided into five series: Works, Personal, Bertha McKee Dobie and Edgar Kincaid Papers, Artifacts, and Newspaper Clippings. The series contain drafts of Dobie's posthumous books, research material, drafts of newspaper columns, magazine articles, lectures, transcriptions of radio broadcasts, correspondence, photographs of family and friends, property deeds, income tax records, personal items (pipes, clothes, a favorite chair), wills, and clippings about Dobie as well as articles, clippings and photographs that had belonged to Bertha McKee Dobie and/or Edgar Kincaid.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_1e45c0535a0447b06b1a8dab95e10e59"><head>Series Description</head><p>The first subseries, Books, contains drafts, galleys, research notes and clippings, photographs, correspondence, captions, typescripts and a record album of Dobie's books. Also included are files on posthumous books compiled by Dobie's wife Bertha. </p><p>The second subseries is entitled Research Material. The research files include correspondence, bibliographical notes, articles, clippings, pictures, and quotes on the Southwestern themes Dobie explored. Subjects covered are animals, Southwestern customs, Texas heroes, Southwestern characters, hunting, tall tales, cooking and treasure hunting. Files of old maps and guidebooks document research trips made to Mexico including the 1933 trip to Saltillo with Henry Nash Smith. </p><p>Fellow University of Texas English professor Stith Thompson invited Dobie to join the Texas Folklore Society in 1915. The third subseries contains documents relating to his involvement in the organization. Dobie claimed he had never heard of the word folklore before. "If Stith Thompson hadn't said folklore to me . . . I don't know where in the devil I'd be today. (Tinkle 37) Dobie succeeded Thompson in 1922 as secretary-editor of the society's publications. He revitalized the society after it had become moribund during World War I, and he pushed it in a direction independent of the American Folklore Society. Dobie resigned as editor in 1943, when he left Texas to teach a year in Cambridge, England, but he continued as a participant in the society and his influence remains strong to this date.</p><p>The fourth subseries is entitled Newspaper Columns. Dobie first worked for a newspaper, the <emph render="italic">San Antonio Express</emph>, the summer after graduation from Southwestern in 1910. In 1914, he reported for the <emph render="italic">Galveston Tribune</emph> to earn extra money during a summer break from teaching at the University of Texas. In September 1939, Dobie began a syndicated newspaper column which he continued writing until the year of his death. His columns touched on a wide range of areas from current events and postwar Europe to folk tales and Texas characters. This subseries contains drafts of these columns. It also contains his file on the Alamo memorial sculpture controversy, which includes articles, interviews and correspondence. In 1937, the sculptor Pompeo Coppini was commissioned to create a monument to the fighters at the Alamo. Dobie vehemently took issue with the choice and expressed his views publicly by radio and newspaper. </p><p>The next subseries, Magazine Articles, includes the typescript of Dobie's first nationally published article for <emph render="italic">The Country Gentleman</emph>. The subsequent magazine articles cover various topics of interest to Dobie--cowboy life, Mexico, herbs, animals, reading, literature, etc.</p><p>Dobie became a popular lecturer as his books and articles on Southwestern ways gained national attention. The sixth subseries, Lectures and Speeches, includes notes on his speaking itinerary and covers his lectures on folklore, the Southwest and his experience as a Texan in England.</p><p>The final subseries has been titled Radio and Television. Dobie began broadcasting from the radio in 1932 with five-minute talks on the program "Longhorn Luke and His Cowboys." His radio programs and later television appearances covered the same subjects as his books and articles but the audio/visual aspects of the technologies allowed him to enhance the tales with live narration. The files contain a letter from his original radio sponsor, fanletters, and scripts. </p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_bbb49b823dfdb4bfd60034d39d90227f"><head>Series Description</head><p>The first subseries within this group of records, Family, contains a family photo album of mostly 19th century photographs of the Dobie and Byler families. Also included are the family bible from which Dobie's father read nightly and two of Dobie's own bibles given to him as gifts: one in 1905 from W. H. Butler and the other from his family in 1908.</p><p>The next set of files, entitled Graduate Education, contains class notes, the Masters thesis, theater programs and newspaper clippings from Dobie's Columbia University days. Despite Dobie's statement in Some Part of Myself that he destroyed a "kind of diary" he kept at the time because he "was so disgusted with the sentimentality in it" (185), there is a diary herein which for the most part describes his reactions to the New York theater. </p><p>In the third subseries, World War I Service, is found Dobie's army uniform, his shipping trunk, and military documents. Dobie enlisted in the Army May 17,1917 but was not shipped to Europe until October of 1918 shortly before the armistice of November 11. He never saw action but was able to use the opportunity to see something of Europe.</p><p>The next subseries, Teaching, contains grade books, teaching notes, lectures and diaries. It includes the notes from the lectures Dobie gave at Cambridge University in 1943. </p><p>Household Records and Personal Effects, the fifth subseries, contains property deeds, income tax records, invoices, mementos, personal items, addresses, wills, and notes. There is information on Dobie's homes, lifestyle and interests. The file named Workfiles and mementos contains miscellaneous envelopes, empty files, clippings and articles including Walter Prescott Webb's "The Search for William E. Hinds."</p><p>The next subseries contains correspondence. The majority of these letters are from Dobie to Bertha detailing his experiences in the army. Other letters to Bertha were written during various separations and discuss family, personal matters and Dobie's writings. They also mention Dobie's work with the Texas Folklore Society and his various research interests. The other major correspondence in this subseries is the letters of Roy Bedichek. Bedichek was director of the University of Texas Interscholastic League by profession but a student of nature by predilection. Bedichek often met with Dobie and historianWalter Prescott Webb for barbecue or at Barton Springs swimming pool in Austin to argue and philosophize. Prodded by Dobie and Webb, Bedichek became a writer of lyrical books on nature at the advanced age of 70. His letters discuss animal stories, politics (especially Texas politics), and mutual friends--University of Texas president Homer Rainey, Folksong collector John Lomax, political commentator John Henry Faulk, Western historian Henry Nash Smith, Walter Prescott Webb and Texas Folklore Society editors Mody Boatright and Wilson Hudson. Also included here are some letters from Isabel Gaddis, a friend who collaborated with Dobie on I'll Tell You A Tale, published in 1960.</p><p>Dobie died on September 18, 1964. The seventh subseries, Dobie's Death, contains the many telegrams and condolence cards sent to his widow along with funeral arrangements, the memorial record book and newspaper clippings about Dobie's accomplishments.</p><p>The eighth subseries, Writings about Dobie, is a collection of clippings, articles and papers on J. Frank Dobie gathered by his wife Bertha and his nephew, Edgar Kincaid. A few of the clippings concern Roy Bedichek or Edgar Kincaid. There also is a file on the Paisano Fellowship, the grant set up as a memorial to Dobie. His beloved ranch west of Austin was deeded to the University of Texas, which, along with the Texas Institute of Letters, manages a fellowship for selected Texas writers and artists. The award enables the writer or artist to spend six months on the ranch with a stipend in order to work on projects free from distraction. The first fellowship was granted in 1967 to Billy Porterfield.</p><p>Photographs, the final subseries contains photographs of Dobie, his wife Bertha, and their family and friends. There are publicity photos, photos taken on Dobie's research trips, and pictures clipped for research. Included are photos of Dobie and Bertha on their ranch or entertaining friends.</p></scopecontent>

It is important to note that the backs of his papers often contain notes to other manuscripts, correspondence, and other information, since Bass recycles paper by using both sides. Some notes are on scraps, and in one case, a note is written on a piece of bark. Sent to the Wittliff Collections in small pieces at a time, the manuscripts have been arranged alphabetically by the processor.</p></scopecontent>

The proceeds were to be channeled to provide assistance to needy agricultural families. Bill Wittliff served as an adviser to the project. His wife, Sally Wittliff, recommended the Massachusetts social activist, Carolyn Mugar, to administer the project. The first Farm Aid concert was held September 25, 1985 in Champaign, Illinois.

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Correspondence, printed material, financial documentation, interviews, photographic material, legal documentation, notes, creative works, audio and video recordings, and machine-readable records, created and maintained by Bill Crawford and Joe Nick Patoski, document the research, production, and promotion processes of their co-authored biography, <emph render="italic">Stevie-Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire</emph>.</p><p>The collection consists of three main series, the Crawford Files, the Patoski Files, and the Audio and Video Materials Series.  The Crawford Files and Patoski Files represent each author's individual research, production, and promotion for the book.  Generally, the series representing one author will contain material created and maintained only by that author, although some overlap does occur, as the two authors collaborated closely on this project. Each author's differing methods of research and production are revealed by the structure and contents of their files, which are listed briefly in the Series Summary, following the Series Descriptions.  The Audio and Video Materials Series was created for ease of access to this varied material, which was created and maintained by both authors. It includes interviews, musical performances, a recording of Stevie Ray Vaughan's funeral service and consists of formats such as cassette audiotapes, VHS videotapes, and CD-ROM audio discs.</p><p>Because this biography of Stevie Ray Vaughan was unauthorized, the authors did not have the cooperation of the Vaughan family, including his brother, Jimmie Vaughan, nor that of certain other key figures in Vaughan's life, including Tommy Shannon, Chris Layton, and Reece Wynans, of his band, Double Trouble.  However, published interviews with these important figures do appear in this collection, complementing the original research done by the authors. This collection sheds a unique light on Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and musical career.  At the same time, it documents the rise of the blues in the Austin music scene during the 1970s and 1980s, a time when progressive country artists, such as Willie Nelson, reigned supreme. Of particular note are the many interviews with Stevie Ray Vaughan's musical mentors and colleagues such as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, W.C. Clark, Ray Benson, Kim Wilson, Angela Strehli, and Antone's owner, Clifford Antone.  Interviews with Stevie Ray Vaughan's longtime friend, Dale Bramhall, twin brother to Doyle Bramhall, Vaughan's closest songwriting partner and friend, lend important insights into the history of certain albums and certain periods of the late musician's life.  Many of the interviews conducted for this project bring to light what had for years been stories held only among Austin musical enclaves. Also, bootleg recordings of Stevie Ray Vaughan performances dating back as far as 1975, and many candid and publicity photographs dating back to the mid-1970s, are of special interest.  Inclusive dates range from 1964- 1995, with the bulk of the material dating from 1990-1993.</p><p>A special note on interviews in this collection: Not all interviews on audiotape have written transcripts, and conversely, not all transcripts are represented by audiotapes.  Existing transcripts are filed with the series of the author who conducted the interview.  The interview audiotapes themselves are simply listed in alphabetical order in Series III, each tape has been assigned a number, and when a transcript is available for a particular tape, its location (by box and folder) will be noted on this list.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_f59e1d7623dd52218e4c41a2baecc79b"><head>Series Description</head><p>Maintained by Bill Crawford, the Crawford Files constitute the bulk of the record group and reflect Crawford's original order. The records on the Research Materials subseries, 1994-1993, document the primary and secondary research of Stevie Ray Vaughan's life conducted largely by Bill Crawford. Included are a large quantity of interview transcripts and audiotapes, a copy of Stevie Ray Vaughan's death certificate, and Vaughan family genealogical material. Of special note are numerous published interview transcripts with the late musician himself. Material in the Book Production Material subseries documents the progress of the book's publication. Heavily edited manuscript drafts and page proofs comprise the majority of these records. This subseries also includes material relating to the selection of photographs to be used in the biography. There is almost no record in this series of public relations / advertising activities.</p></scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_cdc94c10b7ee4c901630b284b0c6f020"><head>Series Description</head><p>The Patoski Files, maintained by Joe Nick Patoski, are divided into the same subseries as the Crawford Files: Research Materials, and Book Production Materials. The cataloger has maintained as much of Patoski's original order as possible for this material, but imposed some additional degree of order in the interest of accessibility. The Research Materials, 1977-1993, include numerous interview transcripts and audiotapes, published books on the music industry with Patoski's notes. Notable interviewees include Kim Wilson, Clifford Antone, Double Trouble manager Chesley Millikin, W.C. Clark, Angela Strehli, Stevie Ray Vaughan's ex-wife "Lenny" Vaughan, Marc Benno and Dale Bramhall. Please note that Patoski's groupings for "General" and "Stevie Ray Vaughan" in this series both deal with Stevie Ray Vaughan specifically, despite their differing titles. The Production Materials subseries, 1984-1993, includes manuscript drafts and page proofs, but is strongest in public relations / advertising material related to reviews and book signings.</p></scopecontent>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Correspondence, drafts, typescripts, photographs, scrapbooks, artifacts, ephemera and clippings constitute this collection. The bulk of this material was created by Elithe Hamilton Kirkland, although a small amount was created or maintained by her son, James Beal, the donor of this collection. (For example, documents related to Ms. Kirkland's funeral, located in box 446, folder 7, were donated by Mr. Beal.) Drafts, notes, and correspondence in this collection document Kirkland's writing process, including published and unpublished works. Many working drafts of Kirkland's published work, as well as a wealth of unpublished poems, songs, plays, short stories, and essays are included. For her published works, working drafts are accompanied by notes, publicity material, and correspondence, rounding out the evolution of these works. For much of the correspondence related to and filed with specific published works, the carbon copies of Kirkland's letters are interfiled.</p><p>Her personal history is documented as well, through formats including awards, photographs, correspondence, scrapbooks, and resumes. Highlights include long runs of correspondence between Kirkland and her mother, her son, and her husband, Dr. R.D. Kirkland. Photographs document her life from childhood through her last years, including colleagues, friends, favorite dogs, and family members.</p><p>Kirkland's interest in J. Frank Dobie is also well represented here. Her first contact with Dobie is identified as a college paper written for Dobie's graduate class at UT Austin (see box 15 folder 6a). Her novel, <emph render="italic">Heather, For Luck</emph>, is a tribute to the Texas author, and the research and drafts for this book are located in the Books series. Correspondence with Dobie, articles written by and about Dobie, books inscribed to Kirkland from Dobie, can all be found in the J. Frank Dobie series. Kirkland helped develop the first Dobie Day, celebrated at Southwestern University, in Georgetown, TX; her research and correspondence related to this effort are also located in the J. Frank Dobie series.</p><p>Resumes, career summaries, autobiographical sketches are located in this series, as are school scrapbooks and Kirkland's booklet of favorite clippings and poems. Kirkland's extensive notes and subject files are included in this Personal series, recording the breadth of her interests. Material related to her many speaking engagements is also included.</p> </scopecontent>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection of correspondence, photographs, and two interviews lends an insight into Katherine Anne Porter's relationship to her home state of Texas in the last years of her life. Correspondence with Dr. Roger L. Brooks of Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas,  documents Porter's interest in returning to Texas and visiting her mother's gravesite. While these 10 letters and 2 telegrams hardly comprise the bulk of this collection, they shed light on  Ms. Porter's relationship to Texas during this time of her life. Correspondence from other writers and literary figures to Dr. Brooks regarding Ms. Porter's work represents the status Ms. Porter enjoyed towards the end of her life nationally, internationally, as well as within Texan literary circles.  The bulk of the collection is comprised of these letters from other writers to Dr. Brooks. A lengthy interview with Ms. Porter in the early 1970s also gives a unique view into her definitions of art, religion, her methods of writing, and more. Also included in this collection is Dr. Brooks' collection of Katherine Anne Porter books signed and inscribed by the author. Dr. Brooks' personal copies of periodicals in which Ms. Porter's stories and articles appeared have been cataloged separately. Dates for this collection range from 1898-1977, bulk 1972-1977.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>Printed material, correspondence, financial and legal documentation, handwritten notes, books and other published material, photographs, artifacts, and sound recordings, 1921 to 1993 (bulk 1930-1975), created and maintained by Jovita González Mireles and E.E.

(Maria) Isabel Cruz who inherited the material after Mr. Mireles' death, help to document the education, teaching careers, and personal and financial lives of Jovita González Mireles and E.E. Mireles. </p><p>
The collection has been arranged into fourteen series: Education, Teaching, Correspondence, Daybooks/Notebooks, Minutes, Financial Papers, Legal Materials, Medical Records, Photographs, Clippings, Postcard Collection, Artifacts, Books/Published Material, and Sound Recordings. These series are based on the original order of the materials when present, order was created by the cataloger for the materials that lacked it.</p><p>
Mr. and Ms. Mireles' masters theses, included in the Education Series, are of particular interest, because they document the areas of their graduate studies. Ms. González was awarded the Rockefeller grant in 1934 for the research she did for her thesis. In the Correspondence Series the letters to Mr. Mireles from Ms. Mireles while she was away in Mexico offer insight into their personal relationship. The beginnings of the Pan American Council of Texas is documented in the Minutes Series. This council, started by E.E. Mireles in 1943, worked to support the Spanish program in the Corpus Christi public schools where Pan American Clubs had already been started. Among the books in the Books/Published Material Series are <emph render="italic">The Voice of the Coyote</emph> by J. Frank Dobie and <emph render="italic">Finding Literature on the Texas Plains</emph> by John William Roger and J. Frank Dobie, both of which are inscribed by Dobie to Ms. Mireles. The Clippings Series documents the legal and political issues pertaining to education in Texas, racial discrimination, and local Corpus Christi news. Some aspects of Mr. and Ms. Mireles' careers are not fully documented. For example, there are no drafts of any of their writings, and there is limited material on Ms. Mireles' teaching career.</p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_816e0e6e4b489214197ad738efbb98ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The bulk of this series is comprised of personal correspondence (1942- 1945) between Paul and Kitty Baker while she remained in the U.S., and he was stationed in Iceland and Paris as a Special Services Entertainment Officer during World War II. This group of correspondence is of particular interest in that it offers great insight into the Bakers' early relationship as husband and wife. The original chronological order in which the Bakers kept this correspondence has been maintained. The remaining correspondence in this series is an assortment of letters and cards sent to the Bakers between 1927 and 1999. There was little original order to this correspondence, therefore it has been arranged by the cataloger in chronological order.</p></scopecontent>

Some interviews have both audiotapes and transcriptions, while others exist only in one format or the other. Interview subjects include Tejano artists, people in the music business, music critics, family, friends, fans, and acquaintances. Because Patoski's book was an unauthorized biography, he could not contact any of the Quintanilla family or close friends.

<p>Series three, Books - Published (boxes 85-92), includes correspondence, research, typescripts, and reviews of Broyles's 1986 novel, Brothers in Arms: A Journey from War to Peace.

Broyles has written one play, Boot, and materials relating to that project comprise the fifth series of the Broyles Papers, Plays (boxes 95-96).

<p>Correspondence, research notes and interviews, plot maps, chapter synopses, character outlines, editor's revision suggestions, and two magazines document the career of Texas writer Rick Riordan spanning the years of 1997-2004. The bulk of the collection consists of manuscript materials for five of his novels: <emph render="italic">Big Red Tequila, Widower's Two-Step</emph>, "Gunman's Cantina" (<emph render="italic">The Last King of Texas</emph>), <emph render="italic">The Devil Went Down to Austin</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Cold Springs</emph>. The collection is arranged chronologically into seven series based on dates of publication of each book, with the seventh series consisting of promotional materials. Because of this, the author's method of constructing and writing a novel from first notes to manuscript is demonstrated. </p>
<p>The first series contains two magazines that featured Riordan's short fiction, the first published in 1988 and a more recent piece published in 1998. The second through sixth series are dedicated to each of Riordan's novels. Correspondence, research, and interviews particular to each novel are contained within that specific novel's series. Most of the research notes and interview materials are for the <emph render="italic">Widower's Two-Step</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Last King of Texas</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Devil Went Down to Austin</emph>. The seventh series contains promotional materials for Riordan. </p>

<p>Journal articles, correspondence, published works, unpublished research and notes and photographs document the career of Edward Muegge "Buck" Schiwetz as an artist, illustrator and architectural sketcher.  The collection is arranged into four main series: Biographical Material, Correspondence, Art Projects by E.M. Schiwetz, and Photographs. </p>
<p>The first series, Biographical Material, 1929-1955, contains two published journals, each containing articles about E.M. Schiwetz. They provide biographical data on the artist and his budding, and then successful career.  Each article contains several examples of his work. </p>
<p>The second series, Correspondence, 1954-1979, contains letters written to and from Schiwetz. Most of the correspondence pertains to work rather than personal life, although many elude a respect and affection for the artist. Of note are letters concerning Mathews Ranch and the work E.M. Schiwetz did for the book, <emph render="italic">Interwoven</emph> written by Sallie Reynolds Mathews.  Most of these letters are from book designer Carl Hertzog, with the dates ranging from 1956 to 1958.  Six of these letters are handwritten. </p>
<p>The third series, Art Projects by E.M. Schiwetz, 1928-1961, is arranged according to the five individual projects. The first, and largest, is Schiwetz's material for <emph render="italic">Interwoven</emph>, which contains notes, sketches to be included as illustrations, a small photo of an unidentified gravestone, two 7x10 photos of a two-story house, one program from Susan Mathews Reynolds funeral dated November 10, 1955, two programs from the Mathews Memorial Presbyterian Church dated December 22, 1957, sketches of the church by E.M.

Schiwetz. There are two copies of the sketchbook, one of them being a reprint from the earlier publication with a different cover.</p>
<p>The last series of the collection, Photographs, 1961-1978, contains six black and white photographs by James Vance. Five of the photographs are of what appears to be Texas scenery.  One of the photographs is of E. M. Schiwetz working on a sketch or painting of a landscape.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>Cash Edwards and Roger Polson created the 2 linear feet collection of papers for Under the Hat Productions during the company's sixteen year existence starting in 1984 and ending in 2000. The majority of the papers contained are from the period of 1996 through 1999. The papers include a wide variety of promotional materials for their artist clients as well as a number of market research materials and press clippings. The archivist altered the original order of the collection by alphabetizing the clients and combining materials that pertained to each artist. The creators maintained individual client files and these were honored in the new arrangement.</p><p>
The collection is in to two series, Artists Files and Market Research. The first series is arranged alphabetically by artist and contains promotional materials maintained by the staff. Each of the files contain some or all of the documents including press kits, photographs, negatives and slides, press releases, stage plots, resumes and biographies, flyers, posters, calendars, and mailing or emailing lists. There are clippings and reviews plus advertising, including newspaper and magazine reviews, listings, catalogs, ad tear sheets and photo copies. Also included are financial materials, contracts arranged chronologically, itineraries, travel arrangements, and correspondence with notes, postcards, and letters from artists. The second series contains market research materials. Also maintained by the staff, there are documents including magazines and organization newsletters.</p><p>
There are a few artists that are more prominently represented. These are the most successful of the artists and include Christine Albert, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Terri Hendrix, Hugh Moffatt, Katie Moffatt, and Pat Mears. In the folder for various artists, each is represented by as few as one document and no more than five. As an example, Ray Wylie Hubbard has 2 folders of contracts for the year 1996. The breadth of venues includes everything from in-store appearances to festival dates both national and international.</p><p>
The individual biographical sketches, press releases for creative output, and the press kits provide insight into careers the represented artists, venues, travel range, and the "neighborhood" of the Austin Music Scene during the dates represented. The records for the majority of the artists are significantly limited, while the most commercially successful artists have substantial records in the collection. The most revealing parts of the collection include the bios and the press releases and the contracts, documentary evidence of financial income.</p><p>
There are no papers concerning Under the Hat's organization, finances, or history, and most materials concerning bluegrass artists are at the International Bluegrass Music Association Museum in Nashville, TN</p><p>
The collection provides a simple snapshot into the professional careers of the Texas singer-songwriters of the late twentieth century in the Greater Austin area, who were clients of Under the Hat Productions.</p> </scopecontent>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The letters in this collection date from 1874 to 1931. The bulk of the letters cover Hardin's arrest and imprisonment. Several of the letters describe in detail Hardin's version of the Webb killing and lynching of Hardin's relatives as well as his own arrest, trial and incarceration. There is good documentation of the 1894 Gonzales County election controversy in which Hardin was deeply involved. The correspondence also offers insights on 19th century Texas life, i.e. politics, reconstruction, the Texas Rangers, the State Police, the Taylor-Sutton feud, prison life, farming practices, and country social life and mores. The collection also contains handwritten legal exams and papers as well as family photographs.</p><p><emph render="bold">1874 Letters: </emph>There is only one letter from this year. On September 18, Hardin, on the run after the Webb killing in May, writes to his father to make a payment to his cousin, Mannen Clements. In a postscript, Hardin tells his father to destroy the letter after it is read.</p><p><emph render="bold">1875 Letters: </emph>There is one item from the year 1875, a bill dated September 25 from Joseph DeMartini of Jacksonville Florida to J. H Swain. In his autobiography, Hardin says he was in Jacksonville using the alias of Swain from July 1875 to July 1876. (Hardin, 110-112)</p><p><emph render="bold">1876 Letters: </emph>There are scraps of bills and invoices from Jacksonville, Florida dating from May until January. Present also is the first letter from Hardin to his wife. It is dated September 8 and he writes he will send for her when he has set up a business.</p><p><emph render="bold">1877 Letters: </emph>The Hardins contacted their families in April to let them know for the first time since they left Texas how they had fared. They are answered by Jane's uncle Joshua Bowen (May 6) and Hardin's uncle Robert E. Hardin (alias R. E. Barnette, May 9. See Marohn 104). Both responses relate the state of affairs in Texas, update the Hardins on their respective relatives and mention the status of the Sutton-Taylor feud factions. After Hardin was captured by John Armstrong and Jack Duncan on August 23, 1877, he writes Jane from Decatur Alabama on August 25 explaining what happened and hinting that he might be able to escape. He accuses her brother Brown of being the cause of his capture. The majority of letters in September and October are letters of support from the family. Hardin is tried in September and convicted of Second Degree murder. He is returned to the Austin jail October 6 to await his appellate hearing. Letters from the family lament his sentence, and encourage him in his appeal. Beginning in November, the Hardin family urges Jane to return to Texas. Other letters of interest are a letter from Doc J An which mentions his knowledge of the detective who arrested Hardin, October 13; from Hardin's mother, Elizabeth, recounting the family version of the Webb killing, October 26; from Hardin giving his wife a detailed account of what happened on the day of the Webb killing and mentioning Brown Bowen who is also in the Austin jail, December 5, 1877; and again from Elizabeth Hardin discussing her family's tragedies and asking Jane what exactly had been Hardin's occupation, December 14, 1877.</p><p><emph render="bold">1878 Letters: </emph>Jane Hardin and her children arrived at Hardin's mother's home in Bennett Station in North Texas in February. Brown Bowen is sentenced to hang for the murder of Tom Haldeman and on March 11, Hardin complains that Brown is blaming him for the murder. He tells Jane that her father has been the cause of the indictment against him for the murder of J. B. Morgan in 1873. On March 26, Hardin writes Jane that Brown got Mannen Clements indicted for the Paten Patterson killing of July 25, 1872. Brown Bowen was hung on May 17 and Hardin, in a May 18 letter to Jane, describes how her sister and father begged him to take the blame for the Haldeman murder, tells why he refused to do so and describes Brown's hanging. On May 19, Mattie Bowen writes her sister Jane how she found Brown's corpse waiting for her and her father when they returned home to Gonzales County from Austin. Hardin learns his conviction has been affirmed in June. Jane Hardin quarrels with her mother-in-law and Hardin writes her in August to mend her relations with his mother. (The reasons for the quarrel are not given.) An August 3 letter from Mannen Clements to Jane also urges her to end the quarrel and advises her not to worry Hardin with her problems. Jane and the children go to Austin in the same month and are able to visit with Hardin in the Austin jail. On September 16, 1878 Hardin is taken under Ranger guard to Comanche for sentencing and he writes Jane describing his travels. On October 5 he enters the Huntsville penitentiary to serve a 25-year sentence as #7109. Jane returns to his mother in Red River County. Hardin's letter writing in prison is restricted and letters are read by prison authorities. By December he has found a guard, J. C. Outlaw, who will slip out letters for him. Hardin writes in his autobiography (127) that he immediately began planning his escape. His letters are circumspect but in a slipped out letter of December 28 he describes an escape attempt. He does not admit blame but says he was punished.</p><p><emph render="bold">1879 Letters: </emph>In his letters to Jane, Hardin often expresses his love for her and the children. On January 9, 1879, he reminisces on their courtship in uncharacteristic detail. Later he apologizes that he exposed their courtship conversation which intimates how very aware he is that his letters are being read by others. In a letter of February 23 which he is slipping out through a guard, he warns Jane to be careful about what she writes, to pretend that she only wants him to be released legally. Letters to Jane of January 26 and February 9 also go into more detail about conditions at prison mentioning escape attempts and punishment. On February 9, Hardin tells Jane about Mannen Clements' legal troubles and that her sister Mattie married Oliver Odom. While Jane is still in Bennett he repeatedly urges her to be considerate of his mother and family. Jane leaves Hardin's mother around April 4 and goes to Austin. By May, she is living with Mannen Clements' family in San Saba County. In a May 11 letter to Mannen Clements, Hardin asks him to give information to Texas Rangers, Lee Hall and J. B. Armstrong, which will help them convict members of the mob who lynched Scrap Taylor. (Hardin relates in his autobiography that Scrap Taylor was lynched by Suttonites after the Webb murder). Mannen Clements is in Austin to take care of an aggravated assault charge mentioned in an earlier letter. In June, Hardin is put in boot shop and writes he has become a good fitter and cutter. On June 19, 1879, Sally Jane Clements, wife of Joseph Hardin Clements, writes Jane about an Indian raid against nearby settlers in West Texas. In August and September, Hardin's mother and family are moving around looking for another place to farm. November 2, Hardin tells Jane to enjoy her stay in Gonzales where her family lives and advises her to "let bygones alone." He is most likely referring to the animosities between Hardin and the Bowens over the Bowen's part in Hardin's arrest and Brown Bowen's hanging.</p><p><emph render="bold">1880 Letters: </emph>There are only five letters and one four-side page of school exercises belonging to Edward Bowen from this year. None of the letters are to or from John Hardin. In May, Elizabeth Hardin writes to Jane in Gonzales that Hardin has had his letter writing privileges taken away after he has been caught planning an escape in clandestine correspondence with Mannen Clements. In August 1880, Hardin attempted escape again and these attempts undoubtedly are the reason he is unable or unwilling to write.(Marohn, 150)</p><p><emph render="bold">1881 Letters: </emph>On June 3, 1881, Hardin writes Jane again after a long hiatus. He explains, in a rather circumspect manner, why he had not written. He is basically saying that since he could not be frank with her (he is possibly referring to his escape attempts and punishment), there was no point in writing at all. He also offers her the opportunity to leave him since they are forced to live apart. He indicates a prison superintendent convinced him to write his mother after she repeatedly wrote asking what had happened to him. He claims that he has decided to make no more attempts to escape and hopes now to gain early release by earning good time or being pardoned. On July 3, 1881, Hardin writes that he worships on the Sabbath, belongs to the Moral and Christian Society and is secretary of the Debating Society. Once again he offers Jane her freedom if she thinks it is in her best interest. In a letter of August 14, he acknowledges that Jane has responded that she wants to remain his wife. He again gives reasons why he did not write her for so long including "to Keep you out of a disgraceful correspondence Something I cannot mention Now." On September 25, Hardin once more offers Jane her release if she wants it. He asks her to write and offers to give her advice on how to educate the children if she wants it.</p><p><emph render="bold">1882 Letters: </emph>In a letter of February 26, Hardin writes that he is glad Jane has chosen to wait for him. In his next letter of April 2, he tells her that he wants to see her but not in stripes. Hardin's mother is writing from Gainesville in May and Hardin's sister, Matt Smith, moves to Lampasas Springs after her husband Bright's house burns down. The children are growing and Hardin's letters increasingly discuss their upbringing beginning with Sep 3. There is one letter from Jane's father Neill Bowen, the only letter of his in the collection. It is written from Pollard, Alabama to Wad who is probably a resident of Gonzales County. Some have thought Wad was Wes but the contents of the letter indicate rather that Neill is writing to someone who has family in Florida and is living in the free world.</p><p><emph render="bold">1883 Letters: </emph>There is only one letter from this year written to Jane Hardin by her sister. Hardin writes in his autobiography that he tried to escape in 1883 without success. In the fall, he became very ill from an abscess to an old gun wound received in 1872. When he is well enough, he is put to work in the tailor shop. (Hardin 131-133)</p><p><emph render="bold">1884 Letters: </emph>Hardin's letters begin to appear on prison forms. He writes Jane two letters in this year indicating he spent most of the year sick from his wound.</p><p><emph render="bold">1885 Letters: </emph>In May, Hardin's mother Elizabeth died at the age of 58 in Ennis, Texas.In August, Hardin asks prison superintendent Ben McCulloch for proper medical treatment saying he has been suffering for two years. In September, Hardin writes Jane that he is feeling better after 2 years of sickness and that sickness prevented him from writing more. His two oldest children begin to write him.</p><p><emph render="bold">1886 Letters: </emph>Hardin begins to write his children directly, giving them advice on the importance of education and the proper way to behave.</p><p><emph render="bold">1887 Letters: </emph>Hardin continues to lecture wife and children using more biblical quotes and religious references. He explains to his children that he was unjustly imprisoned.</p><p><emph render="bold">1888 Letters: </emph>Hardin writes flowery letters instructing Jane and the children on how they should behave. In a February 5th letter, he tells Jane his release date has been moved up because of his good conduct. He promises that if released, he will try to purge himself of his "wicked intemperate ways." On June 24, he defends his past as the actions of a brave man fighting all foes. He has never surrendered and he stood up against the mob. On October 7, Hardin tells Jane to tell the children all about him and that they should imitate his virtues and avoid his faults.</p><p><emph render="bold">1889 Letters: </emph>All the letters from this year are addressed to the children but the body of the letter often contains individual messages to each member of his family. Hardin continues to claim he is imprisoned unjustly. In the July 14 letter to his daughter Jane, he relates his version of the Webb killing, his brother's lynching, his arrest and trial. He also expresses sorrow that Jane's father, Neill Bowen has died. In October he asks Jane why she is not writing.</p><p><emph render="bold">1890 Letters: </emph>In an April letter, Hardin attacks successive Governor's administrations from Davis to Ross. He writes that he has endured 13 years of slavery in prison and the 10 years before he was in "tragic battle" with Yankee soldiers and their supporters. In a November letter, Hardin tells Jane to keep her good looks since he expects to be free in three years. He adds that he will continue to battle for his rights, and for the children to cease writing for the present. In every letter, Hardin gives advice on the behavior of the children.</p><p><emph render="bold">1891 Letters: </emph>Many of these letters are addressed to Jane Hardin written by John and various other family members. Following a Southern familial custom, John continues advising Jane on the behavior of the children. In an April letter, John pleads with Jane to teach the children "that it is cowardly to lie to Steal to rob […] to murder or to violate any law civil." Hardin also receives a letter from L.A. Whatley, Superintendent of Penitentiaries, detailing additional prison time Hardin has accrued on account of his "misconduct" and relates to Hardin's that his term will thus expire on January 22, 1894, if Hardin "will be acquiescent &amp; obedient to the rules." </p><p>
<emph render="bold">1892 Letters: </emph>Letters from the Fly &amp; McNeal law firm are of interest here, such as one letter dated May 18, in which W.S. McNeal writes to Hardin reassuring him that his case "is a good one and will be of great benefit with the governor in obtaining a pardon for you." Also of interest here are the heartfelt letters that Hardin sent to his children.In an August letter to his son and two daughters, Hardin writes that "Your papa" desires to greet his family with "Kisses of love and tender caresses emblematic of his deep and Sinceere [<emph render="italic">sic</emph>] affection for each of you."</p><p><emph render="bold">1893 Letters: </emph>Considering that Hardin was released from prison the following year, many of documents contained here are not surprisingly related to Hardin's case (with various references to the murder of J.B. Morgan); including formal interaction with state legislators and Governor J.S. Hogg.</p><p><emph render="bold">1894 Letters: </emph>Recently released from prison, Hardin is involved in prolific correspondence with various persons including sheriffs, attorneys, and local merchants. Of peculiar interest are several bills Hardin received from J.P. Randle, P. Levyson, and (responding to a request for a law book catalogue) Gilbert Book Company.</p><p><emph render="bold">1895 Letters:</emph> One singular article of interest here is Hardin's business card—as an attorney at law in El Paso. The card is fixed to a note, which reads, "This card and about 80 others were found in Hardin's room after he was killed in 1895." One humorous letter dated July 11, from J.H. Flynth, asks Hardin to "please tell me when you was convicted the first time and what was your sentence […] for the purpose of settling a dispute here in regard to the matter." This was answered in a script that (to this writer) appears to be J.W. Hardin's, but was written "in regard to Mr. Hardin," and is unsigned.</p>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Cormac McCarthy Papers span 1964-2007 and document the literary career of one of America's most celebrated authors. The collection contains Published Works and Unpublished Works. The bulk of the collection is Published Works, housed in boxes 1 through 96. All of McCarthy's published novels and produced plays and screenplays are represented: The Orchard Keeper (boxes 1-7); Outer Dark (boxes 8-15); Child of God (boxes 16-17); The Gardener's Son (box 18); Suttree (boxes 19-34); Blood Meridian (boxes 35-45); All the Pretty Horses (boxes 46-54); The Crossing (boxes 55-65); The Stonemason (boxes 66-68); Cities of the Plain (boxes 69-78); No Country for Old Men (boxes 79-86); The Road (boxes 87-93); and The Sunset Limited (boxes 94-96). </p><p>The works are arranged chronologically by publication/production date. The material for each title is arranged into the following subseries: correspondence; research; notes; drafts; fragments; proofs; and production materials. Not every title has material from each subseries. For example, there is no correspondence associated with Outer Dark or Child of God; and The Gardener's Son is the only title with a subseries devoted to research. Other titles such as Blood Meridian have some research materials within the "notes" subseries. </p><p>Drafts represent the bulk of material for each title and are arranged chronologically as best determined. All pages of each draft remain in the original order, and pagination lists exist for each, representing McCarthy's unique page-numbering practice -- particularly for early and revised drafts. Nearly every draft arrived at the Collections with a numbered cover sheet that includes descriptive information such as title, draft stage, and page numbers. These sheets remain with the materials, although the listed page number counts are often inaccurate. The true count and pagination can be found in the container list of this finding aid. </p><p>Unpublished Works contains drafts for McCarthy's unproduced screenplay, "Whales and Men," (box 97) and a novel with the working title "The Passenger" (box 98). McCarthy began both Cities of the Plain and No Country for Old Men as screenplays, and although his scripts were never produced, the notes and drafts for them are housed in the boxes with the published novels of the same titles. </p> </scopecontent>

<scopecontent id="aspace_0e528c8b804f60e009925ecf45cc79d4"><head>Series Description</head><p>These audio cassettes primarily feature Willie Nelson, though there are several of other recording artists. The cassettes are in varying condition, some have been recorded over multiple times and the labels are not always descriptive of what is on the tape. The series of audio recordings has been divided into 5 subseries; Jody Fischer recordings, Willie Nelson studio recordings, Willie Nelson dated live recordings, Willie Nelson undated live recordings, and other recording artists. The collection also included a variety of commercially produced and released cassettes that have been transferred to the library holdings. </p><p>The cassettes covered a broad scope of music, as well as some personal recordings of events, phone calls and jam sessions. The cassettes did not have a particular original order, and when possible have been arranged by date. The priority for sorting recordings was broken down by separating out the Studio recordings, Jody's own recordings which give insight to the interests and activities outside of strictly music that she participated in as an individual and as Willie Nelson's personal assistant. Following that recordings are sorted by those including Willie Nelson, and those of other artists. </p><p>When it is not possible to sort by date, the recordings are sorted by alphabetical order of contributing artists. Often the labels only include first names, such as Hank, Dolly, Kris, Frank, and Johnny to name a few. While some of the last names can be inferred based on other famous musicians and context, last names that have been added by the processing staff are put in parenthesis to indicate that they are additions not included on the actual labels.

Subseries 1: Jody Fisher Recordings, 1988-1996, undated
These recordings are difficult to date, frequently Fischer has recorded over other tapes, and many of her recordings have Willie Nelson music on the other side. These recordings include phone conversations, Hawaiian music taped from the radio on her trip to Hawaii, and programs focusing on Native American civil rights, amongst other topics.

Subseries 2: Willie Nelson Studio Recordings, 1983-1987, undated
These recordings with one exception are from the Pedernales Studio. They are arranged by date when possible, with undated recordings at the end of the series. </p><p>Subseries 3: Willie Nelson Recordings Dated, 1976-1995
These recordings vary from jam sessions to concerts to rough recordings prior to production. Often they include other artists such as Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, and other country, folk and blues artists. </p><p>Subseries 4: Willie Nelson Recordings, Undated
These recordings are similar to those in subseries 3, except that they are undated. Recordings will be grouped by collaborating artists listed on the labels.</p><p>Subseries 5: Recordings by Other Artists, 1982-1986, undated
These are other unproduced recordings in the Jody Fischer collections featuring other artists. These are sorted alphabetically by artist last name. </p></scopecontent>

Most of the tapes are programs featuring Willie Nelson recorded from television. The programs include news interviews, music concerts, television shows and film. The majority of the tapes are produced video although, there are some tapes featuring raw footage of Willie Nelson. The raw footage includes a music performance at a bar in 1990, the auction of Willie Nelson's personal belongings, Willie Nelson performing at Phoenix Indian School and Willie Nelson performing a toast to Mae Boren Axton. The raw footage tapes have been copied onto DVDs. </p><p>The collection also includes television recordings of Farm Aid 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that aired on the MTV network. The VHS tapes that do not feature Willie Nelson include two episodes of <emph render="italic">Ned Blessing</emph>, a raw footage recording of the play, <emph render="italic">Small Town Girl</emph> and a raw footage recording of a tribal award ceremony with Kris Kristoferson in attendance. Titles supplied by Jody Fischer are in quotations. </p><p>This series is divided into five subseries: Farm Aid Concerts, Farm Aid Related Videos, Willie Nelson Produced Video, Willie Nelson Raw Footage and Non-Willie Nelson. </p></scopecontent>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Sam Shepard and Johnny Dark Collection spans 1972-2011 and documents the men's forty-plus year friendship. The collection is arranged in five series: Correspondence, Dialogues, Photographs, Audio Material, and Video Material. </p><p>Series I: Correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection (boxes 1-4) and is arranged chronologically. The first letters are from the early 1970s when the Shepards lived briefly in England and the Darks remained in California. Because the two families lived together for many years, there are few letters until 1980 when Shepard began filming on location. The letters pick up in earnest in 1983 after Shepard left his wife and son and began a long-term relationship with actress Jessica Lange. For the next three decades, the two men kept up a fairly regular correspondence.</p><p>Series II: Dialogues is over 200 pages of typed transcripts of conversations that Dark and Shepard recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. Arranged in themed sections by Dark, the conversations cover a wide range of topics including relationships, writing, film, ageing, and friendship.</p><p>Series III: Photographs is comprised of photographs collected by Dark. Many are mounted onto notebook pages with annotations in Dark's hand. These photographs provide a glimpse into the private lives of the men. The bulk of the photos are of Shepard and Dark, but there are also images of Scarlett Dark, O-Lan Jones, Jesse Shepard, Sam Rogers (Shepard's father) and Jessica Lange. The photographs are in the order in which Dark arranged them, and each has a unique identifying number (001-178) assigned by the archivist. In addition to the numbered photographs, there are over 250 snapshots taken by Dark. Many of these are duplicates of the numbered photographs, but there are several unique ones including shots of Shepard on the set of <emph render="italic">All the Pretty Horses </emph>with Matt Damon, photos from Jesse Shepard's wedding, and more photos of Shepard and of Dark.</p><p>Series IV: Audio Material contains 28 tapes of varying audio quality. Most of the tapes feature conversations between Shepard and Dark - some recorded in person, some over the telephone. The tapes from the 1970s and 1980s form the basis of Dark's typescript, Dialogues, in Series II. All of the cassettes have been digitized, and there are listening copies available. Archives staff have provided summaries of many, but not all, of the digitized tapes. </p><p>Series V: Video Material consists of two items. The first is a VHS tape of home movies shot by Dark. The video quality is relatively poor, but the tape has been digitized and a viewing copy is available. The second item is a DVD of the documentary, <emph render="italic">Shepard and Dark</emph>, directed by Treva Wurmfeld. Access to this DVD is by special permission only.

In particular, this subseries contains information regarding the Civil Rights movements and the changes made in language with regard to African-Americans. It also illustrates how newspaper reporters made changes in how reporting was done when an African-American was the subject, especially regarding reporting of crimes.</p><p>
The second subseries within Series III, includes the years 1976 through 1998. During this time, Compton was editor of the Focus and Books sections of the Dallas Morning News.

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph> archive contains scripts, memos, letters, notes, production forms, set and costume sketches, set blueprints, photographs, props, costumes, videotapes, audiocassettes and a laser videodisc. The material details every aspect of the production--from the writing of the teleplay through the budgeting, casting, planning, scheduling, filming, publicity and distribution. </p><p>The archival arrangement follows the order of production and is organized into eleven series:
1. Story and Script
2. Producer's Unit
3. Production Staff
4. Casting
5. Art
6. Wardrobe
7. Production
8. Post-Production
9. Distribution
10. Publicity
11. Congratulations and Awards. </p><p>Of particular interest are the various drafts of the screenplay, the almost complete set of production records, the dailies, the set designs, the story boards, the props, the costumes, the costume research notes and Bill Wittliff's photography of the cast and filming. </p><p>The archive was donated through Bill Wittliff. Some material was sent to Wittliff for inclusion in the collection by others--producer Suzanne de Passe; storyboard artist Michael Peal; property master Eric Williams; actors Tim Scott, Glenne Headly and Anjelica Huston; production designers Cary White and John Frick; costume designer Van Broughton Ramsey; and composer Basil Poledouris. The remainder of the archive belonged to Wittliff as writer and producer.</p> </scopecontent>
<scopecontent id="aspace_40c87bb260888ee8924b481c66f81b4a"><head>Series Description</head><p>Suzanne de Passe, president of Motown Productions, enlisted Bill Wittliff to write the screenplay for <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph>. Wittliff, a native Texan, had been writing films since 1977, beginning with the CBS-TV movie <emph render="italic">Thaddeus Rose and Eddie</emph> and including credit for <emph render="italic">The Black Stallion </emph>(1979),<emph render="italic">Honeysuckle Rose</emph> (1980), <emph render="italic">Raggedy Man</emph> (1981), <emph render="italic">Barbarosa</emph> (1982), <emph render="italic">Country</emph> (1984) and <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph>(1986). Wittliff's experience compelled him to seek some creative control to assure his ability to protect the integrity of his script. He was made executive producer as well as screenwriter, and he shared creative control with de Passe and CBS-TV. The collection of notes, drafts, polishes and final script provides an unusually clear-cut example of how to transform a lengthy, multi-peopled, much-beloved novel into a film while still retaining the substance of the original. </p><p>The series begins with a typescript of <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph> sent by Larry McMurtry's agent Irving Paul (Swifty) Lazar to Suzanne de Passe in 1985. This is followed by Wittliff's marked hardback and paperback copies of the novel; by the notes, rough drafts, and typescripts for each of the four parts of the miniseries; and by the final shooting script with blue and pink pages reflecting revisions made just before and during shooting. The title page of the shooting script was signed by every actor who had a speaking line in the miniseries.</p></scopecontent>

Assistant to Mr. Wittliff: Connie Todd</p><p>Co-executive Producer: Robert Halmi</p><p>Producer: Dyson Lovell</p><p>Supervising Producer: Michael Weisbarth</p><p>This series is primarily made up of correspondence among the producers. The majority of the memos are from Dyson Lovell and deal with scheduling, hiring, budget, set behavior, etc. Wittliff's files contain letters, thank yous from actors, bills and notes relating to the production. Present also is the correspondence of Wittliff's assistant Connie Todd as well as her research on period music to be used in the film. </p></scopecontent>

</p><p>Here is found the paperwork of the production manager and the script supervisor. The production manager supervises the technical staff and is responsible for the budget and technical details of the production. His memos deal with cost, censorship, location information, set problems, etc. His staff prepares the production forms--standard documents used throughout the film and television industry which detail every aspect of a production. Included here are the budget breakdown, script breakdown, production board, shooting schedules, Day-Out-of-Days, One-liner Schedules, Call Sheets and Daily Production Reports.</p><p>The Script Supervisor is responsible for continuity, i.e. assuring that the different takes are consistent with one another despite the fact that scenes are rarely shot in chronological or script sequence order. This position also serves as the link between the director and the film editor. The Continuity Script and the Cutter's Log represent the script supervisor's functions</p></scopecontent>

Assistant Production Designer: John Frick</p><p>Storyboard Artist: Michael Peal</p><p>Property Master: Eric Williams</p><p>Here are found the set designs as drawn by the Production Designer Cary White and his assistant, John Frick. Cary White, a Texas-based designer, had worked with Wittliff on <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph>(1986)and had also designed for <emph render="italic">Texas Chainsaw Massacre II</emph>(1986) and <emph render="italic">Nadine</emph>(1987). The drawings and plans for <emph render="italic">Lonesome Dove</emph> include a sketch of the town of Lonesome Dove, construction details for the Whiskey Boat, a map showing the path of the characters from Texas to Montana, a sketch of Clara's ranch and a sketch of the Montana ranch. </p><p>This series also holds the storyboard rough drawings and copies of the finished drawings for Scenes 24 to 28, "Horse Rustling;" Scenes 56 to 59, "Dust Storm and Lightning;" and Scenes 223 to 225, "Buffalo Chase and Gus's wounding." Each of these sequences requires action, a large cast of animals and/or special effects. The pictorial layout of the shots in storyboard form facilitates the logistical planning of the scenes to avoid risk, delay or unnecessary takes. Storyboard artist Michael Peal had previously drawn storyboards for <emph render="italic">Blood Simple</emph>(1982) and <emph render="italic">Save the Dog</emph>(1987). He had been a set dresser on <emph render="italic">Red Headed Stranger</emph> (1985)and a set decorator on <emph render="italic">Texas Chainsaw Massacre II</emph>(1986). </p><p>Included here too are the Property Master Eric Williams' snapshots used for continuity. These photos illustrate in great detail the mass of props employed in the miniseries--saddles, bridles, guns, bows, belts, gear, bedrolls, etc. The Polaroids were originally kept on large circular rings or tied together with leather thongs. The series also contains actual props such as Gus' muslin wrapped body, Gus' Colt Dragoon pistol, knife, and Gus' and Deets' grave markers and Po Campo's walking stick.</p></scopecontent>

Ramsey kept his notes, forms and drawings in two cloth zipper notebook containers. A blue container held Ramsey's sketches of costumes for the principal characters and includes notes from the novel, cloth swatches and photocopies of period photos from books and articles. A purple container held the shooting schedule, contact sheet, filming locations, purchases and sizes of the principals and extras. Four black notebooks (now removed) labeled Volume I to IV held snapshots on each character in costume, followed by a form listing every item of clothing worn in the scenes in which the character appeared.

<p>The Wick Fowler papers span 1944-1991 (bulk dates: 1944-1945, 1965-1978) and document Fowler's journalism work as well as the Chili Appreciation Society International and Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili product. The collection is arranged in 7 series: Biographical Information, Writings, Chili, Correspondence, Audio Recordings, General Newspapers, and Printed Material.</p>
<p>The largest series, Chili, documents the chili cook-off in Terlingua, the Chili Appreciation Society International, and Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili product, and contains articles and clippings, a scrapbook, promotional materials, photographic materials, and artifacts.

<p>The second series, Writings, documents Fowler's career as a journalist. Subseries are World War II, Vietnam War, Humor, John Connally Assassination Attempt, Crime and Safety, and Boating. Each subseries contains clippings and columns by Fowler, including his "Vietnam Diary," a special insert for the <emph render="italic">Dallas Morning News</emph> on February 27, 1966.

<p>The papers of reporter and publisher, Sam Kindrick, span 1934-2018, and are arranged into three series: Photographs, Personal Papers, and Action Magazine Records. Photographs comprise the bulk of the collection and number approximately 4,000. Most are photographs of artists and musicians from Kindrick's Action Magazine files that document a veritable "who's who" of local and touring performers who played in San Antonio and the region from 1975 to the mid 2010s. </p><p>The photographs are arranged alphabetically, and notable artists and personalities include Asleep at the Wheel, Moe Bandy, Johnny Bush, Johnny Cash, Hondo Crouch, Joe Ely, Freddy Fender, Kinky Friedman, John Lee Hooker, Waylon Jennings &amp; Jessie Colter, Steve Jordan, Augie Meyers, Willie Nelson, Johnny Rodriguez, Leon Russell, Doug Sahm, Billy Joe Shave, Jimmy Spacek, and Jerry Jeff Walker. The Willie Nelson photographs are substantial in number, and of note are some images of his father, Ira, as well as images of each of the band members.</p><p>The photographs also document the unique culture of 1970s-1980s Texas and include files on armadillos; artists &amp; craftsmen; beer; chili cookoffs; and politicians. In addition, there are a number of photographs of sports personalities, pool players, boxers, and dare devils.</p><p>And finally, the photographs include some of Sam Kindrick's personal and family photos, including some from Kindrick's childhood, school days, and early reporting career. Images of Kindrick with performers are filed with the respective performer's file, such as Kinky Friedman, Augie Meyers, Willie Nelson, and Jerry Jeff Walker.</p><p>The bulk of Kindrick's personal papers include clippings of his "Offbeat" column that appeared in the San Antonio Express News, 1968-1974. The column is a precursor to the work he would later do at Action Magazine, and the subjects are similar: music, culture, off-beat stories of sports, politics, and society. </p><p>The final series relates to Action Magazine itself and includes some artist press releases, advertising files, some layout pages, a wire newspaper stand, and a near-complete run of the newspaper from 1975-2018.</p> </scopecontent>

The collection is divided into 12 series as seen below. Researchers are urged to look at each series, as material about individual musicians may be found in multiple locations.

A quick note on terminology. The initials RH are used frequently to denote material that is either created by or related to Hernández himself. The material described as "mounted" in the finding aid indicates that it is affixed on foamcore and was likely once displayed.

<emph render="bold">Series Descriptions</emph>

<emph render="bold">Series I: Artists Files, 1922-2019, undated
Boxes 1-155</emph>

Artist Files comprise the bulk of the collection. The files are separated into Male Artist Files and Female Artist Files to maintain Hernández's original order. Both series are then arranged alphabetically by artist last name or band name. Although the series is titled Artists Files, there are also entrepreneurs, community leaders, promoters, street performers, and many others represented.

The material found in each artist file varies greatly. For artists that Hernández worked with, there are typically hundreds of his photographs (both portraits and of performances), drafts of publicity material, and design ideas for album covers. The contents of larger files are typically sorted into the following broader subseries: Personal, Photographs, Concert and Event Publicity, Albums, Publicity, Ramón Hernández Material, Clippings, Audiovisual material, and Promotional Material. Note: not every artist file has each type of material.

• Personal includes autographs, business cards, correspondence, and other such material.
• Photographs consist of both snapshots and portraits (most taken by Hernández) along with publicity photographs.
• Concert and Event Publicity consists of tickets, flyers, publicity cards, programs, and other publicity material for concerts and other events.

There are two exceptions to this: the majority of boxes, including the oversized ones, for Little Joe Hernandez (boxes 33-46) and Selena (boxes 121-142) are housed within Series I: Artists Files due to the sheer quantity of material, but as with all artists, materials related to them can be found in many series.

<p>Jones' papers are divided into two series: 1. Texas records; 2. New Mexico records. They span the years from 1931 to 1992 with most of the material dating from the 1960s through the 1980s. Contained here are class notes, scripts, set designs, costume designs, playbills, letters, photographs, records, audiotapes, reports, clippings, magazines, articles, awards, school records, yearbooks, scrapbooks, personal effects, and mementos. The Texas series contains three subseries: Education and Teaching; Acting, Design, and Directing; and Dallas Theater Center Administration. </p><p>
The first subseries of the Texas files presents information on Jones' education at Baylor University and her teaching of acting and design at both Baylor and Trinity Universities. The second offers a good deal of information on her career as actor, director, and designer at the Dallas Theater Center. The third subseries covers her work as assistant artistic director to Paul Baker and is especially informative on the state of affairs during the transfer of the directorship at the Dallas Theater Center from Paul Baker to Adrian Hall. </p><p>
The New Mexico series is arranged into four subseries: Teaching and Directing, Paul Baker Festival, Production and Script Files, and Personal. The first subseries provides information on Jones' work as artist-in-residence, and later as a faculty member at the College of Santa Fe. The second centers on the career of Paul Baker, especially at the Dallas Theater Center, and documents the 1990 festival organized by his former students to honor him. The third subseries is Jones' collection of scripts or production files including many of the plays performed at the Dallas Theater Center. The fourth contains material on Mary Sue's private life and non-theatrical interests, such as her baby book, gardening, and decoration ideas for her Santa Fe home.</p> </scopecontent>

Afterwards, she continued to keep in touch with her mentor, inviting him to Santa Fe to oversee a production of Preston Jones' The Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia in 1985, while at the same time organizing a tribute to him. She also took a prominent part in the 1990 Paul Baker festival in Waco, "Second Harvest." The second subseries, Paul Baker Festival Files, contains newspaper clippings, programs, and letters, much of which focuses on Baker's career and theatrical influence.</p><p>The next subseries, Script and Production Files, contains Mary Sue's collection of scripts, articles and research material on stage productions. Many of the scripts are annotated with remarks on interpretation and stage directions. A good number of these plays were performed at the Dallas Theater Center. They are arranged alphabetically by title.</p><p>The final subseries, entitled Personal, presents aspects of Mary Sue's life from her birth in Carthage, Missouri, through her marriage to and divorce from the sculptor Roy Barto Fridge, her life with Preston at the Dallas Theater Center, her widowhood in Santa Fe, to her death in 1992.

When we discuss dynamics, we're talking about movement. It's motion — but it's more than that. Think of the motivating forces behind everything, everywhere. There are physical forces, moral forces, and driving forces. You can see and feel dynamics in growth, change, inspiration, and action. We will consider the movement from where you are to where you will be, approaching dynamics both literally and metaphorically, from the observations of astrophysics to the momentum of daily life.</p><p>This theme will ask you to explore your own experiences in the contexts of space, place, movement, and time. By studying the past while examining your personal values, you can trace the paths of social, political, and cultural movements. Each new opportunity will add knowledge and experience — leading you to see the influences and responsibilities you have in shaping our global future.</p><p>---From Common Experience website</p></scopecontent>
