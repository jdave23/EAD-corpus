    <head>Biographical Notes</head>
<p>Mary Gray Hughes, the daughter of Texas author and newspaperman, Hart Stilwell and his first wife, Mary Gray Seabury, was born in Brownsville, Texas on August 25, 1930. A prolific and respected author in her own right, Hughes wrote and was published almost continuously for nearly three decades from 1969 until dying from cancer in Chicago, IL in September, 1999. Throughout her life, she received numerous awards for her writing. She received the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Writing (1978), was Illinois Writer in Residence from 1977-1980, had her stories anthologized in <emph render='italic'>Best American Short Stories</emph> (1962, 1972), had her stories mentioned in <emph render='italic'>Best American Stories</emph> (1974-1975), and was elected a member of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1983.</p><p> 
Hughes graduated from Brownsville High School in 1947 then attended The University of Mexico for a summer before completing her education at The University of Texas and Barnard College.  While at Barnard, she participated in Phi Beta Kappa and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts. After receiving a Fulbright Scholarship for two years, she pursued a Master of Letters in Social Anthropology. She graduated in 1953.</p><p> 
In this same year, she married J.R.T. Hughes. Moving to Illinois, Hughes gave birth to a son, Benjamin in 1960, and twin girls, Charis and Margaret, in 1962. Starting in 1954, Hughes worked continuously at a variety of jobs â€“ almost all in the teaching, publishing, and writing fields. She was an editor at Bowker Publishing Co. and People's Book Club, and was the Writer in Residence of the Illinois Arts Council. She conducted writing workshops at high schools and colleges; served as consultant for the Illinois Arts Council; was writer-consultant to the graduate program in Creative Writing for the University of South Alabama; lecturer in English at Lake Forest College; lecturer in English at Northwestern University, and a judge for the Texas Institute of Letters.</p><p> 
All the while, Hughes worked on her own writing and had numerous short stories, poems, and books published. Notable among her works are the short story collections, <emph render='italic'>The Calling</emph> and <emph render='italic'>Cora's Seduction and Other Stories</emph>, and the novel, <emph render='italic'>The Empty Lot</emph>. This collection of papers represent the materials published by Puckerbrush Press as <emph render='italic'>Cora's Seduction and Other Stories</emph>, and were donated to Texas State University's Wittliff Collection by the Press in 2003.</p>  </bioghist>

It is sub-divided into Short Stories and Poetry by Hughes. Short Stories are further sub-divided into Short Stories and Story Lines. Both are arranged alphabetically and arranged according to the type of document generally in order by handwritten note, typescript draft, typescript, typescript copy, copy, then submission to editor.</p><p>Poetry is sub-divided into a Poem List, Poems, "Journey to a Hard Conclusion" edits, "Journey to a Hard Conclusion" printout, Untitled Handwritten Poems, and Submissions to Editors. Poem List consists of numerous drafts of a handwritten list of poems by the author. Additionally, the poems are arranged alphabetically and according to document type mainly consisting of printout drafts. "Journey to a Hard Conclusion" edits contains drafts as collected by the author of poems included in the book of the same title arranged alphabetically and by document type. Of special note is the "Journey to a Hard Conclusion" sub-series. This folder contains a complete printout copy of the book. Untitled Handwritten Poems contains random poems written on various papers. Again, these poems were collected and written by the author and because they contain no title have no fixed arrangement. Finally Submissions to Editors are letters to and from various editors submitting, accepting, or refusing Hughes' work. Arranged chronologically, this folder was only altered from its original submission by arranging in date order.  All other material grouped together is as submitted by the author.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_e655f7a99aa2517c84b1785ce32d1151" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Short Stories</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_a51d066244053d1b3aee54456273dff5" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Beach" "Cora's Seduction" "A Few Spoken Words" 	"In a Strange Land" "Let Me Take You Away From It All" "Life Blood"</unittitle><container id="aspace_80b039bc0f67fec3e7e4d46797121e9f" label="Text" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_25ce910e26d869f102c5fbb9ca5c6932" parent="aspace_80b039bc0f67fec3e7e4d46797121e9f" type="folder">4</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_91a659a6a097133e2d428b2e5ae5c1db" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Long Drive"</unittitle><container id="aspace_6cb89d974c3acbc06f030f8ba7602a90" label="Text" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_9ec5e09fb95848352aeab9d2c01dcf26" parent="aspace_6cb89d974c3acbc06f030f8ba7602a90" type="folder">5</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_0fef899bc64fb5a82dd2f7fac208f0d3" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Merging in San Francisco" "A Mother's Love"  "New Venture" "The Old Woman of the Mountain" "Reunion" "Third House, On the Left" "Three Ages on a Park Bench" "Torn Leaves"	"Welcome Strangers, and Others Too" 	"The Valley of Zibelu"</unittitle><container id="aspace_6d5b19125373a9f33350b61ed9a8d261" label="Text" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_d152da2b6bcda4c7b08538bb3322698c" parent="aspace_6d5b19125373a9f33350b61ed9a8d261" type="folder">1</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_295c6ef3e30dc730501286ace48a2a5b" level="file"><did><unittitle>"You Go On"</unittitle><container id="aspace_c4fb08b9bc4b816dc6793919075dbc77" label="Text" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_b1520de1404d79472e0ad66bfb2dea22" parent="aspace_c4fb08b9bc4b816dc6793919075dbc77" type="folder">2</container></did></c03></c02><c02 id="aspace_6c8b887c2b41786b60ec6abe49e3f939" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Story Lines</unittitle></did><c03 id="aspace_f4ff7913b4e17a41d637c61c5a5f497f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Various story lines</unittitle><container id="aspace_35bb3f56ed1a4c9c89f8706f337b78db" label="Text" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_653c40196dc05f0a5f074b52bbad970c" parent="aspace_35bb3f56ed1a4c9c89f8706f337b78db" type="folder">3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0152b06b41c33563af22d727bf33589e"><head>Contents</head><p>"Ashamed"- handwritten draft
