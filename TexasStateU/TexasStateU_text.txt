Gary Cartwright was born August 10, 1934 in Dallas, Texas, and raised in nearby Arlington. He received a B.A. in journalism and government from Texas Christian University in 1957. Cartwright reported the police beat for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram from 1956 until he was hired away in 1958 to the Fort Worth Press, where he joined Dan Jenkins and Bud Shrake in the sports department under legendary Texas sportswriter Blackie Sherrod. In 1960, Cartwright moved to the Dallas Times Herald as a sports reporter and in 1963 he joined the Dallas Morning News to write his own sports column. Cartwright's first book, a football novel entitled The Hundred Yard War, was published in 1967 at which point he left newspaper work to become a freelance writer. His work has appeared in The Texas Observer, Esquire, Saturday Review, Rolling Stone and Texas Monthly.
Cartwright has been associated with Texas Monthly magazine since its inception in 1973. His articles range over various topics--crime, notable Texans, Texas culture, travel, sports and international travel. A collection of his Texas Monthly articles can be found in Confessions of a Washed-up Sportswriter. The true-crime books Blood Will Tell and Dirty Dealing began as articles for Texas Monthly. In 1988, Cartwright had a heart attack that required quintuple-bypass surgery. A suggestion by Governor Ann Richards to document changes in his life since the injury led to his latest book, HeartWiseGuy.
Among the many honors Cartwright has received for his writing are the Texas Institute of Letters' Stanley Walker Award for Journalism for "The Endless Odyssey of Patrick Henry Polk" (Texas Monthly, May 1977) and the Press Club of Dallas Katie Award for Best Magazine News Story for "The Work of the Devil" (Texas Monthly, June 1989). Cartwright has written screenplays in collaboration with Edwin (Bud) Shrake, including J W. Coop (1972) and Another Pair of Aces (CBS-TV, 1990).
Cartwright passed away on February 22, 2017.

Lawrence Leo King, the youngest child of Clyde Clayton and Cora Lee Clark King, was born January 1, 1929 in Putnam, Texas. He fixed on a career as a writer early in his childhood, inspired by the Mark Twain his mother read to him. As early as grade school, King pursued publication of his works. He wrote regularly for the student newspaper at high school where he found a mentor in Aubra Nooncaster, football coach, English teacher and poet. From high school, King joined the army where he was a reporter for his base paper. He wrote professionally as a sports and crime reporter for the Hobbs (N. M.) Daily Flare, the Midland Reporter-Telegram and the Odessa American after a brief stint at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) as a journalism major. In 1954, King moved to Washington, D.C. as the Administrative Assistant to Representative J. T. Rutherford. After Rutherford was defeated in 1962, King joined the staff of another Texas congressman, future House Speaker Jim Wright. In 1964, King quit Capitol Hill to become a free-lance writer.
The novel, The One-Eyed Man, was published in 1966, but King's chief livelihood as a writer during this time came from his magazine articles. From 1964, King wrote for The Texas Observer, an iconoclastic liberal magazine "then the only voice of dissent (constant) or reason (occasionally) to be found in my native state" (King, Blockhead 20). At the same time, Mississippian Willie Morris, a University of Texas graduate and former editor of the Observer, encouraged King's writing ambitions. Morris gave King his first national exposure in Harper's, where Morris was an editor. In 1967, Morris was named editor-in-chief of Harper's and under his leadership, the magazine became famed for its' exciting and innovative writing. Morris published the brightest literary lights of the day as represented by an impressive list King catalogues in The Old Man and Lesser Mortals: "James Dickey, Jules Feiffer, Robert Penn Warren, Justin Kaplan, Sara Davidson, Jack Richardson, Elizabeth Hardwick, Norman Podhoretz, Arthur Miller, Tony Lucas, George Plimpton, Bud Shrake, Michael Arlen, Joe McGinnis, Alfred Kazin, John Updike, Ralph Ellison, Jeremy Larner, Ward Just, Truman Capote, Herbert Gold, Tom Wicker, Gay Talese, Larry McMurtry, Joan Didion, Philip Roth, John Fowles, Irving Howe . . ." (286). Not to be left out are William Styron, Norman Mailer, Bill Moyers and David Halberstam. King's best magazine work, as witnessed by the dominance of Harper's pieces in King's published collections, was done under Morris's editing. Examples of their collaboration are "Requiem for a West Texas Town", "My Hero LBJ", "The Old Man", and "The Whole World's Turned On."
King went on to write for numerous, well-known publications including Life, Holiday, Cosmopolitan, The Progressive, Playboy and Sports Illustrated. His topics were, in the main, Texas ("Requiem for a West Texas Town," "The Old Man," "The Lost Frontier," "Playing Cowboy") and politics ("My Hero LBJ," "God, Man and William F. Buckley," "The Trial of John Connally"), but he also treated other subjects such as sports, travel, and music.
In 1978, King penned the book for the hit Broadway musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, based on an article he wrote for Playboy. The success of Whorehouse allowed King to get off what he had come to feel was the magazine treadmill and develop his talent in a different form. He has subsequently seen his plays The Night Hank Williams Died, The Kingfish and Golden Shadows Old West Museum produced.
During his career, King's work has received much praise. He earned a National Book Award Nomination in 1972 for Confessions of a White Racist. He received a Stanley Walker Journalism Award from the Texas Institute of Letters in 1973 for the article "The Lost Frontier." A television documentary, CBS Reports: The Best Little Statehouse in Texas, earned him an Emmy. He received the Mary Goldwater Award from the Theatre Lobby Trust in 1988 for The Night Hank Williams Died. This same work brought him the Helen Hayes award for best new play in 1989.
Though a college dropout, King's journalistic talent brought him to Harvard University in the 1969-1970 academic year as a Nieman Fellow. (He chronicled this experience in the October 1970 issue of Harper's, "Blowing My Mind at Harvard".) From Fall 1973 through Fall 1974, King taught as a Ferris Professor of Journalism and Political Science at Princeton University. He was a Duke Fellow of Communications from 1975 to 1976.
King has lived the majority of his life away from his home state but he continually returns there in his writing. In his own words, "That time and place of my youth -- which, I had been thoroughly convinced contained no story material, has merely provided me with the stuff of a career." (King, National Geographic Speech 1988) By chronicling the Texas that formed him, a Texas that is passing if not past, King, who believes "understanding of the past is vital to the lessons of the present" (King, The Old Man 46) has come to see himself as a leaver of "literary signposts. Those signposts say, simply . . . this is how it was, in my time and my place, when I passed this way . . . . Pass it on!" (C.A.S.T. Speech 1993, SWWC).
King married Wilma Jeanne Casey (d. 1991) in 1950. They had three children, Alexandria, Kerri Lee King Grandey, and Bradley Clayton. King, divorced in 1964, married on February 20, 1965 Rosemarie Coumaris Kline, who died of cancer June 8, 1972. Since May 6, 1978, King then married Barbara S. Blaine, who was also his lawyer and agent. They had two children, Lindsay Allison and Blaine Carlton.
King died of emphysema on December 20, 2012.
Billy Lee Brammer was born April 21, 1929, in Dallas, Texas. He graduated from North Texas State College in 1952 with a degree in journalism. Brammer was a reporter for the Corpus Christi Caller Times and the Austin Statesman, where he won a press award for excellence in writing in 1952. In 1954, he won the Texas Associated Press Managing Editors Contest for a feature sports story written for the same paper (newly titled the Austin American-Statesman). As the Statesman reported in its January 10, 1954 issue, the prize-winning story was written in Brammer's "usual unusual style."
In 1955, Brammer became an associate editor of the Texas Observer, a magazine of liberal dissent at a time when in Texas "the impulse for dissent scarcely existed" (Texas Observer, August 25, 1961). There he attracted the attention of Texas Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, who invited him to join his staff. While employed by Johnson in Washington, D.C., Brammer began working on his first and only published novel, The Gay Place. The book was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1961 to wide critical acclaim.
The Gay Place (reissued by Texas Monthly Press in 1978 and by Vintage Press in 1984) is where Brammer's literary reputation rests. The book consists of three novellas, all revolving around politics, all dominated by the larger than life, omniscient, manipulative Governor Arthur Fenstemaker. Brammer told friends Fenstemaker was a composite, but the character is largely reminiscent of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Willie Morris calls The Gay Place a "symphony of politics and sex and ambition and the immense Texas landscape [that] remains the great authentic modern novel we have yet of the state" (Texas Observer, Mar 3, 1978).
In 1959, after the still-unfinished The Gay Place had been bought by Houghton Mifflin, Brammer left Johnson's staff to work for the economist Eliot Janeway. Time hired him in 1960 to cover civil rights issues from the magazine's Atlanta office. Brammer quit the Time job in 1961 and thereafter never held sustained employment. He began a sequel to The Gay Place titled Fustian Days, but it was never completed. Though he did write several articles, Brammer never followed up the promise of his first book. Several reasons have been put forth for his writing block: disappointment at being barred from access to Johnson, who was displeased with The Gay Place; the overwhelming success of his first novel; and drug abuse. Brammer at one point gave his own explanation in a letter dated August 23, 1968 to Larry L. King - the problem was "getting hanged-up with attempts at over-perfection, compounded by uptight-making realization that [one] is really on [one's] own and has to be-god-effing mother produce as fulltime free-lance typewriter fella." (King Papers, The Wittliff Collections)
Various friends tried to help Brammer produce again. Fellow Texan and writer Larry L. King lobbied magazine editors into giving Brammer assignments. Texas columnist Jay Milner hired him as a journalism professor at Southern Methodist University in 1969 and then got him a position as a writer-in-residence at Bowling Green. William Broyles signed him on as a contributing editor for Texas Monthly. In 1976, Brammer's former wife, Nadine Eckhardt, asked him to help her write a memoir. Brammer took these offers in earnest, but after an initial spurt of activity he always drifted off. He held numerous other jobs for short periods of time, among them rock and roll promoter, dishwasher, and cook.
Those who knew Brammer remember him fondly and with admiration. Filmmaker Robert Benton testified, "Bill was one of the most charming, charismatic people I've ever met in my life. And he could talk about anything ‚Ä¶ "(Austin Chronicle, March 26, 1993). Jay Milner, in his syndicated newspaper column, portrayed Brammer as having been a "soft-spoken, gently lecherous, incredibly widely read, avid rock aficionado, ultimately rather seedy bon vivant, neurotic little man ("Remembering Billy Lee Brammer, a man of the Sixties" 1993). Willie Morris reminisced that he was "kind, unselfish, and giving of the things he knew - a sweet, gentle man, a teller of stories who never knew how to attitudinize" (Texas Observer, Mar 3, 1978). Brammer, tongue-in-cheek, did his own summing up in 1976: "Bestowed from birth with a lucy-in-the sky twinkle and irreverence for everything, Brammer bounced around the sub-culture after leaving LBJ, writing unfinished masterpieces by the score, ingesting hogsheads of drugs and acquiring a local image as the best approximation of guru and human wonder around" (Brammer Papers, The Wittliff Collections).
Brammer married Nadine Ellen Cannon (Nadine Eckhardt) on April 22, 1950 while both were students at North Texas State College. They had three children, Sidney Gail, Shelby Ellen, and William Raoul. The two were divorced in 1961. In 1963, Brammer married Dorothy Brown; they were divorced in 1969. Brammer died of a drug overdose on February 11, 1978.
Edwin "Bud" Shrake Jr. was born to Ruth and Edwin Shrake Sr. in Fort Worth, Texas on September 6, 1931. He was their first child, and took an early interest in writing and painting. By the fifth grade, Shrake had written his first short story, an adventure about World War II fighter pilots. In 1946 he entered Paschal High School in Fort Worth, and quickly became good friends with junior Dan Jenkins. The two future sportswriters, lifelong buddies and sometime-collaborators got their start writing for the Paschal Pantherette, the school newspaper.
Following high school Shrake enrolled for a year at Texas Christian University, then transferred to The University of Texas at Austin. After two semesters at UT, he returned to Fort Worth and with the help of Jenkins, found part-time work at the Fort Worth Press. Soon Shrake was working full-time at the Press alongside Jenkins and under the tutelage of sports-page editor, Blackie Sherrod. Shrake also returned to TCU, this time majoring in English and philosophy, and married Shakespearean scholar, Joyce Rogers.
In 1953, Shrake, having graduated from TCU, went to New York City to try to land a journalism job there. The New York Herald-Tribune showed interest in his writing, but then Shrake was called up to active duty in the army reserves. Shrake served stateside for two years, and in that time divorced and remarried Joyce. In 1955 he returned to Fort Worth, looking to pick up where he left off.
The Fort Worth Press hired Shrake back, but this time as a police reporter. Working his beat, he met another life-long friend and collaborator, Gary Cartwright, who reported for the rival newspaper, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Over the next few years, Shrake honed his skills at writing fiction and secured a literary agent. In 1958, Sherrod, having moved to the Dallas Times Herald, convinced Shrake to return to sports writing there. Shrake found success as a sportswriter at the Times Herald, and began to find some as a fiction and script writer too, selling his first short story and teleplay around this time. He also was determined to finish and publish his first novel, a western set among the Comanche and early settlers of Texas.
That novel, titled Blood Reckoning, was published by Bantam in 1962, and found some success in the pulp paperback market. Shrake by this time had moved to the Dallas Morning News as a sports columnist. His marriage to Joyce deteriorated a second time, and she left him, taking their two young boys with her. Shrake was hard at work on a second, more serious novel, when he met Doubleday editor Ken McCormick, who expressed great interest in the partial manuscript he had read on the sly in Shrake's apartment.
Shrake worked out a deal with the Morning News to be their "foreign correspondent" so he could travel Europe and finish the novel, which he did. In January 1964 Doubleday published But Not For Love and later that year he rejoined Dan Jenkins, this time in New York City at Sports Illustrated. The magazine's editor, Andre Laguerre, recognized Shrake's literary talents and sent him on more in-depth assignments as well as having him do the typical game reportage. Again Shrake used these traveling assignments to spend time researching and writing his fiction. His travels to the Southwest and Mexico in 1966-67 coincided with his work on a black-humor western set in the same locals.
Doubleday, wanting a book from Shrake on Dallas at the time of the Kennedy assassination, did not support his new novel, Blessed McGill. Although the book, published in January 1968, received favorable attention from literary writers and respected critics, Doubleday did very little to promote it, and the book soon disappeared from the bookshelves. Around this time Shrake made an arrangement with Laguerre that he could keep his job at Sports Illustrated and live somewhere else. Shrake chose Austin, Texas as his new home base, and moved there with Doatsy Shrake (nee Sedlmayr), whom he had married in 1966.
The next novel Shrake wrote, while on assignment in Asia for Sports Illustrated, was a Satyricon-inspired romp set among Texas oil barons, but he had trouble finding a publisher. In the spring of 1971, he went to London to write Strange Peaches, set in Dallas just before and after the Kennedy assassination. Largely autobiographical and based on actual events, Strange Peaches was published by Harper's Press in May 1972, but again disappeared quickly due to almost total lack of marketing effort by the publisher.
Around this time Shrake started turning his attention outside Sports Illustrated to screenwriting. His first two scripts, "Dime Box" and "J.W. Coop" (co-written with Gary Cartwright) were both produced, although the former was released (as Kid Blue) almost two years after production, with very little studio support behind it, and the latter resulted in a high-publicity court case versus the star, Cliff Robertson. This manner of frustrations and near-misses would follow Shrake for the next fifteen years or so as he wrote or co-wrote at least forty-two screenplays and teleplays, many of which were sold to studios but only seven of which actually made it to the screen, including Kid Blue and J.W. Coop.
Shrake did get two books published in the 1970s: Peter Arbiter‚Äîthe Texas Satyricon novel‚Äîby Encino Press in 1973; and Limo‚Äîco-written with Dan Jenkins‚Äîby Atheneum in 1976. Much of the decade was spent on writing screenplays, partying with fellow members of Mad Dog Inc. (a satirical company he founded with Cartwright in 1970), and traveling on assignments for Sports Illustrated. However, by 1978 Shrake parted ways with the magazine to focus on an ambitious new novel about the early days of the Republic of Texas, and to keep pursuing a breakthrough in Hollywood. In 1979 and 1980 he saw two of his scripts turned into feature films: Nightwing, and Tom Horn, respectively.
Two more productions of Shrake's scripts followed in 1984: Songwriter and Pancho Villa's Wedding Day. Songwriter, starring Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, was released by Tri-Star. Yet again, however, marketing mishaps and neglect doomed the work to near-oblivion, despite being well-received by the critics. Pancho Villa's Wedding Day was a movie script (under various versions and titles) that Shrake turned into a stage play. The play had two successful runs in Austin that year, first at the Zachary Scott Theatre then at the Austin Opry House.
That same year a doctor warned Shrake that he would have to clean up his lifestyle or he would be dead within six months. Shrake decided he better follow the doctor's orders, and in 1985 he returned to fiction again. His epic novel about the Republic of Texas, titled "Plum Creek," had been put aside due to lack of publisher interest. Instead he worked on a novel (Night Never Falls) about an alter-ego foreign correspondent who finds himself at Dien Bien Phu and revolutionary Algeria, among other locals. Shrake made a pact with himself to not only write the book without drinking booze, smoking cigarettes or snorting cocaine, but to not even mention Texas in it. Random House published the book in 1987. Then good friend Willie Nelson proposed something new: help him write Nelson's autobiography. Bud set out interviewing numerous acquaintances of Willie's, as well as Willie himself, and crafted a book that was told from both subject's and acquaintances' perspectives. Simon & Schuster published Willie in 1988, and it quickly became a best-seller. Bud Shrake had his first commercial hit on his hands, and it wouldn't be his last, or his biggest.
Another as-told-to biography immediately followed in 1990, this time of football coach Barry Switzer. The book was another best-seller, but it wasn't until Harvey Penick's Little Red Book, published in 1993, that Shrake really hit the big-time. As with Willie and Barry, Harvey was Bud's longtime friend who had a book deal and asked Shrake to collaborate with him. In this case, what Bud was working with was Harvey's lifetime of golfing wisdom, rather than his life story. The resulting Little Red Book was an instant phenomenon among golfers and became the best-selling sports book of all time. Three sequels quickly followed, along with an anthology and a boundless number of spin-off products.
Meanwhile, another movie collaboration with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson was completed, this time for television. Another Pair of Aces, based on a script titled "RIP," co-written with Cartwright and dating back to the seventies, was produced in Austin and aired on CBS. Having been divorced from Doatsy for about ten years by now, Shrake became serious with old friend Ann Richards, shortly before she was elected governor of Texas in 1990. Bud accompanied Ann to many state functions during her four-year tenure. They remained close friends and companions until her death in 2006.
His foray into non-fiction having paid-off handsomely, Shrake returned once again to his first love, fiction. In 1996 he dusted off the "Plum Creek" novel after having let it sit untouched for almost 15 years. Numerous name changes and rewrites followed, and The Borderland was finally published, by Hyperion, in 2000. The next year Scribner published Billy Bud, a shorter, coming-of-age novel about a young golfer in 1950s Fort Worth.
In 2002, Shrake's writing returned to the stage, this time in London for Benchmark, a collaborative effort with stage writer and director Michael Rudman, another long-time friend. Starting around 2005, Shrake worked on a play eventually titled The Friend of Carlos Monzon, based on his experience in prison in Argentina in 1972 while on assignment there for Sports Illustrated. This play eventually was performed posthumously as an experimental, multi-media stage reading in 2010 at the Long Center in Austin. Also in the mid-2000s and in collaboration with Rudman, came Jack, a play set in Jack Ruby's nightclub in Dallas the night after the JFK assassination. To date, this play has yet to be produced.
While recuperating from kidney-removal surgery in late 2001, Shrake died and had an out-of-body experience with silent visitors who took him away, before being revived by hospital personnel. This life-changing experience would resurface in what would become his last-published novel, Custer's Brother's Horse. Set amid the chaos of post-Civil-War Texas, the book completed a trilogy of early Texas history that Shrake had written, with The Borderland and Blessed McGill being the other two. Another late-period novel that Shrake completed was a pseudo-memoir called "Malibu Zulu," written under a pen name and based on his experiences in Hollywood while working with Steve McQueen on Tom Horn. This novel was published in 2020 as Hollywood Mad Dogs as part of The Wittliff Collections Literary Series.
Shrake enjoyed a double round of press attention with Custer's Brother's Horse in late 2007 and Land of the Permanent Wave in the spring of 2008, an anthology of his writing that covers his entire career. In the fall of 2008, Shrake found out he had inoperable lung cancer. Over the past seven years he had beaten cancer twice before, so he began chemo treatment optimistically, and true to form, kept busy writing. He was working on a crime caper set in Fort Worth and Mexico in the 1950s at the time, but his health quickly deteriorated from the chemo, and he passed away on May 8, 2009. He is buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, next to Ann Richards.
Although Shrake enjoyed the respect of critics and peers from New York to Hollywood, his talents have been most recognized by those in his home state. In 1987 he received a star on the Texas Walk of Fame, in Austin, along with Jenkins, Cartwright and Larry L. King. Later in life, he received two awards for his career in letters: the Texas Bookend Award from the Texas Book Festival, in 2002, and the Lon Tinkle Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Institute of Letters, in 2003.
In 2004, TCU Press published The Wittliff Collections' curator Steven L. Davis' Texas Literary Outlaws, a biography of Shrake, Cartwright, King, Jenkins, Billy Lee Brammer and Peter Gent. The book also serves as an invaluable chronicle and critique of these six men's literary achievements and intertwining friendships. In the concluding chapter, Davis addresses Shrake's talents and legacy:
"Shrake's refusal to be typecast alienated New York publishers because it kept them from building a market for his work. But the artistry apparent in each novel endures. The relative paucity of critical attention on Bud Shrake has deflected understanding of the sophisticated narrative techniques employed in his best work" (Texas Literary Outlaws, p. 455).
Davis then goes on to highlight what he considers Shrake's four best novels, and contends they deserve to stand beside the works of celebrated writers like Terry Southern, Leslie Marmon Silko, Ken Kesey and Kurt Vonnegut.
Many of Shrake's early books have been republished and remain in print to this day. Blessed McGill and Strange Peaches were both republished by Texas Monthly Press in 1987, and again by John M. Hardy Publishing Company in 2007. But Not For Love got a second chance by TCU Press in 2000. Limo was also republished in 2000, by Duane Press. Willie, The Borderland, Billy Boy, and the Harvey Penick books remain in print.
As for his films, J.W. Coop, Nightwing, Tom Horn and Songwriter are all available on DVD, Shortly before he passed away, Shrake recorded a commentary track with Gary Cartwright for an American DVD release of Kid Blue.
A.C. Greene named Blessed McGill in 1981 as one of Texas' fifty best books, describing it as having "an appreciation for the absurdities of existence, a recognition of irony's major role in the world, [and] highly suggestive humor" (Texas Monthly, Aug. 1981). The same compliment could be said for much of Shrake's work through the years, whether writing about crime on the police beat in Fort Worth, boxers and poker players on assignment for Sports Illustrated, filthy-rich and eccentric Dallasites in his novels, old-west and country-music outlaws in his movies, or a famous country singer, a football coach and a golf guru in his non-fiction.

Playwright Preston Jones is best remembered for A Texas Trilogy, an evocative depiction of small town Texas life. Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on April 7, 1936, Preston developed an interest in the dramatic arts while attending the University of New Mexico. Though he graduated with a BA in education in 1960 and took a teaching position, drama professor Eddie Snapp continued to encourage Preston to study theater and steered him toward Baylor University in Waco, Texas. At the time, the Baptist school's Drama Department was headed by Snapp's former Yale classmate, Paul Baker, a nationally known figure in regional and experimental theater. Preston applied successfully to Baylor and while waiting to enroll, worked for the highway department in Colorado City, Texas, the place that later formed the basis for Bradleyville, the setting for A Texas Trilogy.
Preston completed his coursework at Baylor but before he could receive his degree, Paul Baker and the Baylor University administration had a falling out over the production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night. Baker moved his entire department to Trinity University in San Antonio in 1963 and Preston followed, receiving his Master's there in 1966. His thesis was a dramatization of the novel by David Grubb, The Night of the Hunter.
In 1959, Paul Baker became director of the newly formed Dallas Theater Center (DTC), which he headed in conjunction with his position as a drama department chairman. Baker invited Preston to join the DTC during his first year as a student at Baylor thus beginning the association with an important regional theater that lasted until the end of his life. In line with Baker's philosophy of non-specialization, Preston performed all duties in the theater: actor, director, stage manager, ticket taker, etc. As an actor, he appeared in Julius Caesar, Journey to Jefferson, Medea, A Streetcar Named Desire, What Price Glory, and The Girl of the Golden West. He played the stage manager in Our Town and Henry Drummond in Inherit the Wind. Preston's directing projects included Under the Yum-Yum Tree, Barefoot in the Park and The Knack. Preston was to credit this varied experience in the theater for his success in writing material for the stage.
It was through the Dallas Theater Center that Preston met his second wife, Mary Sue Birkhead Fridge. The two worked together in many Dallas Theater productions where Mary Sue was assistant director to Paul Baker as well as a popular actress and designer. Mary Sue, for her part, provided Preston with encouragement and support in his writing endeavors. Preston's admiration for his wife's talent was oft expressed. "I never belonged on the same stage as that woman," he told John Anders of the Dallas Morning News (July 5, 1992).
In 1972, Baker appointed Preston managing director of Down Center Stage, a smaller workshop theater in the Center. Jones wished to provide a stage for new works but the lack of good material inspired him to begin writing what became the Trilogy. The first of the three plays, The Knights of the White Magnolia, premiered at the Down Center Stage on December 4, 1973. Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander followed on February 5, 1974 and The Oldest Living Graduate in November of that year. Baker chose Knights and LuAnn (Graduate had not yet been completed) along with other original plays by resident playwrights to be presented in a spring showcase, Playmarket 74. Producers, agents and critics from around the world were invited to view these works, among them literary agent Audrey Wood and director Alan Schneider. Wood, who had discovered, among others, Tennessee Williams and William Inge, became Preston's agent and Schneider eventually directed the Trilogy in Washington, D. C. and New York City. In 1975, the three plays were performed together for the first time on the main stage of the Dallas Theater Center under the title, The Bradleyville Trilogy. That same year the American Playwright's Theater, which promotes the production of new works in theaters around the country, chose Knights as one of their offerings. In 1976, the renamed A Texas Trilogy played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. to popular and critical acclaim. Preston received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to write a play for the American bicentennial and the Golden Apple Award from Cue magazine. After these initial successes, the Trilogy opened September 1976 on Broadway to a lukewarm response, closing after three weeks.
Preston returned to Dallas reassuming the varied tasks required of members of the company but by no means resting on his laurels as a playwright. His A Place on the Magdalena Flats played at the Dallas Theater Center in 1976 while the Trilogy wound its way from Washington to New York. Santa Fe Sunshine premiered at the Dallas Theater Center April 9, 1977. That same year, Preston won the Outer Critics Circle Award for the Trilogy and staged a tribute to Lady Bird Johnson on her 65th birthday. In 1978, Preston created the one-act Juneteenth for the Actors' Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, forming the plot around Black Texans' annual celebration of emancipation. This play was later presented with other one-acts on PBS's "Earplay" series under the title Holidays. In 1979, Remember was on the boards. While working on rewrites, Preston was also crafting a screenplay of the Trilogy for producer Hal Wallis.
Preston was slated to appear as the Duke of Norfolk in the Dallas Theater Center's production of A Man For All Seasons under Mary Sue's direction when he was suddenly taken ill and hospitalized. He died September 9, 1979 after surgery on a bleeding ulcer.

Born August 6, 1920 in Fort Worth, Texas, John Alexander Graves III grew up in that city until moving away to attend college in 1938. He graduated from Rice Institute (now Rice University) with a B.A. in English in 1942, then entered the Marine Corps and served in the Pacific theater until being wounded by a Japanese grenade on the island of Saipan. After the service, Graves traveled to Mexico for a few months then attended Columbia University, earning an M.A. in English from there in 1948. He began his professional writing career while still a graduate student by publishing a short story, titled "Quarry," in The New Yorker in 1947.
Graves taught English from 1948 to 1950 at The University of Texas at Austin, but left academia and Texas behind to spend a year freelance writing in New York City. From January 1953 to July 1955 he spent abroad, living mostly in Spain, including the Canary Islands for some months on a resident colony of writers and artists. During these years he wrote articles for publications like Holiday and Town and Country but also worked on fiction, including a semi-autobiographical novel, The Spotted Horse. Graves concentrated on finishing the novel after returning to the United States, but his agent rejected the final manuscript and Graves soon came to realize the novel was not publishable as a whole.
In the spring of 1957 Graves returned home to help care for his ill father. In November of that year, Graves completed a three-week canoe trip down part of the Brazos River that he feared was about to be changed forever by dams. His narrative chronicle of the trip was first published as a magazine article in Holiday, and later Graves added history, philosophy and folklore which resulted in his first major book, Goodbye to a River (1960). The book attracted national attention and critical praise for its original style. It won the Carr P. Collins Award of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1961 and was nominated for a National Book Award that year. In the meantime, Graves took a teaching job at Texas Christian University, married Jane Cole (his second marriage) and purchased the first of his limestone acres in Somervell County near the town of Glen Rose.
After three years assisting in and writing for a U.S. government study of pollution of the Potomac River, Graves returned to Texas and focused on converting his country acreage from a weekend getaway into a permanent home with a manageable farm and cattle ranch. In that time he also contributed to journals, magazines and books with introductions, articles, and essays‚Äîwork that has continued to the present day. His observations and ruminations about his relationship with the land as a farmer and rancher led to the publication of his second major book, Hard Scrabble: Observations on a Patch of Land (1974). Hard Scrabble describes both the promise and adversity of country life, touching on subjects like animals, tools, construction, weather, water, ecology, agriculture, and migrant workers.
Starting in 1976, Graves again focused on life in the country in a series of essays that were published in Texas Monthly magazine. The essays examined topics such as fences, meat, tobacco, cows, chickens, dogs, and bees, and were collected and published for Graves' third major book, From a Limestone Ledge: Some Essays and Other Ruminations about Country Life in Texas (1980). Some essays follow up topics which he discussed in Hard Scrabble, but all focus on the "more or less country things which came to interest" Graves. From a Limestone Ledge was nominated for an American Book Award.
Although Graves has not published an extensive number of books, his contributions to magazines, books and anthologies spans over five decades. He has written introductions and narratives for a number of books and reports, often on Texas history and Texas environment, such as Cowboy Life on the Western Plains, Texas Heartland: A Hill Country Year and The Water Hustlers. Two of Graves' most famous magazine pieces, "The Last Running" and "Blue & Some Other Dogs," later became their own books, published first by Encino Press. Another well-received essay, "Recollections of a Texas Bird Glimpser," written for the art book, Of Birds and Texas (1986), transformed into a limited edition book, Self-Portrait, With Birds (1991).
In 1996 the University of Texas Press published A John Graves Reader, which gathered together fiction and non-fiction pieces, both published and unpublished, including a long, reworked excerpt from his failed novel, The Spotted Horse. More recently, Graves wrote text for the photography books Texas Rivers (2002) and Texas Hill Country (2003), and in 2004 Knopf published his memoir, Myself and Strangers, which focused on his years abroad as a freelance writer.
John Graves is one of the most important Southwestern writers. Three of his early short stories were collected in the O. Henry award series. He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1963 and a Rockefeller fellowship in 1972. Numerous awards and recognitions have followed him throughout his writing career. Although he is generally considered a regional and nature writer due to his settings and subjects, his style, which incorporates fiction, folklore, autobiography, philosophy, and observation, defies provincial or topical boundaries. Perhaps the best example of this is Goodbye to a River, which has never gone out of print since first being published in 1960, and is still celebrated for its keen ruminations on the historical, attitudinal and natural worlds that intertwined around Graves as he canoed down the river.
Graves was married to the former Jane Cole of New York, and they had two daughters, Helen and Sally. John and Jane lived and worked on Hard Scrabble near Glen Rose until Graves' death in 2013.
Stephen Harrigan was born on October 5, 1948, and grew up in Oklahoma City, Abilene and Corpus Christi. After receiving a degree in English from The University of Texas at Austin in 1971, Harrigan briefly attended graduate school and worked as a yardman and as an ad writer for the University Co-op. He contributed articles to a number of magazines, including Rolling Stone, The Atlantic Monthly, Esquire and The Texas Observer. He became a regular writer for Texas Monthly shortly after its inception and co-founded and edited Lucille, a journal of poetry, which published 10 issues between 1974 and 1978.
Harrigan received a Dobie-Paisano fellowship in 1977, which allowed him to complete his first novel. Aransas, published by Knopf in 1980, tells the story of Jeff Dowling, an alienated young man who comes to terms with himself and the world as he trains two dolphins for a circus in Port Aransas, Texas. The New York Times named the novel one of the notable books of 1980, and reviewers praised its realism and style. His second novel, Jacob's Well, also focused on man's relationship with nature, following the lives of three people who are drawn together to explore an artesian well in Central Texas. The book was named one of the best books of 1984 by The Washington Post and The Dallas Morning News.
Harrigan's recent books, until the publication in 2000 of Gates of the Alamo, have been nonfiction. As a freelance writer and later staff writer and editor for Texas Monthly, Harrigan displayed a talent for journalism, contributing interviews and other investigative pieces, but he also focused on the natural environment, writing about rivers, Big Bend, Padre Island and other Texas landmarks. Many of these essays were collected in Harrigan's third book, A Natural State: Essays on Texas (1988), which was recently republished by the University of Texas Press. His 1992 book Water and Light: A Diver's Journey to a Coral Reef combined research on aquatic life with his own experiences scuba diving off a coral reef in the Caribbean. The New York Times Book Review called Water and Light "moving, intelligent ... literary," and praised Harrigan's "remarkable ability to discuss the metaphysical and spiritual aspects of underwater exploration." Harrigan has also published a book of poetry and written screenplays, one of which, The Last of His Tribe, was broadcast on HBO.
Harrigan's works are characterized by an intense interest in humans and their relationship to the environment around them. He once wrote of his interest in natural subjects: "I don't know what nature is exactly--whether it is a category that includes human beings or shuts them out--but for me it has always contained that hint of eeriness, the sense that some vital information--common knowledge to all the universe--has been specifically withheld from me. Sometimes, as with the snake, this secrecy has seemed malevolent, but far more often it has been wonderfully tantalizing. For much of my life I have been obsessed with nature, but not in the way a naturalist would be obsessed with it--driven to classify, to define relationships, to comprehend the world's marvelous intricacy. I have simply wanted to feel more fully a part of that intricacy, to see something other than neutral scorn in the eyes of that half-imagined snake." (Introduction to A Natural State, UT Press, 1994)
Harrigan lives in Austin with his wife Sue Ellen and three daughters.
Hart Stilwell was born in 1902 in Yoakum, Texas. When he was two, his large family relocated to the Rio Grande Valley, an area they would roam throughout Stilwell's childhood as his father sought undeveloped farmland and the freedom of the frontier. Stilwell's upbringing was marked by psychological and physical conflict with his father, a former Texas Ranger prone to sudden mood-swings and threats of violence.
At the age of seventeen Stilwell entered The University of Texas at Austin, where he worked for The Daily Texan and graduated with a degree in journalism in 1924. One of his first jobs was as a reporter for The Brownsville Herald, a paper he also edited for two years. In the late 1920s Stilwell lost interest in working full-time and turned to free-lance writing, although for the rest of his life he regularly contributed articles to newspapers across Texas, including The San Antonio Light, The Houston Chronicle, and The Austin American-Statesman.
Stilwell's first novel was published in 1945. An indictment of race relations in the Rio Grande Valley, Border Town was narrated by a cynical reporter in love with a Mexican woman who had been raped by a wealthy Anglo businessman. Two years later, Stilwell published his most critically acclaimed novel, Uncovered Wagon, which included a thinly fictionalized account of Stilwell's relationship with his father, called "The Old Man" in the book. Uncovered Wagon was named one of the fifty best books of Texas by A.C. Greene, who wrote "you don't find many Texas writers who can face the bitter reality of rural poverty in a changing society as Stilwell does." Stilwell published a third novel, Campus Town, which was less successful than the others. All of his novels draw heavily from personal experience (Stilwell's daughter called Uncovered Wagon an "autobiography" and said that Stilwell changed names and place names only after his mother objected to the harshness of his narrative) and are marked by a fierce liberalism and hatred of intolerance. Stilwell was also known for his nonfiction. He collaborated with Slats Rogers on Rogers' autobiography and helped write a book on neglected children, titled The Child Who Walks Alone, with his social worker wife, Anne Stilwell. He was an avid sportsman and published two well-known books on hunting and fishing in Texas and Mexico. Field and Stream, Outdoor, Hunting Yearbook, and other outdoor sports magazines also published articles by Stilwell. In the early 1970s he began work on a full-length book on human interference in the natural world; he was particularly concerned about the domestication of wild animals and the increasing use of biological engineering on animals and plants consumed by humans. Stilwell was working on this book, tentatively titled The Great White Immaculate Bird and Other Toys, along with a manuscript on fishing, a children's book on wolves, and a number of short essays when he died on May 13, 1975 in Austin.
Stilwell married twice and had two children. His daughter, Mary Gray Hughes, is also a writer.
Novelist, essayist, and screenwriter Larry McMurtry was born June 3, 1936 in Wichita Falls, Texas. He grew up on a ranch just outside of Archer City and graduated from Archer City High School in 1954. He attended North Texas State University (B.A. 1958), then Rice University (1954, 1958-60, M.A. 1960), and studied for one semester outside of Texas at Stanford University as a Stegner Fellow (1960-61).
McMurtry published his first novels while working as an English instructor at Texas Christian University (1961-62), Rice University (1963-65), George Mason College (1970), and American University, (1970-71). In 1962, he won the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse M. Jones award, and in 1964, he won a Guggenheim grant. In 1970, he bought a rare-book store in Washington D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood, named it Booked Up, and relocated to run the store.¬†A second Booked Up was opened in Archer City, Texas, in 1988.
His first seven novels were all set in Texas, some in the country, some in urban settings. The first three were made into movies. Despite the critical and popular success of "Hud" (Horseman Pass By) and "The Last Picture Show," for which McMurtry wrote the Academy award winning screenplay (1972), he perceived a lack of appropriate recognition for his work in general. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he wore a t-shirt which read "Minor Regional Novelist," to help make this point. McMurtry's urban trilogy, set in contemporary Houston, Moving On (1970), All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers (1972), and Terms of Endearment (1975), all deal with love and marriage, and are examples of McMurtry's ability to consistently create a strong sense of place, characters, and dialogue. Terms of Endearment would later be translated into Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish, and made into a very popular movie by the same name (1983), starring Jack Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine, John Hurt, and Debra Winger. Following this trilogy, McMurtry looked outside of Texas for settings: Somebody's Darling (1978) set in Hollywood, California, Cadillac Jack (1982) set in Washington D.C., and The Desert Rose (1983) set in Las Vegas. These novels involve characters seeking meaning in urban life and were not as critically or commercially successful as McMurtry's novels set in Texas.
In 1985, McMurtry published Lonesome Dove, the story of two ex-Texas Rangers who take on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana. This novel won McMurtry a Pulitzer Prize, as well as widespread critical and commercial success. The novel was brought to the small screen in 1989, in a very popular television mini-series of the same name, making McMurtry even more of a household name. Since writing Lonesome Dove, McMurtry has continued to write novels set in both contemporary and historical Texas with characters grappling with old and new lifestyles and values. These novels have been commercially successful, although not to the same degree as Lonesome Dove. McMurtry announced that he would retire from novel writing with the 1999 novel Duane's Depressed, however he published a biography on Crazy Horse and an autobiographical reminiscence, Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen, in the same year.
McMurtry passed away March 25, 2021.
Sterling VanWagenen produced "The Trip to Bountiful" with screenwriter Horton Foote. VanWagenen was a co-founder of the United States Film Festival and the Sundance Institute, and served as the executive director of the latter organization for five years. He is also known as a director of stage and screen, and he has produced both films and documentaries. He currently heads the Leucadia Film Corporation in Salt Lake City, Utah.
"The Trip to Bountiful" was first written in 1953 by Horton Foote for the "Philco/Goodyear Television Playhouse," and starred Lillian Gish. A longer version opened eight months later on Broadway to critical acclaim. Thirty years later, Peter Masterson, an award-winning actor and director, approached his cousin Horton Foote about making "The Trip to Bountiful" into a movie. Masterson then contacted VanWagenen, who agreed to produce the film. Filming began in the summer of 1985 on location in Texas, and was completed in five weeks. The film starred Geraldine Page (in an Oscar-winning performance), John Heard, Carlyn Glynn, Richard Bradford, and Rebecca De Mornay.
Poet Albert Goldbarth was born on January 31, 1948 in Chicago, Illinois. He earned a B.A. in English from the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in 1969 and a M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa in 1971. Goldbarth began a long teaching career in 1971 at Elgin (Illinois) Community College. His first book of poetry, Coprolites, was published in 1973, followed by Jan. 31 which was nominated in 1975 for the National Book Award), and Opticks in 1974. Also in 1974, Goldbarth began work towards a doctorate in Creative Writing at the University of Utah. Continuing to write and publish poetry throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Goldbarth won two National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowships (1979-1980, 1986-1987), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1984), and two Voertman Poetry Awards from the Texas Institute of Letters (for Different Fleshes in 1980 and for Original Light in 1984). Goldbarth has taught English at Cornell University (1974-1976), Syracuse University (1976-1977), University of Texas at Austin (1977-1987), and at Wichita State University (1987-present).
Alvin Carl Greene (1923-2002) was born and raised in Abilene, Texas. He left Texas during World War II and served in the U.S. Navy and Marines. After a four-year stint in the military, Greene received a B.A. from Abilene Christian College in 1948 and began working as a reporter for the Abilene Reporter-News. He remained on the staff for 12 years and also ran a bookstore in Abilene from 1952 to 1957.
In 1960, Greene joined The Dallas Morning News as book editor and editorial columnist. Eight years later he left to concentrate on writing and received a Dobie-Paisano fellowship which allowed him to finish his acclaimed book, A Personal Country, in 1969. Greene went on to publish many books and articles in the 1970s and 1980s. The range of Greene's writing has been very broad, although he is closely tied to the subject of Texas. His books cover cities in Texas, historical events in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, personal reminiscences, and literary criticism. He also worked at KERA-TV in Dallas as news commentator from 1970 through 1977 and has reviewed books for the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour. Greene taught journalism at Hardin-Simmons University, The University of Texas at Austin, and Southern Methodist University, and served as Coordinating Director of the Center for Texas Studies at the University of North Texas in Denton.
Health problems in the late 1980s kept him from writing, but after receiving a heart transplant Greene recovered and published a book, Taking Heart, about his illness. Greene was a member of PEN International, the Writers Guild of America, and the Texas Institute of Letters. He passed away in 2002.
Nature photographer James Clinton Bones was born in 1943 in Monroe, Louisiana. Since 1975, Bones has been a freelance photographer and wilderness guide in New Mexico, where he now lives. Bones has published five books of photography, with work included in several others. He has exhibited frequently and has produced environmental documentaries for Texas public television.
J. Frank Dobie, teacher, storyteller, folklorist, historian, and author, was born September 18, 1888 on a ranch in the South Texas brush country of Live Oak County. Raised in the toughening, physically bracing traditions of a remote ranching region, Dobie nonetheless developed an early love for language and literature. His mother encouraged reading, providing her children with mail-ordered books, and his father developed the boy's narrative sense with nightly readings of the King James version of the bible. Dobie's mother saw to it that he and his siblings were sent away to relatives in the small town of Alice so that they could obtain the requisite schooling to pursue higher education.
Dobie received his BA from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas. There, under the influence of Professor Albert Shipp Pegues, he became enthralled by the English romantic poets. There too he met the poetry-loving Bertha McKee, who would become his wife, lifelong companion, adviser, booster and critic. After Dobie received his degree in 1910, he taught at a high school in Alpine, Texas and worked summers as a newspaper reporter. Deciding he wished to teach poetry at a more advanced level than high school, Dobie pursued a Masters at Columbia University. He later admitted to being only a lackluster student who learned more from New York and the New York theater than he did from the university.
Returning to Texas, Dobie joined the English Department of the University of Texas at Austin. In his first year there, he officed with Stith Thompson who introduced him to the organization with which he became so closely identified, the Texas Folklore Society World War I soon wrested Dobie from the classroom and he was sent overseas shortly before the armistice. While he missed the fighting, he took the opportunity to acquaint himself with Europe.
Dobie returned to the University of Texas English Department after his discharge from the army. Still ambivalent about his life's direction, he left UT in 1920 to run an uncle's ranch. The ranching stint was unsuccessful and he returned to teaching, writing his wife that "in the university I am a wild man; in the wilds I am a scholar and a poet" (Tinkle 102). He began to settle on a scholarly pursuit that could make use of both environments. Dobie had enjoyed listening to the stories of one of his uncle's vaqueros, Santos Cortez. "It came to me that I would collect and tell the legendary tales of Texas as Lomax had collected the old-time songs and ballads of Texas and the frontier. I thought that the stories of the range were as interesting as the songs. I considered that if they could be put down so as to show the background out of which they have come they might have high value" (Tinkle 102). From that point, Dobie actively pursued the folk legends of the Southwest in his travels, readings, and writings. Dobie became editor of the Texas Folklore Society in 1921. He took a strong hand in the independent direction of the organization, which still follows the standards he set. Under Dobie, the Texas Folklore Society broke from the practices of the American Folklore Society. The national branch examined the subject from an objective scholarly viewpoint while Dobie and his followers instead collected and presented folklore as a living, breathing, participatory endeavor.
Dobie's second book, Coronado's Children, received national attention and broadened substantially the Texas writer's audience. In 1932, Dobie ventured into broadcasting with the radio program "Longhorn Luke and his Cowboys." He also published articles in magazines and continued to put out his folklore books. He frequently traveled in search of material for his books, and he became a popular speaker on the lecture circuit. In 1939, he began his syndicated newspaper column "My Texas." Successful in each medium, Dobie came to symbolize the essence of Texas in the popular mind.
Through all this activity, Dobie remained based at the University of Texas in Austin.¬†In 1930, he introduced his course Life and Literature of the Southwest, and it became the most popular offering on campus.¬†Its curriculum was copied in universities across the state. Dobie had always had a prickly relationship with the University of Texas based partly on his refusal to seek a PhD and partly on his belief that the Southwest was a sufficient scholarly focus in its own right.¬†In 1943, Dobie left UT to serve a two-year stint as lecturer on American History in Cambridge, England. Upon his return, Dobie jumped right into a heated controversy when he spoke out in defense of Homer Price Rainey, president of the University of Texas, in the fight with the Board of Regents.¬†In 1947, when then University president Theophilus Painter refused to grant Dobie another leave, Dobie resigned with the administration's acquiescence. He remained at his home in the University area and was always associated with the University of Texas though his formal days as a teacher were over.
Dobie endeared himself to the public both through his personality and his brand of tale telling.¬†He boldly used his popularity to speak out on social issues and other causes that captured his attention. An ardent individualist, he constantly railed against censorship, demagogic religiosity, and those who would impede freedom of thought.¬†"I have come to value liberated minds as the supreme good of life on earth" (Some Part of Myself 6). He championed black voting rights in 1945 and supported organized labor's right to strike. He considered certain college departments unsatisfactory as programs of learning. Journalism, he said, was the unctuous elaboration of the obvious. Of education-trained teachers he commented, "I have never encountered one possessed of a first class mind, though I have encountered a few fairly good ones. Many are dull well-meanders, cunning climbers, exponents of the paltry, and, worst of all, duelers of eager searching intelligence--especially of intelligence lodged in teachers not willing to knuckle"¬†(Tinkle 170).
After Dobie's death in September of 1964, his wife Bertha, who had worked so closely with him throughout their life together, saw to the publication of two books under Dobie's name based on his notes.¬†The Dobies had no children of their own but were particularly fond of Bertha's nephew, Edgar Kincaid.¬†Kincaid moved in with the Dobies when he became a student at the University of Texas, and he remained in their Austin house on 26th Street to tend to them in their old age. Kincaid was an avid ornithologist and editor of The Bird Life of Texas (1974).
The Dobie name today is often spoken in the same breath with that of his two University of Texas contemporaries, the historian Walter Prescott Webb and the naturalist Roy Bedichek. The three friends have been titled Texas' intellectual triumvirate and are considered the forerunners to Texas literature. "[They] were living proof that serious persons could do independent cultural work in Texas"¬†(Texas Observer 18).
Joe Frantz remarked that Dobie was "Texas' first liberated mind to achieve a wide audience and the first truly professional writer produced by the state" (Third Coast 1983).¬†Many Texas writers openly credit Dobie with giving them the inspiration not only to be a writer but also to feel comfortable using their home state as a subject. Billy Lee Brammer admitted, "It never occurred to me--ever--until I read Frank Dobie, that I could be a writer. There simply were no writers in Texas" (Texas Observer 21).¬†Fred Gipson confided that he had never realized it was possible to live in Texas and be a writer until Dobie set the example (Austin American Statesman B5). Publisher and screenwriter Bill Wittliff wrote Bertha on Dobie's death that "Dobie was the prime moving force of my life." Bertha and friends established a most fitting memorial to Dobie in light of his contribution to Texas letters, the Dobie-Paisano fellowship. The award provides money for writers and artists to work on their projects during a six month stay on Dobie's Paisano ranch in the hill country outside of Austin.

Novelist, essayist, and short story writer Rick Bass was born March 7, 1958 in Fort Worth, Texas. He was raised in Houston and graduated with a B.S. in Geology from Utah State University in 1979. Employed as a petroleum geologist in Mississippi from 1979 to 1987, Bass has since written full time on environmental issues and the vanishing wilderness. Bass has been an active environmentalist and member of the Sierra Club, Montana Wilderness Association, Cabinet Resources Group, Round River Conservation Studies, and the Yaak Valley Forest Council. He regularly publishes articles in magazines such as Field and Stream, Sports Afield, Gray's Sporting Journal, Outdoor Life, and others. Bass and his wife Elizabeth moved to Montana's Yaak Valley in 1987, where Bass finds the isolation he requires to write.
Describing Bass's storytelling voice, Leigh Tillman Partington writes that Bass tells a story "true, strong, and intimate; the details of his language are lush and pure, providing just the right amount of landscape and inner turmoil. Above all, his stories are about precarious balances: between men and women, children and adults, friends, lovers, and between humans and the natural world. His language reflects that balance. Like Eudora Welty, to whom he is often compared, Bass plays close attention to inner and outer surfaces, watching where and how they meet, and he captures those meeting places on the page" (Contemporary Southern Writers, 1999).
Willie Hugh Nelson was born April 30, 1933. After his parents separated, he and his older sister Bobbie were raised by their musically inclined grandparents in Abbott, Texas. The children were started early on instruments--Bobbie on piano and Willie on guitar. By age 10, Nelson was playing in Central Texas communities with a polka band. After high school and many odd jobs, Nelson sold his songs "Family Bible" and "Night Life" and made his way to Nashville in order to establish himself in the cradle of country music. Nelson's talents were quickly recognized by other Nashville artists. They recorded his songs and helped him to get jobs. But Nelson's own recordings received little notice by the public. When promoter Crash Stewart told him his lyrics were ahead of his time he answered that "he wished the world would hurry and catch up with him as he needed the money" (Family Album). After a little more than 10 years struggling in Nashville, Nelson's ranch house burned to the ground and he decided to return to his home state.
In 1971, back in Central Texas, Nelson found himself suddenly in the right place at the right time. Nelson's eclectic style and warm stage presence found a receptive audience in a music scene that came to be labeled progressive country. At a time when a suit, a tie, and a clean-shaven face were the signature look of the country and western singer, Nelson adopted the more informal style of the younger members of his audience--long hair, beard, jeans, and a bandanna. A Nashville colleague told him "No one ever heard of you till you got ugly." In 1973, Nelson held his first annual 4th of July picnic in Dripping Springs, Texas and the sweltering Independence Day celebrations became a huge event into the 1980s. During these years, Nelson became a nationally successful country and western singer who secured his status as a popular mainstream artist with the 1975 release of the concept album, The Redheaded Stranger.
Established as a major star in the music world, Nelson then branched into acting beginning with a small part in The Electric Horseman (1979). He starred in his next film, Honeysuckle Rose (1980), which was co-written by fellow Texan Bill Wittliff. The two collaborated again in Barbarosa (1982) and in the dramatization of Nelson's album Red Headed Stranger (1986).
In 1985, Nelson's concern for failing family farms led him to organize Farm Aid concerts in which he and other entertainers raised money to help small farmers keep their land. The effort provided welcome relief to thousands but did not stem the tide of disappearing family farms. By 1995, with seven Farm Aid concerts behind him, Nelson commented "all the money we raise these days is going to farmers who are already out of business. The [agribusiness] corporations are the only guys making money" (Parade, August 20, 1995, 14).
Nelson found himself owing the Internal Revenue Service millions in back taxes for the years from 1975 through 1981 due to what he avowed was bad advice and bad investments. In 1990, much of Nelson's property was seized and auctioned off. Nelson's friends and fans helped him by taking up collections and buying up his property so that he would be able to eventually buy it back. Nelson committed himself to paying off the monumental debt of taxes, interest, and penalties. He worked hard, doing a full schedule of road shows and selling an album, Who'll buy My Memories: The I.R.S. Tapes, through an 800 number. By mid-1994, Nelson had settled his obligation.
Nelson has recorded a prodigious body of work including the best selling albums Shotgun Willie (Atlantic, 1973), Phases and Stages (Atlantic, 1974), Red Headed Stranger (Columbia, 1975), The Outlaws (RCA, 1976), Stardust (Columbia 1978), Waylon and Willie (RCA, 1978), Honeysuckle Rose (Columbia, 1980), The Highwaymen (Columbia, 1985) and Across the Borderline (Columbia, 1991). He has received many honors and numerous awards throughout his career. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Association Hall of Fame in 1973. In 1975, he received his first Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain." In 1978, he received the same award for "Georgia on My Mind." In 1976, the Country Music Association named Wanted: The Outlaws the album of the year and "Good Hearted Woman" the single of the year. The CMA awarded him the coveted Entertainer of the Year award in 1979. He received a Grammy for the Best Country Song for "On the Road Again" in 1981 and the Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 1989. He was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame in 1993. Now in his sixties, a recognized living legend, the singer/songwriter continues to perform, write songs, and record. "All I do is make music and play golf and I wouldn't want to give up either one" (Contemporary Musicians 173).
C. W. Smith was born in Corpus Christi, March 28, 1940. Currently a professor of English at Southern Methodist University, Smith has been a reporter, critic, screenwriter and novelist. He was a Dobie-Paisano Fellow from 1974 to 1975 and President of the Texas Institute of Letters from 1981 to 1983. He has won the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse Jones Award for best novel in 1973 and the Stanley Walker Award for Journalism in 1985. He has written for magazines and journals including the Dallas Times Herald, Esquire, and Mademoiselle.
Robert Flynn was born April 12, 1932, in Chillicothe, Texas. He graduated with a degree in drama from Baylor University in 1954. After teaching speech and drama for two years at Gardner-Webb College in North Carolina, Flynn returned to Baylor as an assistant professor in the Drama Department. When the Baptist university closed down the 1962 production of Long Days Journey Into Night, Flynn followed the entire drama faculty, headed by department chair Paul Baker, to Trinity University, where Flynn continues to hold a position in the English Department as writer-in-residence.
In 1964, Flynn adapted William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying to the stage in a play entitled Journey to Jefferson. The Dallas Theater Center Production directed by Paul Baker won a Special Jury Award at the Theater of Nations in Paris in 1964. In 1967, Knopf published Flynn's first novel, North to Yesterday, a hilarious trail driving adventure that is "at the same time . . . an ungentle satire on the foolishness of those who live in the past as well as the blindness of those who turn their backs on it."(Garfield 38). This was followed by two other works published by Knopf In the House of the Lord (1969), The Sounds of Rescue, the Signs of Hope (1970), and by Wanderer Springs (1987), published by Texas Christian University Press. Flynn has published two collections of short stories, Seasonal Rain (1986), and Living with the Hyenas (1995).
Flynn had temporarily dropped out of college to serve two years with the Marines during the Korean War. In 1970 after many years in academia, he sought out a position as a war correspondent to Vietnam, eventually getting his credentials through True Magazine. Flynn spent two months in Vietnam and was profoundly affected by the experience. He ultimately wrote a memoir, A Personal War in Vietnam, published in 1989 and a novel, The Last Klick, published in 1994.
Two stories in Seasonal Rain were winners in the NEA/PEN Syndicated Fiction Project. Wanderer Springs won a Spur Award from Western Writers of America and North to Yesterday won a Western Heritage Wrangler Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.

Bill Wittliff was born in Taft, a small town in south Texas, in 1940. After his parents divorced, he and his brother Jim moved with their mother to Gregory, Texas, where Mrs. Wittliff ran a small telephone office during World War II (these experiences provided the basis for "Raggedy Man," Wittliff's feature film). Later, when his mother remarried, the family moved to a ranch in Blanco, a rural community of 700 in the hill country of central Texas.
In 1964, shortly after graduating from the University of Texas, Wittliff, with his wife Sally, founded a book publishing company, The Encino Press, which specialized in regional material about Texas and the Southwest. To date, Encino has won over 100 awards for quality of design and content. The press operated out of a 19th-century Victorian house in Austin in which O. Henry once lived and wrote.
An accomplished photographer, Wittliff's photographs documenting the life of the Mexican vaquero (taken 1969-71) have been exhibited in numerous galleries and institutions throughout this country and in Mexico, including the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, and the Texas Capitol. In Japan, they represented the United States during its bicentennial year. After twenty years, the exhibit is still shown as a traveling display in the U. S. and Mexico under the auspices of the Institute of Texan Cultures.
At 29, Wittliff was elected to the Texas Institute of Letters. He served as president during 1974-78, and sat on the Executive Council until 1990. In 1993, he was elected Fellow of the Institute. He is a member of the historic Texas Philosophical Society, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences; and he served for six years on the Executive Board of Trustees of Robert Redford's Sundance Institute.
In 1985, with the donation of their lifelong collection of original manuscripts and books, Bill and Sally founded the Southwestern Writers Collection at Southwest Texas State University. Since that time the collection has grown rapidly, supported by donors from all over the country. It features original manuscripts by J. Frank Dobie, John Graves, Larry McMurtry, Walter Prescott Webb, Bud Shrake, Larry L. King, Horton Foote, Preston Jones, Sam Shepard, Willie Nelson, and many others. It also includes paintings by numerous regional artists including William Lester, Tom Lea, John Groth, Jerry Bywaters, Kermit Oliver, Robert Wade. Expanding the scope of the current facility, in 1996 the Wittliffs endowed the Wittliff Gallery of Southwestern and Mexican Photography which already includes works by Russell Lee, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Ansel Adams, Keith Carter, Henri Cartier Bresson, Lola Bravo, Laura Gilpin, Edward Weston, Graciela Iturbide, Edward Curtis, Nacho Lopez, Erwin E. Smith, Marco Antonio Cruz, Jim Bones, Paul Strand, Mariana Yampolsky, and many others. Both collections are housed in eight specially designed rooms and a large, chambered gallery on the top floor of the Albert B. Alkek Library on the university campus.
Jesse Sublett was born May 15, 1954, in Johnson City, Texas. He was valedictorian of Johnson City's LBJ High School Class of 1972, and attended Southwest Texas State University from 1972-1974 as an English major.
From 1974 until 1986 Sublett lived in Austin, where he played a dominant role in defining the live music scene as bass player and/or lead singer for a number of bands, most notably The Skunks, who recorded three records between 1978 and 1983.
During this time, Sublett began writing short pieces for the Austin Chronicle, including record and restaurant reviews, and in 1984 he was assigned to write a short piece on the club circuit which bands like The Skunks played. Instead, he submitted a semi-parodic music mystery entitled "Traveling the Hardboiled Highway," which imitated the style of a hardboiled detective novel. This marked the birth of Martin Fender, the central character in Sublett's first three novels. He submitted a second Fender piece, "The Nature of the Crime," which the Chronicle's editorial staff declined to publish but which they encouraged him to re-work as a novel. After finishing the re-titled Capitol Crimes, he wrote Rock Critic Murders with the intention of selling the two novels as a series. While waiting for the attention of publishers on the first two books, he began work on a third novel, Blunt Instrument. In 1987 he moved to Los Angeles in order to be closer to the spirit of his hero Raymond Chandler. He continued to play music on the West Coast while awaiting responses from publishers and re-writing Blunt Instrument. Shortly thereafter, Lisa Kaufman at Viking took an interest in his work and agreed to publish Rock Critic Murders. Sublett has written several screenplays, and served as story editor for the Disney series Adventures of the Old West. During 1994-1995 he ventured into nonfiction, writing a history of the Texas Turnpike Authority.
Sublett now lives in Austin with his wife Lois Richwine, their son Dashiell, and two cats.
Bill Crawford and Joe Nick Patoski have been involved in writing and the music industry for most of their adult lives. From 1990 to 1993, they combined their literary talents and connections with the music industry insiders to write an unauthorized biography of blues guitar legend Stevie Ray Vaughan (1954-1990), who died in a helicopter accident near East Troy, Wisconsin. In spring 1993, Little, Brown & Co. published Crawford and Patoski's Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire. Michael Pietsch provided editorial assistance.
Born in New York City in 1955, Bill Crawford attended Andover and Harvard, where he majored in comparative religion. He moved to Texas after graduation and became involved in radio. He worked as a disc jockey at a music station in Midland and later earned a masters degree in business administration at the University of Texas at Austin. A freelance writer and radio and television producer since 1981, Crawford has produced segments for Music Television and the nationally syndicated public affairs program, Asian Communique. He was an associate editor of Third Coast magazine, and has written on media and business for Texas Business, Texas Monthly, and other publications. He was co-author of the book, Border Radio: Quacks, Yodelers, Pitchmen Psychics, and Other Amazing Broadcasters of the American Airwaves, published by Texas Monthly Press in 1987.
Joe Nick Patoski moved with his family to Fort Worth in 1953, at the age of two. He attended the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he began his career as a writer and consultant in the music business in 1972. Starting as a columnist with the Daily Texan, the newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin, Patoski soon earned a reputation as one of the most respected critics of pop culture in the Southwest. He worked as a stringer for Rolling Stone from 1974 to 1980, and as contributing editor for Texas Monthly from 1975 to 1980. During the early 1980s, Patoski was the manager and executive producer for several top Texas rock and roll bands, and toured the United States, Europe, and South America. In 1985, Patoski was named an associate editor at Texas Monthly. In October 1990, he wrote an article for Texas Monthly commemorating Stevie Ray Vaughan. Patoski has written on various other topics, covering the entire range of Texas cultures. His work has also appeared in Mother Jones, Village Voice, and Conde Nast Traveler, as well as numerous other publications.
Perhaps best known for her bestselling historical romance novel, Love Is a Wild Assault, Elithe Hamilton Kirkland was also a poet, songwriter, playwright, schoolteacher, and journalist. She was born a third generation Texan in 1907, in Coleman, Texas. Both sets of her grandparents were pioneers. Her father was a farmer, and Ms. Kirkland grew up riding a horse to Coleman's one teacher schoolhouse. She was very active in her high school years, participating in the Silver Valley School District debate team, and graduating as Salutatorian in 1924. She then went on to study English and history at North Texas State University, in Denton, Texas, where she received her B.A. and her Teacher's Certificate in 1928.
Kirkland then began her career in writing and teaching with a series of jobs which included teaching high school and writing for newspapers, often at the same time, through the 1930s. From 1928-1929, Kirkland taught high school English, drama, and journalism at Mineral Wells, Texas. At the Coleman Democrat-Voice, Coleman, TX, from 1929-1930, she edited news, features, the editor's front page column, and headlines, many of which dealt with the oil boom and bank robberies. In 1930, Kirkland served as Features writer for the Brady Standard, Brady, TX, researching and photographing major farm and ranch projects in McCulloch County. Also during this time period, from 1930-1932, she taught high school English and journalism in Crane, TX, a ranching center and oil boom town. In 1935, Kirkland served as the Austin correspondent for the Dallas based Texas Weekly. From 1935-1936, she was the State Director of School Publicity (for the Texas Commission for Centennial Celebrations), authoring pamphlets on Texas history and editing the songbook, Songs Texas Sings. From 1937-1939, she was a high school teacher in the State Laboratory School, Iraan, TX, teaching speech arts, journalism, and script writing for radio. Also while at Iraan, she was state correspondent in West Texas for the Fort Worth Star Telegram, writing news stories, often centering on the oil boom.
In 1931, Kirkland married Roy Folk Beal, an interior decorator. A year later, Kirkland's only son was born, James Benjamin Beal. This marriage ended in divorce in 1936. During the summers 1938 of 1939, and during the long term 1939-1940, she was Curriculum Assistant in Department of Educational Administration at the University of Texas at Austin, working with the state on high school curriculum revision. She also attended UT Austin, studying under J. Frank Dobie, and writing a folk-drama series for the Texas State (Radio) Network which was narrated by Dobie. In 1940, she earned a Masters degree from UT Austin in English and Educational Administration.
In the 1940s, Kirkland continued her work as a print journalist, and became very involved in radio journalism. She was the Austin correspondent for the business and financial section of the The Dallas Times Herald, also writing business articles under the name L.E. Hamilton.
From 1940-1947, she was a script writer and acting director for UT Austin's radio department, Radio House, and wrote more than 500 dramatic documentaries for state and national radio networks, many of which were broadcast live from the studios on campus. At the time, Radio House was considered the only complete radio production facility in the southwest. Kirkland traveled to Mexico, among other places, to pursue stories. It was during her tenure at Radio House that Kirkland covered the story of Nazi intrigue surrounding Peck Woodside, an American pilot and businessman in Mexico, a story she would return to again and again over the years.
In 1944, she was the associate editor of Southwest Review, a quarterly publication of University Press in Dallas at Southern Methodist University.
In 1946, she wrote educational film scripts for the Commission on Motion Pictures in New Haven, Conn., including the films "Now is the Seedtime", on Tom Paine, and "Man with a Mission", on Samuel Gompers. In 1948, she married Dr. R. D. (Roy Defoe) Kirkland, an osteopathic surgeon. Also in this year, she mailed her short story "The Realm of Silence" to Pearl Buck, who praised it but described it as ahead of its time and not yet commercially viable. In fact, this story did not come to light until 1984, when it was published as the ending of her novel, The Edge of Disrepute.
As she turned her attention toward creative writing, Kirkland chose Evelyn Oppenheimer, of Dallas, as her literary agent. Oppenheimer helped direct Kirkland to writing historical romance, a genre in which Kirkland would write bestselling novels. Two of these were published in the 1950s, Divine Average(1952) and Love Is A Wild Assault, (1959), the latter being included in A. C. Greene's The 50 Best Books on Texas.
A prolific writer, Kirkland also wrote short stories, songs, poetry, musical dramas, speeches, and television scripts, on a variety of subjects. While her novels tended to be historical romances set in the Republic of Texas era, her other work reflects her broad interests in folk traditions and in the future. She described herself as a "futurist", and often wrote about space travel and parapsychology. She was a member of the Texas State Historical Association, and the national non-denominational Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship of Laymen and Clergymen. In 1982, her short story involving alien kidnapping, The Disappearance of Widow Ellen, was published in a collection of short stories by Texas women writers called Her Work, (Bryan, Texas: Shearer Publishing, 1982).
In 1984, Kirkland's last novel, The Edge of Disrepute, was published. In the next year, her husband, Dr. R.D. Kirkland, passed away, and she moved out of Austin to Wimberley. She published "Leet's Christmas", a Christmas short story including songs and verse. Kirkland remained a very sought after speaker, speaking around the state on the "Texas Voices" program for the Texas Sesquicentennial, as well as for groups such as Daughters of the American Revolution, MENSA, East Texas State University, and Western Writers of America.
In January 1987, her musical drama entitled Precious Memories was performed at the White Elephant in Fort Worth, TX, in collaboration with the Hip Pocket Theater and the Salt Lick Foundation. Kirkland wrote both the drama and lyrics, and acted as narrator. Shortly thereafter, her musical drama, Hear the Flute: An Untold Story of the Civil War in the Western Territories, was performed. Kirkland wrote the script and lyrics, Conrad Fath wrote the music.
On Nov. 12, 1987, Kirkland was inducted into Texas Women's Hall of Fame, one of many honors she received during her lifetime. Kirkland died at her home in Wimberly on Jan. 2, 1992, and was buried in her family cemetery at the David Allen Ranch known as "New Tracks", near the Blanco River, in Kyle, Texas.
Katherine Anne Porter, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winning author, was born Callie Russell Porter in Indian Creek, Texas, in 1890. She was one of five children. Her mother, Mary Alice Jones Porter, died during childbirth in 1892, leaving the Porter children to be raised by their father, Harrison Boone Porter. Mr. Porter took the children to Kyle, Texas, in his native Hays County, to live with him and his mother, Catherine Anne Skaggs Porter. The young Ms. Porter attended Kyle public schools. The family was very poor, but her grandmother proved to be a very strong and resourceful woman, making a deep impression on Ms. Porter. In 1901, when Ms. Porter was eleven years old, her grandmother died. Not long afterwards, in 1904, the family moved to San Antonio, where Ms. Porter attended the Thomas School. She studied acting at this time, and performed in several summer stock productions.
In 1906, at sixteen, Porter married John Henry Koontz of Inez, Texas. Mr. Koontz' family was Roman Catholic, and Ms. Porter converted to that faith in 1908. The marriage did not last. Ms. Porter left Mr. Koontz and Texas in 1914, heading north to Chicago to pursue her interests of writing and acting. Apparently it was around this time that she took her grandmother's name, Katherine Anne. The divorce from Mr. Koontz became final in 1915, the same year in which she became very ill with tuberculosis. She returned to Texas, recovered from her illness, and in 1917, worked for the Fort Worth Critic, covering theatrical and social events. Soon afterwards, in 1918, Ms. Porter moved to Denver, Colorado, not to return to Texas for close to fifteen years. In Denver, she reviewed books and theatrical performances for the Rocky Mountain News. During this period she became nearly fatally ill with an influenza which was sweeping the nation. This experience with grave illness served as the background for her short novel, Pale Horse, Pale Rider.
During 1919-1920, she worked in New York City as publicist for a motion picture company, wrote stories for the children's magazine Everyland, and met several Mexican artists who encouraged her to write journalistic works on Mexico. She traveled to Mexico for the first time in 1920, during the time of the Obregon Revolution, and she made many more trips to Mexico during the 1920s. Her first published short story, "Maria Concepcion", appeared in 1922, and was soon followed by other short stories and essays, poetry and book reviews. She was married briefly to Ernest Stock, an English World War I pilot, from 1925-1926. In 1927, she became very interested in the Sacco and Vanzeti case in Mexico, but she would not publish the story of this experience until 1977, in "The Never-Ending Wrong".
"Flowering Judas", one of her most well known short stories, was published in 1930. She was living in Mexico at this time, and met Eugene Pressly, whom she married in Paris in 1933. Around this time, she returned to Texas for a family visit. She also traveled to Paris and Germany during the turbulent 1930s. In 1936, she moved back to America and finished "Noon Wine" and "Old Mortality", and began work on "Pale Horse, Pale Rider". The next year, she and Mr. Pressly separated. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Porter went to New Orleans and became involved with Albert Erskine of The Southern Review. She and Mr. Erskine were married in April, 1938.
In 1939, J. Frank Dobie's Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver and Porter's Pale Horse, Pale Rider were both nominated for fiction awards by the Texas Institute of Letters. Dobie won the prize, leaving Ms. Porter feeling insulted and bitter. (Porter was later awarded the Texas Institute of Letters fiction prize for her 1962 novel, Ship of Fools.) In 1940, Porter and Erskine separated, and Ms. Porter moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, to continue her writing, beginning what would become Ship of Fools. In 1945, she began taking work as a Hollywood scriptwriter, and in 1948 began teaching at various universities including Stanford, the University of Michigan, Washington and Lee, and the University of Liege.
In 1958, rumors circulated to the effect that Harry Ransom, of the University of Texas at Austin's Humanities Research Center, was planning to name a building or at least a room for her at the University. Ms. Porter was very enthusiastic about these reported plans, and accepted an invitation to visit the University. She even considered moving to the area, but the agreement with UT fell apart. Ms. Porter was once again disappointed in Texas.
In 1959, Ms. Porter, supported by Ford Foundation grant, moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where she continued to work on Ship of Fools, which was published in 1962.
In 1965, she published The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter, which won a Pulitzer Prize Award. She also received honorary doctorates from many universities, and was very much in demand for lectures and teaching positions. In 1966, she received an honorary degree from the University of Maryland at College Park, and in that same year she made the decision to donate her personal papers and library to UMCP. The university named a room for Ms. Porter, which was opened on May 15, 1968.
In the Spring of 1976, Ms. Porter was again given an opportunity to return to Texas. Dr. Roger Brooks, President of Howard Payne University, in Brownwood (close to Ms. Porter's birthplace), organized a literary conference of Porter scholars. The university also presented Ms. Porter with an honorary degree. Dr. Brooks and Ms. Porter became close friends in the last years of her life, and during this visit, Dr. Brooks took Ms. Porter to visit her mother's and brother's grave in her hometown cemetery. It was at this time that Ms. Porter decided to be buried next to her mother in her home town. Later that year, she suffered a series of strokes. Her last book, "The Never Ending Wrong", an account of the Sacco and Vanzetti case in Mexico, was published in 1977.
Ms. Porter died on September 18, 1980, and she was buried alongside her mother's grave, in the Indian Creek Cemetery, near Brownwood, Texas.
Since Porter's death, her reputation as a "Texas" writer has grown even though she herself had fled the state and felt unappreciated by it. Critic A.C. Greene, writing in The Fifty Best Books on Texas, calls Pale Horse, Pale Rider "the best Texas fiction ever written." Greene also concludes that he "always thought it strange [that] she was so bitter in her disavowal of things Texan but did so many of her best stories with a Texas background." (Greene, A. C. The Fifty Best Books on Texas. Dallas: Pressworks, 1982. p.33
Katherine Anne Porter's return to Texas has now come full circle. A historical marker has been erected in Kyle, Texas, celebrating her career. Her childhood home there has recently been purchased by a preservation group, and the house will be restored for use as a museum and a residence for visiting writers at Texas State University. The 1998 Texas Writers Month poster, hung widely across the state's libraries and bookstores, featured Ms. Porter.

The family was very poor, but her grandmother proved to be a very strong and resourceful woman, making a deep impression on Ms. Porter. In 1901, when Ms. Porter was eleven years old, her grandmother died. Not long afterwards, in 1904, the family moved to San Antonio, where Ms. Porter attended the Thomas School. She studied acting at this time, and performed in several summer stock productions.
In 1906, at sixteen, Porter married John Henry Koontz of Inez, Texas. Mr. Koontz' family was Roman Catholic, and Ms. Porter converted to that faith in 1908. The marriage did not last. Ms. Porter left Mr. Koontz and Texas in 1914, heading north to Chicago to pursue her interests of writing and acting. Apparently it was around this time that she took her grandmother's name, Katherine Anne. The divorce from Mr. Koontz became final in 1915, the same year in which she became very ill with tuberculosis. She returned to Texas, recovered from her illness, and in 1917, worked for the Fort Worth Critic, covering theatrical and social events. Soon afterwards, in 1918, Ms. Porter moved to Denver, Colorado, not to return to Texas for close to fifteen years. In Denver, she reviewed books and theatrical performances for the Rocky Mountain News. During this period she became nearly fatally ill with an influenza which was sweeping the nation. This experience with grave illness served as the background for her short novel, Pale Horse, Pale Rider.
During 1919-1920, she worked in New York City as publicist for a motion picture company, wrote stories for the children's magazine Everyland, and met several Mexican artists who encouraged her to write journalistic works on Mexico. She traveled to Mexico for the first time in 1920, during the time of the Obregon Revolution, and she made many more trips to Mexico during the 1920s. Her first published short story, "Maria Concepcion", appeared in 1922, and was soon followed by other short stories and essays, poetry and book reviews. She was married briefly to Ernest Stock, an English World War I pilot, from 1925-1926. In 1927, she became very interested in the Sacco and Vanzeti case in Mexico, but she would not publish the story of this experience until 1977, in "The Never-Ending Wrong".
"Flowering Judas", one of her most well known short stories, was published in 1930. She was living in Mexico at this time, and met Eugene Pressly, whom she married in Paris in 1933. Around this time, she returned to Texas for a family visit. She also traveled to Paris and Germany during the turbulent 1930s. In 1936, she moved back to America and finished "Noon Wine" and "Old Mortality", and began work on "Pale Horse, Pale Rider". The next year, she and Mr. Pressly separated. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Porter went to New Orleans and became involved with Albert Erskine of The Southern Review. She and Mr. Erskine were married in April, 1938.
During this time began Paul Porter's relationship with his aunt. In 1937, when Mr. Porter was 15 years of age, Ms. Porter visited his family in Houston. One year after this first acquaintance, Paul Porter wrote to his aunt, initiating a vital correspondence which continued until Ms. Porter suffered several strokes in 1976. (For more information regarding the beginnings of the relationship between Ms. Porter and her nephew, see Paul Porter's essay in "Katherine Anne Porter and Texas: An Uneasy Relationship," Texas A&M Univ. Press, 1990.) Throughout their nearly forty years of visits and warm correspondence, Ms. Porter gave Paul Porter books and literary magazines, offering him an education along with her very long letters.
While Ms. Porter's friendship with her nephew grew over the years, her writing career also continued to flourish. In 1939, J. Frank Dobie's Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver and Porter's Pale Horse, Pale Rider were both nominated for fiction awards by the Texas Institute of Letters. Dobie won the prize, leaving Ms. Porter feeling insulted and bitter. (Porter was later awarded the Texas Institute of Letters fiction prize for her 1962 novel, Ship of Fools.) In 1940, Porter and Erskine separated, and Ms. Porter moved to Saratoga Springs, New York, to continue her writing, beginning what would become Ship of Fools. In 1945, she began taking work as a Hollywood scriptwriter, and in 1948 began teaching at various universities including Stanford, the University of Michigan, Washington and Lee, and the University of Liege.
In 1958, rumors circulated to the effect that Harry Ransom, of the University of Texas at Austin's Humanities Research Center, was planning to name a building or at least a room for her at the University. Ms. Porter was very enthusiastic about these reported plans, and accepted an invitation to visit the University. She even considered moving to the area, but the agreement with UT fell apart. Ms. Porter was once again disappointed in Texas.
In 1959, Ms. Porter, supported by Ford Foundation grant, moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where she continued to work on Ship of Fools, which was published in 1962. In 1965, she published The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter, which won a Pulitzer Prize Award. She also received honorary doctorates from many universities, and was very much in demand for lectures and teaching positions. In 1966, she received an honorary degree from the University of Maryland at College Park, and in that same year she made the decision to donate her personal papers and library to UMCP. Paul Porter has also donated significantly to the Katherine Anne Porter papers at UMCP. The university named a room for Ms. Porter, which was opened on May 15, 1968.
In 1976, Ms. Porter suffered a series of strokes. Her last book, "The Never Ending Wrong", an account of the Sacco and Vanzetti case in Mexico, was published in 1977. Ms. Porter died on September 18, 1980. Paul Porter carried her ashes to Indian Creek, which were buried alongside her mother's grave, in the Indian Creek Cemetery, near Brownwood, Texas.
Since Porter's death, her reputation as a "Texas" writer has grown even though she herself had fled the state and felt unappreciated by it. Critic A.C. Greene,
writing in The Fifty Best Books on Texas, calls Pale Horse, Pale Rider "the best Texas fiction ever written." Greene also concludes that he "always thought it strange [that] she was so bitter in her disavowal of things Texan but did so many of her best stories with a Texas background." (Greene, A. C. The Fifty Best Books on Texas. Dallas: Pressworks, 1982. p.33)
Katherine Anne Porter's return to Texas has now come full circle. A historical marker has been erected in Kyle, Texas, celebrating her career. Her childhood home there has recently been purchased by a preservation group, and the house will be restored for use as a museum and a residence for visiting writers at Southwest Texas State University. The 1998 Texas Writers Month poster, hung widely across the state's libraries and bookstores, featured Ms. Porter.
Jovita Gonz√°lez was born near the Texas-Mexico border in Roma, Texas, on January 18, 1904. Her father was a teacher and her mother a housewife. Her family moved to San Antonio so that the children could be educated in English. After high school, Gonz√°lez earned a teaching certificate and taught in Rio Grande City while earning money for college. She attended The University of Texas at Austin for a year, but due to a lack of funds returned to San Antonio to attend Our Lady of the Lake College where she was able to obtain a scholarship. In the summers she continued to study Spanish at The University of Texas, and it was in the summer of 1925 that she met J. Frank Dobie. Dobie shared Gonz√°lez's interest in the folklore of the Texas-Mexican border and encouraged her to write down the stories. She did so, and some were published in the Folklore Publications and the Southwest Review.
Dobie was not only supportive of Gonz√°lez's writing, but he provided references for her scholarships, underwrote bank loans for her, and he and his wife invited her to dinners in their home. Gonz√°lez was also very involved with the Texas Folklore Society which Dobie helped resurrect in 1922. She gave several lectures at the annual meetings and published articles in some of the journals. With Dobie's endorsement, Gonz√°lez was elected to served as the Texas Folklore Society's vice president in 1928, and as president for two terms from 1930 to 1932. After receiving her B.A. from Our Lady of the Lake in 1927, she taught for two years at Saint Mary's Hall, an Episcopal school for girls, until she was awarded the Lapham Scholarship to conduct research along the border and to work on an M.A. at The University of Texas. Her M.A. research resulted in a Rockefeller grant award in 1934. It was during this time that she may have started work on her novel Caballero which was published posthumously in 1996.
While at UT Austin, Gonz√°lez met her future husband, Edmundo E. Mireles.
E. E. Mireles was born in La Ciudad de Hidalgo del Parral, Mexico on December 28, 1905. He was raised by his grandmother in Sacramento, Coahuila, Mexico and came to the United States at the age of seven to live with his father in San Antonio. He later returned to Mexico with his father to fight in the Mexican Revolution, and was wounded. Back in Texas he attended the San Antonio Junior College, and The University of Texas at Austin where he received a B.A., with a Greek major and Latin minor. He obtained his masters in Spanish in 1953 from the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.
E. E. Mireles and Jovita Gonz√°lez were married in 1935 in San Antonio, and then moved to Del Rio where he was principal of San Felipe High School and she taught English. In 1939, they relocated to Corpus Christi where Mr. Mireles organized the Spanish program in the elementary grades of the public schools. Working together, Mr. and Ms. Mireles wrote two sets of books, Mi libro espa√±ol and El espa√±ol elemental, for the teaching of Spanish in the grade schools. In 1943, Mr. Mireles helped to create the Pan American Council dedicated to the study of Spanish, Latin America and its people. The Council supported the public schools in the organization and functioning of their own Pan American Clubs. Mr. Mireles also served as president of the LULAC Council No. 1. Ms. Gonz√°lez Mireles continued until her retirement to teach Spanish and Texas History at W.B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi. During this time she also directed pastorelas, pageants and Christmastime posadas with Mexican children in the community. E. E. Mireles is considered by many to be the father of bilingual education, because of his role as an advocate for teaching Spanish in the public schools of Corpus Christi. Both Mr. and Ms. Mireles continued as educators and advocates of Spanish language teaching in public schools until they retired. Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles died in 1983, and E. E. Mireles died in 1987.
Few scholars took notice of Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles' work until Teresa Palomo Acosta and Cynthia Orozco helped to renew interest in her at the 1990 "Mexican Americans in Texas History" conference in San Antonio. This renewed interest lead to the posthumous publication of her two novels Caballero in 1996 and Dew on the Thorn in 1997. For further information on Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles and Edmundo E. Mireles see Dancing with the Devil: Society and Cultural Poetics by Jos√© E. Lim√≥n, Dew on the Thorn by Jovita Gonz√°lez, and Gente Decente by Leticia Garza-Falc√≥n.
Poet, novelist, playwright, and short story writer Russell G. Vliet was born in Chicago, on November 4, 1929. His father was a Naval medical officer, and the family lived in many parts of the U.S., largely in the south, and in American Samoa. R.G. Vliet attended Central High School (Class of 1948) in Texas City, Texas, just south of Houston, and attended Southwest Texas State University beginning in the Fall of 1948, where he wrote and acted in his own plays. While at the university, he met Vida Ann Rutherford, of New Braunfels, a fellow Speech and Drama major. The couple married on March 1, 1951, and had a daughter, Brooke, in 1957. The Vliets received their B.S. degrees in Education in 1952, and R.G. Vliet went on to complete his Master's at SWT with the thesis, "Experiment in lyric and dramatic verse", in 1953. Vliet then taught English for one year at Brown's School in Austin, and one year at Rock Springs High School in the Texas Hill Country. Even though many of Vliet's novels, plays, and poems would be set in Texas and would win awards from Texan literary institutions, Vliet would not live in Texas again, except for a six-month period near the end of his life, in 1983.
In 1955, Vliet went from teaching English to attending Yale University School of Drama, where he studied playwrighting with Robert Penn Warren and others for one and a half years. He left Yale to start his own writing career, which began with a string of award winning plays. In 1957, his play, "The Arid Spell", won the Wisconsin Award. In 1959, his play, "The Regions of Noon", was named Southeastern Theatre Conference New Play of the Year. In 1960, while working as a Ford Foundation Fellow, his play, "Rockspring", won the University of Nebraska Award. This play would later be worked into Vliet's first novel, of the same name. During this time, Vliet and his family lived in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Morelos, Mexico, traveling and relocating as his wife's college English teaching career, the family's financial mainstay, required.
In 1966, at the age of 37, Vliet published his first book of poetry, Events and Celebrations. It contained the poem "Clem Maverick: The Life and Death of a Country Music Singer", which would later be individually published by Shearer Publishing, accompanied by woodcut illustrations by Barbara Whitehead. His second book of poetry, The Man with the Black Mouth, was published in 1970. Each of these books of poetry won the Voertman Poetry Award from the Texas Institute of Letters.
From 1971 to 1982, Vliet wrote, and worked a small farm in Stamford, Vermont. He published his first novel, Rockspring, in 1974, at age 44, which sold only a few thousand copies. Despite the novel's relatively low sales, Rockspring earned Vliet $25,000 from the sale of movie rights to the work, the most money he would receive for any of his literary efforts. His 1977 novel, Solitudes, (later reprinted under the name Soledad ) won the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse Jones Award. At a time when large publishing houses rarely took on poetry, Random House published his next book of poetry, Water & Stone (1980). In 1983, he won a literary fellowship which allowed him to spend six months writing at the late J. Frank Dobie's ranch, Paisano. This brief period was essentially the only time Vliet spent in Texas after his schooldays and early teaching days. While there, he began writing what would be his last novel, Scorpio Rising.
Vliet was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 1972, and after a brief illness, the disease went into remission. In 1982, Vliet learned that the lymphoma had come out of remission, and had taken a strong grip on his health. The following year, he was recognized with a Distinguished Alumni Award from his alma mater, Southwest Texas State University. Despite serious illness from chemotherapy as well as from the symptoms of the disease itself, Vliet continued work on his last novel, Scorpio Rising, completing it just days before his death. This novel, set in both Massachusetts and Texas, is widely considered to be his best. Russell Gordon Vliet died of lymphoma in North Adams, Massachusetts, in May, 1984.
Since his death, Vliet's novel Solitudes was reprinted by Texas Christian University Press as Soledad, (1986), and cited in James Ward Lee's Classics of Texas Fiction, in 1987. Rockspring was reprinted by Southern Methodist University (1992), the play "Regions of Noon" was published in William Martin's Texas Plays, (Southern Methodist University Press,1990), and Vliet's poetry will be featured in a forthcoming anthology edited by Dave Oliphant. Malcolm Cowley, who served as editor for Vliet and many other award-winning authors at Random House, describes Vliet's prose as "a joy and a continual surprise. There is nobody else with talent for evoking Texas as it was in the 1880s, nobody else who gives us the same sharp feeling for landscape, animals, birds, changing skies, and above all for people, as they lived out their solitary, violent lives full of kindness, resentments, and hardships accepted without complaint. Vliet's writing is close to becoming a national treasure."
Noted theater director and educator Paul Baker was born in 1911 in the West Texas town of Hereford to Retta Chapman Baker and William Morgan Baker. He was the son and grandson of Presbyterian ministers, and the youngest of five children. When Baker was eight years old, his father moved the family to Waxahachie, Texas where Baker and his older siblings would eventually attend Trinity University, then located in Waxahachie.
In 1932, Paul Baker earned a bachelor's degree in drama at Trinity University. Baker then spent a year at Yale University working toward a master's in drama, but for financial reasons he was unable to continue his studies. He spent the summer of 1934 in England, and while there, he received the offer of a teaching position at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He began teaching there in 1934. At Baylor, Baker met Sallie Kathryn Cardwell (Kitty), a college math professor and artist. Kitty Cardwell had received her undergraduate degree at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. She always had an interest in art, but chose math as her major, and went on to receive her Masters of Science in Math from the University of Chicago, where she spent a year working toward her doctorate before coming to Baylor. On December 21, 1936 ‚Äì three months after they met ‚Äì Paul and Kitty were married.
The Bakers had three daughters, Robyn Cardwell Baker in 1938, Retta Chapman Baker in 1942, and Sallie Kathryn Baker in 1947. Kitty Baker began teaching a children's art and drama class for Robyn and her friends in 1941, basing her teachings on the same ideas that Paul Baker was using in his drama classes at Baylor. This class would eventually grow into the Baylor Children's and Teenage Theater.
In 1939, with the help of a Rockefeller Foundation Scholarship, Baker returned to Yale and completed his master's degree in drama. In 1941, Baker received a Rockefeller Grant to write about his travels during the summer of 1936 to England, Germany, Russia, and Japan where he studied theater design and production. Also in 1941, Baker returned to Baylor and helped design a new theater called Studio One. In Studio One, the audience was seated in swivel chairs and surrounded by six stages. Five of the stages formed a semi-circle around the audience and the sixth was located in the rear. This marked the beginning of Baker's many innovative contributions to theater and theater education.
Paul Baker was one of the first theatrical specialists to join the United States Army during WWII, serving as a Special Services Entertainment Officer in Iceland and Paris, France. He directed theatrical performances at the Iceland base. Baker had no trouble finding a variety of men who were talented actors, but he needed actresses. He put in a request for four actresses to perform at his theater. His request led to the formation of the Civilian Actress Technician Corps (CATS), which continued to provide actresses for performances throughout Special Services. In 1945, Baker was awarded the Legion of Merit for the re-organization of the Entertainment Branch of the European Theater of Operation.
Back in the United States, Baker continued to receive recognition for his involvement in education and drama. Baker was the recipient of two more Rockefeller grants in 1946 and 1959. He received the first of these to make a study of leisure time problems as related to community. In 1958, Baker received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Trinity University. Baker also served as President of the Southwest Theater Association in 1956 and as President of the National Theatre Conference from 1958 to 1961.
In 1952, Baker took a group of Baylor acting students and staff to present Green Grow the Lilacs by Lynn Riggs at the Theater Babylone in Paris. While visiting the Paris Museum of Modern Art, Baker became interested in the works of the Cubists. During this time, Baker was beginning to feel that the progress of theater was lagging behind the other arts. Inspired by the idea of translating modern art techniques into drama, Baker went back to Baylor to produce an updated version of Othello in which these new ideas were expressed. He translated the Cubist technique of presenting subjects from more than one point of view into drama by having three actors play the different parts of one character's personality. Henry Hewes, Drama Critic for the Saturday Review, said that Baker had "accomplished what Orson Wells' motion picture tried and failed to do ‚Äì applied the visual arts to a great play without allowing them to inundate it" (Cory, 23). Charles Laughton called Baker's production of Othello "the most exciting piece of theater in America," and called Baker "a man absolutely without fear" (Cory, 23). In 1956, Baker used this method again in Hamlet with actor Burgess Meredith playing the main speaking role of Hamlet and three other actors representing the war-like, jovial and introspective sides of the character.
In 1959, while still teaching at Baylor, Baker helped found the Dallas Theater Center, which acted as the graduate school for the Baylor Drama Department. Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Dallas Theater Center, his last building and the only public theater ever built from his design. Baker also contributed to the design of the theater, working closely with Wright and sometimes disagreeing with him over such issues as lighting installation and backstage ramps. Playwright Gene McKinney described his own response to the designs for the Dallas Theater Center the first time he saw them, by saying "I realized this was going to be a different kind of theater. The whole approach to the total space, with its lack of right angles, gave freshness to the idea of theater." (Cory, 88) Baker would stay with the Dallas Theater Center for twenty-three years.
Baker's innovations in theater continued to receive praise from across the nation, and in 1961, he was given the first Rogers and Hammerstein Award for outstanding contribution to theater in the Southwest. However, Baker was not without critics. In 1962, he obtained the amateur rights from Eugene O'Neill's widow to produce O'Neill's play Long Day's Journey into Night at Baylor. The contract with Mrs. O'Neill was to do the play intact with no editing of the script. A local Sunday school teacher, who brought her class to see the play, was offended by some of the language. She began a campaign against the production, and the Baylor President ordered Baker to close the play. In response, Baker and his entire department, including assistant professor Robert Flynn and graduate student Preston Jones, moved to Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. Baker split his time between Trinity and the Dallas Theater Center, which then began to serve as the graduate school for the Trinity Drama Department.
Preston Jones not only followed Baker to Trinity, but also worked with him at the Dallas Theater Center. While there, Jones took to heart Baker's philosophy of non-specialization, and worked in a variety of positions, including actor, director, stage manager, and ticket taker. Jones credited these experiences with making him a successful playwright. As an actor Jones appeared in several plays at the Dallas Theater Center, including Journey to Jefferson by Robert Flynn, a stage adaptation of William Faulkner's novel As I Lay Dying. Under Baker's direction, this Dallas Theater Center production of Journey to Jefferson, won the jury prize at the Theater of Nations in Paris in 1964.
In 1972, Baker appointed Preston Jones managing director of Down Center Stage, a smaller workshop theater within the Dallas Theater Center. Jones' desire to present new works, combined with a lack of good material available, led him to begin writing his own plays, the first of which was The Knights of the White Magnolia. In 1973, it was produced at the Dallas Theater Center under Baker's guidance, and inaugurated Jones' classic Texas Trilogy. Jones and Baker would continue to have a close working relationship at the Dallas Theater Center until Jones' death in 1979.
In 1972, Baker wrote the book Integration of Abilities, in which he illustrated the teaching techniques he had used in a class of the same name at Baylor and Trinity. In class, Baker taught his students to use all five senses to experience and express their surroundings. Believing that a theater artist should be introduced to all facets of the arts, Baker gave his students assignments in painting, writing, and music composition. During the process of producing a play, he strove to involve the members of the production -- including playwrights -- in all aspects of theater work, such as taking tickets and helping in areas outside their usual sphere, in order to round out their experience of the theater. Baker explained that with this teaching philosophy he was trying to help students "discover their creative abilities," and at the same time "help the theater catch up with the progress made in the other arts" (Cory, 20).
Baker retired from his position as Professor of Drama and Chairman of the Drama Department at Trinity University in 1976, but continued his work as Director at the Dallas Theater Center. In 1978, he received both a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Trinity University and an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from the Texas Christian University.
By 1982, Baker and the Board of Directors at the Dallas Theater Center had begun to hold different views about the direction the Center should take. Baker wanted it to remain an educational theater, maintaining a resident company of actors, writers and directors as it had since its inception. The Board was interested in making the Center a more commercially dynamic venue, and envisioned touring productions featuring nationally-known actors who could attract audiences simply by the presence of their names on the marquee. In March 1982, Baker, after twenty-three years of service as Artistic Director, turned in his resignation. After Baker's resignation, the Center slowly moved away from its former experimental educational approach, and its role as a graduate school came to an end. However, Baker's methods in drama continued in the Dallas Children's Theater, founded by his daughter Robyn Baker Flatt, and at Dallas' Booker T. Washington School for the Performing Arts, founded by Paul Baker himself in 1976, at the request of the Dallas Independent School District.
After leaving the Dallas Theater Center, Baker continued to receive awards for his work in theater, and he remained busy directing plays and writing books and articles. In 1983, Baker received the Tomas De Gretani Award for outstanding service to American Theater. He directed a variety of plays, including Preston Jones' Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia in 1984 at the New Mexico Repertory Theater in Santa Fe. Baker also directed a professional production of Preston Jones' The Oldest Living Graduate for Paramount Theater of Austin in 1986, and his own adaptation, Hamlet ESP, for the Hyde Park Theater in Austin in 1987. In August of 1990, Baker's work in drama and education was celebrated by ex-students from Baylor University (1934-63), Trinity University (1963-1975), and the Dallas Theater Center (1959-83), with "The Paul Baker Festival ‚Äì Second Harvest," which ran for three days in Waco.
In 1994, Baker was the recipient of the Texas Commission on the Arts Special Merit Award, and in that same year he wrote Making Sense with Five Senses, a textbook featuring his Integration of Abilities Technique. Paul and Kitty Baker currently live on a 132-acre ranch near Waelder, Texas, where they are both active in encouraging the application of their Integration of Abilities Technique at the Waelder elementary school.
Nancie Austin was a friend of Texas novelist Elithe Hamilton Kirkland from Wimberley, Texas.
Cormac McCarthy, author of award-winning and best-selling novels including All the Pretty Horses, The Crossing, and Cities of the Plain, was born Charles McCarthy, Jr., on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island. The McCarthy family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in 1937. McCarthy later attended the University of Tennessee, completing one year. He then served four years in the U.S. Air Force, and then returned to the University of Tennessee for an additional 3 years, leaving without a degree in 1960 to pursue his writing career.
Early on, McCarthy won fellowships and awards, though not a wide readership. In 1960, he won an Ingram-Merrill Foundation grant for creative writing, and in that same year, published his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, for which he won the William Faulkner Award in 1965. Also in 1965, he won an American Academy of Arts and Letters travelling fellowship to Europe. The next year, he won a Rockefeller Foundation grant. In 1968, his second novel, Outer Dark, was published, followed by Child of God, in 1974. He won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1976. His fourth novel, Suttree, was published in 1979. Two years later, he won a MacArthur Foundation Grant, also known as a "genius award," upon which he moved out of the motel where he was living in Knoxville, and purchased a home in El Paso, Texas.
As McCarthy tends to set his novels only in places of which he has first hand knowledge, his earlier novels were set in Tennessee, and novels written after his 1981 move to El Paso have been set in the Southwest and Mexico. In 1985, he published Blood Meridian, considered by many to be one of his finest works. In 1992, All the Pretty Horses, the first of the Border Trilogy, was published, winning the National Book Award for fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction. In 1994, The Crossing became the second of the trilogy, followed in 1998 by Cities of the Plain. All three of the Border Trilogy novels have been very successful both critically and commercially. Also in the 1990s, McCarthy published a play, The Stonemason, a work he had begun writing in the 1970s.
McCarthy has been compared to writers such as William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Herman Melville, sharing with such writers a "rustic and sometimes dark humor, intense characters, and violent plots," (Dianne Cox, Dictionary of Literary Biography). New York Times reviewer, Sara Mosle, describes his works as having always been "drenched in blood, much of it spilled in the South and the Southwest in the latter half of the 19th century," and McCarthy's vision as one of "bleak timelessness," (May 17, 1999). In one of a very few interviews, McCarthy said he had "always been interested in the Southwest. There isn't a place in the world they don't know about cowboys and Indians and the myth of the West," continuing on to say that there "is no such thing as life without bloodshed‚Ä¶The notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is really a dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous," (New York Times Magazine, April 19, 1992).

Noted Texas attorney James Edwin Smith, who won a U.S. Supreme Court case striking down an election primary system that excluded black voters, was born in Sonora, Texas on October 18, 1911. He ran for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas in 1958, as a member of the Democratic Party. Publicity photographs for this campaign were taken by Russell Lee. Smith lived and worked in Houston for much of his life. He died on February 1, 2001.
Essayist and journalist Ian Frazier was born in 1951, in Cleveland, Ohio, and graduated in 1973 with a B.A. from Harvard University. Frazier has served as a staff writer for New Yorker magazine, and has published several books of humorous essays. In 1983, Frazier wrote a biographical essay on SWT alumna Ponce Cruse Evans, author of the syndicated newspaper column, "Hints from Heloise". The essay, "Nobody Better, and Better than Nobody", appeared in New Yorker, and later in a book by the same name of Frazier's essays.
Heloise Cruse Ponce was born April 15, 1952, in Waco, Texas, and graduated from Texas State with a B.S. in Mathematics. Her mother, Heloise Cruse, wrote a newspaper column and published several books featuring household hints in the 1960s and 1970s.

Singer-songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker was born Ronald Clyde Crosby on March 16, 1942, in Oneonta, New York. In the early 1960s, he hitchhiked cross-country, singing in bars and on street corners, adopting the name Jerry Jeff Walker in 1966. While performing in Texas, Walker met songwriter Bob Bruno, with whom he formed a band called the Lost Sea Dreamers (and later Circus Maximus), and relocated to New York City.
In 1968, Walker wrote the song he would become famous for, "Mr. Bojangles", which enabled him to embark on a solo career, this time based in Austin. Although Walker's recording of the song barely broke the charts, artists such as Tom T. Hall, Sammy Davis, Jr., Harry Belafonte, George Burns, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band covered it, making Walker and his music known to a national audience.
Walker became a central figure in the burgeoning alternative country scene in Austin beginning in the early 1970s. In 1973, he recorded the album "Viva Terlingua" in Luckenbach, Texas, a ghost town which was memorialized by Waylon Jennings' 1977 hit song of the same name. Walker began to celebrate his birthday in Luckenbach, an event which has grown to legendary proportions. From the early 1970s to 1978, he played with the Lost Gonzo Band, which was known for its skilled musicians, including singer-songwriter Gary P. Nunn.
In 1986, Walker formed his own production company, Tried and True Music, and began to take more time with each of his recording projects. In 1991, he began hosting the television show "The Texas Connection", on the Nashville Network (TNN). In that same year, he played at the inauguration of Texas Governor, Ann Richards, and two years later at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. Walker continues to play in packed halls to audiences ranging in age from teenagers to retirees.
Professor and university administrator Ricardo Romo was born in San Antonio in 1944, and attended Fox Tech High School. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin on a track scholarship, and went to Los Angeles to earn a masters degree from Loyola Marymount University and a doctorate in U.S. History from the University of California at Los Angeles. He began his career as a social studies coordinator in the Los Angeles public schools in 1967, and then went on to teach Chicano Studies as an Assistant Professor at California State University at Northridge (1970-73) and at the University of California at San Diego (1973-1980).
Romo returned to Central Texas in 1980, serving on the UT Austin History faculty, simultaneously directing the Trinity University Tom√°s Rivera Center (1987-1993), and moving into the position of Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (1993-1999). Also during this time, Romo wrote East Los Angeles: History of a Barrio, which deals with the assimilation of the Latino community into American society during World War II. In 1992, Romo was named Educator of the Year by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). In 1999, Ricardo Romo replaced outgoing UTSA President Sam Kirkpatrick, becoming the leader of the only public four-year higher education institution in his hometown.
Romo met his wife, Harriet, a native of Pasadena, while an undergraduate student at UT Austin. The couple was married in 1967, one year after she earned a M.S. in Education from UT Austin. In 1971, she earned an M.A. in Education from UCLA, followed by an M.A. in Sociology from UC San Diego, and in 1985, a Doctorate of Philosophy in Sociology, also at UC San Diego. Since then Dr. Romo has studied at Stanford University and has been involved in various research projects related to ethnicity, immigration, and education.
In 1996, she collaborated with photographer Alan Pogue, documenting the lives of Head Start program families in an exhibit entitled "Photographs and Field Notes: An Ethnographic View of Head Start Families". This exhibit was shown at Texas State University in 1996. From 1990 to 1996, she taught in the Department of Sociology. Dr. Harriett Romo went on to teach Latino studies at UT Austin, where she co-authored Latino High School Graduation: Defying the Odds, in 1996. As a part of the Romos' ongoing and wide-ranging interest in Latino culture and studies, they also collect Latin American art and rare books concerning Southwestern borderlands.
Joe Nick Patoski was born in 1951 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He moved with his family to West Fort Worth in 1953, at the age of two. He attended the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he began his writing career in 1972 as a columnist with the Daily Texan, the newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. That same year he became a consultant in the music business and had soon earned a reputation as one of the most respected critics of pop culture in the Southwest. Patoski worked as a stringer for Rolling Stone from 1974 to 1980, and as a contributing editor for Texas Monthly from 1975 to 1980. During the early 1980s, he was the manager and executive producer for several top Texas rock and roll bands, and toured the United States, Europe and South America. In 1985, Texas Monthly named Patoski an associate editor. He is currently senior editor for Texas Monthly. Patoski has written books and articles on various topics covering the entire range of Texas culture.

Playwright and novelist William Thornton Hauptman was born November 26, 1942, in Wichita Falls, Texas. As a child in Wichita Falls, Hauptman attended many plays, readings, and magic shows in the large municipal auditorium there, and saw such actors as Charles Laughton and Gene Autry. He graduated from Wichita Falls Senior High School in 1961, and earned a B.F.A. in Drama from the University of Texas in 1966. His undergraduate degree focused on acting; Hauptman did not decide until graduate school that he wanted to pursue playwriting. He completed an MFA in playwriting at Yale University School of Drama in 1973. He then went on to teach playwriting at Adelphi College in Garden City, NY, 1973-75, and at Yale University School of Drama, 1976.
Hauptman is a successful dramatist. He won a Obie Award for Domino Courts/Comanche Caf√© 1978. For Denmark Vesey (1981 PBS teleplay) he won a NAACP Freedom Foundation Award and an Emmy Award nomination. For Big River (1985), a Broadway musical based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, with music written by Roger Miller, he earned a Tony Award for Best Musical Book. For the play Gillette, he won Los Angeles Drama League Award (1986).
His non-stage writing is equally well-recieved.For Good Rockin' Tonight and Other Stories (1986), he received the Jesse Jones Award for Best Fiction by a Texas Author from Texas Institute of Letters.
Hauptman served as Associate Professor at the Texas Center for Writers in 1996, and returned in 2000 to continue teaching. His novel, The Storm Season, originally published by Bantam Books in 1992, was published as a reprint edition by the University of Texas Press in Fall 2000, as part of the Southwestern Writers Collection Series.
In July, 1991, a team of photographers and oral historians from Texas State University set out to retrace the steps of Farm Security Administration photographer, Russell Lee (1903-1986). Fifty years after Lee visited and photo-documented the living and working conditions of the Depression era communities of San Augustine, Texas, and Pie Town, New Mexico, this group was inspired by Lee's FSA images held at Texas State's Wittliff Collections. The group visited these same two towns Lee visited, in some cases the same people, taking photographs and conducting oral histories. The team was funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation, and was led by Francine Carraro and Eric Weller. Students included Tom Anderson, Kathleen Dolan, Homero Garcia, Kerri Madden, Darryl Meyer, Stephanie Shaddock, Karen Sorenson, Mark Edward Smith, Russell Smyth, and Sondra Talbert.
The oral histories and photographs taken by this team led to an exhibit and accompanying catalog featuring selected photographs and portions of the oral histories. The exhibit was first shown at Texas State in September, 1992, and traveled to Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX) and Stephen F. Austin University (Nacogdoches, TX) in 1993.
Jean Lee, widow of Russell Lee, and Bill Wittliff donated a significant collection of Russell Lee's vintage FSA prints and field notes, as well as cameras, personal papers, and photographs spanning Lee's entire lifetime and career, to the Wittliff Collections beginning in 1986. While other institutions such as the Library of Congress, National Archives, University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Louisville also hold important Russell Lee collections, the collection at Texas State University includes the largest group of vintage FSA prints.
Cindy Bonner was born June 14, 1953, in Corpus Christi, Texas. She attended University of Southern Mississippi (1971-73), and San Antonio College (1979). She won Honorable Mention, Roberts Awards, 1989, and third place for a short story, Byliners Contest, 1990. Her first novel, Lily (1992), was a finalist for the Western Writers of America's Pipe Bearer's Award. Her novels have been listed as "Best Books" by the American Library Association and have been translated into Spanish and German. Her most recent novel, Right from Wrong, won the Pen Texas Award in 1997.
In addition to raising two children, Ms. Bonner has worked in various professions, including as a yoga teacher, computer operator, real estate manager of a blues/rock band, and writer. She stated, "In 1982, with the encouragement of my husband, I bought a spiral notebook and began to teach myself to write‚Ä¶ the hard way, through trial and error and a tidal wave of rejection letters. It is my goal to write fiction that someone, somewhere, will still be reading in one hundred years from now," (Contemporary Authors, 1999). Ms. Bonner currently lives and writes full-time in Yorktown, Texas.
Widely considered one of America's greatest living playwrights, Sam Shepard is also an accomplished actor, director, screenwriter, and musician. Born Samuel Shepard Rogers IV on November 5, 1943 in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, Shepard is the oldest of three children. His family traveled extensively before settling in Duarte, California, outside of Pasadena, where his childhood experiences informed themes that mark much of his later playwriting. Shepard described Duarte as a "weird accumulation of things, a strange kind of melting pot ‚Äì Spanish, Okie, Black, Midwestern elements all jumbled together. People on the move who couldn't move anymore, who wound up in trailer parks." (Rolling Stone, 1986). Shepard told biographer Don Shewey that his alcoholic father "had a real short fuse," and that he was often the target of his father's anger. In high school he began acting and writing poetry. He also worked as a stable hand at a horse ranch in Chino, California from 1958-1960. Thinking of becoming a veterinarian, Shepard studied agriculture at Mount Antonio Junior College for a year; but when a traveling theater group, The Bishop's Company Repertory Players, came through town, Shepard joined them and left home. After touring with them from 1962-1963, he moved to New York City and worked as a bus boy at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village.
In New York, Shepard spent much of his time reading the works of playwrights and writing short "rock and roll" plays which frequently focused "on a single event, the characters often talking past one another or breaking into long monologues. However puzzling the action, these plays already ring out with Shepard's deft rhythms," (Contemporary Dramatists 1999). Shepard disavowed the narrative convention that required consistent character motivations, preferring instead to see his characters as capable of a wide variety of roles and actions. Shepard once told an interviewer that, "I preferred a character that was constantly unidentifiable, shifting through the actor, so that the actor could play almost anything, and the audience was never expected to identify with the characters," (Shewey, Sam Shepard, 1997, p. 51). Shepard reconsidered this initial approach to his writing as a result of the influence of New York director and acting teacher Joseph Chaikin. As Shepard said, Chaikin helped him understand that there's, "‚Ä¶no room for self indulgence in theater; you have to be thinking about the audience." (Kevin Berger, salon.com, January 2, 2001) Chaikin also convinced Shepard to begin re-writing his plays in order to discover the essence of the experience. Prior to that, Shepard said, his "tendency was to jam, like it was jazz or something." (Berger, salon.com, January 2, 2001)
Shepard's playwriting debut took place at Theater Genesis on October 16, 1964, with a double bill of Cowboys and Rock Garden. In 1966, he received a grant from the University of Minnesota, the first of several he would receive in the coming years. Also in 1966, he won an unprecedented trio of Obie awards for Chicago, Icarus' Mother, and Red Cross. The awards, presented by off-off Broadway champion The Village Voice, helped Shepard's career gain momentum at a time when critics remained wary of his works.
In 1967, Shepard wrote La Turista, his first full-length play, which won an Obie the same year. More Obies for his early works followed, including Melodrama Play and Cowboys #2 in 1968. Shepard also received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1967 and the Guggenheim Foundation in 1968. Also in 1968, Shepard joined a rock band, the Holy Modal Rounders, playing drums and guitar. Although he played with the band for three years, he continued to write and received a second Guggenheim Foundation grant in 1971.
Shepard married O-Lan Jones Dark, an actress, on November 9, 1969, with whom he had one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard. Shepard and Dark divorced in 1984. In 1971, Shepard had a much-publicized relationship with rock singer Patti Smith. Together they wrote Cowboy Mouth, acting the parts on stage in the first night's performance.
In 1971, Shepard and family traveled to England, where four more plays premiered (The Tooth of Crime, Blue Bitch, Geography of a Horse Dreamer, and Little Ocean). Tooth of Crime was later presented in the U.S., winning an Obie in 1973. The next year, Shepard returned to the United States and served as the playwright in residence for The Magic Theater in San Francisco, a post he held for the next ten years. It was during this time that Shepard made his mark on mainstream American drama, winning the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play Buried Child and producing his best-known plays, among them, True West in 1980.
In 1975, he took part in Bob Dylan's "Rolling Thunder Review," a nationwide touring group that included Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs. Shepard eventually published an account of the experience in 1987, titled Rolling Thunder Logbook. In 1978, Shepard began his film career, appearing in Bob Dylan's Renaldo and Clara and later that year in Days of Heaven, directed by Terence Mallick. Also in 1978, Shepard began his collaboration with Joseph Chaikin, with the theater piece, Tongues. Chaikin and Shepard would also collaborate on Savage/Love (1979), and The War in Heaven, which was presented on WBAI radio in 1985.
In the 1980s, his works continued to win awards. He won his eleventh Obie for Fool for Love (1984.) A Lie of the Mind won the New York Drama Critics Award in 1986. Also during the 1980s, Shepard's screenwriting and acting career began to grow. Screenplays included Me and My Brother, Zabriskie Point, and Fool for Love. His most popular and critically acclaimed film, Paris, Texas, won a Golden Palm Awards at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. This screenplay was commissioned by German director Wim Wenders, and was based loosely on Shepard's Motel Chronicles. His acting roles included Resurrection (1980), Raggedy Man (1981), Frances (1982), The Right Stuff (1983), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, Country (1984), Fool for Love (1985), Crimes of the Heart (1986), and Steel Magnolias (1989). He wrote and directed Far North (1988), which starred Jessica Lange.
Shepard continued to write new plays in the 1990s, though his output has slowed from the dizzying pace of the 1960s-1970s. States of Shock premiered in 1991, and in 1992 a revised version of True West was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Drama. Simpatico opened in 1994, and his revision of Buried Child opened on Broadway in 1996 and received a Tony Award nomination. Another collaboration with Joseph Chaikin, When the World Was Green (A Chef's Fable) also premiered in 1996.
Shepard's collection of stories, Cruising Paradise, was published by Knopf in 1996. Curse of the Starving Class opened in 1997 and Eyes for Consuela (based on an Octavio Paz short story) was produced in 1998. In 2001, Shepard returned to San Francisco's The Magic Theater for the premier of his new play The Late Henry Moss.
Shepard's acting career also flourished through the 1990s and 2000s, with appearances in Defenseless (1991), Thunderheart (1992), The Pelican Brief (1993), and The Good Old Boys (1995), among others. Shepard wrote and directed the feature film Silent Tongue (1992). Some of his additional film appearances include All the Pretty Horses (2000), based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, Blackhawk Down (2001), Swordfish (2001), The Notebook (2004), Stealth (2005), Walker (2005), and Bandidas (2006).
Shepard was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letter in 1986. In 1992, he received the Gold Medal for Drama from the Academy and in 1994 he was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame. From 1983 to 2010, Shepard was in a committed relationship with actress Jessica Lange, with whom has two children, Hannah Jane Shepard and Samuel Walker Shepard.
Shepard's impact on modern theater can be gauged by the numerous scholarly books and articles devoted to his work, as well as the hundreds of productions of his plays, both in the U.S. and abroad.

Novelist James Crumley was born in Three Rivers, Texas, on October 12, 1939 and spent most of his childhood in south Texas. He maintained a straight-A average in high school while also playing football. After graduation he attended the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta on a Navy ROTC scholarship, but soon left to enlist in the U.S. Army, where he served from 1958 to 1961. Crumley then returned to Texas and enrolled at Texas A&I (now Texas A&M University-Kingsville), where he had received a football scholarship. Crumley completed his BA in History in 1964, and was accepted into the University of Iowa's prestigious creative writing program, where he earned a MFA in 1966. Immediately after graduating he joined the English faculty at the University of Montana at Missoula. His masters thesis was eventually published as the novel, "One to Count Cadence, in 1969, a popular and critically acclaimed look at the Vietnam War. After his novel was published, Crumley left Montana to hold a series of visiting professorships: the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville (1969-70), Colorado State University (1971-74), Reed College in Portland, Oregon (1976-1977), Carnegie-Mellon University (1979-1980) and the University of Texas at El Paso (1981-1984.)
During a two-year stretch as a freelance writer (1974-1976) Crumley published the first in a series of crime novels for which he would become known. The Wrong Case (1975) featured a detective named Milo Milodragovitch, who would also appear in later novels. "I always introduce my work by explaining that I am a bastard child of Raymond Chandler ‚Äì without his books, my books would be completely different. We cover some of the same ground, his dark streets in LA, my twisted highways in the mountain west. But because of the events surrounding the Vietnam War, my detectives are not as comfortable with traditional morality as Philip Marlowe seems to be," (Contemporary Authors, 2000).
In 1978 The Last Good Kiss (1978) was published, which introduced Crumley's other detective protagonist, C.W. Sughrue. His third crime novel, Dancing Bear (Milodragovitch series), was published in 1983. After leaving his last teaching job in 1984, Crumley has worked full-time as a writer. He's made his home base in Missoula, Montana since the mid-1980s. He has worked on film screenplays, which remain unproduced, and has continued to write and publish fiction. The Muddy Fork and Other Things: Short Fiction and Nonfiction was published in 1991, featuring many of Crumley's short stories. The detective series continued with The Mexican Tree Duck (Sughrue series) in 1993, and Bordersnakes (1996), which brought together Milodragovitch and Sughrue for the first time.
According to Robert E. Burkholder in the Dictionary of Literary Biography Yearbook (1984), Crumley's crime novels stand "the genre on its head by creating an antiheroic protagonist plagued by the weakness and vice of the corrupt world in which he lives and works and endowing him, nevertheless, with the sort of noble instincts that motivate him to sift through the scum in order to identify right from wrong. Crumley's detectives are curiously amoral moralists."
Crumley's final published works include The Putt at the End of the World (2000); the Milodragovitch series novel, The Final Country (2001); and one in the Sughrue series, The Right Madness (2005). He passed away September 17, 2008 from complications from kidney and pulmonary disease.
Children's author and cookbook writer Angela Shelf Medearis was born on November 16, 1956, in Hampton, Virginia. In 1975, she married Michael Rene Medearis, and the couple moved to Austin, Texas. She attended Southwest Texas State University, has one daughter, Deanna, and one grandchild, Anysa. After working as a secretary for a number of years Ms. Medearis began writing full time in 1987. She founded Book Boosters in 1988, a non-profit, grant supported, multicultural reading program tutoring and teaching literacy to grade school children. Her sister Sandra currently directs the program. In 1990, Medearis published her first book, Picking Peas for a Penny, a picture book counting rhyme. According to Medearis, "Picture books are a child's first step into a lifetime of reading. That is why I feel that my job is important. I want to write in such an interesting and exciting way that the memory of reading my book, and the information I've related about a particular event, will linger with a young reader for a lifetime." Medearis has gone on to publish dozens of children's books about Black Americans with real life themes, as well as history books geared towards young readers, such as Come This Far to Freedom (1993), and brief biographies of Coretta Scott King and Ida B. Wells.
Medearis routinely visits schools and performs storytelling, she produced Children's Radio Bookmobile for the University of Texas at Austin (a weekly program featuring multicultural children's literature), and curated Black American exhibits for the George Washington Carver Museum in Austin. Additionally, Medearis (and her husband, Michael) act as a consultants and writers for Scott Foresman, Scholastic, and Macmillan publishers, creating or contributing textbooks and children's books. Among many other awards, Medearis won the first ever Teddy, a children's-book award presented by Laura Bush (Poppa's New Pants, 1996). In 1997, Texas Monthly magazine featured Ms. Medearis and described her as the best-selling children's book author in Texas, with over 1.5 million copies of works in print. "I write the kind of books I always longed to find in the library when I was a child. Every child needs to find a reflection of himself or herself when looking for a book in the library or bookstore."
Poet and writer Tino Villanueva was born on December 11, 1941, in San Marcos, Texas, to a family of migrant workers. Because of the demands of traveling to harvest crops, Villanueva was never able to attend school regularly. Despite the hardships, he managed to graduate from San Marcos High in 1960 and began working on an assembly-line at a local furniture factory. In 1963, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1963 and spent two years in the Panama Canal Zone. There he became immersed in Hispanic literature, reading the works of poets such as Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Cuban revolutionary Jos√© Mart√≠. Upon returning to San Marcos, he took advantage of the GI Bill to study English and Spanish at Texas State University-San Marcos. He completed his B.A. in three years and then moved to Buffalo, New York to attend the State University of New York. He finished his M.A. in 1971 and moved to Boston, where he began his doctoral studies at Boston University.
In the early 1970s, Villanueva began publishing his poems and he became part of what has been called The Chicano Literary Renaissance. His work highlights the tension as well as the richness of living within two different cultures. He writes in both English and Spanish, often switching between the two languages. In 1972, he published his first collection of poems, Hay Otra Voz Poems (There Is Another Voice Poems). That year he also wrote "Chicano Is an Act of Defiance."
After publishing Hay Otra Voz Poems, Villanueva began traveling widely, presenting readings throughout the United States and in Europe. He founded Imagine Publishers, Inc., and edited Imagine: International Chicano Poetry Journal. In 1980 he published a general anthology of Chicano literature, Chicanos: Antolog√≠a Hist√≥rica y Literaria. A year later, Villanueva completed his doctorate in Spanish from Boston University and accepted a full-time faculty post at Wellesley College.
In 1994 Villanueva won the American Book Award for his book-length poem, Scene From the Movie GIANT. The poem was inspired by his boyhood in San Marcos, where he had first viewed the film at a segregated movie theatre. In 1995 Villanueva received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Texas State University.
Villanueva has published several books of poetry since earning his Ph.D. He continues to teach, lecture, and research, and to develop his interest in painting. Villanueva currently serves as Preceptor in Spanish, Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures in the College of Arts and Sciences at Boston University.
Writer Jan Reid was born on March 18, 1945, in Abilene, Texas. After graduating from high school he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, 1964-1970. He received his BA from Midwestern University in 1968 and then went on to receive his MA from the University of Texas in 1972. Reid began to write for the Mt. Pleasant Tribune and soon after quit to seek another job as the sports editor for the New Braunfels Herald in 1972. His break came in 1973 when an editor at Texas Parks and Wildlife magazine suggested he contact a publication that was just getting started in Austin. Texas Monthly needed young, hungry contributing writers. Along with Stephen Harrigan, Shelby Hearon, Prudence Mackintosh and others, Reid joined in on the ground floor in 1973 and became one of the upstart publication's first writers. He wrote countless stories for Texas Monthly and soon after became a contributing editor for the magazine.
In 1974 Reid published The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock, which tells the story of "the movement that changed the face of traditional country music. It traces the development of the exuberant music community in Austin, Texas, from its formative years in the early sixties up to the flourishing activities of the present." "Like many Americans of my generation, I had fantasized my share of guarded moments over the turn my life would have taken had I been one of those lucky fellows with guitars slung like machine guns on their hips, mowing the audiences down."
He also started up Look Away Books, a small publishing company. While visiting Mexico, along with three friends, on April 20, 1998 he was shot by two robbers. Soon after Reid began to write a book, The Bullet Meant for Me, about his ordeal, describing how the shooting left him a paraplegic and his subsequent struggle to regain as much physical control of his body as possible.
Texas A&M University Press recently published Close Calls: Jan Reid's Texas, a collection of some of Reid's best-loved magazine pieces. Also, the March 2001 issue of Texas Monthly included a story, by Reid, about legendary Texas author Billy Lee Brammer and The Gay Place, Brammer's equally legendary novel about politics.
Reid passed away on September 19, 2020.
Elizabeth Crook was born in 1960 in Nacogdoches and raised in San Marcos, Washington DC, where her father directed VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) under Lyndon B. Johnson, and Australia, where her father served as ambassador. Crook went on to Baylor University, and received her B.A. in English from Rice University.
In 1985, she began intensely researching what would become an article in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly (July, 1990), focused on the 1828 marriage of Tennessee governor Sam Houston and the 20 year old Eliza Allen. This article became the touchstone of her best-selling first novel, Raven's Bride, published in 1991 by Doubleday. The 750 page manuscript was accepted by the publisher after fifteen publishing houses had rejected it; Crook's soon-to-be editor at Doubleday, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, called her personally to accept it. Journalist and author Bill Moyers writes that in Raven's Bride, Crook "brought to life the great events of Texas past and turned them into a robust novel. The characters, the descriptions, and the drama are a panorama that only a fine historian or inspired novelist could handle to the reader's delight, and Ms. Crook is both."
In 1993, Crook was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters. A year later, she published her second novel, Promised Lands: A Novel of the Texas Rebellion, also edited by Ms. Onassis at Doubleday. "At a time when war is sanitized, televised, and intellectualized, Crook's most important contribution may be her reminder of the insanity and sheer waste of it all‚Ä¶ Though she probably did not intend it that way, her account of the slaughter at Goliad is one of the most powerful anti-war statements I've read" (Joyce Slater, Houston Post).
Crook currently lives in Austin, with her husband, Marc Lewis, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas, and their son.
Beverly Lowry was born August 10, 1938, in Memphis, Tennessee, and moved with her family at age six to Greenville, Mississippi. She attended the University of Mississippi (1956-58) and graduated with a B.A. from Memphis State University in 1960. She married Glenn Lowry in June 1960, and moved with him to Manhattan. There, she pursued acting and experimented in writing. After relocating to Houston in 1965, Lowry began to write stories, some of which became novels. Lowry began teaching fiction writing as an associate professor at the University of Houston in 1976, while also pursuing acting, and serving on boards for the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, and for Houston Festival. Her fiction writing has typically been set in Texas and Mississippi. Her first two novels, Come Back, Lolly Ray and Emma Blue were both set in Eunola, Mississippi a fictional town much like her hometown of Greenville. Her next three novels and one work of non-fiction were set in Texas, with her most recent novel, The Track of Real Desires, being again set in the fictional Eunola, Mississippi.
The Lowrys lived just outside San Marcos along the San Marcos River from 1981-1991. One of the Lowrys' two sons, Peter, died in a hit-and-run accident on the highway from San Marcos to their home in 1984. This experience and other personal losses in the early 1980s "caused a marked change in the tone of Lowry's fiction. Gone is her unqualified faith in the future; present is a new preoccupation with fate or chance, even a hint that felicity may invite disaster," (Contemporary Southern Writers, St. James Press, 1999). These themes of isolation and alienation appear in The Perfect Sonya(1987), The Track of Real Desires (1994), and clearly in Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir (1992). Beginning in 1989, Lowry approached and visited convicted pickaxe murderer Karla Faye Tucker, on death row in Hunstville, Texas. Crossed Over relates the story of Karla Faye Tucker as well as some of Lowry's own personal story, resulting in "far more than the usual true-crime tale. Lowry interwove the story of her own troubled son with a chilling account of Tucker's dangerously out-of-control life to achieve an understanding of the human being behind an ostensibly inhuman act; her leap of imagination and empathy enabled her, at last, to make peace with Peter's death," (Texas Monthly, Feb. 2001). Lowry moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and currently teaches at George Mason University, in Virginia. She continues to write essays and non-fiction, and has been working on a biography of Madame C. J. Walker, the first Black woman to become a self-made millionaire.
Texas novelist and journalist Frederick Benjamin Gipson was born February 7, 1908, in Mason, TX, and is best known for his novel, Old Yeller. He graduated from high school in 1926, worked various jobs until he attended the University of Texas from 1933-37. Although he did not complete his degree, he found work as a reporter for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times from 1938-40. He began working as a freelance writer in 1940, publishing many short stories, especially in the Southwest Review. His first non-fiction book, Fabulous Empire: Colonel Zack Miller's Story, was published in 1946, and his first fictional work, Hound-Dog Man in 1949.
Gipson went on to publish many more fiction and non-fiction works, winning numerous awards, and garnering special recognition for Old Yeller, which was pronounced a classic almost immediately after its publication in 1956. Although many of his fictional works were written for young audiences, "Fred Gipson's tales of the Texas hill country have charmed young and old, in print and film, for more than three decades... (He) was a top-notch storyteller, he had a good ear for dialect and a light hand in transcribing it. He handled well, if not very originally, that most familiar them in American fiction: initiation," (William T. Pilkington, Twentieth Century Western Writers). Old Yeller, Savage Sam, and Hound Dog Man (as Return of the Texan) were all produced as films, working from scripts by Gipson. The author died at his home near Mason, in 1973.
Writer Dagoberto Gilb was born in Los Angeles. Gilb graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1973 with a double major in Philosophy and Religious Studies. In 1976, he earned a master's degree in Religious Studies.
After a career as a carpenter and a journeyman. Gilb got his first break when Wendy Lesser of the The Threepenny Review agreed to publish one of his stories in 1992. Over the next decade, Gilb published stories with increasing frequency and he also received occasional appointments as a writer-in-residence at colleges and universities. After winning California's James D. Phelan Award in 1984, Gilb was solicited for a book by a friend in El Paso. In 1985 a collection of Gilb's stories,Winners on the Pass Line, became the first publication issued by Cinco Puntos Press. In 1988 Gilb received a Dobie-Paisano Fellowship from the Texas Institute of Letters. In 1992, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded Gilb a fellowship for Creative Writing.
His next publication was The Magic of Blood. which was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award given for the best fiction of the year. It also earned Gilb the PEN Ernest Hemingway Foundation Award for the best first fiction, the Jesse Jones Award for best book of fiction from the Texas Institute of Letters, and a Whiting Writer's Award.
Gilb's novel The Last Known Residence of Mickey Acuna was published by Grove Press in 1994. The national recognition continued to pour in and the novel was named a New York Times Notable Book. In 1995 Gilb received a Guggenheim Fellowship. Two of his stories appeared in the Best American Essays collections.
Dagoberto Gilb currently teaches in the Master of Fine Arts Creative Writing Program at Texas State University and he resides in Austin, Texas
J. Dunston Milner was born near Muleshoe, Texas on October 30. 1926. The son of John and Nina Milner, "Jay" moved with his family around small towns in West Texas, following the development of cotton farms. The Milner family settled in Lubbock while Jay was in the second grade, and he later became a member of the Lubbock High Westerners state champion football team. After graduating from high school, Milner attended college at Lubbock's Texas Technological College, but then entered military service because of World War II. While in the Navy, Milner also attended school at Pittsburgh College. After his discharge from military service, Milner earned his Bachelor's degree from Mississippi Southern University in 1948, later earning his Master's degree, also from MSU, in 1951.
After college, Milner taught at the high school level and coached football for three years, and then moved to the Mississippi Delta area during the racially turbulent 1950s, working at the Hattiesburg, Mississippi Hattiesburg American, and the Pulitzer-Prize winning Democrat-Times of Greenville, Mississippi. In 1959 Milner moved to New York to join the staff of the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune to serve as the assistant to the editorial page editor. In 1961, having recently published his first novel, Incident at Ashton, Milner quit his job and returned to Texas to concentrate on his writing. It was at this time that Milner met and became friends with a group of Texas men who were also becoming writers: Bud Shrake, Gary Cartwright, Dan Jenkins, and Billy Lee Brammer.
After a few years as a freelance writer, in 1965 Milner joined the faculty of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth as a professor of journalism, and three years later moved on to Southern Methodist University to serve as the Acting Chair of the Journalism Department. After leaving his job at SMU, Milner worked as a news anchor for the Fort Worth PBS affiliate for one year. After resigning his news anchor job, for a brief time Milner took over editorial responsibilities for Iconoclast, a Dallas weekly newspaper that had been created as an underground paper in the 1960s.
Milner was the founding editor of the short-lived Texas Music magazine, but the magazine folded quickly due to financial problems. After the bankruptcy of Texas Music, Milner moved with his mother and daughter to Lufkin. While in Lufkin, Milner began to write a column for the Lufkin Daily News. The Daily News was eventually bought by Cox Newspapers, and Milner wrote for the newspaper and Cox for over fifteen years. Since 1995, Milner has lived in Fort Worth with his wife Gail, whom he married in 1983. Upon his move to Fort Worth, Milner began to concentrate on a memoir of his days as a Texas writer in the sixties and seventies. The book, Confessions of a Maddog: A Romp through the High-flying Texas Music and Literary Era of the Fifties to the Seventies, was published in 1998.
Dr. Robert A. Calvert was born in 1933 in Stephenville, Texas. Calvert earned undergraduate and masters degrees in history from North Texas State University, where he taught history from 1967-1973. Calvert also taught at the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his Ph.D. in history, from 1973-75. In 1975, Calvert then relocated to Texas A & M, where he taught and further developed his specialization in the history of Texas and the New South until the time of his death. Many of his texts on ethnic and labor history, 20th century Texas, and the Progressive Movement in the South were required reading for college level Texas history courses. In addition to teaching and writing during his tenure at Texas A & M, Dr. Calvert served as coordinator of history graduate studies, was a member of the TAMU Press' Faculty Advisory Committee, and co-editor of the Press' Southwestern Studies series. Dr. Calvert contributed to the Handbook of Texas, consulted on numerous Texas history related projects, and served as president of the Texas State Historical Association. He died November 30, 2000, at home in College Station, Texas.

Austin City Limits, a television program showcasing musicians in concert performances, was founded in 1974 by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) affiliate station KLRU-TV in Austin, TX. The show's creators were Bill Arhos, then program director, as well as Paul Bosner and Bruce Scafe, who subsequently produced and directed programs for the series. Their aim was to develop a locally produced program that could attract national attention through distribution to PBS affiliates. Capitalizing on the growing Austin music scene of the 1970s, Arhos received PBS funding for a pilot show featuring Willie Nelson and Family.
Station executives across the country liked the pilot and funded filming for Austin City Limits first season, thirteen shows that were taped in 1975 and premiered in 1976. Austin City Limits continues to follow that filming schedule with each season taped during one calendar year and aired the next. The one-hour programs usually pair two musicians, each given thirty-minute segments in which to deliver an uninterrupted, concert-style performance to a studio audience. Nationally known artists are often paired with lesser-known regional or local performers, giving those lesser-known artists a chance to be seen by the whole country. Although the mainstream country and progressive country genres have been staples of the program, Austin City Limits has also featured an eclectic mix of American music: jazz, blues, folk, pop and rock. Studio 6-A in the Communications building on The University of Texas (UT) campus is the permanent home for the show. Some members of the production crew have been with the show since the beginning. In November 2003, Austin City Limits became the first television program ever to be awarded the National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment for the Arts.
The donor of this collection, Bill Arhos, was co-creator of Austin City Limits and executive producer of the show until his retirement in 1999. A Texas native and graduate of Rice University, he received his Master of Educational Administration from Texas A & M. A semi-pro baseball player and a schoolteacher for part of his career, Arhos began working at KLRN-TV, now KLRU, in 1961. He was an instructor in Radio/TV/Film at UT from 1965-1970. He served six years on the PBS Board of Directors and completed two terms on the Country Music Association (CMA) Board of Directors in 1994. Over four decades in public television, Arhos produced and directed educational and entertainment programs, series and specials, and served as program director, general manager, and president of KLRU. He passed away on April 11, 2015 at the age of eighty.
William Broyles, Jr. was born October 8, 1944 in Houston, Texas, and was raised in Baytown. He attended Rice University, earning a B.A. in History in 1966. While at Rice, Broyles was an active member of the student body and a contributing editor to the student newspaper, The Rice Thresher. As early as 1966, Broyles was also contributing articles to the Houston Post. Broyles served as president of the Rice student association during the 1965-1966 academic year, and was awarded the Hugh Scott Cameron award for outstanding community service. He has remained a strong supporter of the University throughout his career, delivering the commencement speech in 1983, and receiving the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1993.
After graduating from Rice, Broyles was invited to study as a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University where he earned an M.A. in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics in 1968. While at Oxford, Broyles pursued his interests in both journalism and public service. He wrote political columns for the Oxford University magazine and contributed articles to the Economist of London. He also spoke throughout England for the United States Information Service. He later worked briefly for Leo Kramer, Inc., a Washington, D.C. social sciences consulting firm as a consultant on Model Cities, Manpower, and VISTA training programs.
In 1968, Broyles's career was put on hold when he was drafted into the United States Marine Corps. Between 1969 and 1971, he rose to the rank of First Lieutenant and served in Vietnam, first as an infantry commander, and later as an aide-de-camp to the Assistant Division Commander, 1st Marine Division. Due to his education background and experience, his assigned duties included social issues with an emphasis on the refugees in the Quang Nam Province. Broyles received the Bronze Star and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star.
Broyles's experiences in Vietnam inspired two of his most critically acclaimed projects. In 1984, he was one of the first veterans to return to Vietnam, and his book Brothers in Arms: A Journey from War to Peace, recounts his visit and his impressions of the aftermath of war on himself and his fellow soldiers, as well as on the country he fought against in battle. In 1988, Broyles once again drew upon his memories in Vietnam when he co-created the award-winning television series, China Beach, a weekly drama for ABC about the doctors and nurses stationed at an American military base in Danang.
Upon returning from Vietnam in 1971, Broyles picked up his professional career. He taught Philosophy and Political Science at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis before returning to Texas as Chief Public Relations Officer for the Houston Independent School District. After a brief period of time in public service in Houston, Broyles was provided the opportunity to pursue his other primary interest, journalism. He became the founding editor of Texas Monthly magazine in 1972.
Broyles's and Texas Monthly publisher Michael R. Levy's goal was to create a magazine of national quality in Texas, and Broyles spent eight years doing just that. Within its first year, the publication won a National Magazine Award for excellence; and during Broyles's tenure it quickly gained recognition as a "writer's magazine," offering intelligent and entertaining articles on Texas life ranging from politics, culture, art, sports, the environment, social issues, and entertainment. The award-winning magazine continues today as an example of quality journalism with a regional focus and a national readership.
In 1980, Broyles and business partners, including Michael Levy, purchased New West magazine from Rupert Murdoch. Broyles served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1980-1982, and saw it through its redesign and re-naming as California. By 1982, Broyles's impressive track record in the magazine publishing world had caught the attention of Katherine Graham who recruited him to serve as editor of Newsweek magazine. He held that position from 1982-1984 when he resigned to pursue other interests.
During the next few years, Broyles made one more foray into the magazine publishing world, serving as editor-in-chief of Cable Guide, but he focused primarily on developing his writing career. In addition to Brothers in Arms, he wrote a three-act play titled Boot, about three soldiers in a bunker in Vietnam joined by a new recruit that they nickname "Boot". The plot follows the four young men as they struggle to cope with the realities of war.
In 1988, Broyles found critical success with the television series China Beach. In addition to co-creating the show with John Sacret Young, Broyles also wrote or co-wrote several of the early episodes, and remained producer and creative consultant throughout the run of the show. In 1991, the Golden Globe-winning China Beach went off the air, but Broyles was well into production on his second television project, Under Cover, a political espionage series following the adventures of husband-and-wife secret service agents, Dylan and Kate Del'Amico. The series was short-lived, and Broyles next adapted the Nigel Hamilton novel, J.F.K.: Reckless Youth, for a 1993 television mini-series of the same name starring Patrick Dempsey as the young future president.
Also in 1993, Broyles turned his attention from television projects to writing feature films. He shares his first screenwriting credit with former Texas Monthly writer, Al Reinert for Apollo 13. The film, based loosely on the novel Lost Moon, co-authored by astronaut James Lovell and Jeffrey Kruger, was directed by Ron Howard. It was met with both critical and box office success, and Broyles and Reinert were nominated for the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay.
After Apollo 13, Broyles began work on Cast Away, an original screenplay about a FedEx executive stranded on a deserted island. Released in 2000, the film was produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it features Tom Hanks as the resilient Chuck Noland. Apollo 13 and Cast Away secured Broyles's place as an A-list Hollywood screenwriter, and he holds writing credits on several other motion pictures including Entrapment (1999), Planet of the Apes (2001), Unfaithful (2002), Polar Express (2004), and Jarhead (2005). Broyles continues to write.
Born in Duluth, Minnesota on March 16, 1890 to Henry S. Mahon and Helen Brooks Mahon, Winifred Mahon Sanford enjoyed a brief but noteworthy literary career from 1925 to 1931. Her 15 short stories appeared popular magazines of the day such the American Mercury and the Woman's Home Companion. She has been called an "unjustly forgotten" Texas author whose work realistically captures the social transition in post-World War I Texas brought about by the oil boom.
Educated for a year at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts (1909), she received a degree in English from the University of Michigan in 1913. Before marrying law student and naval officer Wayland H. Sanford in 1917, Winifred Mahon taught high school in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and in Idaho, then worked as a librarian in New York City. In 1920, the Sanford's first daughter, Emerett, was born in Duluth. Soon after that, Winifred Sanford followed her husband to Wichita Falls, Texas, where he had found employment as an oil and gas attorney. Their second daughter, Helen, was born in their new home in 1922. Although she is known primarily for her short stories, Sanford's first published work, "England and the Home-Rule Question," appeared in the South Atlantic Quarterly in 1913 when she was still at the University of Michigan. Her early work includes unpublished, possibly autobiographical stories she wrote as a child and portraits of family members. Once established in Wichita Falls, Sanford joined The Manuscript Club, a literary group that met for the first time in 1922 and included published authors Anne Pence Davis and Fay M. Yauger. Along with three other members of The Manuscript Club, Sanford was elected as a member of the Texas Institute of Letters. The women belonging to this club encouraged each other's writing aspirations, providing a forum in which to discuss and critique members' works. By January 1925 Sanford's story "Wreck" was published in the American Mercury, edited by H. L. Mencken. Sanford and Mencken established a regular correspondence in which he encouraged her writing endeavors. She went on to publish eight more short stories in the American Mercury, as well as others in the Woman's Home Companion, The North American Review, and Household until 1931. In addition, three of her works were listed in J. O. O'Brien's The Best Short Stories of 1926, which brought her to the attention of several literary agencies. One such agency was the Paget Literary Agency, which represented Sanford for several years. Sanford began working on a novel in 1925 that she submitted to Paget two years later. In 1931 the Sanford family moved to Dallas, where Winifred Sanford continued to work on her novel but had little success publishing it, nor is there any record of short stories written during this time. Because no copy of her novel appears in her Papers, it is assumed that she disposed of it. The Sanford's third daughter, Mary, was born in 1933. The next year an article entitled "Derrick Jargon," co-authored with Clyde Jackson, was published in 1934 by Southern Methodist University in The Southwest Review. Winifred Sanford suffered a long-term illness in 1937 which kept her bed-ridden for over a year, after which no other new articles, novels, nor stories were published. In 1938 Sanford submitted a detective novel to the Paget Literary Agency with no success. She attempted to sell one last short story, "Deep C," to three magazines in 1945, but none of the editors thought the story would appeal to their readers. Sanford's story "Windfall" was reprinted in several anthologies and textbooks from 1928 to 1988, and other stories appeared in collections in 1982 and 1998. However, no collection was dedicated solely to her works until 1980. She and her family privately published Windfall and Other Stories, a collection of 13 of her 15 short stories originally printed between 1925 and 1931, as well as two stories not originally intended for publication. Winifred Mahon Sanford died at the age of 93 on March 24, 1983, but she left a distinguished legacy. Windfall had caught the attention of Suzanne Comer, senior editor at Southern Methodist University Press, who in 1987 began the process of securing permission to reprint the collection as a part of the Southwest Life and Letters Series of SMU Press. The family agreed to the reprinting, and in November 1988 it appeared and gained regional acclaim, with reviews appearing in newspapers and such publications as Legacies, Belles Lettres, Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Western American Literature, and Texas Books in Review. *. Her writing skills have been compared to Katherine Ann Porters', and one critic claimed that Sanford's fiction was "some of the best creative work to date on Texas during the oil boom of the 1920s." This flurry of attention to Sandford's work led to a film entitled The Stars Fell on Henrietta in 1995. The screenplay, based on Sanford's story "Luck," was written by Sanford's grandson Philip Railsback and produced by Clint Eastwood's production company. In early 1997 The Dallas Museum of Art and the Friends of the Dallas Public Library hosted a program called "Arts and Letters Live: A Literary Celebration," in which Sanford's "Windfall" was read by Sheriden Thomas. In 2004, Helen Sanford donated her mother's literary papers to the Southwestern Writers Collection.

Mary Gray Hughes, the daughter of Texas author and newspaperman, Hart Stilwell and his first wife, Mary Gray Seabury, was born in Brownsville, Texas on August 25, 1930. A prolific and respected author in her own right, Hughes wrote and was published almost continuously for nearly three decades from 1969 until dying from cancer in Chicago, IL in September, 1999. Throughout her life, she received numerous awards for her writing. She received the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Writing (1978), was Illinois Writer in Residence from 1977-1980, had her stories anthologized in Best American Short Stories (1962, 1972), had her stories mentioned in Best American Stories (1974-1975), and was elected a member of the Texas Institute of Letters in 1983.
Hughes graduated from Brownsville High School in 1947 then attended The University of Mexico for a summer before completing her education at The University of Texas and Barnard College. While at Barnard, she participated in Phi Beta Kappa and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts. After receiving a Fulbright Scholarship for two years, she pursued a Master of Letters in Social Anthropology. She graduated in 1953.
In this same year, she married J.R.T. Hughes. Moving to Illinois, Hughes gave birth to a son, Benjamin in 1960, and twin girls, Charis and Margaret, in 1962. Starting in 1954, Hughes worked continuously at a variety of jobs ‚Äì almost all in the teaching, publishing, and writing fields. She was an editor at Bowker Publishing Co. and People's Book Club, and was the Writer in Residence of the Illinois Arts Council. She conducted writing workshops at high schools and colleges; served as consultant for the Illinois Arts Council; was writer-consultant to the graduate program in Creative Writing for the University of South Alabama; lecturer in English at Lake Forest College; lecturer in English at Northwestern University, and a judge for the Texas Institute of Letters.
All the while, Hughes worked on her own writing and had numerous short stories, poems, and books published. Notable among her works are the short story collections, The Calling and Cora's Seduction and Other Stories, and the novel, The Empty Lot. This collection of papers represent the materials published by Puckerbrush Press as Cora's Seduction and Other Stories, and were donated to Texas State University's Wittliff Collection by the Press in 2003.
Author Rick Riordan was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1964. He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with degrees in English and History, and in 1988, he received his teaching certification from The University of Texas at San Antonio. He began graduate studies in English and Medieval Studies at San Francisco State University and then pursued a career in education in Oakland, California, where he taught middle and high schools. He continued teaching English for fifteen years in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Texas. Riordan has since retired from teaching to focus his energy on writing full-time.
Like many successful authors, before writing and publishing full-length novels Riordan honed his craft by writing short stories. "The Sheet Cave" and "Out on 1040" were featured in Cactus Alley in 1988. "A Small Silver Gun" was featured in Family Circle Mary Higgins Clark Mystery in the summer of 1998. His short stories have also appeared in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.
Riordan is perhaps best known for his popular series of mysteries books featuring Tres Navarre, a San Antonio private detective, martial arts master, and English Ph.D. in Medieval literature. In 1997, Big Red Tequila, the first in the Navarre mystery series was published. It won the Anthony Award for best original paperback and the Shamus award for the best first private investigator novel. He followed this early success with the second in his series, The Widower's Two- Step in 1998. This novel also won Anthony and Shamus awards, as well as the Edgar award for best original paperback. The Last King of Texas (2000) was a featured alternate for the Mystery Guild, and The Devil Went Down to Austin (2001) was also critically acclaimed. His newest mystery, and the fifth in the Tres Navarre series, is Southtown, which was published in 2004. Riordan also writes novels outside of the Tres Navarre series. Cold Creek was published in 2003 and placed on the American Library Association's top-ten suspense novels list. In 2003, he was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters.
Riordan uses his native South and Central Texas as locations for many of his novel's settings, and his admiration for this area is apparent. However, he had not always anticipated that he would write about the region. At The Scene of the Crime, a panel discussion held in the Wittliff Collections in 2004, Riordan reflected that distancing himself from the area helped him to appreciate it: "I didn't have any desire to write about San Antonio at all until I moved to California‚Ä¶I had to move away, and I had to appreciate what I knew before I wanted to write about it."
Artist Edward "Buck" Muegge Schiwetz (1898-1984)¬†was born in Cuero, Texas on August 24, 1898 to banker William Berthold and his wife, Anna (Reiffert) Schiwetz. He inherited his artistic talents from his mother, whose pencil drawings served as a model for the young Schiwetz. Further influenced by a local china painter, Mary Louise Gramann, Schiwetz's early paintings depict his subjects in clear, precise strokes. Cabin in the Woods, his earliest work, reflects this style.
Schiwetz graduated from high school in 1916, and although he was unable to realize his dream of attending art school, he made the best of his education, and it provided a strong foundation for would later develop into a very successful artistic career. He attended college at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, what is now Texas A&M University, receiving his degree in architectural design in 1921. In 1922, after a year of graduate studies in Architecture at Texas A&M, Schiwetz moved to Dallas in search of work as an architectural drafter.¬†To supplement his income initially, he created advertisement sketches, working under John Doctoroff and Guy Cahoon. He then landed a job with the architectural firm Thompson and Swaine, where he worked for two years.
On January 30, 1926, Schiwetz married fellow artist, Ruby Lee Sanders, a sculptor and ceramist.¬†The couple moved to Houston in 1928 where Schiwetz did freelance rendering and advertisement art for a year before they moved to New York City. While in New York, Schiwetz further pursued his craft and enrolled in the Art Student's League where he studied etching and lithography. It is during this time period that he sold his art work to magazines, including Pencil Points, a volume of which contains an interview with E.M. Schiwetz and is part of this collection. According to that interview, Schiwetz admired and studied the work of Otto Eggers, Joseph Pennell, and Louis Rosenberg, among others.
After their brief stay in New York, the Schiwetz couple moved back to Houston where E.M Schiwetz became a partner in what was to become Wilkinson ‚Äì Schiwetz and Tips, which later became McCann-Erickson. While in Houston, he and his wife had a daughter, Patricia, in 1931.
Schiwetz won many awards for his sketches and paintings of Texas buildings, landscapes and oilfields throughout the 1930s and 1940s.¬†He also won the Houston Popular Prize in 1951-1952. His work was exhibited throughout the country, including the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. and the Art Institute of Chicago.¬†Other honors bestowed upon him include his selection as the official state artist of Texas for 1977-1978 and as the artist-in-residence at his Alma Mater, Texas A&M during the school's centennial celebration in 1976. Various books of his sketches have been published, including Buck Schiwetz' Texas in 1960 which contains an introduction written by Walter Prescott Webb, one of Schiwetz' former high school teachers.
Schiwetz suffered a heart attack and stroke in 1974 causing temporary paralysis on his right side and then had surgery to remove cancer in 1976. Despite these health setbacks, Schiwetz continued to work, always experimenting with and perfecting his art. He died on February 2, 1984.
Cash Edwards, a fourth generation Texan, spent many summers at her grandparents' farm in San Benito, Texas, where she encountered a wide variety of American and Mexican music through live performance and radio. Throughout her childhood and adolescence, she traveled with her Air Force father and experiences exposed her to classical music, ballet, and European folk music which fostered her appreciation of American folk music.
Edwards received her BA in Economics from Wells College in New York prior to returning to Texas where she pursued a graduate degree in Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M University. After her time at A&M, she migrated to Austin around the same time as some of the other Bryan/College Station "front porch" crowd which included Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett.
Edwards moved to California in 1984 where her tenure as the publicist for Freight and Salvage and her work with the historic Fort Mason Club in San Francisco helped evolve her company into a booking agency and Under the Hat Productions was born.
Returning to Austin in 1987, Edwards began booking bluegrass, Cajun, folk, and Texas singer-songwriters. Her logo was designed by Austin artist Guy Juke. Roger Polson joined as a partner in 1998. She, and later, her team, guided the careers of many successful national and regional acts. Edwards closed the agency in 2000, after 16 years, and went on to work as a publicist for the Folk Alliance.
Grover Virgil Lewis, Jr. was born November 8, 1934, in San Antonio, Texas. Tragedy struck the Lewis family when Grover was eight years old during an encounter between Grover's mother and his estranged father that led to a double-homicide with each parent allegedly murdering the other by gunshot. Lewis was soon removed to Fort Worth, Texas, where he lived with the blight of, in his own words, a "haunted" and "painful" existence while in the abusive household of his maternal aunt and her husband. After five years, he fled to live with his uncle, "Spook" Bailey, in the Fort Worth suburb of Oak Cliff.
At Oak Cliff, Lewis attended W.H. Adamson High School and worked at the Texas Theater, a site made infamous some years later as the location where Lee Harvey Oswald was taken into custody. He graduated from Adamson in 1953 and moved to Denton to attend North Texas State College where he majored in English and Drama. It was around this time that Lewis married and fathered a son and a daughter with his first wife, Peggy. At North Texas he also found a "kindred spirit" in future Pulitzer Prize-winner Larry McMurtry. Together Lewis and McMurtry ‚Äî"each being the only aspiring writer the other knew"‚Äî found their way around the back roads and byways of Texas. And Lewis, like McMurtry, began his career as a writer while attending North Texas. He and McMurtry both won various student writing awards for poetry, fiction, and nonfiction in Avesta, the school's literary magazine; and Lewis's creative work was soon published in other literary magazines and journals such as Carolina Quarterly, New Mexico Quarterly, and The Nation. Samuel French Inc. published his play Wait for Morning, Child, after winning the company's national collegiate writing contest. Also while at North Texas, Lewis and McMurtry and a third North Texas student, John Lewis (no relation to Grover) self-published two issues of The Coexistence Review, a literary magazine full of original poetry, short fiction, and essays that became notoriously controversial on campus. Knowing that after graduation they were both headed in different directions ‚Äîboth moving away from Denton‚Äî Lewis and McMurtry intended the magazine as a token of gratitude devoted to several inspiring professors at North Texas. The school's administration, however, was not as enthusiastic about the project as the 200-plus students who eagerly bought-out the magazine. According to Lewis's book proposal for his unfinished memoir Goodbye If You Call That Gone, "The administration sent out growls of disapproval via channels. Somebody had to explain the 'political error' of the red lone-star cover to us. It began to be whispered around that there would be a loyalty investigation of some sort‚Ä¶whether conducted by the school or the state legislature, nobody would say."
The Coexistence Review was interpreted as a thinly-veiled attempt to broadcast communist propaganda; and Lewis and McMurtry were thus prohibited from publishing in the school's accepted literary magazine, Avesta (although the two had been named winners of the semester's literary awards). But the threatened investigations never materialized, and Lewis and McMurtry both graduated on schedule from North Texas State College in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in English. Lewis left Denton but remained in Texas, contributing book and music reviews to several of the state's metropolitan newspapers such as the Dallas Times Herald and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
In 1960, Lewis was named a National Defense Act fellow and moved to Lubbock to pursue a Ph.D. at Texas Technical College (now Texas Tech University). While a graduate student at Tech, he again wrote for the school newspaper and edited Tech's literary magazine, The Harbinger. Lewis also worked as a graduate teaching assistant, and his students included Ponty Bone and Jimmie Dale Gilmore ‚Äî both of whom became acclaimed Texas musicians.
While in Lubbock, Lewis found himself frustrated by the conservative culture, lifestyle, and politics of the South Plains. Around 1960, he made plans to leave and set out to find and write about blues musician Lightnin' Hopkins. Lewis traveled to Houston's Third Ward and spent a week with Hopkins writing what eventually became a 5-part series published years later in The Village Voice (1968) and winner of a Sigma Delta Chi writing award.
It was during this time, circa 1963, that Lewis discovered his passionate interest in film journalism. Accepting an invitation from McMurtry, Lewis spent a week on the film set of Hud in Amarillo, a motion picture adaptation of McMurtry's novel Horseman, Pass By. Lewis's unrealized notes from his experience in Amarillo became the blueprint from which he would work seven years later, with his famous Rolling Stone article about the filming of The Last Picture Show.
After returning from Houston to his graduate studies at Lubbock, Lewis met fierce resistance to his scathing review in the school paper of a Christian, anti-communist tract written by Billy James Hargis. He was subsequently dismissed from his duties as columnist for the school paper, abandoned by his professors, and received death threats by phone and mail. Lewis's appeals for help ‚Äî to, among others, the Students for a Democratic Society - fell on deaf ears. Lewis, in turn, not only dropped out of graduate school, but divorced his wife and signed away parental rights to his two children.
Out of school and without his doctorate, Lewis returned to the copy desk of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, where he slipped into the life of a hard-drinking newsman. During his three-year tenure at the Star-Telegram, he contributed frequent reviews to the book page and began the first pop music column for a daily newspaper in the state of Texas. In 1966, Lewis moved to Houston as a reporter for the Houston Chronicle, but quit two years later to write copy for a Houston advertising and public relations firm. A year later, in 1969, Lewis moved to San Francisco, California, to work as a West Coast correspondent for The Village Voice.
Although his term at the Voice was brief (1969-1970), Lewis was able to utilize his unique position at the epicenter of youth-culture activity by covering such milestones as the Native American takeover of Alcatraz Island and the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont Speedway. It was Lewis's coverage of the Altamont murder that caught the eye of Jann Wenner, founder, editor-in-chief, and publisher of one of the nation's newest and most unpredictable magazines, Rolling Stone.
From 1970 to 1973, Lewis worked as Associate Editor of Rolling Stone magazine, in charge of features on film and books. Rolling Stone's independent spirit proved auspicious for Lewis. He was allowed to self-assign stories and follow his own initiative; and in doing so, produced electrifying pieces of New Journalism, notably his "Splendor in the Short Grass" ‚Äî a piece The New York Times later called "extraordinary" ‚Äî which revolved around the wealth of in-house drama running throughout the big-budget motion picture production of director Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, a film adaptation of yet another Larry McMurtry novel. Due to the praise and popularity of that reportage, Lewis was able to continue producing on-location features for Rolling Stone, interviewing such eminent talents as Robert Mitchum, Sam Peckinpah, Robert Redford, and Paul Newman.
Although Straight Arrow Press, the publishing arm of Rolling Stone, published two books featuring Lewis's work‚ÄîI'll Be There In the Morning, If I Live (poetry) and Academy All The Way (collected Rolling Stone coverage)‚Äîhis relationship with Jann Wenner soured, in large part due to a baulked agreement between Wenner and Lewis over a book Lewis was contracted to write with friend Sherry Kafka about Texas politician John Connally. Lewis describes Wenner ‚Äî dubbing him "Citizen Wenner" ‚Äî as a capricious and manipulating editor, a "bottom-feeder" with a personality "exacerbated by cocaine." Lewis sued Wenner over the Connally deal for breach of contract and was awarded $10,000 in an arbitration proceeding.
After marrying Rolling Stone employee Raona Ence Seavey in 1973, Lewis quit the magazine and moved with Rae to her home state of Utah where he found work despite Wenner's attempt to blacklist him professionally. Lewis worked briefly as a freelance writer for Playboy and Oui magazines before moving back to California‚ÄîLos Angeles, this time‚Äîin late 1976 to write for New West (later named California), a nascent publication at the time.
At New West, Lewis continued where he left off at Rolling Stone, writing pieces about Bette Midler, Elisha Cook, Jr. (from The Maltese Falcon), and Hustler publisher Larry Flynt. Lewis was walking with Flynt outside the county courthouse in Lawrenceville, Georgia, when the publisher was shot in an assassination attempt. The article, "The Shooting of Larry Flynt: An Eyewitness Account by Grover Lewis," was published as a cover feature for the March 27, 1978, issue of New West. In addition to celebrity profiles, Lewis wrote opinion-driven pieces for New West, such as his "Buried Alive in Hype: My Years Among The Reality Vultures," which was nominated for a National Magazine Award in 1979.
During the 1980s, as freelance magazine work became more elusive, Lewis turned to newsprint, contributing stories and book reviews for The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine, The Los Angeles Times Book Review, and The St. Petersburg Times. It was also during this time that Lewis worked as book editor of Movieline magazine and began copious research for his unrealized novel, The Code of the West, based on the Western cinema-heroes of Old Hollywood.
In 1992, Lewis began to confront the troubling memories of his childhood with his Texas Monthly article "Farewell to Cracker Eden," nominated for a PEN West award for journalism in 1993. On the strength and poignancy of that well-received article, he was awarded a contract with HarperCollins to write a memoir under the editorial guidance of Judith Regan. Unfortunately, the memoir‚Äîwhich was to be titled Goodbye If You Call That Gone‚Äîremained unfinished due to Lewis's untimely death from lung cancer on April 16, 1995. His widow, Rae Lewis, began donating his literary archives to the Wittliff Collections in 2001.
In 2005, University of Texas Press published Splendor in the Short Grass: The Grover Lewis Reader, a collection of Lewis's journalism and poetry spanning his nearly forty-year career. The collection preserves Lewis's work‚Äîand reputation‚Äîas one of New Journalism's founding fathers and most fearless mavericks. In his New York Times book review of Splendor, Roy Blount, Jr., calls Lewis's work "Impressive" and "worth preserving." "Lips were loose in those days," as Blount recalls, "and Lewis took every advantage." Information used in this biographical note was extracted from the following sources: Lewis's proposal of his non-fiction memoir, Goodbye If You Call That Gone, R. K. Scott's "Grover Lewis: The Uncommon Insight and Grace of an Ordinary Man," and Jan Reid and W.K. Stratton's essay, "Star-Crossed: A biographical sketch of Grover Lewis," from Splendor In The Short Grass: The Grover Lewis Reader.
John Wesley Hardin was born on May 26, 1853 in Bonham, Fannin County, Texas, the second of James Gibson and Elizabeth Cartwright Dixon Hardin's eight children. Hardin's father was a circuit-riding Methodist preacher and named his son after the founder of the Methodist sect.
J. G. Hardin moved the family frequently during Hardin's childhood. They settled in Moscow, Polk County, in 1855, then moved in 1859 to Sumpter, Trinity County, where J. G. Hardin taught school. In 1861, J. G. Hardin passed the bar and moved the family to Livingston, Polk County, Texas where he taught school and practiced law.
After the war, in 1865, the family returned to Sumpter. In 1868, the 15 year old John Wesley Hardin killed his first victim, a former slave. Texas was ruled by the military according to congressional reconstruction policies and Hardin believed that he would not receive a fair trial. He fled and later claimed to have killed three soldiers who were sent to arrest him and that his relatives and neighbors helped him bury and hide the evidence. In 1869, his father sent him away from the area to teach school in Pisga, Navarro County, where other relatives lived. He left the school after one term to take up more lucrative pursuits. He developed his skills in gambling and became enamored of horse racing. By the end of 1869, Hardin by his own admission had killed a freedman and four soldiers. In December of that year he killed Jim Bradly in a fight after a card game. His life subsequently became a pattern of gambling, saloons, fights, and killing.
In 1871, Hardin visited his relatives, the Clements, in Gonzales County. J. G. Hardin's sister Martha Balch had married Emmanuel Clements and Hardin was close to his first cousins, Mannen (or Manning), Joe, and Gip. They convinced him to go with them on a cattle drive to Abilene, Kansas. Hardin used his gun often on the drive. Among his victims were an Indian who shot at him with an arrow and five Mexicans with whom he had argued for crowding his herd. In rough and ready Abilene, Hardin fraternized and sparred with Wild Bill Hickock and Ben Thompson. When his cousin Mannen Clements was jailed for the killing of two of Clements' cowboys, Hardin made arrangements with Hickock for Mannen to escape. Later Hardin killed a man at his hotel and fled Abilene fearing arrest by Hickock.
Hardin returned to Gonzales County, Texas, where he and the Clements piled up indictments (Marohn 44). Hardin married Jane Bowen on February 29, 1872. Jane was fully aware of Hardin's way of life and remained totally loyal to her husband through all the vicissitudes of their married life. Hardin was frequently apart from Jane, often to avoid the law. In August 1872, Hardin was wounded after being shot by Phil A. Sublett who had lost money to Hardin in a Trinity City Saloon. Hardin tried to hide out while he recovered but finally gave himself up when his whereabouts were discovered. Along with an indictment for assaulting Sublett, Hardin had several other indictments outstanding when he was arrested. He was sent to Gonzales County at the request of Sheriff W. E. Jones who held warrants against him (Marohn 56). He broke out of the Gonzales County jail with the help of Mannen Clements.
On February 6, 1873, Hardin's first child Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) was born. In April, he killed J. B. Morgan in a Cuero barroom, one of the two killings for which he would ultimately be convicted. The same year, he became embroiled in the Taylor-Sutton feud as a leader of the Taylor faction. Hardin was related by marriage to the Taylors and both Taylors and Suttons relied on the loyalty of kin. Hardin and Jim Taylor killed the powerful and ruthless Sutton supporter, Jack Helm. In March of 1874, Hardin and his older brother Joseph aided Billy and Jim Taylor in their assassination of the leader of the Sutton faction, Bill Sutton, as he boarded a boat in Indianola on his way to New Orleans. After Bill Sutton's murder, Hardin put together another cattle drive and journeyed to Comanche to say goodbye to his family. On May 26, he was celebrating his winnings from a horse race, drinking at the Comanche saloons, when he met up with deputy sheriff Charles Webb from neighboring Brown County. Webb was killed and the crowd turned against Hardin and his companions. Hardin escaped but his father, brother Joseph, and other kinsmen were arrested. Joseph Hardin and two cousins were taken from jail at night and lynched. Hardin, vowing to avenge his brother's death, fled Texas followed by his wife and daughter. Under the name of J. H. Swain he relocated in Florida among his wife's relatives. He later moved his family to other Bowen relatives in Pollard, Alabama across the Florida border. John Wesley Hardin, Jr. was born August 3, 1875. A daughter, Callie, (later renamed Jane Martina and called Jennie) was born July 15, 1877.
In 1873, Reconstruction had ended in Texas with the election of Richard Coke over radical Republican E. J. Davis. As soon as the former confederates were returned to power, the populace was eager to see an end to the violence and lawlessness which had been rampant since the end of the war. Coke re-established the Texas Rangers in 1874, in part to reinforce local law enforcement in their ineffectual fight against cattle thieves, gangs and feudists. He created a Special Force whose first duty was to end the Sutton-Taylor feud. In 1877, John B. Armstrong, a second Lieutenant in the Special Force, requested that he be commissioned to find and arrest the fugitive Hardin. A Dallas detective Jack Duncan was hired to live undercover among Jane Hardin's relatives in Gonzales County in order to learn where Hardin was. Jane's brother, Brown Bowen, also a fugitive hiding in Alabama, betrayed their whereabouts when he wrote his father and told him that his sister Jane sends her love. Armstrong and Duncan went to Pensacola Junction in Florida and made arrangements with the sheriff to arrest Hardin on the train as he was returning home to Alabama on August 23, 1877. They overpowered Hardin and transported him back to Texas where they lodged him in the Austin jail. Under heavy guard by the Texas Rangers, Hardin was taken to Comanche County and tried for the murder of Charles Webb in September of 1877. He was convicted to 25 years in the state prison but appealed the sentence on technical grounds. He was returned to Austin October 6, 1877 to await his hearing. Hardin's brother-in-law, Brown Bowen, was also in the Austin jail sentenced to die by hanging for the murder of Thomas Haldeman. The Bowens asked Hardin to take the blame for the Haldeman murder. Hardin refused maintaining his innocence. Jane Hardin stood by her husband, thereby estranging herself from her father. Brown Bowen was hung proclaiming Hardin was the guilty one to the very last.
In June 1878, Hardin's conviction was upheld. He entered prison in Huntsville on October 5, 1878. He made several unsuccessful attempts to escape and was harshly punished each time. Eventually he settled into prison life, joined the debating society, attended Sunday school and studied law. In January 1892, Hardin was sent to Cuero, Texas where he plea bargained a 2 year concurrent sentence for the 1873 murder of J. B. Morgan. He was released from prison February 17, 1894 after 15 years and 5 months with time off for good behavior. He rejoined his children in Gonzales County. His wife Jane had died November 6, 1892.
Hardin's attorney wrote Governor Hogg for a full pardon based on the fact that Hardin had completed his sentence and was "behaving in an orderly manner." (Marohn 180) The pardon was granted on March 16, 1894. Hardin then passed a law examination and set up practice in Gonzales. He became embroiled in a controversy with W. E. Jones in Jones' campaign for Gonzales County sheriff. Hardin supported Jones' opponent and charged that Jones had helped him escape from prison in 1872. When Jones won a close election, an embittered Hardin left Gonzales and moved to Junction where his brother Jeff was living. By December, he opened a law office there. In January he married the 15 year old Callie Lewis but she left him soon after.
A relative, Jim Miller, asked Hardin to come to Pecos in far West Texas to give legal assistance in his feud with the Pecos County Sheriff, Bud Frazer. Miller was suspected of several murders himself, and when Hardin consented to help him, he was walking straight back into his old way of life. The Miller case ended with a hung jury and Hardin drifted to El Paso. He set up a law office there but soon let his practice slide. He again frequented saloons, gambled, drank to excess and got into fights. On August 19, 1895, John Selman, with whom Hardin had been arguing, shot Hardin in the back of the head as he threw dice at the bar of the Acme Saloon.
Pulitzer Prize winning novelist and playwright, Cormac McCarthy, was born Charles McCarthy, Jr., on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the third of six children born to Charles and Gladys McCarthy, preceded by sisters Jackie and Bobbie, and followed by Bill, Maryellen, and Dennis. In 1937, his parents moved the family to Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father was employed as a lawyer with the Tennessee Valley Authority.
McCarthy spent much of his life in Tennessee, and his early works are clearly influenced by that region. His first four published novels, The Orchard Keeper (1965), Outer Dark (1968), Child of God (1973), and Suttree (1979), reflect the culture, myth and character of East Tennessee and Appalachia.
McCarthy briefly attended The University of Tennessee (UT) from 1951 to 1952 before serving four years in the U.S. Air Force, including two years in Alaska where he hosted a radio program. In 1957, he returned to UT where he published the short stories "A Drowning Incident" and "Wake for Susan" in the student literary magazine, The Phoenix. His literary talent did not go unrecognized at UT, and McCarthy received the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960, firsts in a long list of literary accolades to come.
In 1960, McCarthy left UT without his degree and moved to Chicago where he worked part time in an auto parts warehouse and pursued his writing. He married poet and former UT student, Lee Holleman; the couple had one son, Cullen. In 1961, they moved to Sevier County, Tennessee, where the marriage ended in divorce in 1962. McCarthy left Tennessee again, this time moving to Asheville, North Carolina, and then New Orleans where he continued work on his first novel, The Orchard Keeper. Set in rural Tennessee between the two world wars, it is the story of a boy, John Wesley Rattner, and the bootlegger, Marion Slyder, who has killed the boy's father.
McCarthy has notably kept his distance from reporters, but in 1992 he granted Richard Woodward a rare interview published in The New York Times Magazine. In that interview, he confessed that he sent the manuscript for The Orchard Keeper to Random House because, "it was the only publisher I had heard of." At Random House, McCarthy was paired with renowned editor, Albert Erskine, who had worked with literary giants such as Robert Penn Warren, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner. McCarthy's Southern Gothic novels continue to be compared with those of the latter, and McCarthy's debut novel earned him the William Faulkner Foundation Award in 1965. Erskine remained McCarthy's editor for over twenty years - until his retirement in the mid 1980s. Blood Meridian (1985) was their final collaboration.
In the same year The Orchard Keeper was published, McCarthy received the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Letters traveling fellowship, and he used the funds to go to Ireland. En route on the ocean liner, Sylvania, he met English dancer and singer, Anne De Lisle, and the two were married in England in 1966. A Rockefeller Foundation grant McCarthy received that same year supported the couple as they traveled through Europe and lived briefly on the Spanish island of Ibiza where McCarthy began work on his second novel, Outer Dark. They eventually moved to Tennessee, settling in Rockford, near Knoxville.
Outer Dark was published in 1968. It tells the story of brother and sister, Culla and Rinthy Holme, who have a child together. He lies, claiming the child has died, and leaves to search for paying work. She then searches for her "littlest chap." Like McCarthy's debut novel, Outer Dark was a critical, if not popular, success. The selection committee for the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation agreed with the critics, and McCarthy was awarded a Fellowship for Creative Writing in 1969.
McCarthy's third novel, Child of God, was published in 1973. The story of the isolated mass murderer and necrophile, Lester Ballard, is loosely based on an historical figure in Sevier County, Tennessee. Like his previous works, Child of God could not be considered a commercial success, but a steady following of devoted readers and critics grew.
Following Child of God, McCarthy departed from the novel format to write the script for The Gardener's Son, an episode in the PBS series, Visions. It first aired January 6, 1977 and starred Brad Dourif, Ned Beatty, and Kevin Conway as members of two feuding South Carolina families, the wealthy Greggs, and the blue-collar McEvoys.
Suttree, McCarthy's fourth novel, was published in 1979. Written over the span of twenty years, the semi-autobiographical novel set in the early 1950s follows Cornelius Suttree, a fisherman on the Tennessee River who lives on the fringe of society after severing ties with his family and abandoning his wife and son. Many of the characters are reflections of people that McCarthy knew in Knoxville and the surrounding area.
By the time Suttree was published, McCarthy was living in El Paso, Texas. He had separated from De Lisle in 1976, and the two divorced in 1978. In 1981, McCarthy won a coveted MacArthur Fellowship, commonly referred to as a "genius grant." The five-year grant provides recipients with "flexibility to pursue their creative activities in the absence of specific obligations or reporting requirements," and it allowed McCarthy to concentrate on his next writing project.
McCarthy's move to the southwest brought a shift in the settings of his novels. He began work on what he termed his "western," which was published in 1985 as Blood Meridian. In his 1992 interview with Woodward, McCarthy states, "I've always been interested in the Southwest. There isn't a place in the world you can go where they don't know about cowboys and Indians and the myth of the West." In Blood Meridian, McCarthy tackled the myth of the West head-on with his mid-nineteenth century border story of "the kid" and a band of American mercenaries hired to kill and scalp Indians in Mexico. The novel firmly thrust McCarthy into the center of the American literary canon. Critic Harold Bloom declared Blood Meridian, "the authentic American apocalyptic novel," stating, "The fulfilled renown of Moby-Dick and of As I Lay Dying is augmented by Blood Meridian, since Cormac McCarthy is the worthy disciple both of Melville and of Faulkner. I venture that no other living American novelist, not even Pynchon, has given us a book as strong and memorable."
McCarthy followed Blood Meridian with three novels set on the Texas-Mexico border in the mid-twentieth century, and which reveal the dreams and coming-of-age of two remarkable characters, John Grady Cole and Billy Parham. All the Pretty Horses (1992), The Crossing (1994), and Cities of the Plain (1998), known collectively as "The Border Trilogy," were McCarthy's first novels published after Erskine's retirement and McCarthy's move from Random House to Knopf. They also mark another significant shift in McCarthy's career -- for the first time, his novels were bestsellers.
McCarthy continued to receive praise from critics; All the Pretty Horses won the National Book Award in 1992 and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1993. And he received personal accolades with his induction into the El Paso Herald-Post Hall of Fame in 1991 and his reception of the Texas Institute of Letters Lon Tinkle Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. In 2000, All the Pretty Horses was released as a film directed by Billy Bob Thornton and starring Matt Damon as John Grady Cole. Ted Tally wrote the screenplay.
While McCarthy is best known for his novel writing, he has also written in other formats. The Stonemason, a play about an African-American family in Louisville, Kentucky that he wrote in the 1970s was revised and published by Ecco Press in 1994. And in 2006, Sunset Limited, a novel in dramatic form originally performed by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, was published in paperback by Vintage Books.
McCarthy initially began No Country for Old Men as a screenplay in the 1980s, but he eventually abandoned the format. Instead, the suspenseful story of sociopathic killer Anton Chiguhr's pursuit of Llewelyn Moss was published in 2005 as his ninth novel. Ethan and Joel Coen adapted it for film in 2007, starring Javier Bardem as Chiguhr, Josh Brolin as Moss, and Tommy Lee Jones as sheriff Ed Tom Bell. In interviews supporting the film's release, the Coen brothers joked that in adapting the novel for the screen, one of them simply held the book open while the other typed. The film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, and best screenplay adaptation.
McCarthy's tenth novel, The Road, was published in 2006. The post-apocalyptic story of a father and son's journey across a ruined landscape was dedicated to his son John Francis, from his third marriage to Jennifer Winkley. The novel won McCarthy the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for fiction as well as the United Kingdom's oldest literary award, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. In March 2007, Oprah Winfrey selected The Road as a reading for her popular book club, and the reclusive McCarthy made his first televised interview on her show that year.
McCarthy currently resides in the Santa Fe, New Mexico area, where he enjoys an affiliation with the multi-disciplinary Santa Fe Institute and continues to write.
Book collector and bibliographer, J. Howard Woolmer, wrote to Cormac McCarthy praising both Outer Dark (1968) and McCarthy's first novel, The Orchard Keeper (1965) after reading Robert Coles' review of Outer Dark published in the March 22, 1969 issue of The New Yorker. In his July 29, 1969 letter, Woolmer states his intent to begin collecting all of McCarthy's work and asks if the author would be willing to sign copies of his books. In his August 16 reply, McCarthy agrees. These letters mark the first of over 120 sent between the two men from 1969 to 2006.
By 1969, Woolmer had been in the book selling business for almost ten years. Operating out of the literary Mecca of New York City, he issued his first catalogue in 1961. His early catalogues were of modern first editions and on the works of literary giants such as James Joyce. Woolmer soon began issuing catalogues based on single subjects; the first on the Imagist Poets (1966) and then, in 1969, on the novelist Malcolm Lowry, author of Under the Volcano. He has since published a bibliography on Malcolm Lowry; A Checklist of the Hogarth Press; and a bibliography of the Leonard L. Milberg Irish Theatre Collection.
In a 2007 interview, Woolmer stated that he had initially moved away from modern firsts because "I didn't get enough of a kick from the books of contemporary writers." However, with Cormac McCarthy he had discovered an exception, and over the next thirty years he amassed a remarkable collection of signed first editions, advance proofs, and foreign imprints of McCarthy's books. The Wittliff Collections purchased these books in 2006 along with the collection of letters between McCarthy and Woolmer.

The Lonesome Dove miniseries originated from a chance meeting between Motown Productions president Suzanne de Passe and author Larry McMurtry in which de Passe asked McMurtry about his current project. McMurtry subsequently sent a copy of his unpublished Lonesome Dove to de Passe who quickly snatched up the film rights. The book was published in June 1985, and went on to spend 20 weeks on the New York Times best seller list. It received the 1985 Pulitzer Prize, the Spin Award for Best Western Novel of 1985 and the Texas Institute of Letters Jesse Jones Award for Best Fictional Book.
Lonesome Dove originated as a screenplay called The Streets of Laredo, which was intended as a vehicle for John Wayne, Henry Fonda and James Stewart. The 288-page script was written by McMurtry with Peter Bogdanovich in 1972. The project failed to materialize and McMurtry eventually chose to expand the idea into a sprawling 843-page novel eulogizing the Texas past, both factual and mythical, as represented by the horseman and cowboy. Motown Productions contracted with CBS Television to air the western as an eight-hour miniseries. Bill Wittliff, who had scripted the westerns Barbarosa (1982) and Red Headed Stranger (1986), was signed to write the teleplay. He also served as Executive Producer. Filming began March 1988 in Austin, Texas; moved to Del Rio, Texas in April and then to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in May, wrapping in July after 88 days of shooting. The film, directed by Simon Wincer and starring Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Urich, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston and Diane Lane, aired on CBS in February 1989 to high ratings and critical acclaim.
Among Lonesome Dove's many awards were seven Emmys for directing, sound editing, sound mixing, makeup, costume, music, and casting. It also received a Peabody Award and two Golden Globe Awards, one for best miniseries and one to Robert Duvall for best actor in a miniseries. Duvall, already a celebrated actor noted for a distinguished career, reported that the character Gus was a favorite role, and he remarked "When I was doing The Godfather, I knew we were doing something big. When I was doing Lonesome Dove, I got the same feeling. I've only felt that a couple of times in my life." (New York Tribune, Feb 6, 1989) Bill Wittliff reminisced "sometimes something just takes over and is a good example of that. I think every element works, from cast to crew to wardrobe to Jerry [sic] White's art design and the production design . . . it was just a beautiful combination of enormously talented people . . . [and] the final project was larger than all the people." (Austin Chronicle, March 11, 1994)
Jerry Retzloff was born in San Antonio, Texas, on January 4, 1940 to Walter (Red) and Celia Retzloff. He was raised on the Southeast side of town, proudly attending Central Catholic High School. Upon graduation, Jerry decided to join the U.S. Coast Guard and was stationed in San Francisco, California. He enjoyed the USCG and often spoke pridefully of being the only coasty to have never gotten seasick on his ship despite numerous significant storms on his watch. During one storm, he wagered everyone their once-a-week ration of steak that he would not get seasick ‚Äì he won the bet and ate steaks daily for over a month.
Upon returning from the USCG, he came back to San Antonio and joined Lone Star Brewery in 1963. He loved his job at Lone Star Beer, working on the dock, the accounting office, and ultimately ending up in marketing and special promotions. While at Lone Star in his early years, he also earned his bachelor's degree in marketing from St. Mary's University. In the mid 1970s, he became the district manager for Lone Star in Austin, Texas. He worked passionately to grow the brand through the burgeoning Austin music scene. Jerry identified with the younger crowd and made connections quickly - enjoying music, meeting people, building relationships and promoting the "National Beer of Texas". He developed many bonds with musicians from the area including Kinky Friedman, Red Stegall, Charlie Daniels, and, among others, his lifelong friend, Willie Nelson.
Jerry originated the concept of calling beer bottles "long necks" and promoted the idea of "Long Live Long Necks". He was especially proud to have been featured in an article for Texas Monthly (2014) entitled "Bottle Rocket" - an amazing article on how Jerry built the Lone Star brand through music, unique promotions and his travels from Austin to Nashville to Hollywood. To cap his legendary career in the beer/music business, a phenomenal exhibit was created in his honor at Texas State University's Wittliff Collections.
After retiring with 34 years at Lone Star Beer, Jerry pursued his hobby of fishing and telling stories on frequent trips to the Rockport area. He also served in the hospital ministry at the downtown Baptist Hospital for 26 years. Having built a vast network of friends over the years, he genuinely enjoyed people, had a servant's heart, was kind to all and never encountered a stranger. His trademark phrase of "Not to Worry" stuck with him until the end. He passed away March 10, 2020.

Born in San Antonio, Texas in 1941, acclaimed filmmaker Severo Perez earned his B.A. in American Literature and Contemporary History from the University of Texas. Perez moved to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue a career in the motion picture industry. His productions have won more than 50 awards, including three CINE Golden Eagles. Perez is also an accomplished playwright and novelist.
Perez began working in theater in 1974, teaming up with legendary actress Carmen Zapata to translate and adapt the Mexican play Los desarraigados (Uprooted) for American audiences. Later, Perez became playwright-in-residence at El Teatro Campesino, where he wrote Soldierboy with his wife, Judith Perez. That play is based on Perez's own personal story in San Antonio as the son of a returning U.S. soldier after World War II. Soldierboy has been staged around the country and appears in the 1989 anthology Necessary Theater: Six Plays About the Chicano Experience. Perez's credits as a dramatist also include Speaking of Cats, inspired by Tejana activist Emma Tenayuca and the 1938 pecan shellers strike in San Antonio.
Perez's 1995 film, ‚Ä¶and the earth did not swallow him, is adapted from Tom√°s Rivera's classic 1971 Chicano novel, ‚Ä¶y no se lo trag√≥ la tierra, and follows the lives of a South Texas family of migrant farmworkers in the 1950s. Perez's nuanced, powerful film beautifully evokes the substance and spirit of Rivera's work, and it has won international critical acclaim, including top honors at film festivals worldwide. Some of these honors include the Gold Medal at the 12th Annual Television Movie Awards in 1997, Jury Award at Vina del Mar (Chile) International Film Festival in 1996, Sol Award CineSol at the 1995 Latino Film Festival, Best Feature at the San Diego Independent Film Festival in 1994 and the Minneapolis Rivertown Film Festival in 1995, Best of the Fest Audience Award at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1994, and Jury Award for Best Director at the Cairo International Film Festival in 1994.
In 1998, Perez finished a documentary, Willa Brown: An American Aviator, about a remarkable woman‚Äîa pioneering African American pilot who took to the air in the 1930s and defied Jim Crow laws. Her efforts led to Congress forming the renowned Tuskegee Airmen squadron. The film is currently distributed by Filmakers Library.
Perez's other films include a documentary on artist Carmen Lomas Garza: Carmen Lomas Garza: Looking Back; a family drama about a high school girl's desire to attend college, Dreams of Flying; a documentary about dancer-choreographer Rudy Perez, Countdown: Reflections on a Life in Dance, an adaptation of Mark Twain's The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County; a feature film on Tejano hero Juan Seguin; a documentary about immigrants in Southern California, There Goes the Neighborhood; an animated film about the history of writing, Astronauts and Jelly Beans; a drama about AIDS for young teens, Between Friends, a documentary about four retired African American men, Elders; as well as short documentaries on a wide range of subjects, including La Raza Unida's 1960s political uprising in Crystal City, Texas. He also negotiated the deal at Universal Studios that allowed Luiz Valdez to direct the film version of Zoot Suit.
In 2012 Perez published his first novel, The Challengers Aero Club, inspired by his documentary on aviator Willa Brown and other pioneering African American pilots in the early 20th century. The book was praised by Kirkus as "an engaging, thorough novel about forgotten heroes of aviation history."
Aubra Nooncaster graduated Sul Ross State College with a Master's in English in 1940. Upon returning from service in World War II, he was hired as head basketball and assistant football coach at Midland High School where he taught for two years. At Midland, Coach Nooncaster was also given an English class to teach that his football players took in anticipation of an easy A. One of these students was Larry L. King, the playwright and author best known for The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Nooncaster would become a great influence on Larry L. King's writing career. As early as 1974, King began a lifelong correspondence with Coach Nooncaster.
In 1947, Aubra Nooncaster began to teach at Pampa Independent School District in Pampa, Texas, where he stayed until his retirement in 1978. During his career as a teacher he pursued an enduring love of poetry, ultimately publishing four books of poems: Listen for a Poem, Selected Poems: 1959-1988, Amid the Glow of Suns, and Interim Days: A Book of Poems.
His community, peers, and former students loved and admired Aubra Nooncaster. Many of his former students reconnected with him after reading Larry L. King's article about his time with Nooncaster entitled "A Coach I Can't Forget." The article was published in Parade, a newspaper insert that ran nationwide, on July 17, 1983.
 Journalist and chili enthusiast Wick Fowler (1909-1972) was born Homer Thomas Wilson Fowler in Big Sandy, Texas and grew up in Victoria, Texas.
Fowler began his newspaper career at the Austin American Statesman, then joined the Dallas Morning News, and later became editor of the Midland Reporter Telegram. During World War II he served as the only Texas news correspondent, writing for the Dallas Morning News, and was awarded a Purple Heart after being wounded in Italy with fellow journalist Ernie Pyle. He followed the 36th Infantry Division, which was partially comprised of men from his former National Guard unit.
During the Vietnam War Fowler shipped out to Vietnam as a war correspondent for the Denton Record Chronicle. Again Fowler told the story of Texan soldiers. He returned later to cover the local boys for 15 Texas newspapers, and again with Texas businessman H. Ross Perot in attempts to return prisoners of war.
Fowler helped found the Chili Appreciation Society International and created Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili product, both of which are still active. Both ideas were born of a chili cook-off first held in Terlingua, Texas in 1967, in which Fowler competed against Francis X. Tolbert, a friend and colleague at the Dallas Morning News.
Fowler was also a humorist, writing columns such as the "Towering Texan," "Fowler Fare," and "The World's Fare" from 1947-1968. He brought Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili on his trips to Vietnam, and was called on to cheer the troops in World War II. Fowler also wrote on local issues such as the John F. Kennedy assassination in Dallas in which Texas governor John Connally was injured, crime and safety, and boating.

Naomi Shihab Nye, acclaimed poet who also writes essays, songs, novels, and children's books; edits poetry anthologies, and teaches poetry writing to youth and adults, was born in 1952 in St. Louis, Missouri to Aziz Shihab, a journalist and immigrant from Palestine, and Miriam Shihab, a Montessori teacher with a fine arts degree in painting. Nye has won numerous awards, including her first major recognition for Hugging the Jukebox as a National Poetry Series selection in 1982, critical acclaim for her 2011 short story collection There Is No Long Distance Now: Very Short Stories, Best Books for Young Adults several times from the American Library Association, and the gratitude of San Antonio Independent School District teachers for her poetry teaching packets. Nye is a Lannan Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and Poetry Foundation Young People's Poet Laureate for 2019-2021. Nye referred to herself as an "itinerant writer," referring to the twelve years from 1974-1986 she spent teaching poetry in schools around Texas, while also writing and publishing. Nye lists her early influences, starting at age five, as Carl Sandberg, Margaret Wise Brown, Emily Dickinson, William Blake, and Louisa May Alcott. High School and college influences include Henry David Thoreau, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Gary Snyder, Gertrude Stein, and William Stafford; the last of whom Nye was able to work with, and she became friends with Stafford and his family.
Nye began writing early in life, publishing poetry at age 7 and continuing throughout her childhood. She wrote a column for teens in high school, and while teaching across Texas and the country she continued to write and publish. While teaching children poetry during the Gulf War, which began in 1991, Nye read the students poetry written by Iraqi writers, and ultimately edited This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from Around the World, which includes 129 poets from 68 countries. Her young adult novel Going Going, 2005, is an attempt to recognize and document her neighborhood in San Antonio, Texas as it changed due to gentrification. This attention to the connection of people across the world, and their local daily realities, imbues Nye's work. For Nye, the best audience is children, and she does not recognize a distinction between adult and children's writing. While writing poetry for adults in the 1970s and 1980s, Nye searched for cross-over texts to use with the young people she was teaching. In the 1990s her editor Virginia Duncan suggested she write for children, which she did with Sitti's Secrets, and continues today. To date, Nye has published audio recordings of songs she wrote and sang; children's books, including picture books, poetry, poetry anthologies, and young adult novels; written and edited poetry for adults; served as a columnist for Organica and poetry editor for The Texas Observer; and contributed to numerous poetry anthologies and periodicals.
Naomi Nye and her family moved to Jerusalem when she was in high school, around 1965, where she met her father's family for the first time. Nye attended a school that instructed in Arabic, Armenian, and English, though she only knew English. After the 6-Day War in 1967, she moved with her parents and brother to San Antonio, Texas, where she still resides. Nye graduated from high school in Texas without ever having attended a football game, and in honor of this accomplishment the football players bought her a mum. Nye attended Trinity University in San Antonio and lived with her parents. She graduated summa cum laude in 1974 with a degree in English and World Religions. In 1978, Nye married Michael Nye, a lawyer-turned-photographer, and in 1986 they had a son, Madison Cloudfeather. After college, Naomi and Michael traveled extensively in Mexico and Central America, which produced many unpublished poems from this time period, and in response to the Mexican American culture in San Antonio but lack of Mexican culture, the anthology The Tree Is Older than You Are: A Bilingual Gathering of Poems and Stories from Mexico with Paintings by Mexican Artists, decades later in 1995. Nye continued her high school work of essayist, writing numerous articles on topics from poetry to politics to housework for various newspapers, served as a columnist for Organica: A Magazine of Art and Activism.
Nye was the most active employee at the Texas Commission on the Arts Writers in the Schools Project, working across Texas and publishing chapbook and poetry. She stopped this work in 1986 when her son was born. Nye also worked as a visiting instructor or writer in residence across US colleges and schools, as well as internationally, including at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Hawai'i Manoa, the University of Texas at Austin and at San Antonio, and Texas State University in San Marcos.
Nye also contributed to two PBS television series, the "Language of Life" with Bill in 1995, and "The United States of Poetry" in 1996. As a young woman in the late 1970s, Nye wrote songs and played guitar and sang in coffee shops and for schoolchildren. She recorded an album of children's songs, Rutabaga-Roo in 1979, and an album of folk songs, Lullaby Raft in 1981. Nye writes for adults and children, is adept in multiple genres, finds home in her backyard and wherever in the world she travels, and teaches and edits anthologies as well as writes poetry. Similarly, she is both loving and accepting of all people, and a fierce activist for peace and justice.

Clarence Samuel Kindrick (November 3, 1934 -) is a Texas journalist, author and publisher. The longtime newspaper reporter and columnist is best known as the founder of Action Magazine in March 1975 and for his wild and wooly chronicling of the outlaw country music movement of the 1970s from his home base of San Antonio and Bulverde.
Kindrick was born in San Antonio and grew up in a religious household in Junction. He graduated from Junction High School in 1953 and graduated from Southwest Texas State University in 1957.
After short stints at the Bay City News and the Kerrville Daily Times, Kindrick joined the San Angelo Standard Times in 1958 as a general assignments reporter. In 1960, he was hired by the San Antonio Express-News where he worked as a reporter and columnist until 1975.
Kindrick forged close bonds with Willie Nelson, Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown, Kinky Friedman, Hondo Crouch and Jerry Jeff Walker, adopted their redneck rock attitude, look and partying ways. His outrageous gonzo style of reporting made him the Hunter S. Thompson of the emerging music scene.
Ron Young was the founder and publisher of the pioneering indie music newspaper It's Only Rock 'N' Roll. The longtime music journalist, songwriter and musician grew up in San Antonio, where he graduated from Robert E. Lee High School. He studied journalism at the University of Texas at Austin. Young was an avid record collector and in the 1970s was a columnist and music critic at the daily newspaper San Antonio Light, and later a regular contributor to the San Antonio Express-News. The easygoing writer once described himself as the Bob Newhart of rock and roll. Young later moved to Nashville, Tennessee and became a published songwriter. He died in San Antonio from complications of cancer on May 11, 2017. He was 67.
Maury Maverick Jr. (1921-2003) was a member of the prominent San Antonio Maverick family who traces their lineage back to the Texas Revolution. Throughout his life, Maverick worked as a lawyer, politician, and activist. He served in the Marine Corps during World War II after which he got his law degree. In 1950, following in his father's footsteps, he was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House of Representatives where he supported workers rights and civil rights. He also opposed the persecution of suspected communists during the Red Scare.
In the 1960s, Maverick left his political career and went to work for the American Civil Liberties Union where he represented civil rights activists, communists, and those opposing the Vietnam War. He left his legal career in 1980 and became a columnist for the San Antonio Express News where he continued to write in support of civil rights and worker's rights. He faced backlash later in his career from the Jewish community in Texas for his support of Palestine in the Palestinian and Israeli conflict. This collection mainly consists of documents from this time in his life forward. He stayed with the San Antonio Express News until his death in 2003. His last column was a condemnation of the Iraq War. He is remembered for his activism, and a San Antonio library was built in his honor.
Frank Waters was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado on July 25, 1902. He felt a deep connection with the geographic area known as the American Southwest that could be seen in many of his writings. His works were inspired by this deep connection of this geographic area in addition to many other topics and themes related to the American Southwest. Over the course of his lifetime, Waters wrote and published over 25 books, in addition to other works, beginning early on his life, when his short story "How It Was Settled" was first published in 1916 when Waters was fourteen. While Waters wrote many influential books and other written works, he is probably best known for his book The Man Who Killed the Deer, which was published in 1942.
Waters spent most of his life in New Mexico, particularly in Arroyo Seco, where he moved to after working for the office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington D.C. in the early 1940s. In addition to his writings, Waters was also the editor of El Crepusculo, a Spanish-English newspaper that operates out of Taos, New Mexico from 1949 to 1951 and book reviewer for the Saturday Review of Literature from 1950 to 1956. In 1992, the Frank Waters Foundation was established in his name with the idea of encouraging literary and artistic advancement in the spirit of Frank Waters and for the American Southwest. Much of the Frank Waters Papers is related to the efforts of this organization. Waters died at the age of 92 in Arroyo Seco, New Mexico on June 3,1995.
Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez (1940-) became an authority on Tejano music through his work as a journalist, photographer, publicist, collector, and musicologist. Hern√°ndez was born on the West Side of San Antonio. He grew up loving music, and during his teenage years he formed a band with some classmates, but soon realized that his skills were better suited behind the scenes (the band later became The Monsanto Band). After he graduated from San Antonio's Brackenridge High School in 1960, he joined the U.S. Navy, where he became a naval intelligence officer and learned to speak five languages. It was during his military career that he found his interest as a photographer and writer. By 1968, while still in the Navy, he was freelancing as a photographer on the sets of the popular The Lawrence Welk Show and The Andy Williams Show. In 1983, he retired from the military and returned to San Antonio.
In 1985, Hern√°ndez was hired by the San Antonio Express-News to write about the local Tejano and conjunto scene. He soon began writing for other publications, including Full Tilt Boogie, La Prensa de San Antonio, and Billboard Magazine. There are many of his drafts as well as published articles in the collection.
At the same time, he started doing publicity and photography for many of the musicians he wrote about. His clients included some of the most popular names in Tejano music: Selena, Little Joe Hernandez, Patsy Torres, Los Desporadoz, Emilio Navaira, Ram Herrera, among many others. He also collected artifacts and ephemera from the early days of Tejano, conjunto, and orquesta music, preserving material from such influential artists as Lydia Mendoza, Isidro "El Indio" Lopez, Rosita Fernandez, Juan Gaytan, Narciso Martinez, and Beto Villa.
By 1990, his collection became known as the Hispanic Entertainment Archive and Research Center. Hern√°ndez wanted to create a museum that honored the legacy of Hispanics in all areas of entertainment. That goal never materialized; however, he loaned out many items from his collection for display at events and at museums including the Bob Bullock Museum, Institute of Texan Culture, and in 2017, at The Wittliff Collections with the exhibit "The Legends of Tejano Music - Highlights from the Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez Collection."
Hern√°ndez's desire to promote Hispanic entertainers can also be seen in his 1990 creation of the National Hispanic Entertainment Directory, a massive undertaking where he published the contact information of bands, vocalists, venues, record labels, record stores, and most areas of the Tejano music industry. There are quite a few records related to this venture in the collection.
During the 1990s through the early 2000s, Hern√°ndez also worked as a publicist and promoter for many of the prominent Tejano record labels including Hacienda, CARA, and Tejano Discos (Little Joe Hernandez's label). Hern√°ndez continues to be a prolific writer with regular columns in Street Talk and online blogs. He published his first book The Latinaires, La Familia, Little Joe y m√°s, in 2020. He lives in San Antonio with his wife, Martha.
Sergio Troncoso (1961-) was born to Mexican immigrants in the Ysleta neighborhood of El Paso, Texas. The family lived in a colonia near the border in a house that Troncoso's parents built, but without electricity or running water for their first two years in Ysleta.
His family had a long history of writing and storytelling. Troncoso's paternal grandfather, Santiago Troncoso, was the editor and publisher of El Dia, the first daily newspaper in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Santiago was arrested multiple times, and even had his office firebombed several times, for reporting on government corruption. Sergio's maternal grandmother, Dolores Rivero, was a gifted oral storyteller who would tell him stories of being a teenager during the Mexican Revolution.
From an early age, Troncoso loved reading. On weekends he would often ride his bike the 15 miles to El Paso Public Library to check out books for the week. Troncoso attended Ysleta High School, and following in his grandfather's footsteps, he became the editor of the high school newspaper, the Pow Wow (full issues can be found in the collection).
In 1979, Troncoso began his studies at Harvard College, which he describes as a complete cultural and linguistic shock. It was there that Troncoso became profoundly aware of his Mexican roots in a way that hadn't been possible in El Paso. As he puts it in a 2004 profile in the Houston Chronicle, "Suddenly I was brown against this white background." After never feeling like a minority in El Paso, he used this new outsider status to delve into Latin American and Mexican history. In 1983, he graduated magma cum laude with a degree in Government, with a Latin American Certificate. After he graduated, he received a Fulbright Scholarship to Mexico where he studied economics, politics, and literature.
From 1985-1992, Troncoso earned graduate degrees in International Relations and in Philosophy from Yale University, where his interests included questions of the self, philosophy and psychology, and philosophy in literature. But before he earned his doctorate, he realized that his academic work was isolating, and that while he couldn't necessarily discuss the details of what he was learning with his family, he could tell stories. His first published short story "The Abuelita" (1987), was a fictionalized account of the intersection of the knowledge that he was learning at Yale with the people and places of Ysleta. This exploration of deep philosophical questions in a border setting is a theme that runs throughout his career.
Troncoso's first book of collected work, The Last Tortilla and Other Stories (1999) was published by University of Arizona Press, and includes "The Abuelita." It won the Premio Aztl√°n Literary Prize for the best book by a new Chicano writer, and also the Southwest Book Award from the Border Regional Library Association.
Troncoso's debut novel, The Nature of Truth (2003), was first published by Northwestern University Press and later revised and re-released in 2014 by Arte P√∫blico. In this philosophical thriller, a Yale graduate student finds out that his boss, an internationally renowned German professor, is hiding a Nazi past.
Crossing Borders: Personal Essays (2011) contains sixteen autobiographical essays, exploring how Troncoso navigates a life full of literal and metaphorical borders. It won the Bronze Award for Essays from ForeWord Reviews, and Second Place for Best Biography in English in the International Latino Book Awards.
From This Wicked Patch of Dust (2011) is a novel that chronicles the lives of the Ysleta-based Martinez family over the span of forty years. It won multiple awards and was named as one of the best books of the year by Kirkus Reviews, and was shortlisted as runner-up for the biannual PEN/Texas Southwest Book Award for Fiction.
On July 29, 2014, the El Paso City Council voted unanimously to rename the Ysleta public library branch in honor of Troncoso. At the dedication ceremony, he announced the creation of the annual Troncoso Reading Prizes to encourage students in the Ysleta area to read.
In 2019, Troncoso published a collection of linked short stories on immigration, A Peculiar Kind of Immigrant's Son (Cinco Puntos Press) to critical acclaim. In 2020, it won First Place in the category of Best Collection of Short Stories (English/Bilingual) at the International Latino Book Awards.
In 2020, Troncoso was elected President of the Texas Institute of Letters. Other honors include being inducted into the Hispanic Scholarship Fund's Hall of Fame as well as serving as a judge for multiple literary awards such as the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. As of 2020, Troncoso lives in New York City with his wife Laura and their two sons. He teaches writing at Yale Writers' Workshop.
Ralph B. Sipper and Carol Sipper established Joseph The Provider/Books, an internationally known rare-book firm in 1970. Since 1996 he has been conducting business under his own name. He is a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America and has served on that organization's board of governors.
In 1970, Larry McMurtry founded Booked Up in Washington, D.C., and the two bookmen developed a long friendship over their mutual interests. In his 2021 obituary for McMurtry, Sipper recounts that over 50 years, "Larry and I discussed books on a professional level or swapped stories about our colleagues." They occasionally met in person, but primarily communicated via letters.
Western historian and author of over 20 books, Dale Watson served as Director of the Western Press at The University of El Paso for nearly 30 years. He was also a friend and chess opponent of Cormac McCarthy.
Texas Monthly magazine was founded in 1972 by its publisher, Michael R. Levy, a 26 year-old native Dallasite who was "convinced that my state was ready for a really first class magazine that will appeal directly to the sophisticated, cosmopolitan folks that Texans have become." (Texas Monthly, Feb. 1973). Levy brought aboard 27 year-old William Broyles, Jr. as editor. Broyles assembled an editorial staff that was short on journalistic experience but imbued with curiousity, intelligence, irreverence, and literary skills. Many of Texas Monthly's early staffers were friends of Broyles from Rice University, where the intellectual climate helped set the tone for the magazine. As Broyles later wrote, "If any one quality unites these farflung efforts, it is a boundless curiosity. Most of our stories began with one of us saying "I wonder..." (The Best of Texas Monthly: The First Five Years.)
Texas Monthly's first issue was published in February 1973, and it was not an immediate commercial success, selling only about 35,000 copies. But the magazine quickly gained recognition for offering a significant departure from the rest of the state's media. Texas Monthly contained intelligent and entertaining examinations of Texas life ranging from politics, culture, art, sports, personalities, lifestyles, the environment, fashion, crime, business, education, entertainment, and travel. Along the way, the magazine began to define how Texas was emerging as a contemporary urban state while still clinging to its rural mythic past.
From its beginnings, Texas Monthly developed a reputation as a "writer's magazine," and it helped develop new generations of writing talent while also offering a welcome forum for established voices. Texas Monthly hired many young writers as full-time staff members with benefits, creating a community of professional writers centered near the magazine's home base in Austin.
In 1974, after only one year of existence, the editorial staff's efforts were rewarded with a National Magazine Award (the industry equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize) for Specialized Journalism. Since then Texas Monthly has established a solid reputation for editorial excellence, winning eight National Magazine Awards and 38 nominations- a record surpassed by only The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and Esquire.
Over the next several decades, Texas Monthly has evolved and changed under new editorships and owners, but it remains the "National Magazine of Texas," chronically life in the Lone Star State, exploring its politics and personalities, barbecue and business, true crime and tacos, honky-tonks and hiking.
Beverly Lowry was born August 10, 1938, in Memphis, Tennessee, and moved with her family at age six to Greenville, Mississippi. She attended the University of Mississippi (1956-58) and graduated with a B.A. from Memphis State University in 1960. She married Glenn Lowry in June 1960, and moved with him to Manhattan. There, she pursued acting and experimented in writing. After relocating to Houston in 1965, and sending the younger of her two sons to nursery school Lowry began to write stories, some of which blossomed into novels. Lowry began teaching fiction writing as an associate professor at the University of Houston in 1976, while also pursuing acting, and serving on boards for the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, and for Houston Festival. Her fiction writing has typically been set in Texas and Mississippi. Her first two novels, Come Back, Lolly Ray and Emma Blue were both set in Eunola, Mississippi a fictional town much like her hometown of Greenville. Her next three novels and one work of non-fiction were set in Texas, with her most recent novel, The Track of Real Desires, being again set in the fictional Eunola, Mississippi.
The Lowrys lived just outside San Marcos along the San Marcos River from 1981-1991. One of the Lowrys' two sons, Peter, died in a hit-and-run accident on the highway from San Marcos to their home in 1984. This experience and other personal losses in the early 1980s "caused a marked change in the tone of Lowry's fiction. Gone is her unqualified faith in the future; present is a new preoccupation with fate or chance, even a hint that felicity may invite disaster," (Contemporary Southern Writers, St. James Press, 1999). These themes of isolation and alienation appear in The Perfect Sonya (1987), The Track of Real Desires (1994), and clearly in Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir (1992). Beginning in 1989, Lowry approached and visited convicted pickaxe murderer Karla Faye Tucker, on death row in Hunstville, Texas. Crossed Over relates the story of Karla Faye Tucker as well as some of Lowry's own personal story, resulting in "far more than the usual true-crime tale. Lowry interwove the story of her own troubled son with a chilling account of Tucker's dangerously out-of-control life to achieve an understanding of the human being behind an ostensibly inhuman act; her leap of imagination and empathy enabled her, at last, to make peace with Peter's death," (Texas Monthly, Feb. 2001). Lowry moved to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and currently teaches at George Mason University, in Virginia. She continues to write essays and non-fiction, and has been working on a biography of Madame C. J. Walker, the first African-American woman to become a self-made millionaire.
John Emil Sepich is a historian and scholar of Cormac McCarthy. He is author of Notes on Blood Meridian.
Austin-based author and journalist Mike Cox began donating his papers to the Southwestern Writers Collection/The Wittliff Collections in 1993.
Inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters in 1993, Cox is the author of 22 non-fiction books and hundreds of articles, essays and newspaper columns. A native of Amarillo who grew up in Austin, he sold his first magazine story to The Cattleman in 1964 and has been writing professionally ever since.
In addition to his other writing, for more than 30 years he reviewed Texas-related books for the Austin American-Statesman. In 2010, he received the A.C. Green Lifetime Achievement Award. Over the years, his work has earned numerous other recognitions. His most noted work is a two-volume, quarter-million-word history of the Texas Rangers published in 2008-2009. In 2014, his book Cowboy Stuntman was one of two finalists for a Western Writers of America Golden Spur Award. The same book also was nominated to receive a Will Rogers Medallion from the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. Cox lives in Austin and continues to write.

JuVee Productions has optioned the film rights and Viola Davis will play Rachel DuPree. Filming is scheduled for 2018.
Weisgarber's second novel, The Promise, takes place in 1900 on Galveston Island at the time of America's deadliest natural disaster. It was shortlisted for the United Kingdom's Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction, was the finalist for the Spur Award for Best Western Historical Fiction, and was a finalist for the Ohioana Book Award for Fiction. Her third book to date, The Glovemaker, was published in 2018 and is set in Utah's deep canyon country during the winter of 1888.
Weisgarber's archive preserves many aspects of her writing career: her early works including poetry and short stories, interviews, manuscript drafts, research materials, correspondence with editors, agents, and readers, reviews and publicity material, foreign editions and artifacts. Also present are materials from her tenure as the artist-in-residence at Badlands National Park while she was working on The Personal History of Rachel Dupree.
Weisgarber was born and raised in Ohio and graduated from Wright State University in Dayton with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work. She earned a Master of Arts in Sociology from the University of Houston and became a social worker in psychiatric and nursing home facilities and also taught sociology at Wharton County Junior College in Texas.

In a career that has spanned almost half a century, Benson has established himself as the modern king of Western Swing by being the driving force behind Asleep at the Wheel. In 1970 the Philadelphia-born Benson co-founded the band in Paw Paw, West Virginia along with Lucky Oceans and Leroy Preston. The band relocated to the Bay Area in 1971 upon the urging of musician Commander Cody, whose own band The Lost Planet Airmen was gaining prominence on the West Coast. Asleep at the Wheel quickly attracted fans, one of which was legendary rock and soul artist, Van Morrison. Soon after Morrison mentioned the band in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Asleep at the Wheel were offered a record contract by United Artists, and in 1973 their first album "Comin' Right At Ya" was released.

Russell Lee was born on July 21, 1903, in Ottawa, Illinois. His parents' divorce, the death of his mother, and supervision by three successive guardians created an unsettled childhood for Lee. In 1917 he was sent to Culver Military Academy (CMA), which provided some stability in his life. He attended CMA until 1921, then enrolled at Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1925 with a degree in chemical engineering and joined the Certainteed Products Company in Marseilles, Illinois.
In 1927 he married painter Doris Emrick. The following year, Lee was transferred to Kansas City, where he became so bored with his job he resigned to pursue painting.¬†After moving to San Francisco in 1929, the Lees resettled a year later in an artists colony in Woodstock, New York.¬†Lee subsequently became increasingly frustrated with his limitations as a painter. In 1935, at the suggestion of a friend, he bought his first camera and his enthusiasm for photography quickly grew.¬†He explored the technical aspects of the craft, experimenting with developing chemicals, exposure speeds, and flash photography techniques.
Lee began taking documentary photographs in Woodstock in 1935 and went to Pennsylvania to photograph bootleg coal miners.¬†The winter of 1935 found him in New York City documenting the poor and their living conditions.¬†Shortly after, he acquired an agent and began selling his work to magazines.¬†In 1936, Lee joined the photographic staff of the Resettlement Administration, later renamed the Farm Security Administration (FSA), where he worked under the creative supervision of Roy Stryker, director of photographic projects.¬†His colleagues included Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein, Walker Evans, and Carl Mydans.¬†During his FSA years, Lee traveled throughout the United States, documenting life in rural and urban communities.¬†He developed a flash technique that enabled him to take innovative and candid interior photographs. He also specialized in taking pictures in series, most notably those shot in Pie Town, New Mexico, and San Augustine, Texas.
The long periods away from his wife while working for the FSA contributed to their divorce in 1938.¬†On assignment in New Orleans the same year, he met Jean Smith, a Dallas journalist.¬†They began working together and eventually married.
In 1943, Lee received a captain's commission in the Air Transport Command (ATC). He traveled military transport routes taking aerial photographs, visiting the West Indies, North Africa, India, and China.¬†Lee was promoted to major and received the Air Medal.
About a year after leaving the ATC, in 1946, Lee was hired by the Department of the Interior's Coal Mines Administration to take photographs for a major report on health and safety conditions in bituminous coal mines.
The Lees moved to Austin, Texas, in 1947.¬†At the request of his former FSA chief, Roy Stryker, Lee worked for Standard Oil of New Jersey, documenting the oil industry at home and overseas.¬†Lee continued with industrial photography projects throughout the 1950's, visiting Saudi Arabia and Europe.¬†He contributed to Fortune magazine and was an associate staff member of the prestigious Magnum photographic cooperative.
Between 1949 and 1962, Lee conducted a photographic workshop at the University of Missouri.¬†In 1950, Lee worked with The University of Texas on a study of Spanish-speaking people in Texas.¬†He contributed to the Texas Observer and between 1952 and 1957 covered Ralph Yarborough's election campaigns. His coverage of a 1956 Texas primary campaign appeared in The New York Times. The September, 1961, issue of Texas Quarterly published 150 of some 4,000 photographs taken during a two-and-a-half month visit to Italy. 
In 1965, The University of Texas at Austin presented an exhibition of Lee's photographs and he was invited to join the university's art faculty as an instructor in photography.¬†He taught until his retirement in 1973.¬†Russell Lee died on August 28, 1986.

The Common Experience tradition began with the 2004-05 academic year. It "brings students together to read and engage with a powerful text, explore related themes in University Seminar classes, write responses and reactions to the text in writing courses, participate in related symposia with scholarly panels, hear renowned and respected speakers address the topic, see films related to the Common Experience theme, explore the experience by way of the fine arts, engage in informal discussions in residence halls and coffee shops, and extend the exploration via the avenues of their own choosing." Beginning in 2007, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Distinguished Lecture Series was held in conjunction with the Common Experience.

Each year since 2004, diverse groups of faculty, staff, and students have created distinctive experiences for our campus and community, with presentations by some of the world's most important voices on the issues of our time. Speakers have included poet Maya Angelou, filmmaker Spike Lee, writer Isabel Allende, broadcast journalist Soledad O'Brien, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, Adm. William McRaven, attorney Bryan Stevenson, astronaut Jos√© Hern√°ndez, and Oscar/Grammy-winner Common. In fall 2020, the Common Experience presented live online events with John Qui√±ones of ABC News (and host of What Would You Do?) and U.S. Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez. Additionally, there have been many special events, such as Innovation Week in 2018, which offered 50-plus events over five days for learning and engaging with new ideas on campus.
Common Experience proposals should establish strong connections to a theme and events that cross academic boundaries, creating junctions for Academic Affairs and Student Affairs.

The themes and emotions that O'Brien explores in the context of Vietnam are the themes and emotions of human life: friendship, patriotism, duty, sacrifice, leadership, innocence and experience, good and evil, humanity and inhumanity. Arguably the central theme in much of O'Brien's work - a theme he explores with passion and honesty - is Courage. Courage offers a relevant, challenging, and inspiring theme for the 2005-2006 Common Experience.
Common Experience theme explores the trials of segregation and the impact of integration, raising the question of how we internalize change in this 50-year celebration of the desegregation of Texas State. A closer exploration of desegregation reveals a long and difficult struggle to achieve one of modern democracy's great promises, equal access to a quality education. Specifically, we use this 50-year anniversary of the desegregation of our institution as an opportunity to examine issues related to equal access to higher education and the role of laws, litigation, and civil rights movements in helping students obtain higher education. This theme also makes a connection to the 2008-2009 Common Experience theme, "Civic Responsibility and the Legacy of LBJ," celebrating our most famous alumnus, Lyndon Baines Johnson. Bringing LBJ into the conversation emphasizes the role he played in making these changes happen and helps build pride in Texas State and its graduates.
--from the Common Experience Website The theme of "Bridged Through Stories: Shared Heritage of the United States and Mexico" will highlight the work and values of Tom√°s Rivera as well as those of others from all walks of life who have contributed to the fabric of our common understandings of the world. Through specific attention to connections between stories of Mexico and the United States, this theme will highlight multiple perspectives that contribute to community building, affirmations of identity, and collective struggles to make the world a more just place for everyone.
--from the Common Experience Website Through gaining a stronger comprehension of concepts of justice and crime, students will gain a greater appreciation of a core principle of their democratic system as it pertains to their own fields, as well as to their participation in the process of governance (both as citizens and future leaders). This theme helps students understand some of the more serious repercussions of decisions made by law enforcement, courts, parole boards, and even our elected representatives for both offenders and victims.
--from the Common Experience Website The key to this sustained success: Innovation.
The 2018-19 Common Experience theme focuses on innovation as a means to engage students, faculty, staff, and the community/region in a conversation about the ideas and opportunities that will shape our future, here at Texas State and throughout the world ‚Äî and beyond.
This theme presents an opportunity not only for innovation to inspire a conversation but also for that conversation to inspire innovation. With eyes to the future, we have an opportunity to draw the connections between the world of innovation and Texas State while also raising Texas State's visibility and reputation in innovating the world...
Innovation is sometimes simple and sometimes remarkably difficult. Major obstacles can hinder progress on any project in any discipline, whether inside a classroom or outside in fieldwork ‚Äî both in education and the workplace. How we overcome those obstacles demonstrates yet another dimension to innovation.
The world is rapidly changing, and this Common Experience theme aspires to immerse students in that change to become active participants in it.
Many voices. One theme: Innovation.
--from the Common Experience Website While investigating Truth through University Seminar (US 1100) courses, students will understand how truth operates in the context of a university and how students, faculty, and staff seek truths on a daily basis through courses and research. However, truth is not limited to the academic environment ‚Äî by interrogating common frameworks of truth from nuanced, multidisciplinary lenses, we're empowering students to navigate post-graduate life with an unparalleled critical thinking skill set. This theme will catalyze a collaboration among students, faculty, staff, and the surrounding community. Together, we will discuss the meaning, nature, embodiment, and action of truth and how all involved can become more involved and empathic global citizens. ...
All past Common Experience themes have explored truth. However, by focusing solely on the concept, students can look at truth through every lens: a quest for truth, a search for truth, and an examination of authenticity. Areas of exploration will range from an understanding of university truth ‚Äî in scholarship and research ‚Äî to a definition of Universal Truth with a capital T, and from one's own personal truth to a sense of honesty, accuracy, validity, and truthfulness.
--from the Common Experience Website Clyde Beatty was a circus entertainer and lion tamer who ran his own circus. After facing financial hardship in 1956 Beatty sold his circus to Frank McClosky and Walter Kernan. In 1959 the circus was renamed The Clyde Beatty Cole Bros. Circus. Clyde Beatty continued to perform with the show until his death in 1965.
The glass plate negatives in this collection are of the "dry" type, which was a significant innovation. Before their invention in 1871, photographers had to prepare the glass plates and apply emulsions, expose, and develop them while still "wet." To process, or develop, the images, photographers needed a place that was free from light, a "darkroom." Thus, wet plate photographers needed either to remain close to their darkrooms or recreate them in the field.
Dry plate emulsions did not have the same time limitations as wet plate. Their stability allowed for greater mobility and convenience. Photographers could wait to expose their plates and then store them back in the box until they could be developed. Nevertheless, glass plates remained fragile and surprisingly heavy.
While dry glass plates allowed the practice of photography to spread to a larger number of people, it was the invention of roll film (1887) and Kodak's Brownie box camera (1900) which made photography widely accessible to the general public. Roll film was stable, lightweight, and a roll could be mailed to Kodak for developing and printing.
The photographer for this collection was using dry plates, we know they carried these heavy and fragile plates to locations to expose them, then carried them back to the darkroom to process them. The photographer likely needed considerable chemical and technical knowledge, specialized darkroom materials and equipment, and a dedicated work space to develop their plates and print photographs.
The glass plates arrived in Cramer's Lightning Dry Plate negative boxes. Mr. Cramer was a national supplier of dry plates beginning 1883.

Early in his career at Southwest Texas State, Dr. Nolle formed a relationship with future U.S. Senator and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The two corresponded until Johnson's death and Nolle maintained an interest in following Johnson's political career.
Dr. Nolle served in a number of educational organizations during his career. At Southwest Texas State Teachers College, he served as the sponsor of extra-curricular clubs devoted to studying the German language, including Die Germanistische Gesellschaft and Der Schiller Verein. Nolle served as a member of the Committee on Standards and Classification of the Association of Texas Colleges from 1923 to 1959 and was chair of the committee from 1939 to 1959. He was also involved in the founding of the Scholarship Societies of Texas which became Alpha Chi, a national honor society. Nolle served as president of the organization in 1927 and then as secretary-treasurer from 1928 through 1969.
For his contributions to education in Texas, Nolle received the honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from the East Texas Baptist College in 1957.

It was first produced in showcase production at Actor's Studio, New York City, October 27-November 12, 1977. It then opened off-Broadway at Intermedia Theatre in April 1978, and moved to Broadway's 46th Street Theatre, on June 19, 1978, where its success supported 1,584 performances over the next four and half years and garnered King a Tony award nomination.
The files in this series include scripts, sheet music, screenplay drafts, a playbook, playbills, posters, flyers, reviews, clippings, photographs, tickets, T-shirts, a jacket, promotional buttons, congratulations and a 1981 cartoon by Patrick Oliphant drawn on a napkin.
The Kingfish, a one-man play about the flamboyant Louisiana Governor Huey P. Long, was written with long-time friend and Texas legislator, Ben Z. Grant. Found here are scripts, programs, playbills, the SMU Press book jacket and clippings.
The Night Hank Williams Died premiered at the Memphis State University theatre. After several revisions, the play received its world premiere in Washington, D.C. in 1988. The following year it opened Off-Broadway. For this play, King received the Theatre Lobby Trust's 1988 Mary Goldwater Award for his contribution as playwright and actor and the 1989 Helen Hayes Award for best new play. These files contain scripts, correspondence on rewrites and production prospects, congratulations, awards, flyers, posters, playbills, audition notes, reviews, clippings, SMU Press proofs, a playbook and screenplays.
The Golden Shadows Old West Museum was also tried out first in a workshop production at Memphis State University. These files contain a script, correspondence on revisions, playbills, flyers, reviews, and posters.
In addition to the above material, this series includes an outline of The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public, a playbook for a one-act play titled Christmas: 1933 and a playbill for the same one-act under the original title, That Terrible Night Santa Got Lost In The Woods, and a prospectus and treatment for "Road Story" an aborted project with Glenn Frey and Jimmy Buffett, put together by the New York producer Rocco Landesman.
Also included in this series is research material and a script for a never-completed project on Lydia Thompson, an English burlesque queen who was all the rage in late 19th century America.
This series covers King's contributions to magazines and newspapers from his days with the Odessa-American in the 1950s, through his stint in Washington as editor of Capitol Hill, to his work for national magazines including Harper's, Life, Esquire, The Progressive, Sports Illustrated, Sport, Cosmopolitan, Playboy and Parade. The series contains tear sheets, and in some cases, whole copies of the magazine in which the article appeared. In addition, King's collection of The Texas Observer, to which he was a frequent contributor, is included. These issues have been removed from the plastic, colored, 3-ring binders in which King kept them. There are tear sheets for King's column for New Times and Washington Star, and newspaper clippings of his book reviews. The files contain galley proofs, magazines, cover pages, tear sheets and newspaper clippings and are arranged chronologically.
This series contains only one file. Something Went With Daddy appeared in the literary journal, Story, in Autumn 1990. It contains the original manuscript, a final edit, and a copy of the journal.
King won an Emmy in 1982 for his television contribution, CBS Reports: The Best Little Statehouse in Texas, which first aired in August 1981. These files include a videotape and transcript of the show as well as a publicizing post card. Here also is a proposal for a TV series with a political setting.
King penned some lyrics for his play The Night Hank Williams Died and later sold these along with others styled in a country and western vein in a package of ten.

"The Best Little Writer in Texas," Leslie White Clay, Southern Methodist University, 1986
"Perspectives on the South: The Writing of Willie Morris and Larry L. King," James B. Smith, Jr., University of Texas, May 21, 1973.
"Ruminating and Relating in the Texas Essay," Clifford, Craig Edward, Tarleton State University, undated
This series contains material, mostly clippings, King collected on contemporary writers. It includes a reminiscence of Billie Lee Brammer by Glenn Wilson of their days on Capitol Hill and a manuscript by Jack Runnel probably sent to King for his comments.
This series contains personal records such as report cards, army discharge, birth and marriage certificates. There are photographs of King, his family and friends, cancelled checks and tax records from the mid-1970s.
Correspondence forms the bulk of the King Papers, filling over 21 boxes. It is arranged chronologically, reflecting King's own arrangement -- he kept a box under his desk where he tosses the letters (with a copy of his response attached) as he answers them. When the box becomes full, King stuffs the letters into a large brown envelope upon which he marks the months and year covered.
The correspondence describes writing projects, including fan response and King's reaction to it. He is generous with advice to aspiring writers and frequently discusses the literary craft with his writer friends. Writer correspondents include Borden Deal, Ronnie Dugger, Peter Gent, A. C. Greene, Norman Mailer, Jay Milner, Willie Morris, Terry Pringle, Frank Rich, Edwin (Bud) Shrake, H. Allen Smith, William Styron, Barlow Herget, and, less frequently, Billy Lee Brammer, Jim Brosnan, Jim Lehrer, Larry McMurtry, Bill Moyers and Bill Wittliff. Other correspondents are the Texas attorney, Warren Burnett, King's cousin Lanvil Gilbert, legislator and The Kingfish co-writer Ben Z. Grant, Midland lawyer Reagan Legg, Director Keith Kennedy, high school coach Aubra Nooncaster, politicians Morris Udall and Jim Wright, and many more friends and family.
The archive contains book manuscripts, newspaper clippings, tear sheets, correspondence, photographs, and Brammer's high school baseball uniform pants. Included in the collection are the typed manuscripts of The Gay Place, and the unfinished sequel to that work, Fustian Days; newspaper and magazine articles written by Brammer; reviews for The Gay Place; and letters which describe Brammer's tenure as a Johnson staff member, his marriage to Nadine Eckhardt, and his writing.
This series contains Brammer's typed manuscripts of The Gay Place and the unfinished novel, Fustian Days. Both manuscripts are a gift from William Broyles, the first editor of Texas Monthly, who admired Brammer, hired him to write for the magazine, and encouraged him to write consistently again. The Gay Place manuscript is followed by the play adaptation, Come and Join the Dance, by Brammer's daughters, Sidney and Shelby. Included are Brammer's two Texas Observer articles: a tear sheet about the Observer editor, Ronnie Dugger, from the August 25, 1961, issue; and the January 10, 1963 edition, which contains Brammer's Glooey, a satire of the Kennedy White House based on J. D. Salinger's Frannie and Zooey. There is also a file of Brammer's jottings - a 1965 interview with a writer called Norman Maelstrom set in El End Zone; a memo of advice on running El End Zone; notes on the media, possibly written for the SMU journalism class; and a page titled "The Angst Book." (Ronnie Dugger in a reminiscence on Brammer states, "he made a bundle of journal type notes he called 'the Angst Books" [Washington Post, June 18, 1978].) These pieces were purchased from Larry McMurtry's bookstore, Booked Up, in 1988.
This series contains clippings and articles about Brammer, reviews of his work, and the eulogy presented at his funeral. Also included are correspondence - many from his publisher Houghton-Mifflin about The Gay Place, some from his agent, a few personal letters, and a dust jacket of The Gay Place. There are photos of Brammer with his family and friends, which were enlarged and duplicated by Bill Wittliff.¬†The material is filed in chronological order.
Nadine Eckhardt (nee Nadine Ellen Cannon) was the first wife of Billy Lee Brammer and the mother of his three children. The two met as students at North Texas State College and married on April 22, 1950. Nadine Brammer worked for a time on the Lyndon Baines Johnson staff along with her husband, but later returned with her children to live in Austin while Brammer remained in Washington. In 1961, the Brammers were divorced and in 1962, Nadine married Texas Congressman Bob Eckhardt. Her papers contain Brammer's school records, his Air Force application, correspondence, and a file on The Gay Place. The bulk of the correspondence comes from those times during the Brammers' marriage when they lived separately - while Nadine lived in her parents' home in McAllen during her first pregnancy, and while she lived with the children in Austin when Brammer worked as a Johnson staff member in Washington. Their letters discuss their marriage, their children, work, and Brammer's writing. Brammer writes about his Washington staff job, Johnson, and other staff aides. There are also letters to and from Brammer's McAllen in-laws, the Cannons. Photographs and clippings are interspersed throughout the correspondence. The final folders contain The Gay Place file, which contains a wide range of information related to the book and the author. In the divorce settlement, Nadine received one-half interest in The Gay Place; and the collection of these materials is related to that interest. It consists of reviews, sales records, examples of Brammer's newspaper writing, clippings about Brammer, Brammer memos to Johnson, etc. In 1976, Nadine Eckhardt considered writing an autobiography and she asked Brammer to collaborate with her, hoping to spark Brammer back into writing. This project produced a chronology and a few notes from Brammer. There is also a chronology of Johnson's activities from 1955 to 1956, which Nadine Eckhardt was given by government oral historian Michael L. Gillette to help her remember events for an interview. The material is in chronological order except for The Gay Place file, which is in the original filing order.
One hundred and fifty-two boxes of typescripts, galley proofs, notes, research files, correspondence, and artifacts, among other items, document the life and career of Edwin "Bud" Shrake (1931-2009). The collection is arranged into following series: Periodicals (1953-2006), Fiction (1959-2008), Screenplays/Teleplays (1970-1994), Playscripts (1977-1994), Non-fiction, Anthologies, Correspondence, Financial Papers, Corporations, Legal Papers, Research, Personal Papers and Other Writers, Correspondence (1936-2009, undated), Financial Papers (1963-2000), Corporations (1969-1995, undated), Legal Papers (1977-1997), Research (circa 1954-2006), Personal Papers (1901-2009, undated) and Other Writers, 1968-2007, undated).The Edwin "Bud" Shrake Papers reflect Shrake's 58-year career as a professional sportswriter, journalist, fiction writer, script writer, and non-fiction writer. Numerous drafts of his books and screenplays in the Works series give insight into Shrake's creative process. The many correspondence files show his relationship through the years with various editors, agents, friends, family members and fellow writers. Other aspects of Shrake's life like financial and legal matters, and personal effects like artwork and scrapbooks, are represented in the later series.
Arranged chronologically, this series includes photocopies and printouts of articles and columns written by Shrake and published in newspapers and magazines, from 1953-2006. These folders do not contain all of Shrake's published work in periodicals, particularly regarding his years as a sportswriter and police beat reporter in Fort Worth and Dallas. Most notably missing is anything from his work at the Dallas Times Herald.
The series is composed of two sub-series Published and Unpublished material.
Published material starts with the first short story Shrake published, in 1959, and ending with his last novel to be published, in 2006, this sub-series is arranged chronologically according to publication date. It contains handwritten, typewritten and computer-generated drafts, proofs of all kinds, correspondence, contracts, promotional materials, research files, and press clippings. The book with the most copious files is The Borderland, started in 1976 but not published until 2000. In general, the files for the earlier novels, being before the advent of computers, contain more materials like corrected drafts and proofs.
The Unpublished sub-series is arranged alphabetically, this is a much smaller sub-series than its predecessor, contains mainly early short stories and unfinished novels. One of the unfinished novels, "These Unhappy Occasions," led directly to Blessed McGill. Also included is a finished novel titled "Malibu Zulu" that Shrake completed in 2008 and intended to publish under a pen name. (It was published as Hollywood Mad Dogs in 2020).
This series is also divided into Produced and Unproduced work.
The Produced sub-series is arranged by production date. It contains similar materials: drafts, correspondence, contracts, promotional materials and press clippings. The three projects Shrake was most closely involved with ‚Äî Kid Blue, Songwriter and Pair of Aces ‚Äî contain the most materials. The Beverly Hills Cop II folders contain documents related to the unsuccessful arbitration Shrake and Dan Jenkins initiated in order to get writing credits on the movie.
The Unproduced sub-series is the most voluminous, reflecting Shrake's prolific work as a screenwriter from the early 1970s to the early 1990s. Except for the three film treatments at the beginning, the files are arranged alphabetically. Contents are typically drafts and treatments, with some correspondence and research. Those works that contain more materials than others often reflect that they were closer to being produced, such as with "The Big Mamoo," the various Pancho Villa projects, and "Slim and None." Shrake collaborated with Dan Jenkins in the 1970s and 80s on many of the unproduced screenplay efforts. Two of Shrake's attempts to turn his novels into films are also contained here: Strange Peaches and Limo, the latter written with Jenkins.
Again, this series is divided into Produced and Unproduced material.
The sub-series of produced works is arranged by production date. The bulk of the sub-series consists of Pancho Villa's Wedding Day, which, after Shrake turned it from a film script into a play script, underwent more incarnations, including as a musical. Numerous, corrected drafts are included, from 1977 to 1994, when he stopped revising it. The play was staged in 1984. The last play in the series, The Friend of Carlos Monzon, was staged posthumously, and materials from that production, though not directly donated by Shrake, are included.
The Unproduced sub-series contains only one untitled playscript, and notes, correspondence, research and a corrected draft for "Jack," a play Shrake co-wrote with Michael Rudman, but failed to get produced.
Though essentially consisting of only three projects, all published, this sub-series contains a voluminous amount of research on its subjects, especially Willie Nelson. Included in the Willie materials are numerous tapes and transcripts of interviews Shrake and others did with Nelson and his acquaintances. Also included are clipping files on Nelson and country music going back to 1978 (when Shrake was writing the Songwriter screenplay), and many files of corrected draft fragments. Notably, the opposite is true for the Barry Switzer book, Bootlegger's Boy‚Äîno research files are present in the papers, except for some clippings on Switzer gathered post-publication. The sub-series Harvey Penick Books contains drafts for all five Penick/Shrake books, plus research on Penick and golf, interviews, contracts, photographs, and all kinds of marketing materials. As with the files on Willie Nelson, the Harvey Penick files are ample with biographical information on their subject and insight into their subject's craft.
Interview cassettes: Betty Jameson, Tom Gresham, Mickey Wright, Mary Lena Faulk, John Trimble, Marshall Pengra, Bobby Moncrief, Harris Greenwood, Harris and Ed Turley, Harvey Penick - with notes attached (24-27 June 1991) (5)
Interview micro-cassettes: Sandra Palmer, Harvey Penick (July 1994, undated) (2), Tinsley Penick, Kathy Whitworth, women talking
This small series contains four drafts of the fiction piece, "How To Live Forever," first published in Land of the Permanent Wave.
Two main subseries constitute the Correspondence series: Alphabetical and Chronological. This arrangement reflects Shrake's, in that he filed some of his letters by correspondent, and some by year. Most correspondence in the Alphabetical sub-series are with friends, collaborators, and family members. The Chronological sub-series contains correspondence from a far wider range of addressors, some strangers to Shrake and others intimate friends.
A name index for the chronological letters is available in a separate document. See http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu/research/a-z/shrake.html or ask an archivist to see the document.
Please note that letters pertaining directly to writing projects are filed with those projects, as that is most often how Shrake filed them. Also note that some folders in this series are access restricted.
This series is arranged chronologically, and contains receipts, income taxes, expense reports, financial statements and other documents related to various aspects of Shrake's life. The financial records tend to give snapshots of Shrake's financial situation and lifestyle through the years, rather than a complete picture. Besides expense reports from Sports Illustrated that go to 1976, the financial records do not contain any documents between 1972 and 1980.
This series documents the two corporations that Shrake started and operated: Mad Dog, Inc. and East Pole Corporation. The Mad Dog, Inc. Corporate Structure and correspondence reflect the company's satirical nature. The East Pole Corporation materials include receipts, reports, a budget, tax records, pension plan and an embosser.
Seven subjects of a legal nature are documented in this series: Austin Sun Publishing Company, Jan Demetri, ICM Contracts, Gary DeShazo, D.W.I., Buttercup Mountain and Manny Newburger. The series is arranged chronologically.
Shrake kept subject files on a wide variety of topics, often having to do with ideas for writing projects. These files make up the Subject Files sub-series and are the bulk of the Research series. They are arranged alphabetically by subject. Also included in the Research series are the Notes and Notebooks sub-series, and books and general research. The series is arranged chronologically by sub-series
This series contains materials belonging to Shrake of a more personal nature and is arranged chronologically. The oldest item in this series, and in the collection, is Shrake's father's baby dress. Also included are certificates, clippings about Shrake and friends, photographs of Shrake, family and friends, scrapbooks, short stories written for class, two typewriters, a briefcase Shrake used for traveling on Sports Illustrated assignments, Shrake's leather office chair, artwork by Shrake and friends, property maintenance records, drafts of speeches, among other materials.
Shrake kept files of works by various writers, which are kept in this series. Some of these files contain editing notes by Shrake or correspondence from the writer. The series is arranged alphabetically by author's last name. Included are the production files for Another Pair of Aces, a TV movie written by Rob Gilmer that was a sequel to Shrake and Cartwright's Pair of Aces. Shrake was a co-producer of this movie. In the late 1990s, Roger Young wrote a screenplay for Blessed McGill, and worked with Shrake and G.W. Bailey to get it produced. The drafts and correspondence from this failed effort are included here. Shrake's good friends Gary Cartwright, Dan Jenkins, Larry L. King, Jay Milner, Willie Morris and Bill Wittliff have works in this series as well ‚Äî often more than one.
The Preston Jones papers span the years 1940 to 1988. The archive contains typescripts, set designs, playbills, props, clippings, magazines, articles, letters, photographs, personal items (pipes, glasses, keys, a stuffed bear collection, etc.), mementos (World War I items, ticket stubs, "good show" gifts, etc.), awards, posters, school records, sculptures, scrapbooks, audiotapes, videotapes, T-shirts, and athletic equipment. Most of the material was saved by Preston's widow, Mary Sue Jones. Mary Sue kept files on Preston and his career in several different file groups. These file groups have been rearranged and consolidated into chronological order within subjects. The records are comprised of five series: Early Years and Dallas Theater Center, Plays, Professional Files, Publicity Files, and Illness and Death. The series chronicle Preston's personal and professional life, from his childhood in New Mexico through his days as a successful playwright.
This series outlines Preston Jones' life before he became known as a playwright. It begins with photographs, articles and memorabilia of his father, James "Jawbone" Jones. It continues with boyhood photographs, yearbooks, memorabilia and drawings from his elementary school, high school, and college in New Mexico. Class notes, designs, school records, and diplomas represent his master's work in playwrighting from Baylor University in Waco and Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. Scrapbooks and photographs of Mary Sue and Preston's honeymoon trip to Europe in 1964 and subsequent trips and vacations to Europe and Colorado are present. Jones was an enthusiastic player of darts and baseball, and equipment from both sports is included here. His intense interest in World War I, in which his father had served, is well documented by pamphlets, photographs, slides, medals, posters, and military memorabilia as well as sculptures Preston made out of coffee stirrers, many of which represent World War I scenes. Included too in this series are personal items: wallets, slides, programs, posters, pipes, and other paraphernalia. Finally there is material on Jones' career at the Dallas Theater Center in the form of scrapbooks, audiotapes and photographs.
This series is organized into 3 subseries: Unproduced Writings; A Texas Trilogy; and Post-Trilogy plays. Many of the files reflect Mary Sue's filing system but the material has been consolidated and reorganized by play in chronological order. The group Unproduced Writings contains manuscripts of Preston Jones' unproduced plays. Included is his thesis adaptation of The Night of the Hunter. The three plays of the trilogy in the second subseries were performed together for the first time at the Dallas Theater Center in 1975 as the Bradleyville Trilogy. They played again as A Texas Trilogy in May 1976 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D. C. and at the Broadhurst Theater in New York in September 1976. The first set of files refers to the three plays as a unit and contains playbills, posters, set designs, reviews, clippings and screenplay drafts. There is considerable documentation of the Washington and New York productions--promotional articles, photographs, reviews, playbills, congratulation notes, memorabilia (t-shirts, Algonquin hotel mementos) and interviews. Preston's Teddy Bear collection is included here. His favorite was a small teddy bear named Fred, an ever-present good luck talisman that was buried with him. Knights was the first completed play of the Trilogy, premiering at the Down Center Stage in the Dallas Theater Center on December 4, 1973. This subseries contains the handwritten versions of the play along with successive drafts and rewrites. Also included are props, costumes, playbills, programs, clippings, reviews, and interviews. The material is arranged by format (scripts, props, programs, clippings) in chronological order. Preston Jones began LuAnn before the other two plays of the Trilogy, inventing as he did so the connecting thread, the town of Bradleyville. LuAnn was the second of the three plays to be completed, premiering in February of 1974. This subseries contains scripts and rewrites, programs, clippings, reviews, photographs and a video of the University of Minnesota 1980s production. After Knights and LuAnn had been presented, Preston Jones wrote the final play of the Trilogy, The Oldest Living Graduate. It premiered at the Down Center Stage November 1974. In 1980, Graduate was presented live on television costarring Henry Fonda, Cloris Leachman, George Grizzard, and Harry Dean Stanton. This set of files contains the scripts and rewrites, clippings, reviews, and photographs. Included is a video of the 1980 telecast along with clippings and reviews. Preston Jones turned to his native New Mexico as the inspiration for the three plays written after the Trilogy. In 1975, Jones began writing A Place on the Magdalena Flats, also titled The Plains of St. Augustine, which examines the relationship of two brothers working their New Mexican ranch during the 1956 drought. Santa Fe Sunshine is a comic play about an artist's colony. Remember concerns an actor reminiscing on his past during a visit to his boyhood home. Included here also are records on Juneteenth, a one-act play commissioned by the Actor's Theatre in Louisville, and a tribute to Lady Bird Johnson on her 65th birthday, scripted and staged by Preston. This subseries contains handwritten and typed drafts and rewrites, programs, photographs, set designs, memorabilia, clippings of reviews and publicity, and audio and videotapes.
This series contains journals, address books, correspondence, contracts, royalty payments, articles, clippings and photographs. The major part of the material relates to A Texas Trilogy and is made up of communications with agents, fans, and theaters concerning options on the plays. Included is correspondence with Hal Wallis in regard to the movie production of the Trilogy.
This series contains materials on the promotion of Preston Jones' theatrical career especially in regard to the Trilogy. It includes photographs, clippings, reviews, articles, interviews and videotapes, providing information on aspects of the author's life, career, and writing methods.
Jones died unexpectedly in September of 1979 after surgery for bleeding ulcers. This series contains documents concerning Jones' medical care and cause of death, obituaries, the funeral service, the memorial fund established at the Dallas Theater Center, sympathy cards, Christmas cards, acknowledgments from Mary Sue Jones, correspondence and reports on the estate.
This series contains World War I memorabilia, material relating The Texas Trilogy, and personal items.
Forty-nine boxes of typescripts, galley proofs, correspondence, printed material, photographs, scrapbook material, notes, and artifacts, among other items, document almost the entire writing career of John Graves (1920-2013).
The collection has been arranged into seven series: Writings (1946-2004, undated), Correspondence (1943-2006, undated), Institutional Activities (1960-1998), Awards and Honors (1961-2004), Personal Materials (circa 1920-2002, undated), Clippings (circa 1940-2004, undated), and Writings by Others (1942-2002, undated).
The author's original order has been maintained where possible. The collection gives an overview of Graves' literary career, and with numerous drafts of many of his books, essays and short stories, it is particularly strong in illustrating his writing process. Another strength of the collection lies in its documentation of the editorial process, illustrated by the correspondence with publishers and agents found in both the Works and Correspondence series. Numerous letters between Graves and fans, family and friends were added to the collection in 2007, making the Correspondence series at ten boxes the second most voluminous. Other highlights of the collection are personal photographs and journals in the Personal Materials series.
The Monograph series includes research notes, typed manuscripts, galley proofs, printed materials, correspondence, and other materials chronicling Graves' literary contributions from his earliest short stories to his more recent essays and memoir. Materials from all of his books are included. Many of these materials were annotated by Graves with personal comments when he donated the materials to Bill Wittliff.
Manuscript materials relating to the books Graves is credited as writing or co-writing make up the first series. Materials are arranged alphabetically by book title. Of particular interest in the files pertaining to his first book Goodbye to a River are photographs taken by Graves during his trip down the Brazos River, the plate proofs of the first edition, and two printed articles written before the publication of the book. There are also drafts of his second book, Hard Scrabble, and his 2004 memoir, Myself and Strangers. The materials relating to From a Limestone Ledge have to do with the publication of the book itself; materials relating to the essays that were previously published in Texas Monthly are in the following sub-series. Likewise, materials under Blue and Some Other Dogs, The Last Running, and Self-Portrait, With Birds have to do with the book versions of these writings, not the original versions, which can be found in the next sub-series.
The Other Writings series is devoted to the many short stories, essays, book introductions, tributes, and unpublished pieces written by Graves, and spans almost six decades. This series is also the largest in the collection, filling eleven document boxes, plus oversize. The works within it are arranged alphabetically by title, usually according to the official published title, but sometimes by a book title if Graves' piece is an untitled introduction, or a draft title if the piece is unpublished. Many of these files contain correspondence, notes and research as well as typescripts and drafts. Some files also include or are limited to the publication itself that published it, or a clipping or photocopy of the published piece.
Graves' work for Texas Monthly is thoroughly documented in this series, including the typescripts, galleys, clippings and correspondence he kept in two binders, covering ten years of published essays in the magazine. The manuscript of Graves' first published short story, "Quarry," can be found in this series, as well as one of his most famous pieces, "The Last Running," in both fiction and screenplay formats.
The third series covers speeches that Graves wrote and delivered, arranged alphabetically by the event or occasion. Like the previous two series, these files contain drafts, correspondence, published forms, notes and other materials related to their subjects.
The Correspondence series contains letters that highlight Graves' writing career, with letters to and from publishers, agents, fellow writers, fans, event organizers and others. Insights into Graves' personal life and thoughts are also found in letters between Graves and longtime friends and family members. Graves kept carbon copies and later computer printout copies of many of his letters to others, so the researcher gets both sides of the letter-writing dialogue, in these folders and elsewhere in the collection where correspondence is included.
The vast majority of the correspondence is filed alphabetically by last name, though in a handful of cases by institution name, event name, or subject. Within the folders that are labeled with a range of names the correspondence is arranged and labeled in smaller folders. Folders that have just one name written on them means the volume of letters warranted its own folder (or in some cases, more than one folder).
The correspondence in the John Schaffner file is notable for chronicling the agent-writer relationship. Schaffner was Graves' agent until 1979, and this file, covering eighteen years, highlights their personal and professional association during that time. Writers Rick Bass, Angus Cameron, Nick Lyons and John N. Cole have considerable amounts of correspondence with Graves, as does writer and photographer Bill Wittliff, who has also been a close friend of and sometime collaborator with Graves through the years. Though less voluminous, the letters between Graves and Cormac McCarthy reveal a respect and kinship between the two men.
Daughters Helen Graves and Sally Jackson also have a considerable amount of correspondence in this series. Fleet Lentz and Abe Rothberg each have multiple folders, making evident their important friendships with Graves. Another significant friendship documented in letters is that of Graves and Samuel Hynes, who have been close friends since their days together at Columbia University. These letters are arranged in two parts, one restricted and one not. Letters donated by Mr. Hynes himself for inclusion in the John Graves Papers are restricted from access until after the deaths of both gentlemen. There are also two other, unrelated letters placed at the end of the series that are restricted until 30 years after the death of Mr. Graves.
There are two main parts to this series: Texas Institute of Letters, and Classes and Workshops. The former sub-series deals with Graves' membership in and activities with T.I.L., including two folders of his 1971-73 presidency of the organization; while the latter sub-series contains syllabus information and notes related to two courses and one workshop taught by Graves. The files in these two sub-series are arranged chronologically. The last part in Institutional Activities is a file relating to the "John Graves Essay Contest," conducted by The University of Texas Press. Graves was the judge of the final three-place winners of the contest.
This series is arranged chronologically, and contains mainly invitations, programs and photographs related to awards and honors bestowed upon Graves. A significant portion of this series deals with the Dallas Museum of Art's "John Graves Day," celebrated in May 1995, and includes video recordings of the event as well as correspondence, clippings and programs.
Notebooks, legal papers, financial papers, photographs, journals, objects and academic records make up the majority of the materials in this series. Graves' academic career is well documented through grade reports and written recommendations, class notes from undergraduate and graduate school, and his Columbia University Master's thesis on William Faulkner. Of particular interest in this series is the notebook Graves used while traveling in Europe and his journal of a trip down the Rio Conchos, as well as many copy prints of family photographs. Objects of note include Graves' Royal Standard typewriter and the paddle and tent he used during his canoe trip down the Brazos River in 1957. Materials in this series are arranged chronologically according to sub-series.
The "Reading Notes" journals in Box 38 may not be viewed or duplicated without the permission of John Graves or Bill Wittliff.
Photocopies‚Äîand the originals, when available‚Äîof newspaper and magazine clippings related mostly to Graves' writing career can be found in this series. The clippings are filed in chronological order. A number of issues of entire magazines are kept in Box 47, due to their size.
This series consists mainly of draft photocopies and printouts of other people's novels, essays, screenplays and poetry. Also included are correspondence, clippings, research, notes and page proofs. A handful are essays written about Graves, but the majority of the files are creative works that Graves has proofread or for which he has offered promotional comments.
The typescript "A Texas Rancher in Durango, Mexico" may not be viewed without permission from John Graves or Bill Wittliff.
The collection is composed of 21 boxes of manuscripts, galley proofs, notes, clippings, correspondence, artwork, financial and legal papers, screenplays, photographs, and artifacts, from 1971 to 2000 that document Stephen Harrigan's writing career. It has been arranged into six series: Works (1971-2000, undated), Correspondence (1976-1991, undated), Personal Materials (undated), Works by Other Authors, (1971-1972, 1992-1993, undated), Texas Institute of Letters (1982-1983, 1985-1986), and Clippings (1971-1983).
The Works series comprises the largest part of the Harrigan collection. It thoroughly documents Harrigan's methodical writing process. Most of the books and articles can be traced from the earliest notes taken by Harrigan to a proof copy or published work. The other series relate generally to his writing career. The materials are arranged in chronological order. Largely absent from the collection are personal papers or correspondence.
Books in the Stephen Harrigan Collection have been cataloged separately.
This series surveys Harrigan's creative works from his work as ad writer at the University Co-op to the publication of his book, Water and Light. It includes manuscript drafts, notes, notebooks, galley proofs, correspondence, magazines, clippings, financial and legal papers, screenplays, photographs and artifacts. In some cases Harrigan added notes and inscriptions describing the materials and providing background information. This series is further divided into six subseries: Early Works, Books, Screenplays, Songs, Contributions to Texas Monthly, and General Works.
The first subseries, Early Works, contains notes, clippings, manuscripts, correspondence, artwork, financial papers and forms documenting Harrigan's writing before the publication of his first book. It contains clippings of the ads Harrigan wrote for the University Co-op and materials from Lucille, the journal of poetry that he helped found and edit. Both are introduced by notes written by Harrigan in 1988 giving additional information and background about his job at the Co-op and his association with Lucille. The Co-op clippings are arranged chronologically, and the Lucille files have been grouped by type of material, having lost their original order. Of particular interest in the Lucille files are the three folders of submissions of aspiring poets, some of whom have gone on to literary success, such as Naomi Shihab (Nye), R. S. Gwynn and Vassar Miller.
The second subseries, entitled Books, contains research notes, background materials, legal papers, handwritten and typed manuscripts, galley proofs, correspondence, reviews and artwork for four of Harrigan's published books. There are multiple drafts of each book, and the handwritten notes and early drafts of Aransas, Jacob's Well, Water and Light and Gates of the Alamo provide an overview of Harrigan's writing process. His attention to detail and in-depth organization are demonstrated in his research for Water and Light, which includes two boxes of index cards with notes about the sea and the history of diving as well as his personal notes from his trip to Grand Turk Island. The materials are arranged alphabetically by book.
Screenplays, the third subseries, contains research notes and multiple drafts of Harrigan's screenplay ISHI, which was filmed for HBO in 1992 as The Last of His Tribe. Many of these drafts were maintained in notebooks and materials found in the pockets of these notebooks have been placed at the back of each folder. The drafts are arranged chronologically, from the earliest draft to the final production script and shooting notes. Also found in the subseries is the script "Moonwalker," co-written by Harrigan and Lawrence Wright.
The fourth subseries, Songs, contains various typed and handwritten drafts of a song written by Harrigan entitled "The Old Three."
The fifth subseries, Contributions to Texas Monthly, contains research materials and notes, manuscript drafts, galley proofs, correspondence, photographs, artwork, and published articles written by Harrigan for Texas Monthly magazine. Harrigan's talent as a journalist is well documented here, showing the broad range of his interests, from an interview with Governor Bill Clements to research on the sculptor Pompio Coppini to essays on the natural wonders of Texas. Some of these articles were later published in Harrigan's third book, A Natural State: Essays on Texas. Also included are a number of complete issues of Texas Monthly in which Harrigan's articles appeared.
Within the final subseries are general materials relating to Harrigan's writing career. It includes multiple handwritten and typed drafts on broadcasting, a typed essay on the exploration of Texas, an application for the NASA "Journalist in Space" program, a press release, and a clipping about the author.

The letters range from requests for articles from magazines and journals to letters of interest from agents and publishers, "Letters to the Editor" forwarded to Harrigan from Texas Monthly, letters from other writers and friends, fan mail, and correspondence from organizations like the Texas Institute of Letters, of which Harrigan is a former president. The series is arranged chronologically except for one folder of short notes from Lee Goerner, Harrigan's editor at Knopf. Other correspondents of note include John A. Sterling, Wallace Stegner, A.C. Greene, Elmer Kelton and Gunnar M. Hansen.
Within this series are a few materials relating to Harrigan's personal life. Of particular interest are swimming fins and underwater slate, still imprinted with faint notes from a scuba diving trip.

The largest draft is The Great White Immaculate Bird and Other Toys, a series of essays criticizing human efforts to change animals for commercial purposes. There are three drafts of this typescript, all of which contain handwritten emendations. A number of short essays by Stilwell written for newspapers and magazines are also found in this series; many of these essays cover topics found in The Great White Immaculate Bird, but others discuss such subjects as feminism, football at The University of Texas, and the loss of the Southern dialect. One folder contains a few published articles by Stilwell, generally focusing on food but also covering such topics as javelin hunting, the demise of the jalape√±o, and the death of outlaw Sam Bass. The correspondence in this series consists of two rejection letters

The bulk of this archive was acquired through Bill and Sally Wittliff, who purchased the material in an estate sale in 1985.¬†(See Richard Holland's article in Corners of Texas cited above for a fuller description of the acquisition.)¬†Dobie had already donated much of his library and papers to the University of Texas at Austin.¬†The material at Texas State was what remained in his Austin house at the time of his death in 1964.¬†It is divided into five series: Works, Personal, Bertha McKee Dobie and Edgar Kincaid Papers, Artifacts, and Newspaper Clippings.¬†The series contain drafts of Dobie's posthumous books, research material, drafts of newspaper columns, magazine articles, lectures, transcriptions of radio broadcasts, correspondence, photographs of family and friends, property deeds, income tax records, personal items (pipes, clothes, a favorite chair), wills, and clippings about Dobie as well as articles, clippings and photographs that had belonged to Bertha McKee Dobie and/or Edgar Kincaid.
The first subseries, Books, contains drafts, galleys, research notes and clippings, photographs, correspondence, captions, typescripts and a record album of Dobie's books. Also included are files on posthumous books compiled by Dobie's wife Bertha.
The second subseries is entitled Research Material. The research files include correspondence, bibliographical notes, articles, clippings, pictures, and quotes on the Southwestern themes Dobie explored. Subjects covered are animals, Southwestern customs, Texas heroes, Southwestern characters, hunting, tall tales, cooking and treasure hunting. Files of old maps and guidebooks document research trips made to Mexico including the 1933 trip to Saltillo with Henry Nash Smith.
Fellow University of Texas English professor Stith Thompson invited Dobie to join the Texas Folklore Society in 1915. The third subseries contains documents relating to his involvement in the organization. Dobie claimed he had never heard of the word folklore before. "If Stith Thompson hadn't said folklore to me . . . I don't know where in the devil I'd be today. (Tinkle 37) Dobie succeeded Thompson in 1922 as secretary-editor of the society's publications. He revitalized the society after it had become moribund during World War I, and he pushed it in a direction independent of the American Folklore Society. Dobie resigned as editor in 1943, when he left Texas to teach a year in Cambridge, England, but he continued as a participant in the society and his influence remains strong to this date.
The fourth subseries is entitled Newspaper Columns. Dobie first worked for a newspaper, the San Antonio Express, the summer after graduation from Southwestern in 1910. In 1914, he reported for the Galveston Tribune to earn extra money during a summer break from teaching at the University of Texas. In September 1939, Dobie began a syndicated newspaper column which he continued writing until the year of his death. His columns touched on a wide range of areas from current events and postwar Europe to folk tales and Texas characters. This subseries contains drafts of these columns. It also contains his file on the Alamo memorial sculpture controversy, which includes articles, interviews and correspondence. In 1937, the sculptor Pompeo Coppini was commissioned to create a monument to the fighters at the Alamo. Dobie vehemently took issue with the choice and expressed his views publicly by radio and newspaper.
The next subseries, Magazine Articles, includes the typescript of Dobie's first nationally published article for The Country Gentleman. The subsequent magazine articles cover various topics of interest to Dobie--cowboy life, Mexico, herbs, animals, reading, literature, etc.
Dobie became a popular lecturer as his books and articles on Southwestern ways gained national attention. The sixth subseries, Lectures and Speeches, includes notes on his speaking itinerary and covers his lectures on folklore, the Southwest and his experience as a Texan in England.
The final subseries has been titled Radio and Television. Dobie began broadcasting from the radio in 1932 with five-minute talks on the program "Longhorn Luke and His Cowboys." His radio programs and later television appearances covered the same subjects as his books and articles but the audio/visual aspects of the technologies allowed him to enhance the tales with live narration. The files contain a letter from his original radio sponsor, fan letters, and scripts.
The first subseries within this group of records, Family, contains a family photo album of mostly 19th century photographs of the Dobie and Byler families. Also included are the family bible from which Dobie's father read nightly and two of Dobie's own bibles given to him as gifts: one in 1905 from W. H. Butler and the other from his family in 1908.
The next set of files, entitled Graduate Education, contains class notes, the Masters thesis, theater programs and newspaper clippings from Dobie's Columbia University days. Despite Dobie's statement in Some Part of Myself that he destroyed a "kind of diary" he kept at the time because he "was so disgusted with the sentimentality in it" (185), there is a diary herein which for the most part describes his reactions to the New York theater.
In the third subseries, World War I Service, is found Dobie's army uniform, his shipping trunk, and military documents. Dobie enlisted in the Army May 17,1917 but was not shipped to Europe until October of 1918 shortly before the armistice of November 11. He never saw action but was able to use the opportunity to see something of Europe.
The next subseries, Teaching, contains grade books, teaching notes, lectures and diaries. It includes the notes from the lectures Dobie gave at Cambridge University in 1943.
Household Records and Personal Effects, the fifth subseries, contains property deeds, income tax records, invoices, mementos, personal items, addresses, wills, and notes. There is information on Dobie's homes, lifestyle and interests. The file named Workfiles and mementos contains miscellaneous envelopes, empty files, clippings and articles including Walter Prescott Webb's "The Search for William E. Hinds."
The next subseries contains correspondence. The majority of these letters are from Dobie to Bertha detailing his experiences in the army. Other letters to Bertha were written during various separations and discuss family, personal matters and Dobie's writings. They also mention Dobie's work with the Texas Folklore Society and his various research interests. The other major correspondence in this subseries is the letters of Roy Bedichek. Bedichek was director of the University of Texas Interscholastic League by profession but a student of nature by predilection. Bedichek often met with Dobie and historian Walter Prescott Webb for barbecue or at Barton Springs swimming pool in Austin to argue and philosophize. Prodded by Dobie and Webb, Bedichek became a writer of lyrical books on nature at the advanced age of 70. His letters discuss animal stories, politics (especially Texas politics), and mutual friends--University of Texas president Homer Rainey, Folksong collector John Lomax, political commentator John Henry Faulk, Western historian Henry Nash Smith, Walter Prescott Webb and Texas Folklore Society editors Mody Boatright and Wilson Hudson. Also included here are some letters from Isabel Gaddis, a friend who collaborated with Dobie on I'll Tell You A Tale, published in 1960.
Dobie died on September 18, 1964. The seventh subseries, Dobie's Death, contains the many telegrams and condolence cards sent to his widow along with funeral arrangements, the memorial record book and newspaper clippings about Dobie's accomplishments.
The eighth subseries, Writings about Dobie, is a collection of clippings, articles and papers on J. Frank Dobie gathered by his wife Bertha and his nephew, Edgar Kincaid. A few of the clippings concern Roy Bedichek or Edgar Kincaid. There also is a file on the Paisano Fellowship, the grant set up as a memorial to Dobie. His beloved ranch west of Austin was deeded to the University of Texas, which, along with the Texas Institute of Letters, manages a fellowship for selected Texas writers and artists. The award enables the writer or artist to spend six months on the ranch with a stipend in order to work on projects free from distraction. The first fellowship was granted in 1967 to Billy Porterfield.
Photographs, the final subseries contains photographs of Dobie, his wife Bertha, and their family and friends. There are publicity photos, photos taken on Dobie's research trips, and pictures clipped for research. Included are photos of Dobie and Bertha on their ranch or entertaining friends.
This series contains family letters to Bertha. The bulk of the correspondence is from her mother and mentions Dobie, his work, and his trips to Mexico. The letters also discuss Bertha's family, health and gardening. Included too are Bertha's gardening columns, and various sundry clippings, pamphlets and articles that she collected about Dobie and other matters of interest to her. Edgar Kincaid's family records and photographs of Kincaid at a book signing for The Bird Life of Texas are also present.
This series contains personal items that belonged to J. Frank Dobie, including clothing, toiletries, a ceramic roadrunner figurine, pipes, a typewriter, and a Dictaphone machine.
This series is housed in one oversized box and contains unprocessed original newspaper clippings collected by J. Frank Dobie.
The Rick Bass papers are comprised of manuscripts, galley proofs, notes, clippings, correspondence, legal papers, photographs and artifacts, 1924 to the present, relating to Bass' career as a novelist. Series include Works, Clippings and Reviews, Writing Related Files, Environmental Concerns, General Correspondence, and Personal. The largest of these series is the first, Works, which is comprised mainly of photocopied pages from Bass' handwritten notebooks which serve as the forum for Bass' ideas and notes.
This series surveys Bass' works from his earliest published pieces to his more recent articles and stories. In this series are manuscripts for The Watch, Oil Notes, The Ninemile Wolves, Winter: Notes from Montana, as well as notes for The Deer Pasture and short stories published in Platte River. The series also contains numerous short stories and essays, research notes, journal notes, reviews, and interviews. Most of the non-fiction manuscripts relate in some way to Bass' intense relationship with nature and concern for the environment, although they also concern his writing career.
The bulk of this series is comprised of photocopied pages from the notebooks in which Bass does most of his writing, and also contains manuscript pages, typed drafts, computer disks, galley proofs, and published pieces, many of which are heavily annotated. Not all of the manuscripts are complete; many lack pages, while others contain only Bass' notes or are partially finished. It is important to note that the backs of his papers often contain notes to other manuscripts, correspondence, and other information, since Bass recycles paper by using both sides. Some notes are on scraps, and in one case, a note is written on a piece of bark. Sent to the Wittliff Collections in small pieces at a time, the manuscripts have been arranged alphabetically by the processor.
Materials in this series include clippings and reviews regarding works published by Bass, and have been arranged chronologically.
These files are comprised of editorial correspondence regarding Bass' writing and its publication, correspondence and ephemera related to author readings and booksignings, course description and coursework related to fiction and non-fiction college writing courses taught by Bass, audiocassette tapes and a full transcript of an interview with Scott Slovic regarding Bass' writing career.

The Texas Institute of Letters was organized in 1936 during the year of the Texas Centennial for the purpose of the "promotion and recognition of literature in Texas." It evolved into an organization which met annually and awarded literary prizes to works by Texas authors. Bill Wittliff joined the TIL in 1969 and was president from 1974 to 1978. He wrote and published a history of the Institute, The Texas Institute of Letters, 1936 - 1966. He and Encino Press had received awards from TIL beginning with his book design for an SMU Press printing of a lecture by Harry S. Truman. Wittliff designed and printed many TIL programs. Clippings about TIL are also found here along with the first copy of Texas Monthly signed by authors who were at the 1973 TIL meeting, and a cassette of the 1977 TIL meeting.

"My second attempt at writing a script--but it turned out to be only a collection of episodes based on my father's funeral and some of my high school experiences. So I shelved it after one draft." Bill Wittliff, December 22, 1988
Thaddeus Rose and Eddie was the first script written by Wittliff to be produced. The working title was "Sledge and Eddie," and some of the early drafts are titled as such. Wittliff's agent brought the script to the attention of producers Rod Sheldon and Dan Paulson. The TV movie was directed by Texas director Jack Starrett and starred Bo Hopkins and Johnny Cash. The film aired on the CBS network Friday Night Movies, February 24, 1978 to generally favorable reviews. The production brought Wittliff to the attention of producer/director Francis Ford Coppola who hired Wittliff to work on the script for The Black Stallion (1979). Wittliff credited the Coppola job for providing him validation as a screenwriter. This series contains drafts of the script, production forms, publicity and reviews. Also contains the drafts and galleys for the paperback Pinnacle Book based on the teleplay.

"This one got stuck between thinking and feeling. The best stuff (the old men, the feathered airplane, the Mask itself) come from cutting the subconscious loose. Much of the rest of the story is contrivance--that is to say, thought out. The two didn't mix." Bill Wittliff, February 24, 1989
Written and co-produced by Wittliff. Starred Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard. Wittliff began as director but was replaced by Richard Pearce. 1985, Lange won Academy Award nomination.

This started as a rewrite of Pistoleers--"My first couple of drafts were set in New York City--then Crocodile Dundee came out and the studio asked me to reset the story in Washington, D. C. to avoid comparison. Against my better judgment I agreed to give it a try and the whole thing (meaning the writing) went downhill after that." Bill Wittliff, February 16, 1989. Includes notes by Wittliff's assistant at the time, Connie Todd.

For six years during the 1980s, Bill Wittliff served on the Board of Trustees for the Institute, working in particular on the Selection Committee. He also donated his time as a writer's mentor during the June Workshop at Sundance Resort near Provo, Utah and at the Writer's Workshop held during the January Sundance Film Festival.

Correspondence, printed material, financial documentation, interviews, photographic material, legal documentation, notes, creative works, audio and video recordings, and machine-readable records, created and maintained by Bill Crawford and Joe Nick Patoski, document the research, production, and promotion processes of their co-authored biography, Stevie-Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire.
The collection consists of three main series, the Crawford Files, the Patoski Files, and the Audio and Video Materials Series. The Crawford Files and Patoski Files represent each author's individual research, production, and promotion for the book. Generally, the series representing one author will contain material created and maintained only by that author, although some overlap does occur, as the two authors collaborated closely on this project. Each author's differing methods of research and production are revealed by the structure and contents of their files, which are listed briefly in the Series Summary, following the Series Descriptions. The Audio and Video Materials Series was created for ease of access to this varied material, which was created and maintained by both authors. It includes interviews, musical performances, a recording of Stevie Ray Vaughan's funeral service and consists of formats such as cassette audiotapes, VHS videotapes, and CD-ROM audio discs.
Because this biography of Stevie Ray Vaughan was unauthorized, the authors did not have the cooperation of the Vaughan family, including his brother, Jimmie Vaughan, nor that of certain other key figures in Vaughan's life, including Tommy Shannon, Chris Layton, and Reece Wynans, of his band, Double Trouble. However, published interviews with these important figures do appear in this collection, complementing the original research done by the authors. This collection sheds a unique light on Stevie Ray Vaughan's life and musical career. At the same time, it documents the rise of the blues in the Austin music scene during the 1970s and 1980s, a time when progressive country artists, such as Willie Nelson, reigned supreme. Of particular note are the many interviews with Stevie Ray Vaughan's musical mentors and colleagues such as Buddy Guy, B.B. King, W.C. Clark, Ray Benson, Kim Wilson, Angela Strehli, and Antone's owner, Clifford Antone. Interviews with Stevie Ray Vaughan's longtime friend, Dale Bramhall, twin brother to Doyle Bramhall, Vaughan's closest songwriting partner and friend, lend important insights into the history of certain albums and certain periods of the late musician's life. Many of the interviews conducted for this project bring to light what had for years been stories held only among Austin musical enclaves. Also, bootleg recordings of Stevie Ray Vaughan performances dating back as far as 1975, and many candid and publicity photographs dating back to the mid-1970s, are of special interest. Inclusive dates range from 1964- 1995, with the bulk of the material dating from 1990-1993.
A special note on interviews in this collection: Not all interviews on audiotape have written transcripts, and conversely, not all transcripts are represented by audiotapes. Existing transcripts are filed with the series of the author who conducted the interview. The interview audiotapes themselves are simply listed in alphabetical order in Series III, each tape has been assigned a number, and when a transcript is available for a particular tape, its location (by box and folder) will be noted on this list.
Maintained by Bill Crawford, the Crawford Files constitute the bulk of the record group and reflect Crawford's original order. The records on the Research Materials subseries, 1994-1993, document the primary and secondary research of Stevie Ray Vaughan's life conducted largely by Bill Crawford. Included are a large quantity of interview transcripts and audiotapes, a copy of Stevie Ray Vaughan's death certificate, and Vaughan family genealogical material. Of special note are numerous published interview transcripts with the late musician himself. Material in the Book Production Material subseries documents the progress of the book's publication. Heavily edited manuscript drafts and page proofs comprise the majority of these records. This subseries also includes material relating to the selection of photographs to be used in the biography. There is almost no record in this series of public relations / advertising activities.
This listing refers to interviews conducted by Bill Crawford for which written transcripts and/or notes have been made. Box and folder numbers in this list refer to these transcripts and/or notes. Tape numbers in this list refer to the audiocassette tapes listed more fully in Series III.)
This includes clippings from newspaper and magazines regarding Stevie Ray Vaughan's career.
The Patoski Files, maintained by Joe Nick Patoski, are divided into the same subseries as the Crawford Files: Research Materials, and Book Production Materials. The cataloger has maintained as much of Patoski's original order as possible for this material, but imposed some additional degree of order in the interest of accessibility. The Research Materials, 1977-1993, include numerous interview transcripts and audiotapes, published books on the music industry with Patoski's notes. Notable interviewees include Kim Wilson, Clifford Antone, Double Trouble manager Chesley Millikin, W.C. Clark, Angela Strehli, Stevie Ray Vaughan's ex-wife "Lenny" Vaughan, Marc Benno and Dale Bramhall. Please note that Patoski's groupings for "General" and "Stevie Ray Vaughan" in this series both deal with Stevie Ray Vaughan specifically, despite their differing titles. The Production Materials subseries, 1984-1993, includes manuscript drafts and page proofs, but is strongest in public relations / advertising material related to reviews and book signings.
This listing refers to interviews conducted by Joe Nick Patoski for which written transcripts and/or notes have been made. Box and folder numbers in this list refer to these transcripts and/or notes. Tape numbers in this list refer to the audiocassette tapes listed more fully in Series III.
The Audio and Video Material Series includes recordings of interviews conducted by the authors for the Stevie Ray Vaughan biography, as well as earlier recordings of published interviews with Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimmie Vaughan. Bootleg recordings of various Stevie Ray Vaughan bands, such as the Cobras and Double Trouble, are included in this series, ranging in date from 1975 to 1990, including Stevie Ray Vaughan's last performance. Also included in this series is an audio recording of Stevie Ray Vaughan's graveside funeral ceremony. Other material in this series includes various tributes to Stevie Ray Vaughan, and interviews with Crawford and Patoski regarding the publication of the biography, Stevie Ray Vaughan: Caught in the Crossfire. The bulk of the material in this series is in cassette audiotape format, with the remainder in VHS videotape, a 45-RPM single album, and CD-ROM disc formats.

Correspondence, drafts, typescripts, photographs, scrapbooks, artifacts, ephemera and clippings constitute this collection. The bulk of this material was created by Elithe Hamilton Kirkland, although a small amount was created or maintained by her son, James Beal, the donor of this collection. (For example, documents related to Ms. Kirkland's funeral, located in box 446, folder 7, were donated by Mr. Beal.) Drafts, notes, and correspondence in this collection document Kirkland's writing process, including published and unpublished works. Many working drafts of Kirkland's published work, as well as a wealth of unpublished poems, songs, plays, short stories, and essays are included. For her published works, working drafts are accompanied by notes, publicity material, and correspondence, rounding out the evolution of these works. For much of the correspondence related to and filed with specific published works, the carbon copies of Kirkland's letters are interfiled.
Her personal history is documented as well, through formats including awards, photographs, correspondence, scrapbooks, and resumes. Highlights include long runs of correspondence between Kirkland and her mother, her son, and her husband, Dr. R.D. Kirkland. Photographs document her life from childhood through her last years, including colleagues, friends, favorite dogs, and family members.
Kirkland's interest in J. Frank Dobie is also well represented here. Her first contact with Dobie is identified as a college paper written for Dobie's graduate class at UT Austin (see box 15 folder 6a). Her novel, Heather, For Luck, is a tribute to the Texas author, and the research and drafts for this book are located in the Books series. Correspondence with Dobie, articles written by and about Dobie, books inscribed to Kirkland from Dobie, can all be found in the J. Frank Dobie series. Kirkland helped develop the first Dobie Day, celebrated at Southwestern University, in Georgetown, TX; her research and correspondence related to this effort are also located in the J. Frank Dobie series.
Resumes, career summaries, autobiographical sketches are located in this series, as are school scrapbooks and Kirkland's booklet of favorite clippings and poems. Kirkland's extensive notes and subject files are included in this Personal series, recording the breadth of her interests. Material related to her many speaking engagements is also included.

Correspondence (1920-1991, undated) Letters are arranged alphabetically by the last name of the correspondent, and relate to both personal and professional subjects. While correspondence most closely related to a specific work is filed with that work, more general material can be found here.

This collection of correspondence, photographs, and two interviews lends an insight into Katherine Anne Porter's relationship to her home state of Texas in the last years of her life. Correspondence with Dr. Roger L. Brooks of Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, documents Porter's interest in returning to Texas and visiting her mother's gravesite. While these 10 letters and 2 telegrams hardly comprise the bulk of this collection, they shed light on Ms. Porter's relationship to Texas during this time of her life. Correspondence from other writers and literary figures to Dr. Brooks regarding Ms. Porter's work represents the status Ms. Porter enjoyed towards the end of her life nationally, internationally, as well as within Texan literary circles. The bulk of the collection is comprised of these letters from other writers to Dr. Brooks. A lengthy interview with Ms. Porter in the early 1970s also gives a unique view into her definitions of art, religion, her methods of writing, and more. Also included in this collection is Dr. Brooks' collection of Katherine Anne Porter books signed and inscribed by the author. Dr. Brooks' personal copies of periodicals in which Ms. Porter's stories and articles appeared have been cataloged separately. Dates for this collection range from 1898-1977, bulk 1972-1977.

Printed material, correspondence, financial and legal documentation, handwritten notes, books and other published material, photographs, artifacts, and sound recordings, 1921 to 1993 (bulk 1930-1975), created and maintained by Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles and E.E. Mireles, and further maintained by their friend and employee M. (Maria) Isabel Cruz who inherited the material after Mr. Mireles' death, help to document the education, teaching careers, and personal and financial lives of Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles and E.E. Mireles.
The collection has been arranged into fourteen series: Education, Teaching, Correspondence, Daybooks/Notebooks, Minutes, Financial Papers, Legal Materials, Medical Records, Photographs, Clippings, Postcard Collection, Artifacts, Books/Published Material, and Sound Recordings. These series are based on the original order of the materials when present, order was created by the cataloger for the materials that lacked it.
Mr. and Ms. Mireles' masters theses, included in the Education Series, are of particular interest, because they document the areas of their graduate studies. Ms. Gonz√°lez was awarded the Rockefeller grant in 1934 for the research she did for her thesis. In the Correspondence Series the letters to Mr. Mireles from Ms. Mireles while she was away in Mexico offer insight into their personal relationship. The beginnings of the Pan American Council of Texas is documented in the Minutes Series. This council, started by E.E. Mireles in 1943, worked to support the Spanish program in the Corpus Christi public schools where Pan American Clubs had already been started. Among the books in the Books/Published Material Series are The Voice of the Coyote by J. Frank Dobie and Finding Literature on the Texas Plains by John William Roger and J. Frank Dobie, both of which are inscribed by Dobie to Ms. Mireles. The Clippings Series documents the legal and political issues pertaining to education in Texas, racial discrimination, and local Corpus Christi news. Some aspects of Mr. and Ms. Mireles' careers are not fully documented. For example, there are no drafts of any of their writings, and there is limited material on Ms. Mireles' teaching career.
This series documents the higher education of both E.E. Mireles and Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles through records of school work which contain the dates of attendance, grades and classes taken. Their Masters theses are also included in this series and offer insight into the topics of their studies. Ms. Gonz√°lez's thesis, "Social Life in Webb, Starr, and Zapata Counties," is of particular interest.
This series contains material that helps to illustrate Mr. and Ms. Mireles' life-long teaching careers. Mr. Mireles' career in particular can be traced through his teaching contracts, and his Texas Teacher Retirement System statements in this series.
This series includes both correspondence belonging to E.E. Mireles and Jovita Gonz√°lez Mireles, as well as correspondence between them. Of particular interest are the letters from Ms. Mireles to Mr. Mireles during the summer of 1956, while she was away in Mexico, which offer insight into their relationship.

Consisting of notes, outlines, drafts, typescripts, correspondence, subject files, photographs, newsclippings, artifacts, a scrapbook, legal, medical, and financial records, this material was created and maintained by R.G. Vliet, with the exception of some material maintained by his widow, Ann Vliet, after Mr. Vliet's death. Dates range from 1900-1990 (bulk 1960-1984).
This material documents the author's writing process and career, covering the various genres in which he worked, and demonstrating the creative overlap between these genres (plays, poems, and short stories worked into novels, for example). For each major work, extensive background notes, outlines, sketches, drafts, handwritten copies, and typescripts exist, showing details of the author's creative method. Of special interest are the research files, drafts, and correspondence relating to the author's final, and posthumously published, novel, Scorpio Rising.
Personal items include photographs, a large scrapbook, newsclippings, notebooks, medical, legal, and financial records, and several artifacts, such as clothing and eyeglasses. This material offers a perspective on the personal lives of R.G. and Ann Vliet.
This series is arranged into the following sub-series: Novels, Plays, Poetry, Stories, Articles and Essays, Speeches, and Subject Files.
This subseries very clearly shows Vliet's process of writing from preliminary research through final product. It includes extensive background research files including files by subject containing clippings from newspapers and magazines, library call slips, color and black and white photographs, and handwritten notes. Following these research files are drafts of chapters handwritten in pencil, annotated typescripts, clean typescripts, and (minimal) correspondence. Perhaps most meticulously documented is the process of writing Scorpio Rising, Vliet's last novel, despite the fact that he was violently ill when writing it and died only one week after completing it. The author's widow, Ann Vliet, saw this novel through to publication.
Drafts of plays (mostly handwritten in pencil and annotated) and typescripts (mostly mimeographs or photocopies with annotations) are arranged in this subseries in alphabetical order. For reviews and further information regarding the author's plays, see Series II: Personal, Newsclippings.
Individual handwritten and typed poems, and hand-bound books of poetry, comprise this subseries. Many of the individual poems are accompanied by drafts, some are single copies. Individual poems are arranged alphabetically, followed by books of poetry, also arranged alphabetically. See also Series 2: Personal, Subseries C: Scrapbook, for early drafts of poetry.
This subseries includes short stories such as "The Morning of the First Day" and "The Morning and the Evening of the First Day". Many are complete stories, some are fragments or are in draft form. Portions of these examples of Vliet's early prose would later be worked into the author's novels.
Articles and essays in this subseries relate to Vliet's own writing process and influences. All are in typescript form and most have handwritten annotations.
This subseries includes drafts and typescripts of four speeches which address Vliet's writing process and influences. Also included here is the author's acceptance speech for the 1978 Texas Institute of Letters Award received for his novel, Solitudes.
Handwritten and typed notes, clippings, and photocopies, arranged in alphabetical order by the author's subject categories, comprise the majority of this subseries. Also included are several folders of topographical and road maps of various Texas counties and other locations.
Personal Papers are arranged into the following sub-series: Correspondence, Photographs, Scrapbooks, Clippings, Notebooks, Medical Records, Legal Records, Financial Records, Computer Disks, and Artifacts.
Business correspondence relates to Vliet's writing career, and covers such subjects as writing submissions, editing of works to be published, royalties for published works. Correspondents include various poetry and literary
journals, Texas Institute of Letters, the Ford Foundation, and Vliet's agent, Lucy Kroll, of the Lucy Kroll Agency.
Two non-correspondence files were filed by the author with this business correspondence, and are located at the beginning of this group of correspondence. The first of these, "Market List", is a list of journals and publishers to contact; the second file, "Notes on copyright", includes lists of Vliet's works and their copyright status (transfer of copyright, renewal dates for copyright, etc.) and notes regarding royalties.
Personal correspondence in this subseries includes letters to Vliet from long-time friends such as Ruth Bloom, Harry Clauss, Alan Distler, John Haag, Ralph Houston, and David Lyttle. Several letters from Vliet to Ralph Houston are also included here, presumably sent to Ann Vliet after R.G. Vliet's death. These letters are of special interest in that they discuss Vliet's writing and his health. Correspondence from Vliet's family include genealogical information, and a letter from Vliet's father, R.G. Vliet, Sr., regarding the use of the name "R.G. Vliet" in published materials.
Photographs in this subseries are divided into the following groups: photographs of R.G. Vliet alone, Vliet and his immediate family, Vliet and extended family, Mexico snapshots, friends, workspaces, and pets. Most are color snapshots from Vliet's personal life, most are not labeled with identifying information. See also Subseries C: Scrapbook, for additional photographs, especially from Vliet's youth.
This scrapbook serves as Vliet's baby book, and documents his activities as a Boy Scout and Eagle Scout, his high school days (including his diploma), and college days at Southwest Texas State University, as well as some examples of his early poetry and sketches. Formats include photographs, drawings, newsclippings, pressed flowers, awards and badges, membership cards, letters, drafts of poetry.
Clippings in this subseries cover subjects ranging from Vliet's early play productions to the posthumous publication of his last novel, Scorpio Rising. These clippings were maintained by the author and filed along with play programs for several plays. This original order has been maintained, so that clippings regarding specific plays are filed here along with the play programs.
This subseries is comprised of Vliet's handwritten notes for a class taken at Yale School of Drama, "History of the Theater", in 1955.
Records in this subseries include correspondence, photocopied clippings, and doctors' reports regarding R. G. Vliet's fight against lymphoma from 1982 until his death in 1984. Also included are records relating to Ann Vliet's health from to 1987-1989.
R.G. Vliet's Last Will and Testament (1983) is included in this subseries, along with documents relating to a 1983 purchase of land in Kyle, Texas, and Ann Vliet's 1985-86 retirement and move to Kyle.
Check registers, bank statements, tax receipts and notes comprise one-half of this subseries. The second half includes financial notes and notebooks maintained by R. G. Vliet, which document expenditures relating to research and writing and may have been tax deductible.
Eighty-six 5 1/4" floppy computer disks (with no print-outs) are included in this subseries. Many are untitled or have fragments of labels.
One award (from Southwest Texas State University) and several items of clothing, as well as Vliet's eyeglasses and case, are included in this subseries. The embroidered white cotton shirt worn by Vliet at his daughter's wedding (see Series 2: Personal, Subseries B: Photographs) can also be found here.

The original chronological order in which the Bakers kept this correspondence has been maintained. The remaining correspondence in this series is an assortment of letters and cards sent to the Bakers between 1927 and 1999. There was little original order to this correspondence, therefore it has been arranged by the cataloger in chronological order.

This series, made up of the subseries Tributes and Interviews, Play Productions, Educational, and Miscellaneous, documents the Bakers' lifelong involvement in theater and education. Within each series the cassettes have been arranged alphabetically by title. Many of the cassettes in the Tributes and Interviews, and Educational Subseries offer insight into Paul Baker's philosophy of education, while the cassettes in the Play Productions Subseries provide examples of Baker's work as a director.
The majority of the recordings (13 reel to reel tapes, 3 cassettes, and 1 phonograph) in this series are of theater productions directed by Paul Baker during his time at Baylor. They are arranged alphabetically.
The bulk of the scripts in this series are from plays directed or written by Paul Baker. Other scripts were written by students, friends or relatives of Baker. Many of the scripts have been annotated and some are in an early or rough stage. The scripts have been arranged alphabetically by author.

In 1941, Mrs. Baker began a children's art and drama class for the Baker's first daughter and her friends, which would eventually grow into the Baylor Children's Theater. In this series, clippings, photographs, booklets, workshop materials and ephemera record the activities of the Children's Theater and Mrs. Baker's role as its co-founder.
The small group of clippings in this series highlights periods in Paul Baker's life from his undergraduate years at Trinity University in Waxahachie, TX, to his work at Baylor University, and his retirement in Waelder, TX.
The brochures and programs in this series come mostly from theaters and productions with which Paul Baker was involved either as a performer or director. They are arranged alphabetically by theater name.

The Iceland Base Command newspaper, "The White Falcon," contains several articles about productions directed by Paul Baker at the base. Also included in this series are programs from some of these plays, as well as art works from Iceland. This series is arranged by material type.

Santa Fe Indian School: One Hundred Years of Indian Education 1890-1990
This collection was created and maintained by Joe Nick Patoski in the process of writing the biography of Tejano singer, Selena Quintanilla Perez. The collection is compiled of news clippings, manuscripts, interviews, photographs, court documents, notes, publicity materials, computer disks and ephemera. Dates range from 1961 to 1997 (bulk 1995-1996).
The collection is arranged into eight series: I. Clippings (1971-1997, undated), II. Subject Files (1961-1996, undated), III. Court Documents (1995), IV. Notes (1995, undated), V. Interviews (1992-1995), VI. Manuscripts (1995-1996), VII. Correspondence (1995-1996), and VIII. Publicity (1995-1996). The materials arrived with little discernible order and have been arranged by the archivist.
The author's year long research and writing processes, which began the day after Selena's death on March 31, 1995 and continued until January 1996, are reflected in this collection. Patoski, working under his publisher's deadline of the first anniversary of Selena's death (March 1996), delegated a portion of the Selena research to friends and colleagues. Richard and Mary Zelade, among others, conducted interviews and research, adding significantly to the information Patoski was able to gather in this short amount of time.
This series contains coverage of Selena mainly in the form of newspaper and magazine clippings. However, there are other items such as scholarly papers and rough drafts of Patoski's magazine articles for Texas Monthly. This material has been arranged in chronological and subject order by the archivist.
Lake Jackson (1971-1985, undated) The clippings cover Selena's beginnings in Lake Jackson. Under this topic is her birth announcement, news about the Dow Chemical plant where her father worked, and advertisements for the family restaurant.
Pre-Shooting (1983-1995, undated) This folder includes Selena's musical and personal accomplishments before her murder.
Shooting (1995) Found in this folder are items relating to the events immediately following Selena's murder: the standoff between Yolanda and Corpus Christi Police, a transcript of the 911 call from the Days Inn Hotel lobby where Selena collapsed after running from Saldivar, and publication of Selena's autopsy photographs in the tabloid magazine the Globe.
Veneration (1995-1996) This folder involves the public and media expressions of grief, veneration of a pop icon, tributes, and look-alike contests.
Media Fact Finding Folder (1995) This folder contains the media's attempt to piece together events that led up to the shooting and possible reasons and motives for why the shooting took place. The folder also features background information on Yolanda Saldivar, reports on Selena's net worth before and after her death, and gossip generated by the National Enquirer and the Globe.
Culture of Death (1995) Compiled in the Culture of Death folder is the media's attempt to analyze the violent episodes of Selena's murder and an unrelated office shooting in Corpus Christi.
Posthumous CD: "Dreaming of You" (1995) This contains information about the songs on the CD, the release dates, and reviews of the CD.
Cashing in on Selena's Death (1995-1997) This folder includes clippings covering Abraham Quintanilla's legal battle to stop unauthorized selling of Selena memorabilia such as T-shirts, pictures, and bootleg tapes of her music.
Criticisms of Public Grief folder (1995) This folder includes clippings regarding Howard Stern's insults regarding Tejano music and Selena, and LULAC's response to Stern and their boycotts of products advertised on his radio program. Also included are letters to the editors of various newspapers stating that the Selena veneration of Selena is excessive.
Trial (1995) The trial folder includes media coverage of the State of Texas vs. Yolanda Saldivar in October of 1995, and the public's reaction to the outcome of the court case.
Selena: Como la Flor (1996) Within the folder are book reviews (mainly favorable), excerpts of the book in various newspapers, a piece by Don McLeese of the Austin American-Statesman questioning Patoski's right to pen an unauthorized biography of Selena, and Abraham Quintanilla Jr.'s public denouncement of Patoski's book.
Selena the Movie (1995-1997) This folder contains reviews of the movie (mostly unfavorable) as well as reviews of the movie's soundtrack.
Hispanics in the Media (1991-1995) Topics include: Hispanic celebrations, folklore, discussion in the media about the growing Hispanic population in Texas, the increasing economic power of Hispanics, Catholic religion, coverage of Hispanics portrayed in the media, and information of Hispanic success stories such as entertainers and business people.
Tejano Music (1993-1996, undated) News of Tejano stars, music and awards is included in this folder along with selected coverage of Selena's awards, appearances, music, and concerts
This series contains research on various people and places (arranged in alphabetical order), in the form of typewritten notes, photographs, scholarly papers, Tejano Press kits, Abraham's military records, a Selena Boutique catalog and information on Texas radio stations. Yolanda Saldivar's folder within this series contains her signed murder confession with the Corpus Christi police. In addition, there is extensive information collected on Tejano music and Tejano stars.
This series consists mainly of photocopies of typed court documents. Additionally, there are artist renditions of the State of Texas vs. Yolanda Saldivar trial and an identification card for Patoski to attend the hearing. Other court documents in this series include 1.) Ramiro Burr's (a writer for San Antonio Express News) lawsuit against Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. and his associates for breach of contract to ghost write a biography of Selena, and 2.) the family settlement of Selena's estate.
This series is comprised of notes handwritten by Patoski on legal and spiral bound notebooks, as well as notes written and typed from Richard and Mary Zelade. The Zelades interviewed people who could offer insight into Selena and her family before she became famous.The researchers also investigated bank records and places of employment for the Quintanilla family before they moved to Corpus Christi, Texas.
This series contains various interviews with people related to or who had contact with Selena. The interviews consist of conversations recorded on audio cassettes, both in person and by telephone. Some interviews have both audiotapes and transcriptions, while others exist only in one format or the other. Interview subjects include Tejano artists, people in the music business, music critics, family, friends, fans, and acquaintances. Because Patoski's book was an unauthorized biography, he could not contact any of the Quintanilla family or close friends. However, interviews with Chris Perez (Selena's husband), Selena's father, and her siblings were given to Patoski by the interviewer, John Morthland. One interview of particular interest features Selena discussing her relationship with Yolanda Saldivar and her own naivete about people's motives to be her friend.
This series includes typed rough drafts of Selena: Como la Flor. The various drafts include editor's corrections and questions either typed or hand-written on the pages of the manuscripts. In addition, some of the editor's comments are written on small notes. Correspondence between Little, Brown and Company and Patoski concerning his manuscript is also included in this series. Along with the manuscripts is a paper back book copy of Selena and examples of the book cover.
Included within this series is various correspondence related to or peripheral to Patoski's research. It is organized in alphabetical order by author. Of special note are correspondence from Little, Brown & Company to Patoski concerning legal issues related to the publication of the book. Also of special interest is the correspondence between Patoski and Selena's father concerning Abraham's wish for Patoski to ghost write a biography of Selena.
In April of 1996 Little, Brown and Company administered a book signing tour for Selena: Como la Flor. In addition, Patoski attended lectures and discussions about his book and about biographical work in general. A special event called Selena Trial Revisited was a stage for Patoski to promote his book. Found in this folder are faxes to Patoski from his publisher, brochures of the special events he attended, schedules for his appearance, a audio tape of a radio talk show where he was the guest, and fliers.

In 1998, Broyles was hired to rewrite the Y2K caper, Entrapment, starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones. Broyles shares writing credits with Ron Bass and Don Macpherson, both of whom worked on earlier versions of the screenplay. Correspondence, research, scripts (including drafts by Bass and Macpherson), production materials, and videocassettes document Broyles' contribution to the film.
The largest amount of material within the produced films series relates to Broyles's work on Cast Away. Broyles had the idea for the original film about a FedEx delivery driver stranded on a deserted island, and he saw it through from start to finish. This series of material provides valuable insight into the process of developing and writing an original motion picture. The 2000 film was produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and stars Tom Hanks. Broyles's letters and memos with these individuals can be found within the correspondence series.
The bulk of the Cast Away series is comprised of scripts. Broyles's entire writing process is evident from his early notes to the final shooting script. In all, there are over one hundred revised versions of the script. Many contain or refer to notes by Broyles, Sheila Gallien, Tom Hanks, and Robert Zemeckis. Additional materials within the Cast Away series are production files on art, casting, and schedules; publicity records, awards, and artifacts including a promotional Wilson volleyball and a coconut tree bark mask.
Broyles shares writing credits on the 2001 Tim Burton film, Planet of the Apes. The film is based on the Pierre Boule novel of the same name, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, and Helena Bonham Carter. Correspondence, research materials (including copies of Boule's novel and previous Apes films), scripts, and writers credit arbitration files, and publicity materials document Broyles's contribution to the film.
This small series includes correspondence, notes, and writers arbitration materials relating to Broyles's work on the 2002 film, Unfaithful, starring Diane Lane and Richard Gere.

Correspondence, research notes and interviews, plot maps, chapter synopses, character outlines, editor's revision suggestions, and two magazines document the career of Texas writer Rick Riordan spanning the years of 1997-2004. The bulk of the collection consists of manuscript materials for five of his novels: Big Red Tequila, Widower's Two-Step, "Gunman's Cantina" (The Last King of Texas), The Devil Went Down to Austin, and Cold Springs. The collection is arranged chronologically into seven series based on dates of publication of each book, with the seventh series consisting of promotional materials. Because of this, the author's method of constructing and writing a novel from first notes to manuscript is demonstrated.
The first series contains two magazines that featured Riordan's short fiction, the first published in 1988 and a more recent piece published in 1998. The second through sixth series are dedicated to each of Riordan's novels. Correspondence, research, and interviews particular to each novel are contained within that specific novel's series. Most of the research notes and interview materials are for the Widower's Two-Step, The Last King of Texas, and The Devil Went Down to Austin. The seventh series contains promotional materials for Riordan.
In addition to showcasing the people and cultures of Texas through his writings, another important aspect of the Riordan Papers housed in the Wittliff Collection is that it shows the depth of research spent writing his novel as well as the processes of writing from start to finish.
A copy of Cactus Alley (1988) which contains the first two short stories Riordan published, "The Sheet Cave" and "Out on 1040." A copy of Family Circle Mary Higgins Clark Mystery (Summer 1998) featuring Riordan's short story "A Small Silver Gun."
Materials relating to Big Red Tequila Series are arranged according to the chronological writing process: correspondence, a research interview, author's notes, an early draft, and an annotated manuscript with revisions. The correspondence is from Haynes and Boone, LLP and contains information on Texas contract law (July 19, 1996). A 1999 Fax from Mike Hames gives directions to Lackland Air Force Base, TX, a map of the base and a list of questions for interview. The research interview conducted with Hames provides insight into explosive ordinance, amputee physical therapy, and how an amputee deals with day-to-day life. There are notes on the indigenous trees and shrubbery of Central Texas in particular. Several note sheets that list character's names. The complete clean early typed draft of Big Red Tequila from 1994 contains quotes from songs by Texas songwriters in each chapter. These songs were not included in the published version of the book. One draft of the manuscript has been marked by Shelley Singer from the San Francisco Bay Area. Singer was his first line editor. There is also a complete, slightly annotated, typed manuscript of Big Red Tequila
In comparison to the other titles, the Widower's Two-Step has less correspondence, interviews, and research, but does include author's notes, a plot map flowchart, an early manuscript, and a spiral bound annotated draft with revision notes, labeled "2nd Draft." There are no dates for any of the materials belonging in this series, however the contents are likely from 1998 and earlier.
"Gunman's Cantina" was an early working title for The Last King of Texas published in 2000. This series includes correspondence from 1998-2000, author's notes, research emails, a plot map flowchart, and chapter outlines. Correspondence includes a fax from Gina Maccoby with notes from the editor of manuscript. Other correspondence are research interviews conducted via email: Russell Johnson explaining ballistics information and descriptions of guns; Eddie Klauer explaining Bexar County Jail operating guidelines, explosive ordinance and ballistics information, and general heroin use and drug operations; Jay Brandon with police department operational information, and Gloria Huntington on starting a "tech" business.

These letters reference revisions and suggestions about book. Along with letter are the author's revision notes in response to Miciak's suggestions for the manuscript. There is also an email from Riordan to Gina Maccoby of the Literary Agency concerning a review of the draft. Notes are available concerning character descriptions and involvement in plot, character names sheet, notes on scenes and discoveries and a dated reference sheet of characters dated June 15, 2000.

Journal articles, correspondence, published works, unpublished research and notes and photographs document the career of Edward Muegge "Buck" Schiwetz as an artist, illustrator and architectural sketcher. The collection is arranged into four main series: Biographical Material, Correspondence, Art Projects by E.M. Schiwetz, and Photographs.
The first series, Biographical Material, 1929-1955, contains two published journals, each containing articles about E.M. Schiwetz. They provide biographical data on the artist and his budding, and then successful career. Each article contains several examples of his work.
The second series, Correspondence, 1954-1979, contains letters written to and from Schiwetz.¬†Most of the correspondence pertains to work rather than personal life, although many elude a respect and affection for the artist.¬†Of note are letters concerning Mathews Ranch and the work E.M. Schiwetz did for the book, Interwoven written by Sallie Reynolds Mathews. Most of these letters are from book designer Carl Hertzog, with the dates ranging from 1956 to 1958. Six of these letters¬†are handwritten.
The third series, Art Projects by E.M. Schiwetz, 1928-1961, is arranged according to the five individual projects. The first, and largest, is Schiwetz's material for Interwoven, which contains notes, sketches to be included as illustrations, a small photo of an unidentified gravestone, two 7x10 photos of a two-story house, one program from Susan Mathews Reynolds funeral dated November 10, 1955, two programs from the Mathews Memorial Presbyterian Church dated December 22, 1957, sketches of the church by E.M.

The last series of the collection, Photographs, 1961-1978, contains six black and white photographs by James Vance.¬†Five of the photographs are of what appears to be Texas scenery. One of the photographs is of E. M. Schiwetz working on a sketch or painting of a landscape.
Cash Edwards and Roger Polson created the 2 linear feet collection of papers for Under the Hat Productions during the company's sixteen year existence starting in 1984 and ending in 2000. The majority of the papers contained are from the period of 1996 through 1999. The papers include a wide variety of promotional materials for their artist clients as well as a number of market research materials and press clippings. The archivist altered the original order of the collection by alphabetizing the clients and combining materials that pertained to each artist. The creators maintained individual client files and these were honored in the new arrangement.
The collection is in to two series, Artists Files and Market Research. The first series is arranged alphabetically by artist and contains promotional materials maintained by the staff. Each of the files contain some or all of the documents including press kits, photographs, negatives and slides, press releases, stage plots, resumes and biographies, flyers, posters, calendars, and mailing or emailing lists. There are clippings and reviews plus advertising, including newspaper and magazine reviews, listings, catalogs, ad tear sheets and photo copies. Also included are financial materials, contracts arranged chronologically, itineraries, travel arrangements, and correspondence with notes, postcards, and letters from artists. The second series contains market research materials. Also maintained by the staff, there are documents including magazines and organization newsletters.
There are a few artists that are more prominently represented. These are the most successful of the artists and include Christine Albert, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Terri Hendrix, Hugh Moffatt, Katie Moffatt, and Pat Mears. In the folder for various artists, each is represented by as few as one document and no more than five. As an example, Ray Wylie Hubbard has 2 folders of contracts for the year 1996. The breadth of venues includes everything from in-store appearances to festival dates both national and international.
The individual biographical sketches, press releases for creative output, and the press kits provide insight into careers the represented artists, venues, travel range, and the "neighborhood" of the Austin Music Scene during the dates represented. The records for the majority of the artists are significantly limited, while the most commercially successful artists have substantial records in the collection. The most revealing parts of the collection include the bios and the press releases and the contracts, documentary evidence of financial income.
There are no papers concerning Under the Hat's organization, finances, or history, and most materials concerning bluegrass artists are at the International Bluegrass Music Association Museum in Nashville, TN
The collection provides a simple snapshot into the professional careers of the Texas singer-songwriters of the late twentieth century in the Greater Austin area, who were clients of Under the Hat Productions.
The papers of journalist Grover Lewis span the years 1955 to 2005 and are arranged into seven series: Personal Papers, Correspondence, Published Works, Unpublished Works, Works by Others, Audio Tapes, and Oversized Items.¬†Brief descriptions of each series are below.
The first series, Personal Papers (boxes 1-11), contains academic materials dating from the late 1960 to magazine and newspaper clippings dated shortly before Lewis's death.¬†Also included are scanned photographs of Grover and wife Rae Lewis, correspondence regarding organizational affiliations, book and music catalogs, address books, eyeglasses, mini cassette recorder, various other personal artifacts, and the bulk of Lewis's Rolling Stone material.¬†
The second series, Correspondence (boxes 12-18), dates from 1958 to 1995 and includes letters and postcards from notable actors, artists, musicians, and writers as well as correspondence with lifelong friends. Notable correspondence is sheathed in a "white envelope" with pertinent information written across the top edge.
Series three, Published Work (boxes 19-48), is the largest series and contains work in various media‚Äîacademic and literary journals, newsprint, and magazines‚Äîdating from 1955 to 1994. This series includes Lewis's earliest published material in Avesta, and his last published article in Los Angeles Times Magazine. Lewis's meticulous writing process is evident throughout this series in the surfeit of small, hand-written and typed notes, as well as his corrected typescripts.
Series four, Unpublished Work (boxes 49-64), contains research, notes, and finished pages for numerous unrealized projects. This series is dominated by Lewis's unfinished novel, Code of the West, and his unfinished memoir Goodbye If You Call That Gone.¬†
Series five, Works By Others (boxes 65-82), consists of original typescripts or photocopies of short stories, novels, poetry, and screenplays.¬†Also included are several published works, often inscribed to Lewis, and a videotape of Suicide: The Movie, by Ray Cameron and Barry Cryer.
Series six, Audio Tapes (boxes 83-89), contains both original tapes and listening copies of audio-taped recordings of friends, family, and celebrity interviews Lewis conducted for various magazine articles. There are two items on CD format, which were transferred from reel-to-reel format.¬†
Series seven, Oversized Items (boxes 90-91), is comprised of diverse materials and media, including personal artifacts, photographs, photograph reproductions, a lithograph, and various newspapers. Most of the material in this series is press/publicity photographs and reproductions relating to Lewis's article for New West magazine, "The Shooting of Larry Flynt: An Eyewitness Account by Grover Lewis."
This series is arranged by subject and contains material reflecting important aspects of Lewis's Life. The Rolling Stone material is a sub-series containing mostly office memoranda, but also some humorous general correspondence and related ephemera.
Other notable material is the transcription of Robert Draper's interview with Lewis, which Draper conducted for his book-length expose, Rolling Stone Magazine: The Uncensored History. Lewis's astringent testimony of his working relationship with founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone, Jann Wenner, play a memorable role in Draper's book. The complete transcription of the interview not only details Lewis's relationship with the incomparable Wenner, but also includes other amusing anecdotes concerning the high-profile masthead of the magazine.
Also noteworthy is the personal correspondence exchanged with legendary San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen.
The personal artifacts here (boxes 10 and 11) include Lewis's mini-cassette recorder, several pairs of eyeglasses, a small notebook with handwritten notes, buttons, pens, matchbooks, and a view-finder.
This series is arranged chronologically and is comprehensive enough to effectively relate the inherent complexities in the life of a prominent working-journalist. The correspondence signals both Lewis's constant loyalty to friends as well as his uncommon writing ability. The series contains many poignant and superbly crafted letters. The tone of this series ranges between expressly personal letters and perfunctory business memos.
This series is rich with notable correspondence including Nelson Algren, William Brammer, Marlon Brando, Tim Cahill, L. M. Kit Carson, Andrei Codrescu, Francis Ford Coppola, S. Deitch, Joan Didion Dunne, John Gregory Dunne, Peter Gent, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Michael McClure, Steve Miller, Trina Mitchum, Sam Peckinpah, Anthony Perkins, Robert Redford, Tom Robbins, Bob Schieffer, Edwin "Bud" Shrake, Judee Sill, Delos V. Smith, Mick Stevens, Hunter S. Thompson, and Tom Wolfe.
In addition to famous celebrities and well-known literati, Lewis's correspondence includes numerous lesser-known writers and artists such as Eve Babitz, Gina Berriault, Dotty Le Mieux, Speer Morgan, Joyce Rezendes, Kell Robertson, and Jack Thibeau.
This series is arranged alphabetically by publication and surveys Lewis's entire writing career from his earliest poetry and short fiction publications in Avesta (1955)‚Äîthe student literary magazine of North Texas State College‚Äîto his last published piece, a profile of well-known photographer Birney Imes, published in the Los Angeles Times Magazine (1994). Material from a posthumous collection of Lewis's writing, Splendor in the Short Grass(2005), is also included.
The bulk of the newspaper work contained here (from the Dallas Times Herald, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Houston Chronicle, Houston Post, and St. Petersburg Times)is book reviews of contemporary work of the mid to late 1960's. These pieces are often highly opinionated and reflect Lewis's idiosyncratic literary and philosophical sensibilities.
There are many notable inclusions in this series:
‚Ä¢ The Coexistence Review, an underground literary publication published with friends and fellow North Texas State College students Larry McMurtry and George Lewis (no relation).
‚Ä¢ L.A. Weekly, dated 1993, with Lewis's cover story feature of the death of his close friend Gus Hasford, author of The Short-Timers‚Äîthe novel on which Stanley Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket was based.
‚Ä¢ The aforementioned Los Angeles Times Magazine article dated 1994, which includes audio tapes and a complete transcription of Lewis's interview with Birney Imes.
‚Ä¢ The Movieline material, which consists of Lewis's book reviews, and also the audio-taped interview and complete transcription of his interview with Hollywood legend, Aldo Ray, for a January 1991 feature story.
‚Ä¢ The New West material, which includes extensive correspondence and research, interesting artifacts, and audio-taped interviews for two important articles: "The Shooting of Larry Flynt: an Eyewitness Account by Grover Lewis" (March 27, 1978), and "Buried Alive in Hype: My Years Among the Reality Vultures" (May 22, 1978).
‚Ä¢ Lewis's Rolling Stone material, which includes all of Lewis's major articles, and specifically, the September 2, 1971, issue featuring the article, "Splendor In the Short Grass." The related material for this issue of Rolling Stone includes letters and a telegram from Bogdanovich; pay stubs; and several heavily corrected typescripts, including a preliminary film-reportage attempt written seven years before "Splendor," while on the set of Hud near Amarillo.
‚Ä¢ Thirty-seven typescript articles published in The Village Voice during 1969. These articles cover topics from the San Francisco area such as the Rolling Stones concert in Altamont, Native American takeover at Alcatraz, and the People's Park protest in Berkeley.
This series is arranged alphabetically according to either title or subject of work. The bulk of this series is comprised of two large, unrealized projects: The Code of the West (a novel)and Goodbye If You Call That Gone (a memoir).
Both of these projects reflect immensely important aspects of Lewis's life. The Code of the West reflects his intense love of the cinema‚Äîespecially the bygone era of the Western. The material surrounding this project includes many handwritten and typed notes and an audio-taped interview with Diana Carey, a.k.a. "Baby Peggy," the famous child-actor of the early 1920's. Also notable here are handwritten notes concerning Lewis's work-in-progress by Gus Hasford, Lewis's friend and author of the famous Vietnam War novel, The Short-Timers.
Goodbye If You Call That Gone remains unfinished due to Lewis's death from cancer in 1995. This was planned to be an expansive project in which he hoped to chronicle his own past ‚Äî with both memory and fact ‚Äî which centered on the tragic double-murder of both his parents in 1943. Included here are many photographs of Lewis's immediate and extended family, and extensive genealogical research. Other notable items are Lewis's book proposal accompanied by finished pages, both of which tell the fascinating story of his personal life and journalism career in his own words.
Box 47 contains strictly unpublished material; boxes 48-62 comprise a sub-series, Unfinished Work, containing material relating to articles that remained unfinished.
This series is arranged alphabetically by author and includes mostly photocopied short stories and screenplays. Two notable items relating to Lewis are a forty-six page biography, Grover Lewis: The Uncommon Insight and Grace of an Ordinary Man, written by longtime friend and poet R.K. Scott; and the screenplay Deep Ellum, by Stan Vosper, Jr., based on Lewis's adolescent days with Larry McMurtry and other North Texas friends. Included with the screenplay are several pages of Lewis's handwritten notes and corrections on the screenplay itself.
This series is arranged alphabetically by subject and includes both original tapes and listening copies of many of Lewis's taped interviews conducted for L.A. Weekly, Movieline, New West, Oui, and olling Stone magazines. Many famous and prominent actors and artists can be heard, among them Diana Carey (a.k.a. "Baby Peggy"), Elisha Cook, Jr., Larry Flynt (with attempted assassination), David Geffen, Howard Hawks (in a film festival Q & A session), Birney Imes, Lash La Rue, Bette Midler, Robert Mitchum, Slim Pickens, Aldo Ray, Andy Warhol, and Hank Williams, Jr.

The letters in this collection date from 1874 to 1931. The bulk of the letters cover Hardin's arrest and imprisonment. Several of the letters describe in detail Hardin's version of the Webb killing and lynching of Hardin's relatives as well as his own arrest, trial and incarceration. There is good documentation of the 1894 Gonzales County election controversy in which Hardin was deeply involved. The correspondence also offers insights on 19th century Texas life, i.e. politics, reconstruction, the Texas Rangers, the State Police, the Taylor-Sutton feud, prison life, farming practices, and country social life and mores. The collection also contains handwritten legal exams and papers as well as family photographs.
1874 Letters: There is only one letter from this year. On September 18, Hardin, on the run after the Webb killing in May, writes to his father to make a payment to his cousin, Mannen Clements. In a postscript, Hardin tells his father to destroy the letter after it is read.
1875 Letters: There is one item from the year 1875, a bill dated September 25 from Joseph DeMartini of Jacksonville Florida to J. H Swain. In his autobiography, Hardin says he was in Jacksonville using the alias of Swain from July 1875 to July 1876. (Hardin, 110-112)
1876 Letters: There are scraps of bills and invoices from Jacksonville, Florida dating from May until January. Present also is the first letter from Hardin to his wife. It is dated September 8 and he writes he will send for her when he has set up a business.
1877 Letters: The Hardins contacted their families in April to let them know for the first time since they left Texas how they had fared. They are answered by Jane's uncle Joshua Bowen (May 6) and Hardin's uncle Robert E. Hardin (alias R. E. Barnette, May 9. See Marohn 104). Both responses relate the state of affairs in Texas, update the Hardins on their respective relatives and mention the status of the Sutton-Taylor feud factions. After Hardin was captured by John Armstrong and Jack Duncan on August 23, 1877, he writes Jane from Decatur Alabama on August 25 explaining what happened and hinting that he might be able to escape. He accuses her brother Brown of being the cause of his capture. The majority of letters in September and October are letters of support from the family. Hardin is tried in September and convicted of Second Degree murder. He is returned to the Austin jail October 6 to await his appellate hearing. Letters from the family lament his sentence, and encourage him in his appeal. Beginning in November, the Hardin family urges Jane to return to Texas. Other letters of interest are a letter from Doc J An which mentions his knowledge of the detective who arrested Hardin, October 13; from Hardin's mother, Elizabeth, recounting the family version of the Webb killing, October 26; from Hardin giving his wife a detailed account of what happened on the day of the Webb killing and mentioning Brown Bowen who is also in the Austin jail, December 5, 1877; and again from Elizabeth Hardin discussing her family's tragedies and asking Jane what exactly had been Hardin's occupation, December 14, 1877.
1878 Letters: Jane Hardin and her children arrived at Hardin's mother's home in Bennett Station in North Texas in February. Brown Bowen is sentenced to hang for the murder of Tom Haldeman and on March 11, Hardin complains that Brown is blaming him for the murder. He tells Jane that her father has been the cause of the indictment against him for the murder of J. B. Morgan in 1873. On March 26, Hardin writes Jane that Brown got Mannen Clements indicted for the Paten Patterson killing of July 25, 1872. Brown Bowen was hung on May 17 and Hardin, in a May 18 letter to Jane, describes how her sister and father begged him to take the blame for the Haldeman murder, tells why he refused to do so and describes Brown's hanging. On May 19, Mattie Bowen writes her sister Jane how she found Brown's corpse waiting for her and her father when they returned home to Gonzales County from Austin. Hardin learns his conviction has been affirmed in June. Jane Hardin quarrels with her mother-in-law and Hardin writes her in August to mend her relations with his mother. (The reasons for the quarrel are not given.) An August 3 letter from Mannen Clements to Jane also urges her to end the quarrel and advises her not to worry Hardin with her problems. Jane and the children go to Austin in the same month and are able to visit with Hardin in the Austin jail. On September 16, 1878 Hardin is taken under Ranger guard to Comanche for sentencing and he writes Jane describing his travels. On October 5 he enters the Huntsville penitentiary to serve a 25-year sentence as #7109. Jane returns to his mother in Red River County. Hardin's letter writing in prison is restricted and letters are read by prison authorities. By December he has found a guard, J. C. Outlaw, who will slip out letters for him. Hardin writes in his autobiography (127) that he immediately began planning his escape. His letters are circumspect but in a slipped out letter of December 28 he describes an escape attempt. He does not admit blame but says he was punished.
1879 Letters: In his letters to Jane, Hardin often expresses his love for her and the children. On January 9, 1879, he reminisces on their courtship in uncharacteristic detail. Later he apologizes that he exposed their courtship conversation which intimates how very aware he is that his letters are being read by others. In a letter of February 23 which he is slipping out through a guard, he warns Jane to be careful about what she writes, to pretend that she only wants him to be released legally. Letters to Jane of January 26 and February 9 also go into more detail about conditions at prison mentioning escape attempts and punishment. On February 9, Hardin tells Jane about Mannen Clements' legal troubles and that her sister Mattie married Oliver Odom. While Jane is still in Bennett he repeatedly urges her to be considerate of his mother and family. Jane leaves Hardin's mother around April 4 and goes to Austin. By May, she is living with Mannen Clements' family in San Saba County. In a May 11 letter to Mannen Clements, Hardin asks him to give information to Texas Rangers, Lee Hall and J. B. Armstrong, which will help them convict members of the mob who lynched Scrap Taylor. (Hardin relates in his autobiography that Scrap Taylor was lynched by Suttonites after the Webb murder). Mannen Clements is in Austin to take care of an aggravated assault charge mentioned in an earlier letter. In June, Hardin is put in boot shop and writes he has become a good fitter and cutter. On June 19, 1879, Sally Jane Clements, wife of Joseph Hardin Clements, writes Jane about an Indian raid against nearby settlers in West Texas. In August and September, Hardin's mother and family are moving around looking for another place to farm. November 2, Hardin tells Jane to enjoy her stay in Gonzales where her family lives and advises her to "let bygones alone." He is most likely referring to the animosities between Hardin and the Bowens over the Bowen's part in Hardin's arrest and Brown Bowen's hanging.
1880 Letters: There are only five letters and one four-side page of school exercises belonging to Edward Bowen from this year. None of the letters are to or from John Hardin. In May, Elizabeth Hardin writes to Jane in Gonzales that Hardin has had his letter writing privileges taken away after he has been caught planning an escape in clandestine correspondence with Mannen Clements. In August 1880, Hardin attempted escape again and these attempts undoubtedly are the reason he is unable or unwilling to write. (Marohn, 150)
1881 Letters: On June 3, 1881, Hardin writes Jane again after a long hiatus. He explains, in a rather circumspect manner, why he had not written. He is basically saying that since he could not be frank with her (he is possibly referring to his escape attempts and punishment), there was no point in writing at all. He also offers her the opportunity to leave him since they are forced to live apart. He indicates a prison superintendent convinced him to write his mother after she repeatedly wrote asking what had happened to him. He claims that he has decided to make no more attempts to escape and hopes now to gain early release by earning good time or being pardoned. On July 3, 1881, Hardin writes that he worships on the Sabbath, belongs to the Moral and Christian Society and is secretary of the Debating Society. Once again he offers Jane her freedom if she thinks it is in her best interest. In a letter of August 14, he acknowledges that Jane has responded that she wants to remain his wife. He again gives reasons why he did not write her for so long including "to Keep you out of a disgraceful correspondence Something I cannot mention Now." On September 25, Hardin once more offers Jane her release if she wants it. He asks her to write and offers to give her advice on how to educate the children if she wants it.
1882 Letters: In a letter of February 26, Hardin writes that he is glad Jane has chosen to wait for him. In his next letter of April 2, he tells her that he wants to see her but not in stripes. Hardin's mother is writing from Gainesville in May and Hardin's sister, Matt Smith, moves to Lampasas Springs after her husband Bright's house burns down. The children are growing and Hardin's letters increasingly discuss their upbringing beginning with Sep 3. There is one letter from Jane's father Neill Bowen, the only letter of his in the collection. It is written from Pollard, Alabama to Wad who is probably a resident of Gonzales County. Some have thought Wad was Wes but the contents of the letter indicate rather that Neill is writing to someone who has family in Florida and is living in the free world.
1883 Letters: There is only one letter from this year written to Jane Hardin by her sister. Hardin writes in his autobiography that he tried to escape in 1883 without success. In the fall, he became very ill from an abscess to an old gun wound received in 1872. When he is well enough, he is put to work in the tailor shop. (Hardin 131-133)
1884 Letters: Hardin's letters begin to appear on prison forms. He writes Jane two letters in this year indicating he spent most of the year sick from his wound.
1885 Letters: In May, Hardin's mother Elizabeth died at the age of 58 in Ennis, Texas. In August, Hardin asks prison superintendent Ben McCulloch for proper medical treatment saying he has been suffering for two years. In September, Hardin writes Jane that he is feeling better after 2 years of sickness and that sickness prevented him from writing more. His two oldest children begin to write him.
1886 Letters: Hardin begins to write his children directly, giving them advice on the importance of education and the proper way to behave.
1887 Letters: Hardin continues to lecture wife and children using more biblical quotes and religious references. He explains to his children that he was unjustly imprisoned.
1888 Letters: Hardin writes flowery letters instructing Jane and the children on how they should behave. In a February 5th letter, he tells Jane his release date has been moved up because of his good conduct. He promises that if released, he will try to purge himself of his "wicked intemperate ways." On June 24, he defends his past as the actions of a brave man fighting all foes. He has never surrendered and he stood up against the mob. On October 7, Hardin tells Jane to tell the children all about him and that they should imitate his virtues and avoid his faults.
1889 Letters: All the letters from this year are addressed to the children but the body of the letter often contains individual messages to each member of his family. Hardin continues to claim he is imprisoned unjustly. In the July 14 letter to his daughter Jane, he relates his version of the Webb killing, his brother's lynching, his arrest and trial. He also expresses sorrow that Jane's father, Neill Bowen has died. In October he asks Jane why she is not writing.
1890 Letters: In an April letter, Hardin attacks successive Governor's administrations from Davis to Ross. He writes that he has endured 13 years of slavery in prison and the 10 years before he was in "tragic battle" with Yankee soldiers and their supporters. In a November letter, Hardin tells Jane to keep her good looks since he expects to be free in three years. He adds that he will continue to battle for his rights, and for the children to cease writing for the present. In every letter, Hardin gives advice on the behavior of the children.
1891 Letters: Many of these letters are addressed to Jane Hardin written by John and various other family members. Following a Southern familial custom, John continues advising Jane on the behavior of the children. In an April letter, John pleads with Jane to teach the children "that it is cowardly to lie to Steal to rob [‚Ä¶] to murder or to violate any law civil." Hardin also receives a letter from L.A. Whatley, Superintendent of Penitentiaries, detailing additional prison time Hardin has accrued on account of his "misconduct" and relates to Hardin's that his term will thus expire on January 22, 1894, if Hardin "will be acquiescent & obedient to the rules."
1892 Letters: Letters from the Fly & McNeal law firm are of interest here, such as one letter dated May 18, in which W.S. McNeal writes to Hardin reassuring him that his case "is a good one and will be of great benefit with the governor in obtaining a pardon for you." Also of interest here are the heartfelt letters that Hardin sent to his children. In an August letter to his son and two daughters, Hardin writes that "Your papa" desires to greet his family with "Kisses of love and tender caresses emblematic of his deep and Sinceere [sic] affection for each of you."
1893 Letters: Considering that Hardin was released from prison the following year, many of documents contained here are not surprisingly related to Hardin's case (with various references to the murder of J.B. Morgan); including formal interaction with state legislators and Governor J.S. Hogg.
1894 Letters: Recently released from prison, Hardin is involved in prolific correspondence with various persons including sheriffs, attorneys, and local merchants. Of peculiar interest are several bills Hardin received from J.P. Randle, P. Levyson, and (responding to a request for a law book catalogue) Gilbert Book Company.
1895 Letters: One singular article of interest here is Hardin's business card‚Äîas an attorney at law in El Paso. The card is fixed to a note, which reads, "This card and about 80 others were found in Hardin's room after he was killed in 1895." One humorous letter dated July 11, from J.H. Flynth, asks Hardin to "please tell me when you was convicted the first time and what was your sentence [‚Ä¶] for the purpose of settling a dispute here in regard to the matter." This was answered in a script that (to this writer) appears to be J.W. Hardin's, but was written "in regard to Mr. Hardin," and is unsigned.

This collection contains the reference photocopies of the Hardin correspondence.
The Cormac McCarthy Papers span 1964-2007 and document the literary career of one of America's most celebrated authors. The collection contains Published Works and Unpublished Works. The bulk of the collection is Published Works, housed in boxes 1 through 96. All of McCarthy's published novels and produced plays and screenplays are represented: The Orchard Keeper (boxes 1-7); Outer Dark (boxes 8-15); Child of God (boxes 16-17); The Gardener's Son (box 18); Suttree (boxes 19-34); Blood Meridian (boxes 35-45); All the Pretty Horses (boxes 46-54); The Crossing (boxes 55-65); The Stonemason (boxes 66-68); Cities of the Plain (boxes 69-78); No Country for Old Men (boxes 79-86); The Road (boxes 87-93); and The Sunset Limited (boxes 94-96).
The works are arranged chronologically by publication/production date. The material for each title is arranged into the following subseries: correspondence; research; notes; drafts; fragments; proofs; and production materials. Not every title has material from each subseries. For example, there is no correspondence associated with Outer Dark or Child of God; and The Gardener's Son is the only title with a subseries devoted to research. Other titles such as Blood Meridian have some research materials within the "notes" subseries.
Drafts represent the bulk of material for each title and are arranged chronologically as best determined. All pages of each draft remain in the original order, and pagination lists exist for each, representing McCarthy's unique page-numbering practice -- particularly for early and revised drafts. Nearly every draft arrived at the Collections with a numbered cover sheet that includes descriptive information such as title, draft stage, and page numbers. These sheets remain with the materials, although the listed page number counts are often inaccurate. The true count and pagination can be found in the container list of this finding aid.
Unpublished Works contains drafts for McCarthy's unproduced screenplay, "Whales and Men," (box 97) and a novel with the working title "The Passenger" (box 98). McCarthy began both Cities of the Plain and No Country for Old Men as screenplays, and although his scripts were never produced, the notes and drafts for them are housed in the boxes with the published novels of the same titles.
Correspondence, notes, drafts, and proofs relating to McCarthy's 1965 novel, The Orchard Keeper.
"The carbon I have doesn't necessarily have the same page-numbers as the copies you quote from, hence I am not sure what transpires on page 67‚Ä¶" Discusses punctuation and chapter divisions.
"I was glad to get your letter and to know that the book is acceptable to you‚Ä¶" Wishes him well as he is leaving Random House.
"Thank you for the letter. In regard to the apostrophes I meant all of them that had been omitted from negative contractions‚Ä¶" Inquires about possibility of magazine excerpt of novel; recommends the cartoons of Fernando Krahn, and discloses that his typewriter is a "Royal Portable, Quiet Deluxe model, vintage circa 1958."
"To take most important things first, the note on page 260: the passage does refer to the cat sequence on 246-248‚Ä¶"
"Enclosed are the letter and the sheets you sent. Some of the inconsistencies I was aware of, others were more in the nature of typographical errors, or just plain carelessness‚Ä¶"
"Remember to insert galleys McCarthy sent back at later date with further corrections."
"I am shipping you at this date, two pages of the above title [The Orchard Keeper] consisting of: Copyright page, About the Author‚Ä¶" Both pages are included.
"May I give this set of McCarthy galleys to [ ] to send abroad?"
"Here, at last, all of the papers, ms, galleys, etc. on the above [The Orchard Keeper]‚Ä¶"

Praising Outer Dark and asking if McCarthy will inscribe books.
"Thank you for your very kind letter‚Ä¶" Mentions stories in Yale
Review and Sewanee Review. "I don't write short stories‚Ä¶I won't have
another book finished for a couple of years." He will inscribe the books.
Asking about foreign editions, and promising a complimentary
subscription to Works, a magazine that Woolmer had a hand in publishing.
Thanking for inscribed books.
"Thank you for the letter and note‚Ä¶I have an artist friend who wants to do an illustrated edition of my forthcoming book [Child of God] but it remains to be seen whether the publisher will take to the idea." Supplies the names of publishers of foreign editions of his books. Thanks Woolmer for Works: "I was really amazed at the quality of material they're publishing. Most literary quarterlies these days are pretty grim. I particularly liked Lyn Lifshin's poems. And Paul Blackburn's Bertran de Born."
"Thank you for the book of poems‚Ä¶This girl is very good. I particularly liked 'You who rejoice in Symmetry', but of the ones I have had a chance to read there are none bad‚Ä¶"
Inquiring about purchasing manuscripts, corrected galleys, etc. of The Orchard Keeper and Outer Dark.
"Sorry to be so long in answering your letter. The new book [Child of God] is on the fall lists and will be out, I am told, in December. It is not the longer book that I was writing, but a shorter one which intruded itself in the middle of writing the other one." Replies to Woolmer's inquiry about buying manuscripts saying he has all the "stuff" and would consider an offer if Woolmer tendered one.
Asking for an inventory of manuscripts in order to make an offer.

Sending the Miller-Fraenkel book; discussing the reviews of The Gardener's Son; and asking about early works in preparation for a possible bibliography [as yet unpublished]. Corresponding New York Times advertisement for the PBS Visions series, and a November / December 1976 issue of Coda: Poets and Writers Newsletter with mention of the series on p. 9.
"Thank you for the book. It is very exotic looking. This was the only one of Millers books I didnt have and I've been looking forward to reading it for years‚Ä¶" Mentions his early publications: "I'm afraid theres not much research to do in the way of bibliography. Think I published a story once in a college rag‚Ä¶When I started writing novels I stopped writing anything else. Never wrote no poetry." Ends with "I'm in Tucson working on my 'western' [Blood Meridian] Long book supposed to be out this year but maybe not."
Thanking him for typescript and asking to have it signed. Suggests Woolmer/Brotherson publish a limited signed edition of "Burial" [previously published in Antaeus].
"Thank you for the note. Letter, I guess‚Ä¶" Mentions he did not know that Antaeus had published an excerpt from Suttree. "I dont like to find my name in little magazines, but the idea of a limited edition sounds interesting. I'm working on a western [Blood Meridian] ‚Äì based loosely on historical events in Mexico in 1849 ‚Äì illustrated with about 2 dozen period prints ‚Äì woodcuts mostly. The book is essentially finished (300 pp) but needs to be completely rewritten‚Ä¶"
Regarding Suttree, which he does not like as much as McCarthy's other works, but feels it is still "miles ahead of anything being written by any other writer." Asks if McCarthy uses a typewriter; discusses possibility of publishing McCarthy's "western."
"Thank you for your letter and here's your book‚Ä¶" Robert Coles sent him proofs of a review to appear in the New Yorker. Mentions another review: "I suppose by now you may have seen the thing in Esquire, I enjoyed the cartoon. Thought it showed a wit and discernment the reviewer [Geoffrey Wolff] could have used. Also the cartoonist managed to get all the words spelled right." Answers Woolmer's question about his writing process: "I normally use a typewriter (you asked) and I think you can see why." Mentions that Random House has publishing rights for "the western" but that maybe Woolmer can publish an excerpt.
Providing details of publishing history.
"Thank you very much for the Levertov. It is very handsome‚Ä¶" mentions Kosinki's book in passing, agrees that Esquire has fallen on hard times, he's seen a number of reviews, some of them nice ones. Mentions that his editor is Albert Erskine and that Woolmer should contact him about publishing the excerpt.
Regarding publishing an excerpt of Blood Meridian.
"What are you doing? Did you ever hear from Albert about the limited signed edition‚Ä¶?"
Regarding cancelled trip to Vanderbilt and response received from Albert Erskine.
"Sorry you didnt get down to Nashville, would have enjoyed seeing you‚Ä¶" Discusses Random House, "Albert is semi-retired and probably considered some sort of relic of bygone years by the functional illiterates now in command‚Ä¶" Also, "a short section of the western is to appear ‚Äì I am told ‚Äì in the next issue of Triquarterly. The issue being devoted to the literature of the West. I'm branching out."
Informing him that Robert Penn Warren considers McCarthy a "most talented writer." Recommends the film Wise Blood.
"Thank you for your very nice letter‚Ä¶" Mentions that Robert Penn Warren and he share the same editor at Random House [Erskine]. "Interesting that he [Warren] liked Child of God. Some people think it a most peculiar book, but lately it has been receiving a sort of belated enthusiasm in the form of reviews and theses and such." Mentions that Wise Blood actors Brad Dourif and Ned Beatty were also both in The Gardner's Son.
Sending May 2, 1980 TLS review of Suttree [review included].
"Thanks for the clipping. You were right, I probably would not have seen it‚Ä¶I'm getting ready to head west for the final push on my novel [Blood Meridian]. Hope to get it done by the end of the year." Erskine and Random House are very negative about a limited edition. "I don't have an agent anymore and am in a sort of limbo‚Ä¶" All of his books except for the most recent are out of print; inquires if Woolmer knows of a paperback house that might be interested.
Received Triquarterly. "The Scalphunters" is powerful, but confused about characters. Comments on the stuffing genitals into victim's mouths. Mentions reading John Yount.
"Thanks for your letter, it is always nice to hear from you‚Ä¶The characters in the story [Blood Meridian] are a bunch of American adventurers in Chihuahua in 1849 who have contracted to supply scalps to the government‚Ä¶" Mentions John Yount's The Trapper's Last Shot. Also mentions getting "a little windfall from a foundation [MacArthur] so expect to stay in business a while longer." Might go to Europe.
Suggests getting together if McCarthy comes out East.
"I'm looking for a book for a friend of mine and thought maybe you could help me‚Ä¶" Forty-Four Years of the Life of a Hunter by Meschach [sic] Browning. "The western proceeds apace ‚Äì not a blistering pace, I suppose, but it goes." Describes getting caught in the middle of a gunfight between police and criminals in Knoxville, "A news lady rushed up to me with a microphone and a tape recorder and asked me what was going on. I told her I had no idea, but it certainly seemed like the good old days for a few minutes."
Promising to look for the Browning book. Asks if McCarthy couldn't use
a good agent.
"Thanks for the letter. Yes, the Meschach [sic] Browning book is what I need‚Ä¶" States his literary affairs are "a long and tiresome tale at best‚Ä¶. My agent for several years was Candida Donadio...she expressed her satisfaction at representing me personally and negotiated the contract for the book with which I am now occupied. That was the last I ever heard of her‚Ä¶I wrote and told her I'd like to make official what already existed in fact and we amicably parted‚Ä¶After this I wrote some other agents who'd been recommended to me by a friend but the one or two who wrote back seemed less than jubilant about the prospects of representing me. So Random House is now my agent‚Ä¶"
Has asked John Malcolm Brinnin [Gertrude Stein and Dylan Thomas biographer] about agents and his is Dorothy Olding of the Harold Ober Associates, Inc. Waiting for "the western" to come out; is buying up copies of Orchard Keeper to hand out to friends.
"Good to hear from you. Thank you for your inquiries on my behalf‚Ä¶" Planning a trip to New York at beginning of new year. Random House has sold the paperback rights to his early books to the Ecco Press.
Congratulations on receiving the MacArthur grant. Wall Street Journal clipping about the grant from November 19, 1981 included.
"Thank you for the letter and the good wishes‚Ä¶The MacArthur people just call you up and ask where to send the checks. It was something of a shock...My creditors seem much gratified‚Ä¶I am still struggling with my mss, but it goes ok‚Ä¶"
Recommending agent Peter Shepherd who handles Muriel Spark in the U.S. and suggests McCarthy contact him.
"Thanks for the letter. Please dont apologize for trying to find readers for my books‚Ä¶In the same mail came a letter from Peter Shepherd asking that I call him ‚Äì which I've done‚Ä¶"

The MacArthur largess expires in a little over a year and I've gotten used to eating regularly and dont know what will happen when the money stops. Other than that I have 2 or 3 novels that I have notes and a few sections for but I dont know which one to hone in on. Probably the most difficult one‚Ä¶"
"Thanks for sending the review (Images of the Southern Writer)‚Ä¶" Just back from a week-long rafting/hiking trip in Big Bend. "I'm working on a couple of stories in filmscript form. Very good form for conserving the word‚Ä¶"

I dont really propose to do any thing with this junk except keep it‚Ä¶Anyway I'm still at work on my little projects I've finished rough drafts of 2 novels and started a third. They are all three connected‚Ä¶"
"Sorry for the long hiatus in our correspondence‚Ä¶" Just received a batch of reviews [All the Pretty Horses]. "I was very distressed over Chatwin's death. A talented and honest man and a decent human being ‚Äì the perfect candidate, in other words for the fates to single out‚Ä¶I've lost another writer friend two weeks ago ‚Äì Ed Abbey. I think he came across in his writing as some thing of a curmudgen [sic] but he was a kind and generous man ‚Äì qualities, sad to say, not common to writers‚Ä¶" Refers to Woolmer's comments about selling his manuscripts, "I get requests from institutions wanting me to send them my manuscripts. I sometimes wonder vaguely what they think I use for money. I've been a full time professional writer for 28 years and I've never received a royalty check. That, I'll betcha, is a record‚Ä¶"

Posters are divided into Willie Nelson and non-Willie Nelson subseries. The Nelson posters include ones for the sixth annual Fourth of July picnic; Honeysuckle Rose, and two advertising concerts. The bulk of the non-Willie Nelson posters are for concerts at the Austin Opry House by performers such as The Charlie Daniels Band, Kinky Friedman, Dave Loggins, The Lost Gonzo Band, and Taj Mahal.
These audio cassettes primarily feature Willie Nelson, though there are several of other recording artists. The cassettes are in varying condition, some have been recorded over multiple times and the labels are not always descriptive of what is on the tape. The series of audio recordings has been divided into 5 subseries; Jody Fischer recordings, Willie Nelson studio recordings, Willie Nelson dated live recordings, Willie Nelson undated live recordings, and other recording artists. The collection also included a variety of commercially produced and released cassettes that have been transferred to the library holdings.
The cassettes covered a broad scope of music, as well as some personal recordings of events, phone calls and jam sessions. The cassettes did not have a particular original order, and when possible have been arranged by date. The priority for sorting recordings was broken down by separating out the Studio recordings, Jody's own recordings which give insight to the interests and activities outside of strictly music that she participated in as an individual and as Willie Nelson's personal assistant. Following that recordings are sorted by those including Willie Nelson, and those of other artists.
When it is not possible to sort by date, the recordings are sorted by alphabetical order of contributing artists. Often the labels only include first names, such as Hank, Dolly, Kris, Frank, and Johnny to name a few. While some of the last names can be inferred based on other famous musicians and context, last names that have been added by the processing staff are put in parenthesis to indicate that they are additions not included on the actual labels.
Subseries 1: Jody Fisher Recordings, 1988-1996, undated
These recordings are difficult to date, frequently Fischer has recorded over other tapes, and many of her recordings have Willie Nelson music on the other side. These recordings include phone conversations, Hawaiian music taped from the radio on her trip to Hawaii, and programs focusing on Native American civil rights, amongst other topics.
Subseries 2: Willie Nelson Studio Recordings, 1983-1987, undated
These recordings with one exception are from the Pedernales Studio. They are arranged by date when possible, with undated recordings at the end of the series.
Subseries 3: Willie Nelson Recordings Dated, 1976-1995
These recordings vary from jam sessions to concerts to rough recordings prior to production. Often they include other artists such as Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, and other country, folk and blues artists.
Subseries 4: Willie Nelson Recordings, Undated
These recordings are similar to those in subseries 3, except that they are undated. Recordings will be grouped by collaborating artists listed on the labels.
Subseries 5: Recordings by Other Artists, 1982-1986, undated
These are other unproduced recordings in the Jody Fischer collections featuring other artists. These are sorted alphabetically by artist last name.
Tape has a date of December 1, 1985 on label.
This series consists of VHS and U-Matic tapes. Most of the tapes are programs featuring Willie Nelson recorded from television. The programs include news interviews, music concerts, television shows and film. The majority of the tapes are produced video although, there are some tapes featuring raw footage of Willie Nelson. The raw footage includes a music performance at a bar in 1990, the auction of Willie Nelson's personal belongings, Willie Nelson performing at Phoenix Indian School and Willie Nelson performing a toast to Mae Boren Axton. The raw footage tapes have been copied onto DVDs.
The collection also includes television recordings of Farm Aid 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that aired on the MTV network. The VHS tapes that do not feature Willie Nelson include two episodes of Ned Blessing, a raw footage recording of the play, Small Town Girl and a raw footage recording of a tribal award ceremony with Kris Kristoferson in attendance. Titles supplied by Jody Fischer are in quotations.
This series is divided into five subseries: Farm Aid Concerts, Farm Aid Related Videos, Willie Nelson Produced Video, Willie Nelson Raw Footage and Non-Willie Nelson.
The bulk of the series are T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets and hats. Most of the T-Shirts are from Farm Aid, the 4th of July Picnic, and other concerts with some from various running events, and a few from the Austin Opry House. The four sweatshirts are from Farm Aid. The jackets include paraphernalia from Willie Nelson concerts, Pederanales Recording Studio, and the 1984 Darrel and Willie Invitational. There are two hats; one white hat with "Willie Nelson Luck Texas," on the band, and one baseball cap with "Willie Nelson Who'll Buy My Memories? The IRS Tapes," on the front. Also included in this series is a variety of items including match boxes, pins, golf balls fans, and bumper stickers.

The Nadine Eckhardt Collection spans from the 1920s-2009. The collection is comprised of photographs, correspondence, business materials, newspapers clippings and early and final versions of Duchess of Palms. The original order of the Nadine Eckhardt Collection was maintained with minimal changes. The collection was originally arranged chronologically by Duchess of Palms materials, correspondence between Nadine and Billy Lee Brammer 1956-1968, correspondence between Bob, Nadine, and her family 1970s-1983, and Nadine's personal correspondence, 1944 through 1999. The chronological order was maintained, but the materials were organized into five series: Personal Papers - restaurant and scrapbook materials, Family Papers - Billy Lee Brammer, Bob Eckhardt, family, and personal, Photographs - organized chronologically, Print Materials - newspapers and other articles, and Duchess of Palms Materials - drafts, timelines and notes.
Original folder tiles are in quotation marks.

The Sam Shepard and Johnny Dark Collection spans 1972-2011 and documents the men's forty-plus year friendship. The collection is arranged in five series: Correspondence, Dialogues, Photographs, Audio Material, and Video Material.
Series I: Correspondence comprises the bulk of the collection (boxes 1-4) and is arranged chronologically. The first letters are from the early 1970s when the Shepards lived briefly in England and the Darks remained in California. Because the two families lived together for many years, there are few letters until 1980 when Shepard began filming on location. The letters pick up in earnest in 1983 after Shepard left his wife and son and began a long-term relationship with actress Jessica Lange. For the next three decades, the two men kept up a fairly regular correspondence.
Series II: Dialogues is over 200 pages of typed transcripts of conversations that Dark and Shepard recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. Arranged in themed sections by Dark, the conversations cover a wide range of topics including relationships, writing, film, ageing, and friendship.
Series III: Photographs is comprised of photographs collected by Dark. Many are mounted onto notebook pages with annotations in Dark's hand. These photographs provide a glimpse into the private lives of the men. The bulk of the photos are of Shepard and Dark, but there are also images of Scarlett Dark, O-Lan Jones, Jesse Shepard, Sam Rogers (Shepard's father) and Jessica Lange. The photographs are in the order in which Dark arranged them, and each has a unique identifying number (001-178) assigned by the archivist. In addition to the numbered photographs, there are over 250 snapshots taken by Dark. Many of these are duplicates of the numbered photographs, but there are several unique ones including shots of Shepard on the set of All the Pretty Horses with Matt Damon, photos from Jesse Shepard's wedding, and more photos of Shepard and of Dark.
Series IV: Audio Material contains 28 tapes of varying audio quality. Most of the tapes feature conversations between Shepard and Dark - some recorded in person, some over the telephone. The tapes from the 1970s and 1980s form the basis of Dark's typescript, Dialogues, in Series II. All of the cassettes have been digitized, and there are listening copies available. Archives staff have provided summaries of many, but not all, of the digitized tapes.
Series V: Video Material consists of two items. The first is a VHS tape of home movies shot by Dark. The video quality is relatively poor, but the tape has been digitized and a viewing copy is available. The second item is a DVD of the documentary, Shepard and Dark, directed by Treva Wurmfeld. Access to this DVD is by special permission only.

Johnny talks about an old girlfriend named Evelyn and the first time they met. He gives a description of her physical appearance and how they "made out" in a car. There are also various other things that are hard to hear or understand because of the low volume.
Side A: On this side of the tape, Sam and Johnny play guitar and sing songs. They discuss different places they have lived, how Los Angeles started out as a hacienda, how to become a "man with a mission", how Sam's first play had old men in it and how his plays have young men who turn old. They also discuss the racial tensions with Jazz music in the 1940's and how they should make movies about it.
Side B: Johnny discusses the contents of a letter he received from a girlfriend about how she is not in love with him. Johnny goes on to talk about the break up and some of his past relationships.

The Lonesome Dove archive contains scripts, memos, letters, notes, production forms, set and costume sketches, set blueprints, photographs, props, costumes, videotapes, audiocassettes and a laser videodisc. The material details every aspect of the production--from the writing of the teleplay through the budgeting, casting, planning, scheduling, filming, publicity and distribution.
The archival arrangement follows the order of production and is organized into eleven series:
1. Story and Script
2. Producer's Unit
3. Production Staff
4. Casting
5. Art
6. Wardrobe
7. Production
8. Post-Production
9. Distribution
10. Publicity
11. Congratulations and Awards.
Of particular interest are the various drafts of the screenplay, the almost complete set of production records, the dailies, the set designs, the story boards, the props, the costumes, the costume research notes and Bill Wittliff's photography of the cast and filming.
The archive was donated through Bill Wittliff. Some material was sent to Wittliff for inclusion in the collection by others--producer Suzanne de Passe; storyboard artist Michael Peal; property master Eric Williams; actors Tim Scott, Glenne Headly and Anjelica Huston; production designers Cary White and John Frick; costume designer Van Broughton Ramsey; and composer Basil Poledouris. The remainder of the archive belonged to Wittliff as writer and producer.
Suzanne de Passe, president of Motown Productions, enlisted Bill Wittliff to write the screenplay for Lonesome Dove. Wittliff, a native Texan, had been writing films since 1977, beginning with the CBS-TV movie Thaddeus Rose and Eddie and including credit for The Black Stallion (1979),Honeysuckle Rose (1980), Raggedy Man (1981), Barbarosa (1982), Country (1984) and Red Headed Stranger(1986). Wittliff's experience compelled him to seek some creative control to assure his ability to protect the integrity of his script. He was made executive producer as well as screenwriter, and he shared creative control with de Passe and CBS-TV. The collection of notes, drafts, polishes and final script provides an unusually clear-cut example of how to transform a lengthy, multi-peopled, much-beloved novel into a film while still retaining the substance of the original.
The series begins with a typescript of Lonesome Dove sent by Larry McMurtry's agent Irving Paul (Swifty) Lazar to Suzanne de Passe in 1985. This is followed by Wittliff's marked hardback and paperback copies of the novel; by the notes, rough drafts, and typescripts for each of the four parts of the miniseries; and by the final shooting script with blue and pink pages reflecting revisions made just before and during shooting. The title page of the shooting script was signed by every actor who had a speaking line in the miniseries.
Executive Producers: Suzanne de Passe and Bill Wittliff
Assistant to Mr. Wittliff: Connie Todd
Co-executive Producer: Robert Halmi
Producer: Dyson Lovell
Supervising Producer: Michael Weisbarth
This series is primarily made up of correspondence among the producers. The majority of the memos are from Dyson Lovell and deal with scheduling, hiring, budget, set behavior, etc. Wittliff's files contain letters, thank yous from actors, bills and notes relating to the production. Present also is the correspondence of Wittliff's assistant Connie Todd as well as her research on period music to be used in the film.
Production Manager: Dick Gallegly
Assistant Production Manager: Adam Merims
1st Assistant Director: Robert Rooy
Key 2nd Assistant Director: Matt Bearson
Production Coordinator: Jill Lopez
Asst. Production Coordinator: Nikol Hegarty
Location Manager: John Gibson
Script Supervisor: Cynthia Upstill
Here is found the paperwork of the production manager and the script supervisor. The production manager supervises the technical staff and is responsible for the budget and technical details of the production. His memos deal with cost, censorship, location information, set problems, etc. His staff prepares the production forms--standard documents used throughout the film and television industry which detail every aspect of a production. Included here are the budget breakdown, script breakdown, production board, shooting schedules, Day-Out-of-Days, One-liner Schedules, Call Sheets and Daily Production Reports.
The Script Supervisor is responsible for continuity, i.e. assuring that the different takes are consistent with one another despite the fact that scenes are rarely shot in chronological or script sequence order. This position also serves as the link between the director and the film editor. The Continuity Script and the Cutter's Log represent the script supervisor's functions
Casting (Principals): Lynn Kressel, New York
Casting (Locals): Liz Keigley, Texas
The memos in this series relate casting requirements, options considered and actors chosen.
Production Designer: Cary White
Assistant Production Designer: John Frick
Storyboard Artist: Michael Peal
Property Master: Eric Williams
Here are found the set designs as drawn by the Production Designer Cary White and his assistant, John Frick. Cary White, a Texas-based designer, had worked with Wittliff on Red Headed Stranger (1986) and had also designed for Texas Chainsaw Massacre II (1986) and Nadine (1987). The drawings and plans for Lonesome Dove include a sketch of the town of Lonesome Dove, construction details for the Whiskey Boat, a map showing the path of the characters from Texas to Montana, a sketch of Clara's ranch and a sketch of the Montana ranch.
This series also holds the storyboard rough drawings and copies of the finished drawings for Scenes 24 to 28, "Horse Rustling;" Scenes 56 to 59, "Dust Storm and Lightning;" and Scenes 223 to 225, "Buffalo Chase and Gus's wounding." Each of these sequences requires action, a large cast of animals and/or special effects. The pictorial layout of the shots in storyboard form facilitates the logistical planning of the scenes to avoid risk, delay or unnecessary takes. Storyboard artist Michael Peal had previously drawn storyboards for Blood Simple (1982) and Save the Dog (1987). He had been a set dresser on Red Headed Stranger (1985) and a set decorator on Texas Chainsaw Massacre II (1986).
Included here too are the Property Master Eric Williams' snapshots used for continuity. These photos illustrate in great detail the mass of props employed in the miniseries--saddles, bridles, guns, bows, belts, gear, bedrolls, etc. The Polaroids were originally kept on large circular rings or tied together with leather thongs. The series also contains actual props such as Gus' muslin wrapped body, Gus' Colt Dragoon pistol, knife, and Gus' and Deets' grave markers and Po Campo's walking stick.
Costume Designer: Van Broughton Ramsey
Costume designer Ramsey had previously designed the wardrobe for Horton Foote's dramas of early 20th century Texas life, 1918 (1984), and On Valentine's Day (1986). Ramsey kept his notes, forms and drawings in two cloth zipper notebook containers. A blue container held Ramsey's sketches of costumes for the principal characters and includes notes from the novel, cloth swatches and photocopies of period photos from books and articles. A purple container held the shooting schedule, contact sheet, filming locations, purchases and sizes of the principals and extras. Four black notebooks (now removed) labeled Volume I to IV held snapshots on each character in costume, followed by a form listing every item of clothing worn in the scenes in which the character appeared. Also available in this series are costumes, hats, boots and other accessories.
This series deals with material used or generated during the filming of Lonesome Dove from March through July 1988. Glenn Headley contributed her script for the character Elmira marked with her notes. Bill Wittliff, not only a screenwriter and producer, but also an accomplished photographer, publisher and book designer, contributed many of his photographs of performers and scenes taken during the filming. A complete set of the dailies on 3/4 inch tape is also found in this series.
Editor: Corky Ehlers
Music: Basil Paledouris
This series covers the material used in the post-production phase--film editing and the addition of music and sound. It contains the post-production schedule, budget, location breakdown and cost reports. The cutting notes include the suggestions of Wittliff, the producer Dyson Lovell and the director Simon Wincer. The various cuts--the editor's rough cut, the director's cut, the producer's cuts and the final cuts--are available with permission on 3/4 inch and 1/2 inch videotape. The ADR sheets document the dialogue to be added to the film which was recorded in the studio in October 1988. The music is represented by spotting notes, memos, video recording session forms and audiotapes of the score by Basil Poledouris.
This series contains memos on distribution plans by Quintex, the company which held international distribution rights. Quintex went into bankruptcy and the court records found here provide information on foreign distribution of the miniseries.
The publicity files contain videotapes and clippings produced by CBS to promote the miniseries. In addition, there are various newspaper clippings and articles on Lonesome Dove including critical reviews and interviews with the cast.
The letters of congratulations to Wittliff found here indicate the enthusiasm with which the miniseries was greeted. There are files on the many honors received by Lonesome Dove--18 Emmy nominations which resulted in seven Emmys, the award for Best Miniseries and Best Television Program of 1989 from the National Association of Television Critics, the D. W. Griffith Award for Best Television Miniseries, the National Cowboy Hall of Fame Wrangle Award for the Best Western Television Feature in 1989, the Golden Globe Award for best Television Miniseries and Best Actor in a Miniseries, the Peabody Award and the Writers Guild of America award to Bill Wittliff for the teleplay.

There is also some publicity clippings, a few business records, flyers, and some Lonesome Dove production records.
"I think Columbia records probably owns the rights to the entire Wasteland shoot. They did full buyouts back then. Columbia did not fund the neon Candyland shoots. I paid for those and Columbia rejected them. There are some black and white prints from the Live in Aught Three cover shoot taken at the long gone Zephyr in Salt Lake City. Alan Pogue took those, ball cap turned backwards, Farmer's Daughter T-shirt., exit sign. I think his office is called Texas Center for Documentary Photography."
"Neon House installation for Smiley Poole, original "Candyland" shoot was by Ben Livingston of Austin. I think his business was called Benneon. Neon band, that I had hoped to use for the back cover of Candyland was in a studio owned by a photographer named Bechtolt (I think). Studio was on 6th Avenue in Manhattan not far north of Grammercy Park. My friend, Keith McDonald, who shot the "Wasteland" cover, was Bechtolt's assistant and shot the photos of the neon band."

Contained here are class notes, scripts, set designs, costume designs, playbills, letters, photographs, records, audiotapes, reports, clippings, magazines, articles, awards, school records, yearbooks, scrapbooks, personal effects, and mementos. The Texas series contains three subseries: Education and Teaching; Acting, Design, and Directing; and Dallas Theater Center Administration.

The second offers a good deal of information on her career as actor, director, and designer at the Dallas Theater Center. The third subseries covers her work as assistant artistic director to Paul Baker and is especially informative on the state of affairs during the transfer of the directorship at the Dallas Theater Center from Paul Baker to Adrian Hall.
The New Mexico series is arranged into four subseries: Teaching and Directing, Paul Baker Festival, Production and Script Files, and Personal. The first subseries provides information on Jones' work as artist-in-residence, and later as a faculty member at the College of Santa Fe. The second centers on the career of Paul Baker, especially at the Dallas Theater Center, and documents the 1990 festival organized by his former students to honor him. The third subseries is Jones' collection of scripts or production files including many of the plays performed at the Dallas Theater Center. The fourth contains material on Mary Sue's private life and non-theatrical interests, such as her baby book, gardening, and decoration ideas for her Santa Fe home.

The third subseries, Dallas Theater Center Administration, contains administrative files from the executive committee and search committee as well as budgets, planning files, memos, clippings, correspondence, contracts, and playbills. Here is found good documentation of Mary Sue's stint as Interim Artistic Director in 1982, including her plans for the redirection of the theater, and clippings and memos relating to the search for the new director which resulted in the hiring of Adrian Hall.
Mary Sue Jones left the Dallas Theater Center in 1983 and joined the College of Santa Fe as artist in residence. She taught and directed at the Greer Garson Theater Center becoming a full time faculty member at the College of Santa Fe in 1988. The first subseries, Teaching and Directing, contains class notes, student theses, reviews of College productions, and notes on faculty and college administration.

In this series, there are clippings about Preston as well as material on the Dallas Theater Center Endowment Fund set up in his memory.
Mary Sue Jones met Paul Baker as a student at Baylor University, and she went on to work closely with him as a member of his core group of artist-teachers until his forced retirement from the Dallas Theater Center in 1982. Afterwards, she continued to keep in touch with her mentor, inviting him to Santa Fe to oversee a production of Preston Jones' The Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia in 1985, while at the same time organizing a tribute to him.

Our Common Experience theme for the 2020-2021 academic year is Dynamics. When we discuss dynamics, we're talking about movement. It's motion ‚Äî but it's more than that. Think of the motivating forces behind everything, everywhere. There are physical forces, moral forces, and driving forces. You can see and feel dynamics in growth, change, inspiration, and action. We will consider the movement from where you are to where you will be, approaching dynamics both literally and metaphorically, from the observations of astrophysics to the momentum of daily life.
This theme will ask you to explore your own experiences in the contexts of space, place, movement, and time. By studying the past while examining your personal values, you can trace the paths of social, political, and cultural movements. Each new opportunity will add knowledge and experience ‚Äî leading you to see the influences and responsibilities you have in shaping our global future.
