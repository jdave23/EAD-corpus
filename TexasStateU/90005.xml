<p>Alfred Henry Nolle was born on April 28, 1889 in St. Charles, Missouri to Louis E. H. Nolle and Mary Wilhelmine Boenker Nolle.  Nolle graduated from the University of Missouri in 1911 receiving both a Bachelor of Science in Education and a Bachelor of Arts with honors in German. He completed his M.A. at the University of the South (Sewanee) in 1912 and his Ph.D. in German Literature at University of Pennsylvania in 1915. While at the University of Pennsylvania, Nolle received the Joseph G. Rosengarten Traveling Scholarship in Germanics  While traveling and studying in Germany in the summer of 1913, he met his future wife Berda Stewart Wilson. They were married on August 16, 1916. Nolle's dissertation, The German Drama on the St. Louis Stage, was published by the University of Pennsylvania in 1917.  </p><p>Upon receiving his Ph.D., Nolle returned to the University of Missouri and served as an instructor in Germanic languages for four years, 1915 through 1919. He began teaching German at Southwest Texas State Normal College in 1919 and was the first staff member to hold a Ph.D. By 1923, Nolle was appointed Dean of the Faculty, although he continued teaching while serving as an administrator.  In 1936, Nolle was appointed Dean of the College.  </p><p>Early in his career at Southwest Texas State, Dr. Nolle formed a relationship with future U.S. Senator and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The two corresponded until Johnson's death and Nolle maintained an interest in following Johnson's political career.  </p><p>Dr. Nolle served in a number of educational organizations during his career. At Southwest Texas State Teachers College, he served as the sponsor of extra-curricular clubs devoted to studying the German language, including Die Germanistische Gesellschaft and Der Schiller Verein.

Nolle as an educator and college administrator.  Records within this series include incoming correspondence, copies of outgoing correspondence, reports, statistics, short writings by Nolle and others, proposals, pamphlets, and meeting minutes.  The majority of the correspondents include administrators and faculty from other universities.  Congratulatory correspondence to Nolle on receipt of his honorary Doctor of Laws degree from East Texas Baptist College is included.  Correspondence to and from Lyndon B. Johnson and concerning Johnson's relationship with Nolle and the College are also found within the series.  Topics of the correspondence and records include the administration of Southwest Texas State Normal Collages and Southwest Texas State Teachers College, the accreditation of the college, academic standards, foreign language education, curriculum, College faculty, the Religious Activities Council, and San Marcos and its schools.  Although records within this series date to after Nolle's retirement from Southwest Texas State College, the majority of the materials relate to the College and to the organizations.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_4d3f29d5f88204d6ea1cf0b1ebe3ab74" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1935" type="inclusive">1920-1935</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_3c14c567bc1f056bdeb8e5e3a855deeb" label="Text [0112222277769]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_9834fb0bd5fad6162a198357a353a0bb" parent="aspace_3c14c567bc1f056bdeb8e5e3a855deeb" type="folder">8</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_2bf566c33ddbb97108c2809d7e4bc941" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1936/1936">1936</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_e5098b27cde2c890fe069f41561ec95a" label="Text [0112222277769]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_4ffd37a622c218224f1ed98af0e9b260" parent="aspace_e5098b27cde2c890fe069f41561ec95a" type="folder">9</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_6347df1bbf6d66c0e764f18b5a3f9f26" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1937/1942" type="inclusive">1937-1942</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_208712ae48c1d5dbf7efb3f68035a877" label="Text [0112222277769]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_8e6f0cbd7081ad8ed90ab8d0b457a8a4" parent="aspace_208712ae48c1d5dbf7efb3f68035a877" type="folder">10</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_729adabe0c76b1e6c8ddd293ea058a45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1943/1949" type="inclusive">1943-1949</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_db9eef211e4d1d88dce1c0e44f156220" label="Text [0112222277769]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_af0d66ef027ea3536ac00607c9692089" parent="aspace_db9eef211e4d1d88dce1c0e44f156220" type="folder">11</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ef9da0b00e1dc43882ef91b799701853" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1957" type="inclusive">1950-1957</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_e7f76c64139ea25b283ae3538ad87004" label="Text [0112222277769]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_5b3a1ff0a1750c068eb9bc2e5eaab9b8" parent="aspace_e7f76c64139ea25b283ae3538ad87004" type="folder">12</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_876b76a89cffd00533b4b885b6e027cf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1958/1970" type="inclusive">1958-1970</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_f57e2de1ec092f09dfa4f32b15032ed9" label="Text [0112222278015]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_084229fbe58fcb34bcd462c8be14ea85" parent="aspace_f57e2de1ec092f09dfa4f32b15032ed9" type="folder">1</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_ba58995ba22c2ebbe75e40a913eecef2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1977" type="inclusive">1971-1977</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_27131208f333b3b608884389f5dcaeb5" label="Text [0112222278015]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_48da1c2dd4874b0926b2e5e4f8efe450" parent="aspace_27131208f333b3b608884389f5dcaeb5" type="folder">2</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_31c9bb5fdfa7393b8d4aeb6050c01778" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, East Texas Baptist College commencement</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1956/1957" type="inclusive">1956-1957</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_b361e5ff0f462598ecb9a110eaf74935" label="Text [0112222278015]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_7db172ea43b7b41d74c9cdba6e68f8b6" parent="aspace_b361e5ff0f462598ecb9a110eaf74935" type="folder">3</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_6463ee1271f9eee1b9872f5dc65ee489" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, East Texas Baptist College commencement</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1957/1957">1957</unitdate><container altrender="5.0&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_53adffbf677fa234c894dd3b17cc2d17" label="Text [0112222278015]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_c4b90713c863357c348014ae18579e4c" parent="aspace_53adffbf677fa234c894dd3b17cc2d17" type="folder">4</container></did></c02><c02 id="aspace_27993fe9f0c59131abcc42964c661f87" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, Lyndon B.

Five photographs are Nolle portraits.  The date of creation for two of these photographs is estimated to be before 1919 as the photographer's imprint indicates the photograph was taken in Columbia, Missouri.  Hence, these photographs were probably taken when Nolle was in graduate school or teaching at the University of Missouri.  Images from the 1920's include a German club photo from 1922 and two undated photos of Southwest Texas State Teacher College faculty.  Identified staff members include: Alfred H. Nolle, E. O. Wiley, W. R. Boucher, Gates Thomas, A. C. Hurkholder, Mary C. Brogdon, and Georgia Lazenby.  Photographs of Lyndon B. Jonson signing the Higher Education Act of 1965 are also included.  A 1970 photograph of Dr. Nolle also includes fellow faculty member Robert Tampke and an individual identified as Harold C. Simon.</p></scopecontent><c02 id="aspace_f4216423818b8600294559f6475ad9c0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Photographs</unittitle><unitdate certainty="approximate" datechar="creation" normal="1900/1970" type="inclusive">before 1919-1970, undated</unitdate><container altrender="2.5&quot; Legal-size Document Case" id="aspace_b179c5b528db223dbd35f79e7390495b" label="Graphic Materials [0112222278031]" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_f727b0f76639160e097a1fd0c1984eaf" parent="aspace_b179c5b528db223dbd35f79e7390495b" type="folder">6</container></did></c02></c01></dsc>
