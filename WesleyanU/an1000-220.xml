<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>
Born in 1841 in Pleasantville, New York to a Methodist minister father, Andrus graduated from Wesleyan University in 1862. After teaching school in New Jersey for four years, he switched to a career in business and investing. He was primarily involved in the Arlington Chemical Company, which manufactured and distributed medicines typical of that time, including peptonoids, meant to help with stomach discomfort. He also invested in railroads, utilities, real estate, mining, and the Standard Oil Company. He also served as director of the New York Life Insurance Company, President of the New York Pharmaceutical Association, and President of the Palisade Manufacturing Corporation of Yonkers, Westchester County. He was said, however, to be particularly adept at locating and securing undervalued assets, particularly land. His business acumen ultimately earned him millions of dollars, securing his place as a member of the East Coast elite and allowing him to pursue other interests, including politics and philanthropy.</p>

<p>In 1903, already in his 60s, Andrus was elected mayor of Yonkers, New York. It is said that, throughout his life, Andrus rode the subway to work every day, even during his time as mayor. In 1904, he was elected as a representative of New York's 19th congressional district. A Republican, he entered the 59th United States Congress and continued to serving from March 4, 1905 to March 3, 1913. In 1912, he was not a candidate for re-nomination, and, despite his age, continued his former business activities. He also maintained his interest in Wesleyan trusteeship and general philanthropy.</p>

<p>In 1917, Andrus founded the Surdna Foundation with the goal of general philanthropy. (Surdna is the name "Andrus" backwards.) In 1923, Andrus expanded Surdna's operations to include the maintenance of an orphanage in honor of his late wife, Julia Dyckman Andrus. Julia herself had been orphaned in her youth, and Andrus established the orphanage, the Julia Dyckman Andrus Memorial, on the grounds of her adoptive family's farm in Westchester County New York. In 1953, an adjacent retirement home—the John E. Andrus Memorial—was completed by the Surdna Foundation. The Memorial is "now a multi-program mental health, social service, and special education provider for vulnerable children and families," according to an educational video by the Surdna Foundation.</p>

<p>Andrus was also a lay leader of the Methodist Church throughout much of his life.</p>

<p>A member of the Wesleyan Board of Trustees from 1889 through 1932, Andrus was uncommonly dedicated to his alma mater. One of Wesleyan's most significant benefactors, Andrus is honored at Wesleyan as the namesake of Andrus Field in the center of campus, as well as the John E. Andrus Center for Public Affairs (otherwise called the Public Affairs Center or PAC). In his time as an alumnus, Andrus donated funds for the benefit of the library, the football and baseball fields, and North College. The Andrus family donated funds to the Center for Public Affairs in the mid 1900's in his memory. In 1930, Andrus also had the distinction of being named the oldest living alumnus of Wesleyan University. He retired from his position as trustee two years later, noting that his health and age made it difficult for him to travel regularly from New York to Middletown.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
The content of the John E. Andrus Papers collection spans many subjects and years. The earliest documents are found in the first folder and are from his final years at school. The folder otherwise consists of general letters written and received by Andrus throughout his life. A few are about his time at school, but most are in reference to his later occupations, including his teaching position and tenure as Mayor of Yonkers. A particularly touching letter is in response to a note of bereavement from a friend or acquaintance. Andrus's response thanks this person, and describes his deep sadness at the loss of his wife in poignant prose. Another personal letter is to his daughter, Ida, expressing his desire to help with her (unstated) illness in whatever way he can. A final letter in the collection is to then-President of McConaughy of Wesleyan, announcing his resignation from the position of trustee at Wesleyan due to his declining health. 
</p>

<p>The second folder contains a single document, a selection from an alumnus newsletter in 1930. This newsletter announces Andrus' recent distinction as oldest living alumnus, and includes a rather touching and fascinating letter from Andrus to the University community. In this letter, Andrus recounts a rather amusing story about his journey from New York to Wesleyan in the late 1850s and expresses his hopes for Wesleyan students and alumni.</p>

<p>The third folder consists of a collection of general notes and writings, including papers related to do the Union Line Railroad and the United States Treasury. There is also an unlabeled and rather unusual, poetic document that discusses what Andrus (presumably) would bequeath to seven grandchildren. Additionally, there is a long handwritten speech, presumably given to a group of Wesleyan Alumni sometime after the turn of the century.</p>

<p>The final folder includes a collection of academic essays written by Andrus, presumably in his time at school, on a range of subjects from science to religion.</p>
