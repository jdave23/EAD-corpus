</did>
<scopecontent><p>Contains correspondence between Charles and Alice before their marriage. There is also correspondence between Charles and his sister, Helen Woodard Atwater, his parents, and friends. He writes to his future wife about college life at Wesleyan University, and a "machine ride" (car ride) in 1907.  At a later period he writes about family activities and sailing. There are letters to his sister with occasional investment and banking advice, and his concern for the pending departure from the gold standard, noting in 1932 "it is anti-social to horde money at this stage."

</did>
<scopecontent><p>Contains his correspondence and papers. Charles' letters describe his work as a farm hand prior to college and during vacations, his service experience as Pharmacist's Mate, and his deepening interest in foreign policy immediately following his military service. Most of the incoming letters from family members have news of children, travel, and house; a small portion touches on his mental health and care. His sister's letters to aunts or cousins are located in this series as enclosures with their letters to Charles. More family correspondence concerning his health and care is found in Series VII in letters between his siblings Catherine Atwater Galbraith and Robert Atwater. The correspondence is arranged chronologically, the personal papers are arranged alphabetically by topic.</p></scopecontent>
