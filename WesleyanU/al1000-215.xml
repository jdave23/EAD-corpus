<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>
Joseph Wright Alsop was born on March 2, 1772, to the prominent merchant trader Richard Alsop II. He was the eighth child and second son in the family, and the only son of that generation to pursue merchant trade. His older brother, Charles Richard Alsop, became involved in local and state politics as well as the railroad business. His younger brother, John, also became involved in local politics and worked as a bookdealer and a writer for some part of his life.</p> 

<p>Joseph's father Richard came to Middletown in 1750, became an early pioneer of the West India trade, and ultimately became a wealthy and successful member of Middletown society. He also became involved in local politics and charity and was known as a liberal and benevolent man. Richard died when his son, Joseph, was only four years old. Joseph's early education consisted mostly of what could be found in his father's library and in the public school system. It is said that Joseph developed an early love for life on the sea, and worked his way up from cabin boy to captain. He did not only learn his craft on the open ocean, however. It seems apparent that he was in communication for many of his early years with his uncle, John Alsop Jr. of New York, who gave him advice as well as some financial support. Additionally, he apprenticed in his youth as a clerk with Elias Shipman, who owned a trading house in New Haven. While there, he lost a significant portion of his earnings to gambling, which had become an addiction by 1790. He seemed to rid himself of this problem and eventually returned to Middletown, forming a partnership with Timothy Southmayd in shipbuilding. Shortly thereafter, Joseph became involved with trade as well, partnering with Chauncey Whittelsey and Samuel Wetmore. Through this partnership, he captained merchant vessels to places such as Naples, Barbados, and Jamaica.</p>

<p>He married Chauncey Whittelsey's daughter Lucy on November 5, 1797, and had six children with her, Lucy Whittelsey Alsop, Charles R. Alsop, Joseph W. Alsop, Clara Pomeroy Alsop, Elizabeth W. Alsop, and Mary W. Alsop</p>

<p>Joseph Wright Alsop's second son, Joseph, joined the family business by age 15 and became a successful merchant trader and businessman like his father. Clara Pomeroy Alsop never married but became notable for her charitable work, particularly with the local Widow's Home, which provided for widowed women in their old age. The oldest son, Charles R. Alsop, developed the Alsop Pocket percussion revolver, which was manufactured in Middletown, and became involved in local and state politics. Charles also owned and renovated the house built by his grandfather Chauncey Whittelsey. The house is now known as 202 Washington Street and enjoys a reputation as an excellent example of the Gothic Revival style, elements of which Charles added in his extensive early 1840s renovation.</p>

<p>Following the death of his partner and father-in-law Chauncey Whittelsey, Joseph Wright Alsop began a new partnership with a member of the Carrington family. Around 1820, he began the company of Alsop and Chauncey with his former apprentice Henry Chauncey, who had married his eldest daughter Lucy. His son Joseph would eventually join this business. Joseph Wright Alsop's partnership with Henry Chauncey lasted until 1835, when the latter left the company to join a firm in Valpariso, Chile owned by Joseph's nephew Richard Alsop IV. A few years after Chauncey's withdrawal from the company, Joseph retired to Middletown. He died in 1844.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
This collection consists of a single document, an 1805 ship's manifest, which lists the cargo of the Brig Thetis of Hartford. The Brig Thetis was owned by Joseph W. Alsop of Middletown and David Watkinson and William Watkinson of Hartford, and captained by Alsop. According to the manifest, the cargo listed was taken aboard at St. Croix and Turks Islands on December 6, 1804 and was bound for Middletown. The manifest also suggests that the Brig Thetis itself was built in Middletown. Items listed in the manifest include rum, molasses, empty bottles, coconuts, oranges, sugar, salt and old iron. The back side of the manifest was completed on October 12, 1805, presumably upon the ship's arrival in Middletown. The surveyor George Wolcott acted as witness, signing his name and verifying the manifest as accurate.
