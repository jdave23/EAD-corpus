The Agallian Base Ball Club was the first formally organized baseball team at Wesleyan University. It was formed in the autumn of 1864 and played its first matches against other teams the following spring. Baseball had been played informally at Wesleyan back to at least 1860. Baseball letters were given (often at a considerably later date) to Wesleyan athletes in baseball beginning with the 1861-62 season. The name Agallian was given by professor of Greek James Van Benschoten as a derivation of the name Agalles, who was said to have invented the first game of ball-playing in ancient Greece (cf. College Argus, June 11, 1868).</p>
<p>The club played its first match against the Charter Oak Base Ball Club of Hartford in the spring of 1865, losing 22-12. Its first intercollegiate game, which was also Wesleyan’s first intercollegiate athletic contest, was against Yale on September 30, 1865, with Yale winning 39-13. One of club’s founders, Charles L. Bonnell, class of 1868, served as captain for his entire playing career. The first practices and home games took place on the Washington Street green in Middletown and on a nearby vacant plot of land on Washington Street. Later photos exist of games being played on the Wesleyan campus on what is now Andrus Field, which at the time was essentially an undrained swamp or wetlands. The Agallian club was not a formally sponsored university team but a club composed of members of several Wesleyan classes. A later organization, the University Base Ball Club, founded in 1869, seems to have had a more formal endorsement from the administration.</p>
<p>The Agallian B.B.C. ceased to function after 1871, when baseball began to be eclipsed by the popularity of rowing as a collegiate sport. Aside from informal contests between class teams, Wesleyan was not to have an organized baseball program again until 1888.

Joseph Wright Alsop was born on March 2, 1772, to the prominent merchant trader Richard Alsop II. He was the eighth child and second son in the family, and the only son of that generation to pursue merchant trade. His older brother, Charles Richard Alsop, became involved in local and state politics as well as the railroad business. His younger brother, John, also became involved in local politics and worked as a bookdealer and a writer for some part of his life.</p>

<p>Joseph's father Richard came to Middletown in 1750, became an early pioneer of the West India trade, and ultimately became a wealthy and successful member of Middletown society. He also became involved in local politics and charity and was known as a liberal and benevolent man. Richard died when his son, Joseph, was only four years old. Joseph's early education consisted mostly of what could be found in his father's library and in the public school system. It is said that Joseph developed an early love for life on the sea, and worked his way up from cabin boy to captain. He did not only learn his craft on the open ocean, however. It seems apparent that he was in communication for many of his early years with his uncle, John Alsop Jr. of New York, who gave him advice as well as some financial support. Additionally, he apprenticed in his youth as a clerk with Elias Shipman, who owned a trading house in New Haven. While there, he lost a significant portion of his earnings to gambling, which had become an addiction by 1790. He seemed to rid himself of this problem and eventually returned to Middletown, forming a partnership with Timothy Southmayd in shipbuilding. Shortly thereafter, Joseph became involved with trade as well, partnering with Chauncey Whittelsey and Samuel Wetmore. Through this partnership, he captained merchant vessels to places such as Naples, Barbados, and Jamaica.</p>

<p>He married Chauncey Whittelsey's daughter Lucy on November 5, 1797, and had six children with her, Lucy Whittelsey Alsop, Charles R. Alsop, Joseph W. Alsop, Clara Pomeroy Alsop, Elizabeth W. Alsop, and Mary W. Alsop</p>

<p>Joseph Wright Alsop's second son, Joseph, joined the family business by age 15 and became a successful merchant trader and businessman like his father. Clara Pomeroy Alsop never married but became notable for her charitable work, particularly with the local Widow's Home, which provided for widowed women in their old age. The oldest son, Charles R. Alsop, developed the Alsop Pocket percussion revolver, which was manufactured in Middletown, and became involved in local and state politics. Charles also owned and renovated the house built by his grandfather Chauncey Whittelsey. The house is now known as 202 Washington Street and enjoys a reputation as an excellent example of the Gothic Revival style, elements of which Charles added in his extensive early 1840s renovation.</p>

<p>Following the death of his partner and father-in-law Chauncey Whittelsey, Joseph Wright Alsop began a new partnership with a member of the Carrington family. Around 1820, he began the company of Alsop and Chauncey with his former apprentice Henry Chauncey, who had married his eldest daughter Lucy. His son Joseph would eventually join this business. Joseph Wright Alsop's partnership with Henry Chauncey lasted until 1835, when the latter left the company to join a firm in Valpariso, Chile owned by Joseph's nephew Richard Alsop IV. A few years after Chauncey's withdrawal from the company, Joseph retired to Middletown. He died in 1844.</p>

<p>Nancy Ottmann Albert received her Bachelor's Degree from Trinity College in 1988 and her Masters of Arts in Liberal Studies from Wesleyan University in 1994.</p>

<p>Albert began what would become the New England mill project in August of 1981, as a solo endeavor. Largely based on her own reading and library research, she aimed "to find and photograph every extant textile mill in southern New England." Living in western Connecticut at the time, she initially photographed Connecticut area mills, eventually moving outward to the Connecticut River Valley area as well as Rhode Island. As a child, she had lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and this connection led her to do particularly extensive work in that location.</p>

<p>Throughout the next few years, Albert expanded her project to include eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and southern Maine. In 1984 she enrolled as an IDP student at Trinity College in Hartford, majoring in American studies. The Individualized Degree Program offered by Trinity enrolls adults not of college age looking to continue their education. For her undergraduate thesis at Trinity, she wrote a study of the company town of North Grosvenordale, Connecticut. </p>

<p>For her IDP project she completed a photo exhibition of industrial landscapes in New England. She graduated from Trinity in 1988 and started work at Wesleyan's Center for the Arts the next year. At Wesleyan, she began to take classes in the Graduate Liberal Studies Program. </p>

<p>In 1991, she became interested in the photography of Eugene Atget, a French flaneur at the turn of the century who is often considered a documentary photography pioneer given his attempts to capture the architecture and urban landscape of Paris before it succumbed to modernity. That same year, she took her first trip to Paris, following it up with a summer semester in the city in 1992 as a part of her GLSP work. </p>

<p>Under the direction of architecture professor John Martin, Albert completed a thesis on Atget's photography and Paris architecture, which included an exhibition at Wesleyan's Zilkha Gallery, in 1993. The next year she received her Masters of Arts in Liberal Studies. </p>

<p>From 1993 to 2004, Albert worked with the Hartford Studies Project at Trinity under the direction of Susan Pennybacker and photographed Hartford neighborhoods extensively. Additionally, she curated several photographic exhibitions at the Hartford Public Library and Trinity College. In 1998, Albert revisited the Milltown project in order to document the changes of the past 15 years. </p>

<p>In 1999, Albert was hired by the Middletown Housing Authority to document the demolition of Long River Village, Middletown's oldest housing project. Also that year, she finished documenting the changes of milltowns and began photographing mental hospitals with Sandra Wheeler.</p>

<p>From 2000 to 2005, Albert worked on both solo and group exhibitions and explored roadside and vernacular architecture. In 2001, she traveled to Havana, Cuba, where she photographed street life. The next year, she started work as a photo editor for the Hog River Journal, which she continued until 2005, when she was hired by Wesleyan to document the buildings at Long Lane School prior to demolition. </p>

<p>
In 2006, Albert moved out of New England to Charlotte, North Carolina, where she began an ongoing exploration of North Carolina historic and vernacular architecture.
</p>

<p>In addition to the subjects described above, Albert's work includes images taken in the New England, New York state, Portugal, Spain, London, Italy, Eastern Europe, Vienna, Barcelona, Bosnia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Berlin.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Middletown Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi has served as a literary society to Wesleyan University students since its founding on July 31, 1856. At the 1856 Alpha Delta Phi convention in New Haven, Connecticut, two Wesleyan debating societies known as the Betrian Society and the Lebanian Society petitioned the International organization of Alpha Delta Phi for inclusion in the nationwide fraternity. It was decided to merge the two societies and a charter was granted to form the Middletown Chapter as the 18th chapter of the International. The two societies already had common ground with dining at the Chronometer Club and so merging the two worked with ease.</p>

<p>The new chapter moved quickly to renting halls in downtown Middletown for its meetings. In 1884, after the establishment and success of the Building Fund, the chapter erected its first house located on the former Neale property on the corner of High and Cross Streets. In this house, the chapter rented out rooms, held meetings and other events, and dined in its eating club The Star &amp; Crescent Club for almost 20 years until numerous costly repairs necessitated the chapter to tear down the structure. Immediately, plans were drawn up for a larger house located on the same property. The second Middletown Chapter house was completed in 1905 and still houses ADP members and hosts meetings, reunions, weddings, and other Wesleyan or ADP related events.</p>

<p>In 1881 a group of Alpha Delta Phi alumni founded the Adelphic Literary Society (ALS) to support the intellectual and moral improvement of its members by developing ties among the undergraduate and post graduate members of the chapter. With the incorporation of the ALS chartered by the Legislature of the State of Connecticut, the ALS could legally own, maintain and transfer property for the Middletown Chapter, which it successfully did to allow the building of the chapter houses for undergraduate members. The ALS is also responsible for the chapter's eating club, the Star &amp; Crescent, and it connects with its undergraduate members through alumni events on and off campus and serving as mentors.</p>

<p>As a way to sponsor intellectual growth of chapter members through public and educational activities at Wesleyan University, the Adelphic Educational Fund, Inc. (AEF) was established on December 14, 1944, and has since continued the support of intellectual and social life at Wesleyan. The tax-exempt AEF was founded by alumni led by George W. Davison, 1892, and Albert W. Johnston, 1893, to aid deserving undergraduates in the attainment of a college education at Wesleyan, with a preference for members of the Middletown Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi. In addition to educational funding made available to students through the grant-in-aid program, the AEF also funds the Middletown Chapter's literary publication <title render="italic">AdLit</title>, literary events such as the Assembly Series, a Faculty Fellows program, and a community service program. It also funded educational programs which are now defunct, such as the Film Series and a Science Series.</p>

<p>Since its formation in 1856, the Middletown Chapter dealt with local and national issues. Undergraduate members lived years through wars, financial depressions, political unrest and fraternity tensions. During these times, the members came together to support one another and strived to come out on top. In the 1960s and 1970s when co-education was making waves across American universities and colleges, the Middletown Chapter began welcoming women members from Wesleyan's re-imagined co-ed student body, resulting in what is known among ADP members and alumni as the Co-Education Issue. While the International held firm against any of its chapters going co-ed, the undergraduate members of the Middletown Chapter endorsed the inclusion of women members. From 1972 until 1992, there was a constant debate to acknowledge women into the International, a struggle that ended in a split. On August 7, 1992 at the 160th Alpha Delta Phi Convention in Brainerd, Minnesota, a contract was approved by a 41-0 vote acknowledging the withdrawal of four chapters that wished to become co-educational chapters. These four co-educational chapters, Brunonian, Columbia, Middletown and Stanford, made up the newly formed Alpha Delta Phi Society. Other chapters would later leave the national fraternity and join the Society.</p>

<p>In 2006, the Middletown Chapter celebrated its sesquicentennial where they hosted a reunion, conducted oral history interviews, and published a history on the chapter's meeting and living areas titled <title render="doublequote">Halls, Houses &amp; Eating Clubs</title>.</p>

<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP)
worked to unionize college and university faculty and professional librarians, and
to coach them in collective bargaining with administrations. A group calling itself
the Faculty Caucus voted to become a chapter of the AAUP in October 1974,
reactivating what was then a dormant chapter. The reconstituted Wesleyan chapter
adopted its constitution on October 9, 1974, with Victor Gourevitch as its president
pro tem. Over the following two decades, the chapter took part in negotiations with
the administration, including University President Colin Campbell. Beginning in
1977, Nathanael Greene, Vice President for Academic Affairs, would serve as
Campbell’s liaison to the AAUP. AAUP activities at Wesleyan also included collecting
information on faculty compensation at various colleges and universities and
attempting to gather student body and alumni support for their bargaining efforts.
Membership was voluntary, and the group never represented more than a bare majority
of the faculty. The activities of the group appear to have dropped off around
1990.</p>

<p>In 1976, a construction permit was issued for nuclear reactors on the marshes of Seabrook, New Hampshire, near a heavily populated beach community. On April 30, 1977, the Clamshell Alliance organized a protest on the grounds of these marshes calling for the state of New Hampshire and New England as a whole to be a nuclear-free zone. The 1977 Nuclear Resistance Group on Wesleyan's campus was involved in the April 30 protest. On that day, nearly 2,000 people walked onto the construction site to protest having a nuclear presence in New England. Of those 2,000 people, over 1,400 were arrested and 39 Wesleyan students were among them. In June 1977, the Clamshell Alliance held another on-site rally consisting of 20,000 participants of which several hundred also marched to Washington D.C. to protest in front of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>

<p>Students at Wesleyan who were arrested on April 30 were charged with criminal trespass in the Portsmouth Court and called for <emph render="doublequote">bail solidarity,</emph> therefore refusing to post bail until they were all released on personal recognizance. They were held for ten or eleven days, during which Wesleyan's Legal Defense and Bail Fund Board organized a fundraising drive for their release. As of May 11, thirty-two Wesleyan students were still held in state armories apparently under severe conditions; some of those arrested spent 14 hours on a cramped bus before any official arrest and some were held in a room with 691 other people.</p>

<p>Although Wesleyan organized a fundraiser for bail, the imprisoned students felt that it would be counterproductive. One student dictated a letter via telephone asking that the Wesleyan community help in writing letters, making phone calls and protesting the Connecticut governor if he were to accept any of the Seabrook prisoners into Connecticut jails. Some of the arrested students posted bail, and on May 13, the remaining prisoners accepted guilty pleas and were released on their own recognizance.</p>

<p>The Nuclear Resistance Group on Wesleyan's campus continued to stay active in the anti-nuclear front. In 1979, the group participated in another nationally recognized anti-nuclear rally in Buchanan, New York. Over two hundred protesters were arrested, Wesleyan students among them. In the early 1980s, protests were held on campus calling for a nuclear freeze. </p>

<p>The anti-nuclear arms groups also proposed and got approved Wesleyan as a nuclear-free zone. This was achieved in 1984 and consisted of an agreement with Wesleyan students and Wesleyan administration that the school would not participate in the production, testing, deployment, storage, or transportation of nuclear weapons. The school also agreed not to participate in research or investment associated with the development of nuclear weapons. Although this referendum was well-received by the Wesleyan community, the Board of Trustees had the final vote on the implementation of this agreement. Many believed this to be a symbolic gesture of the Wesleyan community during the Cold War, although the agreement was practical in the sense of Wesleyan refraining from investments and research related to nuclear arms. Although Wesleyan still had investments in companies that had some varied involvement in nuclear arms production or research, the campus decided to become a nuclear-free zone like many zoned areas in Europe.</p>

Born in 1841 in Pleasantville, New York to a Methodist minister father, Andrus graduated from Wesleyan University in 1862. After teaching school in New Jersey for four years, he switched to a career in business and investing. He was primarily involved in the Arlington Chemical Company, which manufactured and distributed medicines typical of that time, including peptonoids, meant to help with stomach discomfort. He also invested in railroads, utilities, real estate, mining, and the Standard Oil Company. He also served as director of the New York Life Insurance Company, President of the New York Pharmaceutical Association, and President of the Palisade Manufacturing Corporation of Yonkers, Westchester County. He was said, however, to be particularly adept at locating and securing undervalued assets, particularly land. His business acumen ultimately earned him millions of dollars, securing his place as a member of the East Coast elite and allowing him to pursue other interests, including politics and philanthropy.</p>

<p>In 1903, already in his 60s, Andrus was elected mayor of Yonkers, New York. It is said that, throughout his life, Andrus rode the subway to work every day, even during his time as mayor. In 1904, he was elected as a representative of New York's 19th congressional district. A Republican, he entered the 59th United States Congress and continued to serving from March 4, 1905 to March 3, 1913. In 1912, he was not a candidate for re-nomination, and, despite his age, continued his former business activities. He also maintained his interest in Wesleyan trusteeship and general philanthropy.</p>

<p>In 1917, Andrus founded the Surdna Foundation with the goal of general philanthropy. (Surdna is the name "Andrus" backwards.) In 1923, Andrus expanded Surdna's operations to include the maintenance of an orphanage in honor of his late wife, Julia Dyckman Andrus. Julia herself had been orphaned in her youth, and Andrus established the orphanage, the Julia Dyckman Andrus Memorial, on the grounds of her adoptive family's farm in Westchester County New York. In 1953, an adjacent retirement home—the John E. Andrus Memorial—was completed by the Surdna Foundation. The Memorial is "now a multi-program mental health, social service, and special education provider for vulnerable children and families," according to an educational video by the Surdna Foundation.</p>

<p>Andrus was also a lay leader of the Methodist Church throughout much of his life.</p>

<p>A member of the Wesleyan Board of Trustees from 1889 through 1932, Andrus was uncommonly dedicated to his alma mater. One of Wesleyan's most significant benefactors, Andrus is honored at Wesleyan as the namesake of Andrus Field in the center of campus, as well as the John E. Andrus Center for Public Affairs (otherwise called the Public Affairs Center or PAC). In his time as an alumnus, Andrus donated funds for the benefit of the library, the football and baseball fields, and North College. The Andrus family donated funds to the Center for Public Affairs in the mid 1900's in his memory. In 1930, Andrus also had the distinction of being named the oldest living alumnus of Wesleyan University. He retired from his position as trustee two years later, noting that his health and age made it difficult for him to travel regularly from New York to Middletown.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1981, the University formed the Budget Advisory Committee (BAC) which was made up of 4 students, 4 faculty, and 3 administrators. The BAC studied alternative ways to modify the aid-blind policy. In January 1982, the committee recommended the termination of the aid-blind admissions policy. Aid-blind meant that the admissions decisions were made without regard to the students' ability to pay. Need-blind, Wesleyan University's policy as of 2008, is a system which means that once admitted, a student receives all the financial aid needed to attend Wesleyan. (The third option is budget blind which means that there is no limit to financial aid expenditures.) Wesleyan's former policy was a <emph render="doublequote">pure</emph> aid-blind policy because it was also need-blind and budget blind. In 1981, Wesleyan tuition was $11,450 annually. </p>

<p>Students immediately began to protest the change to aid-blind admissions, and the administration blamed the Reagan administration's higher education cuts. Six hundred Wesleyan students attended a rally in Washington D.C. and were recognized as the largest single group in attendance. On April 29, two hundred students rallied in front of the North College building to protest the aid-blind cuts. The April 29th Coalition, a new student group, presented President Colin Campbell with a petition signed by 1,284 students. They also collected signatures from professors, workers at Downey House (the campus center and dining hall at the time), and from Linus Pauling (two time Noble Laureate). Their demands entailed that Wesleyan return to an aid-blind system, that a student/faculty committee be formed whose primary focus was to study fiscally responsible ways of financing aid-blind admissions (with access to all information requested), that student trustees be granted full voting rights, and finally that President Campbell and the Board of Trustees voice the University's opposition to the federal higher education cuts. President Campbell responded that he would urge the reinstatement of the policy if and when it would be economically feasible. The university could not immediately reinstate the old policy because it <emph render="doublequote">would pose a threat to the range and quality of the educational program.</emph></p>

<p>The students responded by planning a 150 hour sit-in on the second floor of North College, one hour for each year that the university had existed. On May 12, nineteen students moved into North College. In addition to the sit-in there were 150 second <emph render="doublequote">Die-ins</emph> on the steps of North College. Students would play dead in order to <emph render="doublequote">Resurrect aid-blind.</emph> It was very important to the students that the drama of the protests would not take attention away from their aid-blind message. </p>

<p>Although their primary demand for reestablishing the aid-blind system was not met by the end of the semester, President Campbell wrote a statement that the students' demands would be addressed at the next the Board of Trustees meeting and that reinstituting the former policy would be given the highest priority if and when circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>It seems that the University transitioned into a need-blind policy after this dispute, in which students would be accepted and would receive financial aid based on their need, but that their need was taken into consideration when accepted to the school. It is unclear when this policy was implemented and how long it lasted. In the 1991-92 school year, the university denied need-blind financial aid to students who were on the waiting list. Again students rallied and held (a shorter) sit-in at North College. Although the definitions of terminology varies, and different publications describe Wesleyan as either need-blind or aid-blind, the university still claims to have had a long history with giving aid-blind support to its students. </p>

The period which these documents cover was a particularly tense one for the University and the Asian American Students Coalition, which seemed to take on a somewhat representative role for many dissatisfied students of all ethnicities at this time.
</p>
<p>In January 2002, the Freeman Foundation gifted $1.9 million to the University over four years to fund visiting professors at the University who specialized in Asian American studies. According to a May 2008 Argus article, this grant was in an effort to gauge interest in Asian American studies at Wesleyan. It is unclear the extent to which students were interested in this focus of study; a Wespeak included in this collection suggests that there was chronic under-enrollment in the courses, but the May 2008 <title render="italic">Argus</title> article suggests that enrollment was high.</p>
<p> Things came to a head, however, in the spring of 2007. Not only did the initiative expire, but the Board of Trustees also denied Professor Allan Isaac of the English Department—then the only professor with a requirement to teach Asian American Studies in his job description—tenure. Isaac had the support of the English Department in his tenure application, and it reportedly came as a shock to many when he was rejected. Students organized protests about the Professor Isaac tenure denial, highlighting broader issues of cultural inclusion and knowledge in academia and the Wesleyan community at large. </p>
<p> The protests included a variety of methods; students held at least one rally in support of Isaac, and engaged in several paper campaigns. Hundreds of students signed a petition, many handed out pamphlets, and a series of personal letters were sent to the new President Michael Roth to express support for Issac's tenure. The protestors utilized a canary symbol in their materials, referencing the idea of a "canary in the coalmine." According to the protestors, just as the death of a canary can signal a gas leak in a coalmine, the denial of Professor Isaac's tenure pointed to a dangerous cultural heterogeneity in Wesleyan's academic life.</p>
<p> In an unusual move, the Board of Trustees tenured Professor Isaacs in the spring of 2008; professors generally do not get appeals for tenure. This did not entirely appease activists, however. Calls for an Asian American Studies Department continued, and students remained disappointed by the University's failure to make institutionalized change in the study of Asian American issues at Wesleyan.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan Athletic Council was formed by trustee authorization in 1903 to formally oversee the administration of athletics at Wesleyan. It was composed of three faculty members, three alumni members, and three students. The Council regulated most aspects of athletics including the administering of budgets, negotiations with other schools for intercollegiate matches and scheduling, player eligibility rules, hiring and supervising coaches, establishing records, and the awarding of varsity letters. The Wesleyan Alumni Athletic Association (founded in 1904) elected the three alumni members and worked with the Athletic Council, especially with fundraising, which was primarily directed toward coaches’ salaries. Prior to the Athletic Council’s formation, athletics at Wesleyan were overseen beginning in 1891 by a joint athletic committee composed of members of the student athletic associations (i.e., the teams) and student-elected alumni.</p>

<p>In 1923, the Board of Trustees approved a faculty proposal to move primary control of intercollegiate athletics to the faculty. The department of Physical Education, which had existed since 1910, was now responsible for most of the administrative functions of Wesleyan athletics. The Athletic Council retained control over regulation of eligibility rules, approval of team captains and managers, establishing records, and the awarding of letters to Wesleyan athletes.</p>

<p>Wilbur O. Atwater (May 3, 1844-Sept. 22, 1907) was born the son of Minister William Atwater and Eliza Barnes Atwater in the small town of Johnsburg, New York. After growing up in Vermont and spending his first two years of college at the University of Vermont, he transferred to Wesleyan University and received his BA in 1865. He went on to receive his M.A. (1868) and Ph.D. (1869) from Yale University, studying agricultural chemistry; he later obtained his LL. D. from the University of Vermont (1904). A world-renowned chemist, particularly in agricultural chemistry, he is best known for his role in the development of the Calorimeter, which enabled the calculation of caloric content in food items. In 1874 he married Marcia Woodard; they had two children, Helen Woodard and Charles Woodard. He became a Professor at Wesleyan University in 1873 and he remained at the post until his death in 1907.</p>

<p>Helen Woodard Atwater (May 29, 1876-1947) was born in Somerville, Massachusetts to Wilbur Olin Atwater and Marcia Woodard Atwater. She received her B.A. from Smith College, a graduate of the class of 1897. She then became an editorial assistant to her father, which entailed preparing his material for publications. The experience provided her with an expansive knowledge of issues of nutrition as well as the opportunity to publish some of her own popular work on the subject. In 1909 she went on to spend the next fourteen years working as a scientific consultant for the Office of Home Economics in the United State Department of Agriculture; she wrote and edited bulletins relating to food, nutrition and other issues of home economics. During World War I she was placed on the Women's Committee of the Council of National Defense as the Executive Chairman of Food Production and Home Economics. When she left the Department in 1923, she joined the American Home Economics Association in Washington, D.C., becoming the first full-time editor of their official publication, The Journal of Home Economics.

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Douglas Joseph Bennet Jr. was born in Orange, New Jersey, on June 23, 1938, to
Douglas Joseph Bennet Sr. and Phoebe Benedict Bennet. The family settled in Lyme,
Connecticut. Bennet Sr. (Wesleyan class of 1933) was a businessman, and he also
engaged in civic service. He was active in the Connecticut Democratic party and
worked as executive secretary for Chester Bowles, then-governor of Connecticut, from
1949 to 1951. Phoebe Bennet was a graduate of Mt. Holyoke College and the New York
School of Social Work. She was on the board of trustees for the Mansfield Training
School and helped to establish the Office of Mental Retardation in the Connecticut
State Department of Health. She was also on the board of the League of Women Voters
in Lyme and the Lyme Board of Education. Bennet, Jr. was the oldest of five
children. He graduated from Lyme High School in June 1955.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1955, Douglas Bennet, Jr. entered Wesleyan University as a freshman,
class of 1959. During his four undergraduate years he showed a developing interest
in history, government and the Russian language. He was co-president of the
fraternity Alpha Chi Rho and was active in the Wesleyan chapter's decision to
withdraw from the national organization as a result of racial and religious
intolerance on the part of the parent organization. Although he would later
self-deprecatingly describe this exercise by saying, "This operation involved a
great deal of organizing and correspondence, and was one of the most inconsequential
exercises imaginable," it was emblematic of his strongly developed social
conscience. Bennet went on to receive his M.A. in history from the University of
California, Berkeley in 1960 and then moved to Cambridge, MA, to begin work on his
Ph.D. at Harvard.</p>

<p>Bennet's dissertation, <title render="italic">The Idea of Kingship in 17th Century
Russia,</title> was competed in 1967. In the intervening years he had his first
taste of international government work. Family friend and mentor Chester Bowles, who
was then Ambassador to India, offered Bennet a position as his administrative
assistant in New Delhi, India, in 1963. Bowles had been a member of the U.S. House
of Representatives from Connecticut's second district from 1959 to 1961 and his
vision and civic engagement were models for Bennet. Although Bennet had been
thinking of going to Russia, he went instead to India, and spent two and a half
years there. During that time he traveled extensively and wrote many speeches for
Bowles and other administrators. He returned to Cambridge in January 1966 and
finished his dissertation the following year.</p>

<p>With his experience as a speech writer, Bennet was able to land a job in Washington
as speech writer for Vice President Hubert Humphrey. This was the beginning of
almost 30 years in Washington, although his occupation was to change many times.
Being a speech writer for Humphrey quickly swept Bennet into the heady and intense
world of politics, especially when Humphrey ran for president in 1968. When Humphrey
lost the election to Nixon, Bennet joined the staff of Thomas F. Eagleton, a senator
from Missouri, in January 1969.</p>

<p>He worked for Eagleton as administrative assistant for the next four years. Bennet
was active in the 1972 presidential election, in which Eagleton was a candidate for
vice president, and helped to craft the Democratic platform that year. The
controversy that broke in July regarding Eagleton's mental health gave Bennet
on-the-ground training in crisis management. In April 1973, Bennet joined the staff
of Abraham Ribicoff, the senator from his home state of Connecticut, again as
administrative assistant. This was a short lived assignment as Bennet decided to
make a run for the House of Representatives in 1974. His father, Bennet, Sr. ran for
the same position in 1956. Bennet, Jr. did not win the primary and ceded the
Democratic House nomination to Christopher Dodd.</p>

<p>In September 1974 Senator Edmund Muskie tapped him to be the first staff director of
the newly formed Senate Budget Committee. Bennet held this post for the next two and
a half years and it was his last in the legislative branch of government.</p>

<p>In 1977 Bennet reconnected with his 1960s roots in the State Department by becoming
the Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations. His two and a half
years in this position gave him exposure to current foreign policy thinking. He
traveled to Africa and China and was credited by President Carter for being
instrumental in the signing of the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977. In July 1979
Carter nominated him to be administrator for the Agency for International
Development (AID). Bennet held this post for the next year and a half until the 1980
election and the change of administration in January 1981. During his tenure at AID
he traveled intensively, both nationally and internationally.</p>

<p>In January 1981 Bennet decided to spend much of that year at a slower pace, exploring
his options and reconsidering his involvement with government. In December 1981 he
accepted an offer by Chicago businessman, Richard J. Dennis, to be president of the
Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, a think tank started and bankrolled by
Dennis. The mission of this organization was to act as a "bridge between the public
and policymakers. By increasing the public's store of unbiased information, by
opening up our national debate to fresh thinking about long-term solutions, and by
working directly with policy-makers, the Center aims to help Americans and their
leaders make constructive and farsighted policy choices." As president, Bennet was
well positioned to make the best use of his extensive administrative and foreign
policy experience. He worked hard for the next year and a half to further the
Center's mission and was blindsided by Dennis's decision in June of 1983 to remove
him as president. Bennet resigned at the end of June and spent the summer
investigating the possibility of creating his own think tank, but lack of funding
prevented it. In December 1983 it was announced that he would be the next president
of National Public Radio.</p>

<p>National Public Radio was having its own problems in the early 1980s, having nearly
declared bankruptcy just before Bennet became president. Fresh from his
disappointment at the Roosevelt Center and bringing his impressive administrative
skills to bear, he quickly turned NPR around, injecting solvency and a new sense of
energy. Bennet took up the banner of freedom of speech and the first amendment as
enthusiastically as he had foreign policy.</p>

<p>The pull of the State Department was still strong, however. After a break with
government and 10 successful years at NPR, Bennet was ready to re-engage with global
issues as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs in
1993. For the next two years he worked closely with the United Nations working to
improve the standard of living worldwide as he had, off and on, for thirty
years.</p>

<p>Bennet had always retained a strong affection for Wesleyan University, his alma
mater. He had been on its board of trustees for three years, from 1972 to 1975. His
father was an alumnus and two of his children were alumni. So, in 1995 when he was
asked to serve as Wesleyan's president, he accepted. He was president for 12 years,
from 1995 to 2007, at which time he retired from public service.</p>

Dr. Victor Lloyd Butterfield (1904-1975) served as Wesleyan University's eleventh president from 1943-1967, the longest-serving president in Wesleyan's history. Butterfield was born on February 7, 1904, in Kingston, Rhode Island, to Kenyon L. Butterfield and Harriet Millard. He married Katharina Geyer on June 11, 1928 and they had two children, Margot and Daniel.
</p>
<p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) was founded at Wesleyan University in 1959 and existed until 1969. Wesleyan appears to be the first liberal arts college to create such a center. The CAS invited fellows to reside at Wesleyan and participate in the intellectual life of the campus. Each year, the fellows were a diverse group of academics, scientists, social scientists, writers, artists, and other intellectuals.</p>

<p>In a memo to the faculty announcing the creation of the center, President Victor Butterfield wrote: <emph render="doublequote">We feel that institutions of Wesleyan's type, if they can find the resources, should on principle support vigorously the creative work of some of our very ablest people in the liberating disciplines. We feel particularly that such people should be drawn not only from abroad as well as from home, but from the so-called 'active' as well as scholarly professions. One of our concerns and one of the nation's persisting and serious problems is the cultural gap in our society between the intellectual and the man of affairs. We feel that each of these types has much to learn from the other, that they should come together more often in serious discourse, and that the liberal institution should support the study and writing of our ablest journalists, justices, ministers, industrialists and the like, as well as of professional scholars and creative artists.</emph></p>

<p> The Center for Advanced Studies building was housed in Olin library until fall 1960 when it moved into a new building behind the Russell House on Pearl Street (the same building where the Center for the Humanities was later located). Fellows stayed for a full school year, a semester, or a period of weeks, depending on scheduling. During their residence at Wesleyan, fellows were encouraged to research and write but also to work with undergraduate students within Wesleyan departments. They often gave lectures and seminars about their specialties, or even offered courses. The fellows were provided with residences for themselves and their families and given a stipend. Most fellows were men, but several women were also invited, including Hannah Arendt and Jean Stafford.</p>

<p>Sigmund Neumann served as director of CAS from 1959-1962, Paul Horgan from 1962 until 1967, and Phillip Hallie as acting director from 1967-1969. Suggestions for fellows were accepted from all members of the Wesleyan community. Fellows were selected by a panel consisting of the president of the university, the director of CAS, and a trustee. Their decisions were presented to the faculty for approval. Monday evening dinners provided opportunities for fellows and faculty to mingle throughout the year. Wednesday afternoon open houses were sponsored by CAS to bring fellows and students together. Among the fellows to reside at CAS were Hannah Arendt, John Cage, Daniel P. Moynihan, Leslie Munro, and Richard Wilbur.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1968, the fellows were chosen for their similarity of interests in order to allow them to collaborate and to connect with the Wesleyan community in greater depth. At the end of 1968, plans were made to convert the Center for Advanced Studies into a Center for the Humanities. This change was partially the result of the Study for Educational Policies and Programs (SEPP) conducted in early 1968. The major changes included a selection process administered by a board that included faculty, students, and administrators; required teaching responsibilities; and the selection of a broad issue in which the scholars would focus their research. These changes, and the new name, took effect in fall 1969.</p>

<p>During early October 1931, Wesleyan University celebrated its centennial. The event
brought together current students, faculty, alumni, parents, and honored guests
including the Canadian Prime Minister, Richard Bedford Bennett. The events included
a musical comedy, entitled <title render="doublequote">The Girl and the
Graduate,</title> written by alumnus William B. Davis and originally performed in 1908. The
events also consisted of banquets, concerts, recitals, lectures, and sporting
events. For example, Wesleyan’s football team squared off against Columbia
University, falling 0-37. The events of the centennial produced varied ephemera,
including badges for alumni and event staff, pamphlets, schedules, menus and
souvenirs. The event also produced many photographs and coverage in newspapers such
as the <title render="italic">Hartford Courant</title> and campus publications such
as <title render="italic">The Wesleyan University Alumnus</title> and <title render="italic">The Wesleyan Argus</title>.</p>

<p>Wesleyan University's Memorial Chapel was built and dedicated in 1871. It was intended to commemorate those Wesleyan students and alumni who fought in the Civil War, and later additions of stained glass windows acknowledge student service in other wars. The Memorial Chapel has been the main site of religious ceremonies at Wesleyan since 1871. The services were primarily Methodist.

<p>
Sidera Chase was born on October 31, 1818, in Hoosick, New York. He graduated from Wesleyan in 1842. While at Wesleyan Chase was a member of the fraternities: Delta Kappa Epsilon and Phi Beta Kappa. Chase was also a founding member of the Mystical Seven at Wesleyan. Chase was a teacher at Preparatory School in Middletown of which he later became assistant principal (1840-1842). Chase later became principal of the Female Institute in Middletown (1848-1854) and later the Newark Wesleyan University in New Jersey. He subsequently left the educational field due to poor health. Chase had a stint in manufacturing from 1854 until 1861, which was interrupted due to the Civil War, and continued again from 1866 to 1869. Chase later was the U.S. Deputy Collector in New York's First District from 1869 until 1873. Chase again switched careers when he began work on the editorial staff of the New York Tribune (1873-1887). Following his working career, Chase engaged in study and writing until his death on September 21, 1897 in Nordhoff, New Jersey. Chase was the brother of the first Wesleyan graduate, Daniel Henry Chase. Chase was married to Sarah Johnson of Middletown. They had four children: Frances Elizabeth (born 1842), Julia Fisher (born 1848), Jennie Burton (born 1854), and Nellie Low (born 1857).

<event>CONNECTICUT STATE ASSEMBLY. Citron was nominated by the Democratic
Party as its candidate to the State House of Representatives in 1924,
1926 and 1930. He was elected on the second and third occasions and thus
was a member of the Assembly during the 1927-1928 and 1931-1932
sessions, serving as minority leader during both sessions. [On
Connecticut political life during these years and later, see Duane
Lockard, <title render="italic">New England State Politics</title>
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959), pp. 228-304.] </event>
<event>RECORD IN STATE LEGISLATURE: FIRST TERM. During his first term,
Citron was one of 25 Democrats among 237 Republicans in the Republican
administration of Governor John H. Trumbull. A member of the Committees
on Military Affairs, Rules, and the Sale of Lands, he introduced one
resolution and 18 bills, including ones to require proof of financial
responsibility of owners of motor vehicles in case of an accident (HE
70), to increase benefits for dependent children under the Workmen's
Compensation Act (HE 202). to exempt voters in state elections from
payment of a personal tax for the year (HB 660), and to require approval
of all rate increases by public service corporations (HE 712). All of
these were rejected owing in part to the Appropriations Committee's
"rate of slaughter" for proposed bills. Apparently, their war cry was
"Cut, cut, cut for Connecticut!" (<title render="italic">Middletown
Press</title>, March 12, 1927, p. 1), for it was felt "the 1927
session of the state legislature probably [would] create a new record
for minimum number of laws placed on the statute books... " (<title render="italic">Middletown Press</title>, April 9, 1927, p. 1). </event>

<event>RECORD IN STATE LEGISLATURE: SECOND TERM. As a result of the 1930
election, Citron became one of the 85 Democrats among only 182
Republicans in the Democratic administration of Governor Wilbur L.
Cross. He served again on the Rules and Military Affairs Committees, and
also was a member of the Committee on Forfeited Rights. He introduced 7
bills, 6 resolutions, and one petition. He called for the repeal of
Prohibition (HJR 111), an amendment to the State Constitution requiring
a two-thirds vote to override a Governor's veto (HR 25), and creation of
a city planning commission in Middletown (HB 362). </event>

<event>U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Citron was a Democratic candidate for
Congress in 1928, 1932, 1934, 1936, 1938 and 1952. He was elected as an
at-large candidate in 1934 and 1936 and served in Congress from January
3, 1935 to January 3, 1939. A member of the Judiciary Committee, Citron
was decidedly a Roosevelt or New Deal Democrat who initiated and
supported measures to regulate business, to control utilities, and to
regulate the Connecticut River. Among the measures he supported were the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation Extension Act, the National
Industrial Recovery Extension Act, the Work Relief and Public Works
Appropriation Act of 1938, and the Social Security Act. He also voted
for the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938. </event>
<event>RECORD IN CONGRESS: FIRST TERM. During his first term in 1935-1936,
Congressman Citron introduced a total of 19 bills and resolutions,
including ones to grant pensions to Spanish-American War veterans (HR

(HR-672l), to authorize the President to loan $25 million for flood
relief (HR 12131), to deny government contracts over $2,000 to any firms
employing convicts or persons under 16 (HR 12582), to amend the U.S.

remarks printed in the <title render="italic">Congressional Record</title>,
pointing out that the Nazi government of Germany was simply exploiting this
event to claim honor in the family of nations and that Nazi racist practices
would be given tacit approval if the United States fielded a team. Citron's

the CVA proposal in favor of the interstate compact method of developing
water resources. On February 16, 1937 he reintroduced a CVA bill (HR 4811)

<emph render="underline">The Connecticut River--William M. Citron's
Contribution</emph>
</p>
<p>CONNECTICUT RIVER: A natural resource of immense significance to the region, subject
to spring flooding, the Connecticut River held an abiding fascination for William
Citron. He grew up on its banks in Middletown and formed an early attachment to the
river and an interest in its regulation for the public good. The Connecticut River
flows from the Canadian border in New Hampshire 410 miles through Vermont,
Massachusetts, and Connecticut to Long Island Sound, dropping 2200 feet from its
upper reaches to the ocean. The development of water power led to the
industrialization of such cities as Holyoke and Springfield, Massachusetts. The
Connecticut's navigability to Hartford made that city and Middletown important
seaports from colonial times, with the quarries in Portland, across from Middletown,
producing the brownstone for the famous apartment buildings of New York's post-Civil
War years. [See Evan Hill, <title render="italic">The Connecticut River</title>,
with photographs by William F. Stekl, introduction by Roger Tory Peterson, and
foreword by Abraham Ribicoff. (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press,
1972.)]</p>
<p>SOURCES OF POLITICAL CONFLICT IN THE CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY: Private development of
power on the Connecticut River was the rule. Federal action in the movement for the
regulation of utilities or the direct development of public power was resisted under
the cloak of <emph render="doublequote">states rights.</emph> The issue of flood
control was also important in the political life of these states, especially
Connecticut, and individual political figures like Citron were drawn into unending
disputes about numerous imponderables. One careful student of the subject concluded
that <emph render="doublequote">the disputes, as they took shape, reflected the
political configurations and moral attitudes of the major contesting interest
groups in the era of Franklin Roosevelt. The question of federal-state conflict
in the Connecticut Valley is a microcosm of the political struggles of the
period. [Leuchtenburg, <title render="italic">Flood Control Politics</title>, p.
1]</emph></p>
<p>NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY. Politics may not explain the time
of acts of God but natural disasters do have political consequences. Three such
devastations visited the Connecticut Valley between 1927 and 1938, years coinciding
with Citron's emerging prominence, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The New England flood of November 1927 resulted from a collision of a cold,
western stormbank with moist southern winds. Torrential rain fell over all of
Vermont, and western Massachusetts and Connecticut, November 2-4, followed by
near-zero temperatures the following week. The resulting flood left thousands
homeless, took hundreds of lives, destroyed numerous bridges, and aroused great
citizen interest in flood control needs. <emph render="doublequote">In much of the
Connecticut Valley, the floodwaters reached their greatest height in three
centuries. The November 1927 flood was incomparably more destructive than any
previous flood in the history of New England.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 29.] The
chief response to the 1927 disaster was to ignore interstate action and to urge that
private power companies develop a system of storage reservoirs for peaks on the
river. The years passed with insufficient action to achieve a bare minimum of flood
protection. But as Leuchtenburg points out, a flood of the magnitude of 1927 was not
to be expected for another century.</p>
<p>(2) The Connecticut River Valley was flooded even more severely than 1927 between
March 12 and 26, 1936. Industrial life came to a stand-still. By March 22 Hartford
was in a virtual state of siege. [Leuchtenburg, p. 47] There was devastation from
northern Vermont to Long Island Sound. <emph render="doublequote">The flood was a
major disaster for the Connecticut Valley, by far the worst in memory . . . It
cost at least sixty million dollars at a time when the valley was only slowly
recovering from the great depression. The New England floods took twenty-four
lives and left 77,000 homeless.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 48.] Previously buried,
Citron's August 1935 proposal, H.J. Res. 377, to enable the drafting of interstate
compacts, was revived in April 1936. </p>
<p>(3) On September 21, 1938, following four days of rain, a tropical hurricane of major
dimensions struck New England and left devastation that clearly surpassed that
wrought by the great floods of 1927 and 1936. The storm's center hit just west of
New Haven and passed up the Connecticut River Valley to Canada, and yet
counter-cyclonical winds of 110 miles an hour were felt in Providence and Boston.
The hurricane struck when the tides were higher than normal. The wind blew down and
damaged 250 million trees, including some 20 percent of the maple sugar trees of
Vermont. Hundreds of trees on the Wesleyan campus in Middletown were felled. Damage
to crops of all kinds was extreme, 488 lives were lost and property damage was
incalculable throughout New England. One assessment, possibly excessive but worth
bearing in mind was this: <emph render="doublequote">The property damage was the
greatest in any disaster in American History, worse than the San Francisco
earthquake or the Chicago fire.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 113.]</p>
<p>CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL COMPACT</p>
<p>Among the means explored to govern problems created by the untamed Connecticut River
was the <emph render="doublequote">interstate compact</emph> idea suggested in the
United States Constitution, Article I, section 10, providing: <emph render="doublequote">No State shall, without the consent of Congress . . . enter
into any agreement or compact with another State.</emph> After much study, Mr.
Citron on August 13, 1935, introduced a Joint Resolution to enable the six New
England States and New York, <emph render="doublequote">or any two or more of them,
to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts for conserving and regulating
the flow, lessening flood damage, making other public improvements on any rivers
or streams whose drainage basins lie within any two or more of the said
States.</emph> (H. J. Res. 377, 74th Cong., 1st sess.) The bill was referred to
the House Judiciary Committee, where it lay until April 1936. At that time debate on
the so-called Copeland bill, designed to require local contributions for federal
flood control efforts, led Congressmen to look at other alternatives, including
Citron's bill. Hearings were held in April at which Citron stated that he thought
New Englanders preferred the home rule flood control option to the federal
intervention as in the TVA. [Leuchtenburg, p. 50.] The bill was favorably reported
by the Committee, passed, and was signed into law on June 8, 1936. Shortly
thereafter, President Roosevelt signed into law the Omnibus Flood Control Act of
1936 (the Copeland Act) [Leuchtenburg, p. 51], which provided some funds for flood
control projects on the Connecticut and also authorized creation of interstate
compacts in New England for the purpose of determining and distributing costs of
land purchases, rights of way, and construction of dams among the states
involved.</p>
<p>When the New England Joint Commission on Interstate Compacts for Flood Control met in
Boston that year, delegates from Vermont and New Hampshire made it clear that they
were not about to flood good land for the benefit of those downstream, namely
Connecticut and Massachusetts. Nevertheless, upon urging from a representative of
President Roosevelt, the states came up with a completed draft for a flood control
compact. It called for creation of a Flood Control Commission to distribute the
costs of acquiring land according to the following ratios: Massachusetts, 50 per
cent; Connecticut, 40 per cent; Vermont, 5 per cent; and New Hampshire, 5 per
cent.</p>
<p>One provision of the proposed compact caused considerable opposition by the Roosevelt
Administration in Washington. Article 8 provided that the states in which the dams
were constructed would have exclusive rights of water conservation, power storage,
or power development provided by each reservoir site. The Federal Power Commission
objected to this provision, claiming it violated the Flood Control Act of 1936 and
the Federal Water Power Act of 1920. Roosevelt himself opposed Congressional
approval of the New England compact, which forced the issue back in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Those who opposed the Administration's rejection of the power provision included the
<title render="italic">Hartford Courant</title> and Governor Wilbur Cross in
Connecticut, as well as Governor George Aiken of Vermont, Governor Francis Murphy of
New Hampshire, and the <title render="italic">Boston Transcript</title>. Those who
supported Roosevelt included Congressmen Citron, Alfred Phillips, and Herman
Koppelman of Connecticut; Joseph Casey of Massachusetts; and Senator Fred Brown of
New Hampshire. This support proved disastrous in the 1938 election, only a month and
a half after the hurricane of September 21. Only Congressman Casey was reelected.
[Leuchtenburg, p. 119.]</p>
<p>TVA ON THE CONNECTICUT</p>
<p>The controversy over the TVA arose from Citron's bill, HR 4979, introduced on January
29, 1935. Reaction to the idea was mixed. Roosevelt thought that the TVA should be
studied thoroughly before attempting nationwide implementation. Private utilities in
New England opposed a Connecticut Valley Authority, and no substantial support for
the bill ever became evident. As a result, the bill died in committee.</p>
<p>On February 16, 1937, Citron reintroduced a modified version of the CVA bill (HR
4811) which would include an advisory commission of representatives from the New
England states to be recommended by the Governors of those states. This concession
to home rule, however, did nothing to get the bill past the committee on Flood
Control.</p>
<p>FINAL ACTION</p>
<p>A quick review of action in Congress after the New England compact was submitted for
approval follows. While the committee hearings were in progress. HR 10618, the
omnibus flood control bill for 1938, was reported out on May 19. In the course of
floor debate, Alben Barkley's amendment giving the Federal Government title to dams
and reservoirs in all Federal flood control programs won Senate approval. Roosevelt
concurred with this amendment, and the bill passed both houses in June 1938, and was
signed into law by the President. It was now the Federal Government's turn to
attempt to solve the massive political and economic flood control problems in New
England. [For a detailed account, see Leuchtenburg, pp. 110-120.]</p>
<p>CITRON'S ROLE</p>
<p>Congressman Citron lost the election of 1938, but had done his part to see that
Congress had a number of alternatives to direct Federal control of the Connecticut
River flood program. As a New Deal Democrat, William M. Citron tried to bring the
successes of the Federal Government in other programs into New England through the
TVA idea. New England sentiment, however, was in favor of local authority for
solving the problems of the Connecticut River Valley. His first bill enabling the
New England states to form a compact stood as the foundation for the eventual
agreement among those states that they must act independently of the Federal
Government to get action. While approval of their compact agreement was held up in
Congress, Roosevelt's program was passed. Meanwhile, the hurricane of 1938 struck.
It is interesting to note that the New England Flood Control Commission was finally
formed and approved by all the participating states by the summer of 1951.
[Leuchtenburg, p. 211.] After sixteen years in the works, a system was operational.
Political change may not come in time to prevent acts of God, but natural disasters
do have significant political consequences.</p>

<p>Do Gieng Ciu, a member of the Wesleyan Class of 1916, was born on February 11, 1888 in Foochow, China. Dr. Ciu is probably the best known of the Chinese students who attended the Anglo-Chinese College in Foochow then came to Wesleyan to study. It appears that sometime between his junior and senior years at Wesleyan, Ciu changed his name to Womin Chou. He is listed under Ciu in the annual Catalogs of students as attending Wesleyan for the years 1913/14 (sophomore) and 1914/15 (junior). In the Catalog for his senior year, 1915/16, he is listed as Womin Chou. This change of name also appears on his student record in the Registrar’s files. There is no Ciu in the 1917 Olla Podrida. There is, however, the name and picture of Donald Grove (Womin) Chou. The Olla Podrida notes that Chou was a member of the Chinese Student Union. Regardless of the change of name, Wesleyan sources use the name of Do Gieng Ciu.</p>



<p>After receiving his Bachelor of Science from Wesleyan, Ciu went on to earn a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Drew Theological Seminary in 1919; a Master of Arts from Columbia in 1920; and a Doctor of Pedagogy from New York University in 1921.</p>



<p>Although Ciu studied chemistry, political science and teaching, when he returned to his native country of China, he chose to be a missionary. He accepted an appointment in the city of Kutien and began his missionary work there in February 1921. There he started six preaching bands to work in the six city wards, in the city prison, and among the soldiers. He preached nightly. He set up a night school with 47 members, and a boys club with 23 members. Two nights a week, he lectured on hygiene, church history, or doctrine. Ciu became known as <title render="doublequote">The flaming evangel of Kutien.</title> </p>



<p>While traveling to Kuliang, a summer resort near Foochow, Ciu was killed by bandits on August 20, 1921. A memorial service was held at Wesleyan on March 5, 1922. The principle speaker was Ralph Ward, Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church and Ciu’s teacher at Anglo-Chinese College in Foochow, China.</p>

<p>Laban Clark, D.D., father of Wesleyan University and first president of Wesleyan's Board of Trustees, was born in Haverhill, New Hampshire in 1778. He was twice married, first to Harriet Fairchild, daughter of Anson Fairchild and Orpha Spelman. Harriet died in 1836,leaving three children: Joseph, William P. and Marianne Clark (Howland). Clark remarried in April 1837 to Sarah Dorchester Hanks. She lived until 1866, two years before her husband. Laban Clark and his wives are buried in the Wesleyan cemetery on Foss Hill.</p>

<p>From 1801 to 1851, Laban Clark was engaged in the work of the ministry, New York and New York East Conferences, Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1803 he served as a missionary in Lower Canada. Laban Clark introduced the resolution to organize the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York City in 1819. Clark took an active part in advocating Willbur Fisk's educational report in the General Conference in 1828. Both were in sympathy with the movement to establish a Methodist college.</p>

<p>It was while Clark was presiding elder of the New Haven District in 1829 that he became interested in acquiring the buildings and grounds of the American Literary, Military and Science Academy in Middletown, Connecticut. At the Troy Conference in May 1829 Clark made the proposal to buy the ALS&amp;M Academy property. After other locations were studied as well, and the endowment funds raised, the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut granted a charter to the Wesleyan University on May 21, 1831. Laban Clark served as the president of the Board of Trustees from 1831 to 1868. In 1852, Clark was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Divinity degree from the University.</p>

<p>He died on November 28, 1868, in Middletown Connecticut.</p>

<p>COPUS, the Coalition of Private University Students, was a financial aid advocacy group that was formed in the mid 1970s when a coalition of college students across the country joined together to address financial aid issues. The group's immediate goals in the 1970s were to uphold the gains that middle- and low-income students made during the 1960s. Exclusionary economics in the 1970s made it more difficult for these students to afford high priced state schools and independent schools. Thus COPUS became active throughout campuses to make sure the goals of the 1960s were upheld through the 1970's. Their activism became more involved in government policy towards the late 1970s through the mid 1980s.</p>

<p>In 1983, while President Ronald Reagan was in office, billions in federal funds were cut for financial aid for students attending private universities. In response, COPUS began to apply political pressure to oppose the budget cut. This cut threatened enrollment in private universities and students felt that they had a right to federal aid to private universities if qualified. Students sought to halt the budget cut so as to reinstate eligibility of lower income students to attend private universities.</p>

<p>COPUS members at Wesleyan University were particularly passionate about the subject of aid-blind admissions and federal financial aid because of the social-activist history at Wesleyan. The curriculum, resources, and ideology of Wesleyan, as well as the diversity of its student population, had all been reshaped in the 1960s. COPUS members believed that if federal financial aid were to cease to exist, it would compromise the ideal of Wesleyan University as a diverse place for higher learning. This threat, along with the fact that many students studying at the time were being directly affected by this policy, caused Wesleyan students to become very concerned with the federal financial aid budget cuts.</p>

<p>In 1982 and 1983, hundreds of Wesleyan students participated in rallies in Washington, D.C. on National Student Lobbying Day. These rallies were considered successful, yet the budget cut was still under consideration. Wesleyan COPUS members gained support from both Wesleyan faculty and Democratic senators and representatives. Supporters of COPUS called for their elected representatives to lobby for the cause on behalf of students. The group was so involved in lobbyist activities, they even wrote to President Reagan himself At a rally in front of Davenport Campus Center, COPUS members displayed photos in the year book in which they had stamped <emph render="doublequote">withdrawn for financial reasons</emph> over the faces of students who were not able to graduate due to financial aid cuts. A copy of this yearbook was sent directly to President Reagan to emphasize that the future of higher education was at stake.</p>

<p>Founded as a men's college in 1831, Wesleyan University went through two phases of coeducation, the first of which lasted from 1872 to 1909, and the second from 1970 to the present. The 1872 decision to admit women resulted partly from Wesleyan's concession, as a Methodist institution, to the well-established Methodist practice of educating men and women together. In addition, seven other New England institutions had initiated proposals to coeducate in 1871, which may have encouraged Wesleyan to do the same. These proposals, while not formally coordinated, all came in response to the women's suffrage movement of the early 1870s.</p>

<p>Wesleyan's first female class had four members: Jennie Larned, Phebe Almeda Stone, Angie Villette Warren, and Hannah Ada Taylor. From 1872 until 1892, women represented a small minority of the undergraduate community, and only forty-three women graduated in that period. However, female admissions increased in 1898, which led to a decrease in male admissions; this development fueled the fears of those who believed that the presence of women at Wesleyan would curtail opportunities for male students.</p>

<p>The shift away from coeducation was sparked by a change in the leadership of the trustees. Trustee Stephen Henry Olin led Wesleyan's movement away from Methodism and its redefinition as a metropolitan-based university, with a heavy emphasis on athletics. This shift would align Wesleyan more closely with the values of all-male institutions such as Amherst, Williams and Yale.</p>

<p>From 1900 onward, the decline in Wesleyan's overall admissions contributed to the movement against coeducation, as many feared that the college had become too "feminized." Starting in 1900, the admission of women was capped at 20 percent, but this measure never fully reassured coeducation's opponents. The trustees' decision to end coeducation in 1909 came as the culmination of a decades-long backlash against the 1872 decision. Last-ditch efforts to found a separate college for women gained momentum in 1907, but they failed to generate the necessary revenue, and the effort was eventually abandoned. Under the leadership of alumna Elizabeth C. Wright, class of 1897, a committee was formed to consider other options. This effort eventuated in the founding of Connecticut College for Women, which opened in New London, Connecticut, in 1915.</p>

<p>The Natural History Society was organized 18 April 1836 as a predominantly
undergraduate organization for <emph render="doublequote">the investigation and
promotion of various departments of natural science.</emph> The original
constitution and by-laws were adopted in April 1836 and were revised 29 May 1841.
The constitution provided for the election of officers at an annual meeting of the
society: President, Vice President, Corresponding Secretary (always a faculty
member), Recording Secretary, and Curator/Librarian. Members were designated as
Resident (students of Wesleyan and residents of Middletown); Corresponding (students
who had graduated); Honorary (elected if <emph render="doublequote">deemed worthy,
for their attainments in Natural Science</emph>); and Faculty (ex-officio
resident members). It was voted at the second meeting of the society (26 April 1836)
to include juniors in the ranks of members, and at the meeting of 18 August 1840,
the society voted to amend the constitution to include freshmen and sophomores.</p>
<p>In order to collect money for a treasury, it was decided at the meeting of 25 August
1836 that <emph render="doublequote">A tax of 12 1/2 cents was levied on each of the
members to defray certain incidental expenses.</emph> Whenever extra money was
needed, a similar <emph render="doublequote">tax</emph> was voted upon by the
society.</p>
<p>Although the society was originally known as the Natural History Society of the
Wesleyan University, its name was changed (apparently not in a formal way, i.e., no
evidence of a vote by members) to the Cuvierian Society, presumably after Baron
Georges Léopold Chrétien Frédéric Dagobert
Cuvier (1769-1832), French zoologist and geologist, a founder of comparative anatomy
and paleontology. The first evidence of a name change is seen in the minutes of the
meeting of 30 September 1837: A regular meeting of the Natural History Society,
alias Cuvierian Society was held this day. After this date it was always referred to
as the Cuvierian Society in the meeting minutes. Both versions of the constitution
refer to it as the Cuvierian Society.</p>
<p>The last minutes in this record book are for the meeting of 30 May 1846. Essayists
were appointed to speak at the next meeting, but it is not known if any further
meetings were held.</p>
<p>At each monthly meeting, essays on some aspect of science were expected to be read to
the society by members who had been chosen at the previous meeting. Many, however,
were not prepared with essays, prompting a resolution at the meeting of 14 November
1838, that <emph render="doublequote">persons having essays to write and failing in
the duties devolving upon them shall be fined 25 cents each.</emph> Even this
stern measure apparently did little to motivate the appointed essayists; recording
secretary B. F. Mudge, in the minutes for 26 February 1842, editorialized somewhat
on the situation: <emph render="doublequote">Essayists upon being called upon were
found deficient <emph render="underline">as usual</emph>.</emph> Some of the
topics of the papers included <title render="doublequote">Phrenology</title>; <title render="doublequote">Grasshoppers and Locusts</title>; <title render="doublequote">The Bee</title>; <title render="doublequote">Salt</title>;
<title render="doublequote">Coal Formations</title>; <title render="doublequote">Eels</title>; and <title render="doublequote">The Hummingbird.</title> Local
natural phenomena were also discussed at meetings: e.g., the Great Comet of 1843 (25
March and 24 April 1843), a locust colony (27 May 1843), and a bald eagle lately
taken in Meriden (27 July 1844).</p>
<p>An address to the Society on the subject of natural science on 31 July 1838 by
William H. Allen, professor of chemistry and experimental philosophy in Dickinson
College, was printed in New York in 1838.</p>
<p>The Cuvierian Society maintained a cabinet and, later, a room, to hold various
specimens which the members had collected or which had been donated. The minutes of
25 August 1836 read: <emph render="doublequote">A rattlesnake was received and a
vote of thanks returned to the donor H. W. Smith. Also a Shark's
Skeleton.</emph> It was noted on 19 May 1837 that the society was given the use
of <emph render="doublequote">the room over the labratory [sic]</emph> for <emph render="doublequote">the preservation and exhibition of their collections and
specimens in Nat. His.,</emph> as long as none of the specimens were removed
from the University. It was also understood that the collection would be donated to
the University in the event that the Cuvierian Society should cease to exist; the
collection eventually became part of the Museum in Judd Hall.</p>
<p>Several non-students had a great influence on the Cuvierian Society. Professor John
Johnston served as corresponding secretary for most of the society's existence, and
was elected president at the meeting of 25 July 1845. Prof. Johnston was an active
participant at nearly every meeting. Dr. Joseph Barratt of Middletown was elected an
honorary member of the society 8 June 1836. The minutes of 19 September 1836 read,
<emph render="doublequote">It was . . . voted that the thanks of this society be
presented through the corresponding secretary to Dr. Barratt for the interest he
has taken in behalf of said society.</emph> Dr. Barratt was also an active
member, delivering essays or papers and making <emph render="doublequote">remarks</emph> on various topics of natural science at many meetings. He was
elected president 29 June 1844, and served until the election of Prof. Johnston.
Augustus Smith, professor of mathematics and astronomy, 1831-1857, was also involved
in the society during its last years.</p>

<p>Joseph Cummings was the fifth president of Wesleyan University and its first alumnus to serve as president. He was born on March 3, 1817 in Falmouth County, Maine. Cummings attended Wesleyan University, graduating with highest honors in 1840. He taught mathematics and natural science at Amenia Seminary in New York for three years, serving as its principal for three more years before resigning to become a Methodist minister. In 1851, after seven years of preaching, Cummings was chosen president of Genesee College in Lima, New York (later to become Syracuse University). He was elected president of his alma mater, Wesleyan, in 1857, but only commenced his term in 1858, as he was unwilling to so abruptly leave Genesee. Cummings' Wesleyan presidency spanned the Civil War, during which 133 students left Wesleyan to join the Union Army, and several others left to join the Confederate Army. Despite this disruption, Cummings supervised the construction of several buildings, including Rich Library (now the Patricelli '92 Theatre), Memorial Chapel, and Orange Judd Hall. He also enlarged the school's curriculum - particularly in the natural sciences - and oversaw the admission of women, a policy maintained until 1909. However, the 1873 depression inhibited some of Cummings' attempts at expansion, provoking tension between Cummings and the trustees, which led to his 1875 resignation. He stayed on campus as head of the department of philosophy for two years before leaving to preach once more. In 1881, he was elected president of Northwestern University. He died May 7, 1890. </p>

<p>The Continental Vocalists was a successful and popular band of four members, all Americans and natives of Connecticut. It is strongly believed that all group members had musical training, played instruments and sang. They toured the country singing pure music and were well received every place without regard to population, politics or religious beliefs. One member of the group, J. Wesley Smith, began performing as a young boy with his family as part of the <emph render="doublequote">Smith Family</emph> in 1840. Mr. Smith organized a company which he styled the <title render="doublequote">American Vocalists.</title> Mr. Smith receives credit for having first advanced the project of a Continental Band, to represent, in costume, the Patriots of 1776, while performing National music.</p>

<p>W.D. Franklin was born November 25, 1825, in Brooklyn, Connecticut and studied music at the Boston Teachers Institute. He taught guitar, violin, violoncello, and voice for eight years before helping to found the Continental Vocalists quartet. Franklin married Mary Barrett on September 4, 1843. Mrs. Franklin opened a millinery in the 1870s at 54 Broad St., Middletown, CT.</p>

<p>The Continental Vocalists first trip commenced September 1, 1853 and collected $5,503 in receipts. Members of the Continental Vocalists for the first two trips included: C.W. Huntington, New London, Conn.; W.D. Franklin, Norwich, Conn.; W.R. Frisbie, Branford, Conn.; J.W. Smith, South Glastenbury, Conn.; and J.A. Sterry, Agt., Norwich, Conn. The second trip ended May 29, 1855, when at Jamestown, Frisbie was bleeding at the lungs and they started immediately for home where he died July 9, 1855. The group continued to tour with a replacement of Frisbee. The Financial Journal gives a detailed account of the band's daily events from 1853 through 1857. </p>

Daddario played varsity football at Wesleyan for three years and broke or established most of the team's modern day records with his broken field running and drop-kicking ability. He was captain of the football team as a senior. He twice won the C. Everett Bacon award for outstanding athletic ability, which included three years as a varsity shortstop on the baseball team. Later, to pay his way through law school, Daddario played professional football with the Providence Steamrollers and the Hartford Blues, the latter as captain, star and coach. He also coached the Wethersfield State Prison football team. In 1963 he was named to the <emph render="doublequote">Sports Illustrated Silver Anniversary All-America Award</emph> for college players who have achieved success in their lives since. In 1964 his early athletic exploits were honored by Connecticut Sportwriters' Gold Key Award.</event>

<event>Daddario enlisted in the United States Army in February 1943, and was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services in the Mediterranean Theatre. Entering as a private he underwent intensive training for ten months and eventually served with partisans in Italy, behind the lines. For remarkable service during the war, he was awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit and the Italian Medaglio d'Argento medals. This brief description of his exploits documents this aspect of his career: <emph render="doublequote">But it remained for a 24-year-old OSS officer who had infiltrated into Milan to top all these other exploits by waging a brief but highly successful war of his own. During the last five days of the Italian campaign, this one man task-force, Captain Emilio Q. Daddario of Boston, Mass., maneuvered single-handed the surrender of the Nazi S. S. Headquarters at Villa Locatelli in Cenobbio; arranged with the German General in command at Como to confine his troops to the barracks of Italy, made a prisoner of Marshal Graziani, Chief of the Italian Fascist Army as well as Generals Bonomi and Sorrentino and other leaders who were to be turned over to Allied intelligence.</emph></event>

But Captain Daddario had orders from Allied Headquarters to bring Graziani back alive. Somehow he managed to spirit his prize prisoner out of Milan. Several times the OSS party was under fire from excited Italian Partisans; the car which was assigned to the Marshal was dynamited and an OSS lieutenant badly wounded, but Graziani was delivered intact.</emph></event>

<event>Daddario was nominated by the Democratic Town Committee to run for mayor of Middletown and was elected on October 8, 1946. His vote was 4,686 over the Republican Salvatore T. Cubeta's total of 4,306. Cubeta had served as mayor for two terms. Middletown's population in 1940 was 26,495 and rose in 1950 to 29,711. Members of the Common Council during the Daddario administration were four Republican holdovers from the 1944 election (Rosindo Amato, C. Marsden Bacon, Joseph P. Chester and A. Pickett Hull) and five Democrats elected in 1946 (Herbert C. F. Bell, William J. Scanlon, Irving R. Segal, Fiorie DeToro, and Leo Zieller). Daddario assumed office as Middletown's 64th mayor on October 10, 1946 and at age 28 he was the youngest mayor in Connecticut history. Although the office was then considered a part-time position that enabled, or obliged, the officeholder to continue other private employment, Mayor Daddario's administration was a highly active one: the water system was restructured, new parks added, low cost housing built, and collective bargaining for city employees instituted. Mayor Daddario's efforts in reforming the school system in Middletown have been recalled by Wilbert Snow: <emph render="doublequote">We ran him for the office of Mayor in October 1946 and while Mayor, he did me one favor I have never ceased to be grateful for. In Middletown we had not one but two School Boards, one a City Board for the four square miles within the city, and one a Town Board, for the 44 square miles outside the city limits. For eleven years I was chairman of the Town Board. The teachers in the City schools, operating under a special state charter, were receiving from two to four hundred dollars a year more than the teachers in the Town School District, even though they ate in the same restaurants and shopped in the same stores. I acquainted my former student with the disparity and he saw to it that the salaries were equalized.</emph></event>

<event>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION: The Subcommittee held numerous hearings into national policy regarding scientific research and development (R&amp;D). Reports were issued on government research and development expenditures and on the geographic distribution among the states of federal research grants in 1964. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was under intensive scrutiny, and the Subcommittee was responsible for hearings on appropriations to the NSF. In March 1966, Daddario issued a bill modifying the NSF's organizational structure and scope, based on the Subcommittee report issued in the previous December. That bill became law in July 1966 [An Act to Amend the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, 82 Stat. 360]. By 1970, the Subcommittee recommended and acquired for the NSF a budget of $477,605,000 [National Science Foundation Authorization Act, 1970, 83 Stat. 203]. The Subcommittee then proposed a bill for the "collection, compilation, critical evaluation, publication, and dissemination of standard reference data" through the Secretary of Commerce. This bill, which authorized $1.86 million for fiscal 1969 became law [Standard Reference Data Act, 82 Stat. 339].

<event>TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: One of the more active roles Daddario played was in the proposal to establish a Technology Assessment Board.

A seminar on technology assessment resulted in continued hearings by the Subcommittee into that area before any legislation could be drawn up. Three special studies were requested from the Legislative Reference Service, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering. A fourth report, made by the National Academy of Public Information dealt with administrative facets of technology assessment in the Executive Branch. A report from the Science Policy Research Division of the Library of Congress (April 1969), a report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science on ecological effects of chemical defoliants in Vietnam, and a crucial meeting in February, 1969 of the Panel on Science and Technology paved the way for H.R. 17046, a bill introduced by Congressmen Daddario and Mosher (R-Ohio). Subsequently, the <title render="doublequote">Technology Assessment Act of 1972</title> was adopted to establish an Office of Technology Assessment <emph render="doublequote">for the Congress as an aid in the identification and consideration of existing and probable impacts of technological application.</emph> [Public Law 92-484; 86 Stat. 797]. The official legislative history of the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 states the following: <emph render="doublequote">The House Committee on Science and Astronautics provided early leadership in designing this proposed institution, and its Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development, under the chairmanship of Emilio Q. Daddario and later John W. Davis, created a substantial literature on the subject. </emph>[Senate Report No. 92-1123, in <title render="italic">U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News</title>, 1972, p. 5195].</event>

<p>A gift from George W. Davison ’1892 allowed the building’s renovation to take place. Davison, a book and print collector, began giving parts of his collection of prints to the university in 1937. The original collection was housed in the Davison Art Rooms in Olin Library before forming the core collection of the Davison Art Center. After Davison’s death in 1953, Wesleyan has continued to add to its holdings of prints and has included photography as an additional collecting focus.</p>

<p>Der Deutsche Verein, or The German Club, was a student organization at Wesleyan whose purpose was to promote the learning and application of the German language. The members were students with a high level of German, generally past the second level or higher. Membership was limited to 25 members at a time, and members were required to be highly active and pay dues. They held elections and elected officers for various posts including president, vice-president, and secretary. They held regular meetings on the first and third Saturday of every month of the school year around 7:00 pm.</p>
<p>Their gatherings (Sitzungen) frequently included meals, and very often they were accompanied by faculty and students reading essays, stories, and poems written in German, of all academic subjects, and pertaining to German Studies, such as travels in Germany, and post-war era topics. They also held a yearly Christmas party (Weihnachtsfest) on December 8 with a large feast, gifts, singing, and readings of verses and poetry.

<p>The organization that became Delta Tau Delta was started by fourteen members of the classes of 1893 and 1894 as a non-secret literary society. It was founded in the fall of 1891 and was known as the Phi Rho Literary Society. Phi Rho initially called itself a non-fraternity society with the aim of constituting a brotherhood and cultivating the art of public speaking. The society acquired its first house in 1893 and officially adopted the name Phi Rho. Written records of Phi Rho begin in 1895 and at that point, the society was made up of twenty-five men from the classes of 1895 to 1898. The society was organized with a constitution and by-laws; it was a literary and debating club made up of non-fraternity men, and although it had some characteristics of a fraternity, such as colors (lavender and apple green), it was not yet a college fraternity. At the very beginning of the 20th century (1903), the Phi Rho Literary Society finally established itself as the Gamma Zeta chapter of the national fraternity of Delta Tau Delta, although very little changed. By 1905, the public speaking aspect of the society all but disappeared. The fraternity was located, at various times, in eight different houses all over the Wesleyan campus, with the last being 156 High Street (which as of 2008 houses Wes Wings). Between 1970 and 1978, the chapter was not affiliated with the national organization, but rejoined the national organization for its last few years in existence on the Wesleyan campus. The last active chapter of Delta Tau Delta left in 1989.</p>

A College of Social Studies major in the class of 1990, Kirsten Delegard was one of only 5 women in her CSS class. As she notes in her thesis, and as many have noted before and since, CSS is a notoriously male-dominated major in terms of both student population and core theorists-though there are arguments to be made about the increasingly equal distribution of its professorship. As she writes in the introduction to her thesis, her experience as part of a marginal group influenced her decision to write a thesis about the experiences of women throughout the second period of coeducation at Wesleyan, which began in 1968. She wrote that she "felt inhibited, discouraged, and frustrated as a woman in a program pervaded by both blatant and subtle sexism." She offers several anecdotes that illustrate this experience.</p>
<p>
"In classes and department social events professors and undergraduates used sexist language and humor that patronized, demeaned, and objectified women students. In classes where aggressive debate characterized discussion, women were more often interrupted, ridiculed for their comments, and ignored by male undergraduates and professors. While I succeeded academically, my confidence in my abilities was undermined by sexist comments. One professor told me, 'I think you did not do well in my class because women think differently, women can't understand power,' while another said he was surprised to find a woman excelling." </p>
<p>
Because of her experience, she felt compelled to examine how women at Wesleyan have dealt at various periods with being a traditionally marginalized group. Based primarily on the results to the surveys, which are included in the collection and described in detail below, Delegard wrote her senior thesis for CSS, titled "Mixed Memories: Reflections On Twenty-Two Years of Coeducation at Wesleyan."</p>
<p>
Since graduating from Wesleyan, Delegard received her Masters and PhD in history from Duke University. She currently works as a public historian in her hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and is noted for creating the Historyapolis Project, which is meant to "make the history of [Minneapolis] accessible," given what Delegard sees as the city's blindness to its tumultuous past and its discomfort with confronting it. The project "seeks to produce a new book-length history of the city," and to "catalyze community dialogue around some of the most challenging aspects of local history."</p>
<p>
In 2012, Delegard published her first full-length work-Battling Miss Bolsheviki: The Origins of Female Conservatism in the United States. In the book, Delegard explores why once-respected female reformers lost authority after women won the right to vote, and argues that female conservatives pushed out these reformers with anti-radical agendas. Delegard has also been involved in the writing and editing of several other academic texts, and at time of writing is working on a new history of Minneapolis under the Historyapolis project.

<p>Reverend Holden Dwight, son of Daniel and Susan Lippiett Dwight was born on August 28, 1810. After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1835, Dwight moved to Georgia where he opened a private school and became a school teacher. After a year of teaching, he was forced to shut down his school in Columbus, Georgia due to improper facilities and as he states, because the city was <emph render="doublequote">entirely destitute of literary character.</emph> Dwight then departed Columbus, Georgia, on December 30, 1837, and moved to his new home of New Orleans, Louisiana. With the help of a Mr. Hamilton, a leader of the local Methodist Church, Dwight was able to establish another school. Unfortunately, Dwight was forced to close his school on May 29, 1838, whereupon he was appointed as a missionary in the third municipality of New Orleans. Dwight did successfully open a Sunday school in this area, but then left after two months in order to tutor Judge McGehee's children in Woodville, Mississippi. After two months of working in Woodville, Dwight took his leave from the family and traveled to Jackson, Louisiana, where he was appointed to the Preparatory Department in the College of Louisiana on October 15, 1838.</p>
<p>On June 13th, 1839 Dwight married Almena Marietta Pelton in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In the latter half of 1839, he was appointed a deacon of the Methodist Church. Around January 1, 1840, Dwight left the College of Louisiana and took up residence in Clinton, Mississippi where he and his wife opened a private academy. Unfortunately, both Dwight and his wife were struck with serious illnesses leaving no one else to run the school. On December 13, 1840 Dwight's first son, Edward Champion Dwight, was born. Other children were Wilbur Fisk (born February 6, 1843), Susan Eliza (September 13, 1844), and Dwight (July 9, 1847) On January 1, 1841, Dwight was the elected principal of the Preparatory Department of Centenary College in Jackson, Mississippi, but this position eventually fell through. Dwight was then forced to travel north in search of employment. After a month of searching, Dwight was able to find a position in the department of natural science of Norwalk Seminary in Ohio. After three years at Norwalk as a teacher of languages, Dwight was appointed principal of Baldwin Institute at Berea, Ohio. Holden Dwight passed away on November 24, 1846 at the age of 36.</p>

<p>The EQV freshman rushing booklet of 1961 states: <emph render="doublequote">. . . In
rushing we are not hindered by any discriminatory provision; rather our
criterion for selection is based upon obtaining in EQV a diversity of
personalities, talents, and interests.</emph></p>

<p>The Wesleyan fraternity EQV was formed in September 1959 when Wesleyan's Phi Gamma
chapter of Alpha Chi Rho (AXP) voted to withdraw from their national organization.
This move was the result of discrepancies between AXP's exoteric, or external
manual, and its esoteric manual, describing the oaths to be taken by pledges during
their initiation. AXP had been founded in 1895 as a Christian fraternity. In 1954
the national organization changed the language of the exoteric manual from <emph render="doublequote">. . . membership from among Christians only</emph> to a
requirement that <emph render="doublequote">members respect Jesus of Nazareth as
their moral exemplar.</emph> The esoteric manual, however, kept the original
language. For that reason, members of Wesleyan's Phi Gamma chapter chose to withdraw
from the national organization. EQV stands for Esse Quam Videri, which is Latin for
<emph render="doublequote">to be, rather than to seem.</emph>
</p>

<p>EQV was supported by many Phi Gamma alumni who voted to change the by-laws to allow
Wesleyan to lease, and eventually own the AXP building at 300 High St. EQV remained
there until the fall of 1965. By this time, AXP had successfully petitioned the
administration to return to campus and reclaim their house. EQV now needed a new
home. For the 1965-1966 year, they lived in the dormitories on Lawn Avenue, and in
September 1966 they moved into the John Wesley House at 343 High Street. The group
may have lost momentum following a house fire in early December 1967. EQV disbanded
in the spring of 1968. </p>

<p>What would come to be called WESU began in 1939 when two students living in Clark Hall connected a transmitter to a phonograph and began broadcasting 78 rpm records. To provide a signal to other buildings, they extended ran their antenna wire though the utility tunnels which connected the buildings. The station quickly became a campus fixture, broadcasting throughout the Middletown area in the early 1940's on an AM signal with the under the call letters WES. In 1950, updated Federal Communications Commission law granted the station its four-letter WESU. In 1965, sophomore Mark Estren became general manager. During his three-year tenure, WESU enjoyed phenomenal success, with the staff increasing from 8 to over 150.

<p>In 1868, when this collection of examinations begins, there were only 148 students enrolled at Wesleyan University. By 1970, the end date of this collection, the student enrollment was up to 1,393 students and the school had been admitting women for two years. In the latter part of the 19th century, the curriculum was a very different format than what it became by the late 1960s. In the 1860s, the courses for the students were pre-planned each term according to their academic focus. There were requirements for admission to the university in Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English, although if students wished to only take literary and scientific courses, they did not have to be familiar with Latin and Greek. There was a general course of study that included languages, mathematics, various sciences, government, philosophy, and history. There was also a scientific course of study offered with more focus on the sciences and fewer courses in Latin and Greek. Later in the 19th century, a student could chose among the classical course in which he or she earned a bachelor of arts, the Latin-scientific course in which he or she earned a bachelor of philosophy, and the scientific course in which he or she earned a bachelor of science.</p>

<p>Beginning in the early 20th century, new departments were established and students were able to choose courses among the different departments. The departments included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, romance languages, English literature, English language, public speaking, history, economics and social science, philosophy, psychology, ethics and religion, mathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, biology, physical education, military science and tactics, and the required freshman course, <emph render="doublequote">fundamentals of student life.</emph> The departments were divided into three categories or divisions which still exist today: arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences and math. Students were and are still required to take courses in all three divisions of the curriculum in order to ensure a well rounded liberal education. By the mid-20th century, several departments were added to include art, classics (a combination of the Latin and Greek departments), music, philosophy and ethics, and religion. More departments were added to the curriculum following World War II, including Chinese, theater, and Russian. In the 1961-1962 catalog, the section on the background and history of the university states that <emph render="doublequote">the years since the end of World War II have been characterized by self-study and controlled experimentation seeking ways in which to make liberal education more meaningful and vital to each student.</emph> By this point, the College of Letters and the College of Social Sciences (also known as the Public Affairs Program) had been established. With the exception of a few additional departments, the curriculum has remained similar to what it became in the early 1960s.</p>

<p> The Financial Planning Committee (FPC), a faculty-student body created under faculty by-laws, was formed in about 1968. It was composed of 6 faculty members, 4 undergraduate students, and 4 ex-officio administrators. The role of the group was to evaluate administrative proposals related to budgets and allocations, and provide suggestions and recommendations. The FPC also made their recommendations known to the greater campus community through publications like their 1975 <title render="doublequote">FPC Report: A Plan for Financial Stability,</title> which was published as a supplement to the Wesleyan student newspaper, the <title render="italic">Argus</title>.

<p>Willbur Fisk, Wesleyan’s first president, was born on 31 August 1792 and grew up in
Brattleboro, Vermont. Although his mother feared that <emph render="doublequote">godlessness and sin</emph> in schools and colleges would make Fisk too worldly
and <emph render="doublequote">strangle the spiritual life,</emph> Fisk graduated
from Brown University in 1815, after also attending Peacham Academy and the
University of Vermont. Surprisingly, given his future role at Wesleyan, Fisk was not
initially drawn to the Methodist ministry following school. In fact, he struggled
with his spiritual purpose at that time, working in law and as a tutor. However, a
revelation during a bout of illness brought him to the ministry in 1818, and he
devoted the rest of his life to his work as a Methodist. In 1825, Fisk was appointed
principal of Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, a preparatory school from
which many Wesleyan University students were to be drawn.</p>
<p>Fisk was active within the Methodist Church on a number of issues, including the
importance of education, temperance, missionary work, and his opposition to
abolitionist movements.</p>
<p>When the decision to found a university in Middletown, Connecticut was made, Fisk was
tapped for the role of first president. In his inaugural speech in 1831, he outlined
his vision for the university, encapsulated by the statement that <emph render="doublequote">Education should be directed in reference to two
objects—the good of the individual educated and the good of the world.</emph>
Fisk was deeply involved in the administrative and curricular decisions of Wesleyan,
and raised funds for the new college. He traveled to Europe to study educational
institutions and collect scientific equipment in 1835-1836, and also took that time
as a break from the stresses of the presidency. Suffering from ill-health his entire
life, Fisk finally succumbed on 22 February 1839 while still serving as
president.</p>
<p>Willbur Fisk married Ruth Peck on 9 June 1823, and they had one adopted daughter,
Martha.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan University Glee Club was first organized in 1846, although the group did not meet regularly until the late 1860s. The Glee Club began to travel in 1862 with a tour beginning in Middletown, Connecticut. The final concert of this tour was held on the summit of Mt. Washington in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The group began traveling by rail in 1884 on their first tour to Chicago. On the Glee Club's annual tours (often during winter or Easter break), they frequently visited Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Massachusetts. They were the first college glee club to make a phonograph recording in 1890 at the invitation of Thomas Edison. In 1901, they traveled to Washington, D.C. where they were received by President McKinley in the White House. The Glee Club again traveled to the White House in 1928 to meet President Coolidge. In both 1926 and 1927, Wesleyan won the glee club national championship, which was held in Carnegie Hall. </p>

<p>The annual Christmas candlelight concert was first held in the Wesleyan's Memorial Chapel in 1928. From the 1960s until 1972, the concert was performed by both the Glee Club and the Chapel Choir. In 1972, the concert was performed jointly by the Concert Choir and the Chapel Choir, and by 1974, the Concert Choir was the only group that performed at the candlelight concerts. The Glee Club disappeared from campus during the early 1970s.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, a 1,440 acre wildlife preserve in New Fairfield was willed to Wesleyan University by Walter Gordon Merritt. The land was named Great Hollow and in 1969, Peter Budryk, with the moral support of Murray Durst, created the Great Hollow Wilderness School (GHWS), a sort of combination of Upward Bound and Outward Bound: a wilderness program for disadvantaged youth. After the first year of the program in 1970, Budryk developed a graduate course in the Wesleyan Master of Arts in Teaching program in outdoor education leadership; after a few years, the course was no longer needed as a group of capable GHWS staff were available. In 1973, Budryk was named executive director of the program and was given full responsibility for its development and operation. In 1982, the Wilderness Education Association invited and accredited GHWS to conduct the National Standard Program in Outdoor Leadership Certification.</p>

<p>In 1985, GHWS was given approval to run an optional freshman orientation trip. The first Wesleyan Orientation in the Wilderness (WOW) in 1985 was very successful and the program continued through the 1990s.</p>

<p>The following biographical sketch of Karl Pomeroy Harrington is taken from the Memorial Minute presented by Professor Homer E. Woodbridge and adopted by the Faculty, November 24, 1953: </p>

<p>The life of Karl Pomeroy Harrington (June 13, 1861-November 14, 1953) has been closely interwoven with the life of Wesleyan and Middletown. His association with Wesleyan may be said to have begun before he was born: his father, Calvin Sears Harrington, was a graduate of the class of 1852. Shortly after Karl's birth in 1861, Calvin Harrington was became Professor Greek at Wesleyan, and for the next twenty-five years served on the faculty, for two years as Professor of Greek, and then as Professor of Latin. Karl Harrington was educated in the Middletown schools and at Wesleyan, graduating with high honors in the class of 1882. After teaching in Westfield and at Wilbraham, he spent two years in study abroad, in Germany, Greece, and Italy, and returned to Wesleyan in 1889 to serve for two years as Tutor in Latin. Another year of graduate study at Yale was followed by professorships of Latin at the University of North Carolina and the University of Maine. In 1905 he return to Wesleyan as the Robert Rich Professor of the Latin Language and Literature. He occupied this chair, formerly his father's, until he was made Professor Emeritus in 1929.</p>

<p>As a Latinist he was deeply interested in the poets: he published an edition of the elegiac poets (1914) and a volume on Catullus and his influence (1923). He was also a pioneer in making medieval Latin available to American students. His anthology of medieval Latin prose and verse (1925) had been recently reprinted at the time of his death.</p>

<p>Harrington interests were not just in the field of classical studies. He was an accomplished musician, a composer, and a hymnologist, who was at least as well known for his work in music as for his Latin scholarship. He composed one of the most popular modern Christmas carols, and also one of the favorite college comic songs. With Carl F. Price, he edited the first six editions of the <title render="italic">Wesleyan Song Book</title> and was the editor of several hymnals. For more than a generation he was organist and choir direct of the First Methodist Church in Middletown. </p>

<p>He was also an outdoor man, an athlete, and a mountaineer. He frequently went out into the White Mountains with the "trail gang" maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club when they were constructing new stretches of trail. This interest is represented among his writings by his <title render="italic">Walks and Climbs in the White Mountain</title> (1926) and his editorial work for many years on the <title render="italic">White Mountain Guide</title>.</p>

<p>His civic and social interests in the community were many. He founded the Twentieth Century Club, an organization involved with keeping Middletown accessible by railroad. For many years, he was the secretary and moving force in the Conversational Club, a town-and-gown organization which meets informally for dinners and discussions of papers. He was also active in the Apostles Club, contributing papers on a wide variety of subjects. He maintained an interest in the Mystical Seven and in his own fraternity, Psi Upsilon.</p>

Bertha Drew Hartzell was born in Newton Massachusetts to prominent lawyer and Harvard graduate Charles Acton Drew and Harriet Jaquith Drew on July 10, 1876. She attended Radcliffe College, where she was class president and graduated cum laude in 1898. As a young woman she traveled through Europe, and in 1900, while living in Berlin and studying music and German Language, she met the young Artur Rubinstein, who was studying piano there. Artur became quite smitten with her, and she is said to have given him a kiss as his thirteenth birthday present. They became good friends and kept in contact throughout her life. Later, her son Karl kept in somewhat regular contact with Rubenstein as well.</p>
<p>
Also while in Europe, she met Rev. Dr. Morton Hartzell. They kept in touch by letter in the first years of the 20th century while she pursued a graduate degree in German studies at Radcliffe and taught for a year at Brookline High School. Though she seems to have had many other suitors, and perhaps even one serious beau around this time, in 1904 she and Morton became engaged and married, which appears to have been very much supported by Bertha's friends and family. In 1905 or 1906, they had their first child who died at nine months of age. In 1906, their son Karl Hartzell was born in Chicago.</p>
<p>
Said to be a dynamic personality, the Reverend Hartzell was very ill with bovine tuberculosis—contracted through drinking unpasteurized milk—through much of their marriage, and often preached from a wheelchair. At the recommendation of Morton's doctors, the family moved to Pasadena, California for Morton's health. Bertha is remembered as a dedicated helpmate to him during his declining years. In 1916, Morton Hartzell died in Pasadena, California, and it seems Bertha and Karl quickly returned to Massachusetts. Bertha obtained a degree in library science from Simmons College in 1918, and is said to have received the highest marks ever by a student up to that time. She then went to work as a librarian at the School of Social Work in Boston, and then at Dana Hall School in Wellesley. She later became supervisor of training at the Boston Public Library, where she worked until her retirement in 1946. Karl attended Newton High School and then Wesleyan University, graduating in 1927. In 1935 he married Ann Lomas and they had three boys, two of whom attended Wesleyan. He later remarried in Florida. In Bertha's spare time, she participated in church, music, and library organizations. She died in 1950 in Massachusetts.

<p>The following is an obituary note submitted to Wesleyan University following Herge's death in 2003.</p>

<p>Henry Curtis Herge, 97, who served as Dean of the Rutgers University Graduate School of Education in New Brunswick, New Jersey from 1953 to 1964, died March 8, 2003 of pneumonia. He lived in Fleet Landing, a retirement community in Atlantic Beach, Florida, but he had a home in Middletown, Connecticut from 1943 to 1945.</p>

<p>Dr. Herge began his long career in domestic and international education in 1928 as an English instructor, school principal, and school supervisor in public school systems on Long Island, New York. During World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and, subsequently, became the Commanding Officer of the Navy College Training Program at Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, which graduated 6,000 Navy and Marine Corps officers between 1943 and 1945. Just after V-J Day, he became Associate Director of the American Council on Education in Washington, D.C.; and in 1946, he became State Director of Higher Education and Teacher Certification in the Connecticut State Department of Education in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>

<p>In 1953, Dr. Herge accepted the invitation of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, to become Dean and professor of the Graduate School of Education, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Among his other achievements, Dean Herge spearheaded the funding, design and construction of the building which today houses the Graduate School of Education. He left Rutgers in 1964 for a series of appointments with the Agency for International Development and the Organization of American States in Paraguay, Jamaica, Zambia, Malawi, and Italy, where he assisted in developing teacher training and school management curricula and programs. He returned to Rutgers as a professor in the Graduate School of Education and as the Associate Director of the Rutgers Center for International Studies. He retired in 1975. </p>

<p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, Dr. Herge was the recipient of three degrees at New York University, a Ph.D. at Yale University, and an honorary degree at Wesleyan University.

<p>[This narrative was written by Leigh Raiford '94, who in 1999 was in her fourth year of the Joint Ph.D. Program in African-American and American Studies at Yale University. Ms. Raiford worked with the Hewlett Diversity Archive in 1998-99. The narrative was revised by the staff of Special Collections &amp; Archives in the summer of 2000.]</p>



<p><emph render="doublequote">The Changing Face of Wesleyan: An Introduction to The Hewlett Diversity Archive</emph></p>



<p>In the summer of 1994, Wesleyan University was chosen as one of 25 public and private U.S. colleges and universities to receive a Pluralism and Unity Grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. This generous grant occasioned a unique and wonderful opportunity to examine and document, celebrate, and critique nearly 170 years of the changing face of Wesleyan. The Hewlett Diversity Archive, one of myriad projects undertaken during the 3-year tenure of the grant, offered students and historians, administrators, and alumni the chance to explore one university's commitment to racial diversity. Indeed, these archives impel us to investigate and make sense of concepts like "diversity," "unity," and "multiculturalism," often used and often misunderstood in the university context. This archive also provides a springboard for envisioning the collective future of Wesleyan University.</p>



<p>The idea for an archive of the history of racial diversity at Wesleyan was conceived by Krishna Winston, Professor of German Studies, Coordinator of the Mellon Minority Undergraduate Fellowship Program, and Coordinator of the Hewlett Project. Along with Monique Sulle, Associate Mellon Program Coordinator and Hewlett Project Associate Coordinator, Professor Winston felt that an archive would be the best and most useful way of cataloguing Wesleyan's vibrant and contentious history of diversity and of preserving the work of the Hewlett Summer Fellows who had culled materials from various university sources in order to document this history.</p>



<p>During the summers of 1995 and 1996, Hewlett Fellows gathered most of the documents and interviews that make up this collection. The 12 Fellows, members of the classes of 1996, '97, '98, and '99, researched various aspects of Wesleyan's history. Their projects included an examination of admission policies over time; of African-American, Latino, Asian and Asian-American, and Native American presence on campus; of student of color protests; of changes in and development of the curriculum; and of the history of the ethno-cultural houses. For their research, the Fellows studied the University archives and the files of the Office of Public Information. They read back issues of the student newspaper, The Argus, and compiled a complete index to all articles concerning racial matters. They also read and compiled a partial index of the student of color publication The Ankh. Under the direction of William Kerr, late Provost and Secretary of the University, the Fellows examined presidential papers as well as committee minutes and reports. They conducted taped interviews with former key administrators, faculty members, and alumni. They collected and catalogued materials produced by students in several tutorials conducted in the mid-1980s by Dean of the College Emeritus Edgar Beckham on the history of Wesleyan, including a substantial number of taped interviews. All of the above, including the Fellows' own notes and reports, are included in the collection.</p>



<p>It is important to note that much of Wesleyan's history of racial diversity can be found in a variety of sources located throughout the campus, including the records of the Office of Public Information, the Presidential files, and the University Archives' vertical files. In addition, there are a number of excellent secondary sources in the form of theses and essays that can be found in the University Archives. Moreover, much of Wesleyan's early history of student-of-color presence on campus (pre-1964) can be found in the Archives' vertical files. These files provide an introductory though fragmentary overview of the experiences of ethnic and gender minorities at Wesleyan prior to the hiring of Director of Admissions John C. Hoy in 1964 and the subsequent dramatic changes in recruitment strategies and admission policies.</p>



<p>The Hewlett Diversity Archive's strength lies in materials that document Wesleyan's changing face in the last 35 years. But more importantly, the Hewlett Archive's singularity and importance lies in the fact that for the first time these materials are gathered together under a single rubric. Taken together, this information provides a look at the formation and development of student-of-color groups, political, social, and cultural; of administrative policies concerning students as well as faculty; of curricular approaches and pedagogical strategies. This archive is a useful tool for charting the expanding meanings of the concept of diversity itself, from an era when diversity was understood as simply the presence of physical difference to a time when diversity also means heterogeneity of thought. The collection also provides a backdrop for recognizing that "unity" is something struggled for, not automatically attained; and that the achievement of unity may not necessarily be a desirable goal if it can be achieved only at the expense of cultural diversity. In short, the archive's strength lies in gathering together history and memory of the evolution, even revolution, of Wesleyan's vision and self-image.</p>

<p>Born in Atchison, Kansas, Ray P. Holland was interested in the outdoors from an early age. He
became a noted sportsman and writer, was dedicated to the management of wildlife and, as a
United States Game Warden during World War I, became a key figure in the Supreme Court case of
Missouri v. Holland, decided in 1920, a landmark case in constitutional and conservation law.
Active in conservation groups such as the American Game Protective Association and the
International Association of Game, Fish, and Conservation Commissioners, Holland was editor of
the magazine <title render="italic">Field &amp; Stream</title> during its heyday in the
1920s and 1930s. </p>

<event>HUNTING AND FISHING ON THE MISSOURI RIVER. Settled in 1854, Atchison was an important
stop for wagon trains, a railroad terminal, and a booming river city when Holland was a child.
Holland was entranced with the Missouri River which was navigable far north from Atchison
along the Nebraska border, across South Dakota and North Dakota to Montana and south from
Atchison across Missouri to join the Mississippi River above St. Louis. He knew the river
boats, the pleasures of fishing and lived in a boyhood style reminiscent of <title render="italic">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</title> which Mark Twain published in
1883. Holland was also a hunter who "shot his first duck, a greenwing teal, with a
muzzle-loading shotgun in October of 1893. He was 9 years old." [Ted Trueblood, "Ray P.
Holland," <title render="italic">Field &amp; Stream</title>, June 1970, pp. 195-l96.]
There are four great, distinguishable flyways taken by migratory birds in their spring flights
to breeding grounds in Canada and their fall return south: the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central
and Pacific flyways. Holland was an avid duck hunter and came easily to identify all of the
birds on the great Mississippi flyway. He has written that he owned one of the first
motorboats on the river at Atchison and traveled widely with it, probably before 1910.
[Holland, "It Was Mostly Luck," unpub. MSS., Holland Papers, container 10, p. xi-7.] With
friends, Holland was out hunting or fishing in season through all the years he resided in
Atchison until he moved East to New York in 1919. </event>

<date>1893-1903 </date>
<event>EDUCATION. After passing through grammar school, Holland attended Atchison High School,
the College Preparatory School at Atchison, from 1899 to 1902 and then, for one year, was a
student at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. He abandoned an intention to enter
Princeton University in 1903. </event>

<event>EARLY OCCUPATIONS. A paper carrier for the <title render="italic">Atchison
Globe</title> when quite young, Holland listed himself later as an accountant and held a
series of jobs in Atchison during the decade after finishing his formal education. He worked
in a lumber yard, was cashier of the Atchison Railway, Light and Power Company, ran the
office of a small foundry and, finally, as order and price clerk was in charge of the
Atchison Saddlery.</event>
<event>MARRIAGE AND FAMILY. Holland married Ruth Marie Perkins, October 16, 1907. They took a
river steamboat from Atchison to New Orleans for a wedding trip during which they made visits
of several days each in St. Louis, Cape Giradeau, Memphis, Vicksburg and, of course, New
Orleans, returning by train. Their children were three: Robert Perkins, Raymond Prunty, Jr.,
and Daniel John. </event>

<event>FREE-LANCE WRITER OF THE OUTDOORS. Engrossment with the pleasures of camping, hunting
and fishing began to payoff in dollars as Holland's stories and articles poured forth. He
sent a story done for a class at Lawrenceville School to the magazine <title render="italic">Sports Afield</title> and got back a check. By 1912 he was a serious writer, committed
enough and successful enough to give up other work and become a full-time free lance. This
permitted him even more time in the field, more time to observe and indulge in hunting and
fishing and, thereby, become a more authoritative writer. In the winter of 1913, and at other
times later, he and his family spent the winter at Balboa Beach, near Newport Bay, south of
Los Angeles where, as he later wrote, "I could beat a typewriter one day and hunt and fish
the next." [Holland, "It Was Mostly Luck," container 10, p. xiii-1. ] Among his early
writings were "A Goose That Was a Goose," <title render="italic">Recreation</title>, March
1912, pp. 132-133; "How Fast Can a Duck Fly?," <title render="italic">Outing</title>,
September 1913, pp. 748-753; "Calling California Ducks," <title render="italic">Outing</title>, November 1913, pp. 139-145; "Geese and More Geese," Field and Stream,
December 1913, pp. 814-820; and "Do Birds Return to Their Own Nests?," <title render="italic">Outdoor World &amp; Recreation</title>, July 1914, pp. 19-20. </event>
<event>WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY. Holland's publications were commonly run with photographs he
snapped and developed. Perhaps his first published photograph was of a beehive in Atchison
which appeared over the caption, "A Boy Whom Bees Do Not Sting," in <title render="italic">Leslie's Weekly</title>, September 24, 1913. As Holland's views about the place of hunting
matured and his belief in conservation ripened he spoke out in favor of the camera instead of
the gun for out-of-season pleasure, urging "all you old duck-hunters try my way of spring
shooting." He went on: "And when you get the same old restlessness in the spring, when the
ducks and geese start north, you can go and hunt as long as you please. There is no limit. I
have shot thousands and thousands and thousands in a day, and my conscience never hurt me one
whit. Then, again, you can always take these pictures out and hunt these same hunts over and
over again. If you are the least bit inclined to play with a kodak try this duck game some
day and you will undoubtedly get the fever." [Holland, "The Gun for Spring Shooting," <title render="italic">Outdoor World &amp; Recreation</title>, July 1913, p. 33. For a
remarkable photograph of a duck blind, the original of which is in container 13, see Holland,

<event>LOBBYIST FOR NATIONAL LIMIT ON SPRING SHOOTING. Through wide reading and observation,
Holland became an advocate of the Weeks-McLean bill which passed Congress as the Migratory
Bird Protection Act of March 3, 1913 [37 Stat. 847]. He and Gene Howe, son of Ed Howe who was
editor of the <title render="italic">Atchison Globe</title>, "decided to join the anti-spring
shooting crowd" in seeking appropriations to enforce the new law. They sent numerous telegrams
to Congressmen in Washington to this end. [Holland, "It Was Mostly Luck," container 10, p.
xiii-3.] </event>

<eventgrp>
<event>UNITED STATES GAME WARDEN. Having taken a civil service examination at Leavenworth, in
August 1914, Holland was appointed District Inspector and United States Game Warden in the
Biological Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture with the specific duty of enforcing
the new Migratory Bird Protection Act in seven midwestern states. He continued to live in
Atchison, Kansas and was regarded by some hunters in other states not to have jurisdiction
over them. He took both an educational approach and an enforcement approach to the law. Thus
he arranged to speak to groups of hunters in duck clubs throughout the region to persuade
them that limits were needed on shooting to preserve waterfowl and that bag limits and
seasonal limits would be effective to protect their interests as sportsmen. Holland's
interest was to stop the "game hogs" and the market hunters who were depleting the supply of
game by wholesale slaughter. </event>
<event>UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MIGRATORY BIRD PROTECTION ACT OF 1913. Opponents of the new
act stood on the ground of state's rights, arguing that the commerce clause of the United
States Constitution was not a valid basis for national regulation of waterfowl shooting. The
opposition tested the act successfully by finding a judge in Jonesboro, Arkansas who held the
Federal law unconstitutional. [United States v. Shauver, 214 Fed. 154 (1914).] Warden Holland
hoped to counter this by bringing a test case of his own in that he hoped would be the more
hospitable United States Court in Kansas City, Kansas but this, too, failed. [United States
v. McCullagh, 221 Fed. 288 (1915).] Holland continued in his position while sportsmen,
conservationists and the lawyers considered in Washington what course to take.</event>
<event>CANADA-UNITED STATES MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY. Many favorable to the 1913 act feared that
it had an insufficient constitutional basis at the time and urged that authority for national
regulation be based on the treaty power. One of these was Elihu Root who made the argument as
early as 1913. The idea was in the air from then on and was fed by the judicial set backs in
the Midwest. It was decided to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain to protect migratory
birds in both Canada and the United States. At the same time the appeal of the Shauver and
McCullagh cases was delayed and then abandoned by the Department of Justice; the Supreme
Court never revisited those rulings. A treaty was signed and promulgated in 1916.</event>
<event>MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. The bilateral treaty between Canada and the United States
was implemented to provide penalties for violations and appropriations for enforcement by the

<event>MISSOURI V. HOLLAND. In the spring of 1919. United States Game Warden Ray P. Holland
made arrests for shooting ducks out of season, arrests that led directly to testing the
constitutional reach of the treaty power as a basis for protecting migratory birds. Those
arrested at a club near Neosho, Missouri were two bankers and an insurance executive from
Kansas City, the Democratic committeeman from Missouri and the attorney general of the State
of Missouri. Frank W. McAllister. Immediately upon arraignment before the U.S. Commissioner in
Clinton, Missouri, the local sheriff, under the direction of McAllister, turned the tables and
had Holland arrested for having wild ducks in his possession without a Missouri hunting
license. This charge was dropped but soon the State of Missouri brought suit in the Federal
district court at Kansas City, claiming that Holland had acted unconstitutionally in enforcing
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Act was upheld in this case in June, 1919 and Missouri
appealed to the United States Supreme Court. On April 19, 1920 the Court ruled, in an opinion
by Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., that the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916 and the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 were constitutional. As constitutional doctrine, the
importance of this case has rested on its broad reading of the treaty power as against the
claim of a state. But this case of Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 (1920), is also
significant in conservation law, as can be seen in the following passage from the opinion by
Holmes: "To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean against a slender reed. Wild
birds are not in the possession of anyone; and possession is the beginning of ownership. The
whole foundation of the states' rights is the presence within their jurisdiction of birds that
yesterday had not arrived, tomorrow may be in another state and in a week a thousand miles
away." </event>

<event>AMERICAN GAME PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION. Holland's writing, which he had continued while a
U.S. Game Warden in the Midwest --chiefly under the nom de plume of "Bob White" --and now his
prominence in the test case of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, led one of the leading
sportsmen's advocates of the day, John E. Burnham, to invite him to New York City to edit the
<title render="italic">Bulletin of the American Game Protective Association</title>. Holland
moved his family East, briefly to White Plains and then to Scarsdale, to accept this
position. His office was on the 22nd floor of the Woolworth Building and his duties were to
edit the monthly <title render="italic">Bulletin </title>as well as to prepare a special
newsletter of the Association that several prominently known outdoor magazines published in
their columns. Founded in 1911, the full name of the organization was the American Game
Protective and Propagation Association. Support was plentiful, coming on the one hand from
arms and ammunition makers who were "farsighted" and, on the other, from men of means
interested in game refuges and in sport. </event>
<event>Holland's views and those of others in the American Game Protective Association were in
harmony. "The basic idea of this organization is 'Sport for Sport's Sake.' We want to
increase game by setting aside sanctuaries where game birds may breed undisturbed at all
times, through the establishment of state game farms by means of which public covers may be
stocked." [<title render="italic">Bulletin of the American Game Protective
Association</title>, January 1919, p. 12.] Every new member was sent a copy of "The American
Sportsman's Creed" composed by Zane Grey (1875-1939) and first published in 1918, a statement
that pledged prudence and fair play in hunting, scientific study, and game preservation.

<event>GAME REFUGES, PUBLIC SHOOTING GROUNDS, AND A FEDERAL DUCK STAMP. The gnarled story of
the origins of the Federal Duck Stamp to support game refuges is difficult to spell out, but,
while Holland's importance is often not credited in published accounts, it is clear that his
role was significant.</event>

<event>Holland published the first known statement of the idea of a duck stamp in the <title render="italic">Bulletin </title>he edited, thus spreading the notion that a migratory bird
protective fund be created by imposing a Federal hunting license upon those wishing to hunt
migratory fowl. This is a part of the idea, as originally set forth: "During the war the
government established a method of issuing war savings stamps through the post offices of the
country, and this agency for distribution was very successful in reaching those who were
desirous of buying the stamps. The same machinery can be used for selling hunting licenses,
the licenses being evidenced by a stamp to be affixed to the applicant's state hunting
license and cancelled." [A. S. Houghton, "A Federal Hunting License," <title render="italic">Bulletin</title>, April 1920, p. 15.] This was advanced in detail by Holland in the July
1920 issue of <title render="italic">Field and Stream</title>. There would be a 50 cent duck
stamp issued annually by the Department of Agriculture, the revenue from which would be for
the special purpose of acquiring, developing and maintaining Federal waterfowl refuges. This
idea originated with three people: George Lawyer, Chief Harden under the Biological Survey,
John Burnham and Holland. </event>

<event>For several years beginning around 1922, Holland was joined by Dr. Edward H. Nelson of
the Biological Survey as the chief advocates of a program that combined refuge maintenance
with hunting, all financed by a Federal licensing stamp. Opposition emerged among sportsmen
and conservationists, in part perhaps because of the plain-spoken name given to the bill in
Congress where the Nelson-Holland proposal was officially styled as "The Public Shooting
Grounds Bill." A friend of the measure has described the controversy in the 1920s as follows:
"Strong opposition was led by Dr. [William T.] Hornaday and was initially supported by <title render="italic">Outdoor Life</title>, the infant Izaac Walton League, the Camp-Fire Club,
Aldo Leopold, Fiorello La Guardia, and others who feared the refuges would turn into
federally maintained shooting preserves which would produce no surplus of birds. Advocates of
the Nelson-Holland proposal included the Boone and Crockett Club and the National Association
of Audubon Societies. Dr. Nelson maintained that because of food scarcity on the wintering
grounds, a great increase in the waterfowl population was not then desirable, and that the
birds would benefit most from state-regulated shooting combined with federally regulated game
management on refuges. He was seconded in an Audubon bulletin by Charles Sheldon, who was
also an influential member of the Boone and Crockett Club. Though the bill was defeated, the
Camp-Fire Club, the Izaac Walton League, and <title render="italic">Outdoor Life</title>
eventually saw the light of reason--in the form of sport-supported refuges which eventually
materialized in the acquisition program authorized by the 1929 Migratory Bird Conservation
Act." [Robert Elman, <title render="italic">The Atlantic Flyway </title>(New York:
Winchester' Press, 1972), pp. 170-171. Also, see Migratory Bird Conservation Act, Feb. 18,
1929, 45 Stat. 1222, 16 U.S.C. sec. 715.]</event>

<event>While the 1929 Act authorized land purchases and the Bureau of Biological Survey
surveyed for places suitable for waterfowl and for purchase, appropriations were insufficient
to go far. The drought of the early 1930s reduced breeding grounds for ducks while the kill
by man rose sharply. This disastrous trend was reversed with enactment of the Migratory Bird
Hunting Stamp Act of 1934. Popularly known as the Duck Stamp Act, this led Henry Wallace,
Secretary of Agriculture, to name Jay N. "Ding" Darling to be Chief of a reorganized Bureau
of Biological Survey which included a new Refuge Division. Labor from the WPA and CCC, along
with "creation and sale of duck stamps-which by 1970 had realized over 175 million dollars
for migratory waterfowl refuges--was an important part of their plan." [Jene C. Gilmore,
<title render="italic">Art for conservation: The Federal Duck Stamps</title> (Barre, Mass.:
Barre Publishers, 1971), p. 15. Also, see the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, March 16,
1934, 48 Stat. 451, 16 U. S. C. sec. 718.] The first stamp, for 1934-1935, was designed by
Darling, and sold for $1.00 beginning August 14, 1934. Ray Holland and the other originators
of the duck stamp idea are not mentioned in the book on the subject, cited above. </event>

editorship, "<title render="italic">Field &amp; Stream</title> published the works of some
of the best writers and artists of the era--John Taintor Foote, Irvin S. Cobb, Havilah
Babcock, David M. Hewell, Clarke Venable, Harold Titus, Archibald Rutledge, Ray Mullholland,

position to work for waterfowl and other national legislation described above. But Holland and
his audience of sportsmen also opposed gun control of every sort, perhaps most notably in the
form of criticism in the late 1930s of the Sullivan Law in New York State that required
registration of handguns. </event>

<event>ACTIVITIES IN LATER YEARS. Holland continued to combine much outdoor life with further
free-lance writing. He had hunted for 14 consecutive years in Saskatchewan. Now he began
spending winters in Naples, Florida and, after the war, for ten years spent up to three
months each winter in Cuba. In the late 1940s he moved to Quechee, Vermont for the summer
months. When Castro came to power in Cuba, Holland spent the winter months in Roswell, New
Mexico. In addition to the many books listed in the bibliography at page 10 of this register,
he wrote articles and stories for many magazines in the postwar period, <title render="italic">The Saturday Evening Post</title>, <title render="italic">Liberty</title>,
<title render="italic">Collier's</title>, <title render="italic">Nation's Business</title>,
<title render="italic">True,</title> and <title render="italic">American Legion</title>
among them. His last published story was "Desert Tragedy," <title render="italic">Field
&amp; Stream</title>, September 1966.</event>

<event>Not politically active apart from conservation issues, Holland did question the growth
of national power during his later years. He approved of the effort, manifested by the
so-called "Bricker Amendment," aimed at reducing the President's authority to make Executive
Agreements and at limiting the treaty power's effect on domestic matters. The rule of
Missouri v. Holland was a target and he joined in aiming at it. Holland's sentiments were
conveyed to a national columnist who described them well. [See Raymond Moley, "Perspective:
Behind Holland v. Missouri [sic]," <title render="italic">Newsweek</title>, October 19, 1953.

<event>The American Game Protection Association had been in virtual hibernation after 1924,
and Holland and a group of others revived the organization in 1958. He became President, and
the Association endowed and established many game refuges in midwestern states during the
next decade. Finally a merger was decided upon and Holland retired from this activity upon
the formation of the consolidated organization known as the "New York Conservation Council
and the American Game Association Foundation, Inc." in 1969. </event>

<event>Mr. Levy helped draft legislation and arranged hearings on several subjects which
Congress did not approve but which have had enduring importance. </event>
<event>ANTI-LYNCHING BILL, 1938. Civil rights was one of Mr. Levy's major interests, expressed
notably as one of the draftsmen of the Wagner-Van Nuys anti-lynching bill, an amendment to
H.R. 1507, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. The bill made lynching a federal crime, would prosecute
negligent law enforcement officials, and would fine the county within which the lynching took
place. The Senate voted on February 21, 1938, to table the bill, following eight weeks of
filibuster by the bill's opponents, including several Southern Democratic Senators and
Senator William Borah, Republican of Idaho. Failure of President Roosevelt to take a strong
stand in favor of the bill hindered its chances for passage. [For the civil rights context

<event>WAGNER-ROGERS BILL FOR CHILD REFUGEES FROM NAZI GERMANY, 1939. Passionately concerned
with the harsh policies of Nazi Germany, Mr. Levy helped draft the Wagner-Rogers Bill, S.J.
Res. 64, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1278 (1939). An attempt to liberalize the Immigration Act
of 1924, the bill allowed for the entrance of twenty thousand German refugees ages fourteen
and under, during a two-year period. These refugees would not be counted against the national
quota for Germany. Patriotic orders, such as the American Legion, opposed the measure,
claiming it would "deprive American children." Once again the President failed to give the
bill his strong support, and on June 30, 1939, the Senate Immigration Committee barely passed
a hopelessly emasculated bill that would not allow the refugee youths to be counted
independently of the national origins quota for Germany. [For details, see David S. Wyman,
<title render="italic">Paper Walls: America and the Refugee Crisis</title> 1938-1941

Random House, 1967).] </event>
<event>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. The Medicare programs developed as law in the 1960s were
anticipated by the pioneer health bills developed in part by Mr. Levy and championed by
Senator Robert F. Wagner in the 1930s. President Roosevelt never recommended a national
health insurance program and the Social Security Act became law August 14, 1935 without it.
In 1943 the first "Wagner-Murray-Dingell" bill (S. 1161, H.R. 2861, 78th Cong., 1st Sess.)
was introduced. This measure included a compulsory national health-insurance system for
persons of all ages, to be financed through a payroll tax. The bill died in 1944 at the end
of the 78th Congress. Mr. Levy cherished his legislative work on this idea as the most
important in his career. [For a full account of this episode, see Daniel S. Hirshfield,

United States from 1932 to 1943</title> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1970).]

<event>WASHINGTON LAWYER. From 1947 onward Mr. Levy was in private law practice in Washington,
D. C., in partnership with Charles Fahy. Mr. Fahy left the firm in 1952 upon his appointment
as Circuit Judge in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by President Truman.
Sharing a suite with Fahy and Levy were Rufus Poole and Milton Denbo, John A. Danaher and
Barrett Quirk. This loose-knit firm existed for about six years. From 1953 to 1970 Mr. Levy
was a self-employed lawyer in private practice in Washington. [For a broad discussion of this
topic, not connected specifically to Mr. Levy's work at all, see Charles Horsky, <title render="italic">The Washington Lawyer </title>(Boston: Little, Brown and Co.,

<event>PALESTINE. Senator Wagner was vitally interested in the plight of the Jews and in
Palestine, and Mr. Levy was his close advisor. Their tireless effort to save lives of Jews in
Nazi Germany before and during the Second World War was followed by an active concern for
refugees and the establishment of a Jewish state afterwards. Mr. Levy prepared a number of
Senator Wagner's speeches on these subjects. In law practice, Charles Fahy and Philip Levy
together represented the government of the then Palestine a short time before the declaration
of the State of Israel. On May 14, 1948 the State of Israel was proclaimed at Tel-Aviv. On
the same day it received de facto recognition from the United States through the action of
President Truman. After that time, Mr. Levy had no formal or professional ties, other than
that of the concerned citizen. </event>

<event>FOREIGN CLAIMS WORK. Philip Levy's activities before the Foreign Claims Settlement
Commission of the United States are widely regarded as significant and beneficial both for
the clients whom he represented and for the Commission itself. He was counsel in almost all
the programs of the Commission, commencing in 1949 with the first claims program against the
Government of Yugoslavia. Exacting, precedent making work was done by Mr. Levy alone, and
claims work occupied most of the last two decades of his life and represented his flowering
as a mature legal thinker. </event>
<event>Two acts of Congress, the War Claims Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1240) and the International
Claims Settlement Act of 1949, was amended (64 Stat. 12) and Reorganization Plan 1 of 1954
(68 Stat. 1279) form the basis of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United
States. This three-member Commission has jurisdiction to determine claims of United States
nationals against foreign governments for compensation for losses and injuries sustained by
them. Available funds have their sources in international settlements, liquidation of foreign
assets in this country by the Departments of Justice or the Treasury, and from public funds
when provided by Congress. These programs were conducted from 1949 to 1954 by the
International Claims Commission and since 1954 by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. </event>
<event>Mr. Levy's claims work has been praised by Mr. Svonko Rode, senior review attorney at
the Claims Commission, in these words: "In claims programs, such as against the Governments
of Bulgaria, Rumania, Italy, Hungary, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Cuba, and
in the war damage program which encompassed war losses sustained by American companies and
individuals in Albania, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland and Yugoslavia, Philip Levy was representing substantial claims of American
industrial enterprises. His views and opinions on numerous questions in the field of
international law were always held in high regard, and in many instances influenced the final
determination made by the Commission. He was also known as a very precise and accurate
worker, giving a high degree of attention to minute details in the preparation of his
statements. briefs and arguments that he used to deliver before the Commission. In the field
of international claims the late Philip Levy was one of the leaders in the professional
community, and among the representatives appearing before the Foreign Claims Settlement
Commission, his name will always be associated with the most outstanding attorneys who
entered their appearance before that agency." [Statement of Svonko Rode, Esq., March, 1971.]

<p>James Oliver Longstreet was born November 16, 1833, in Onondaga, New York. His
parents owned and operated a farm in Onondaga. He received a BA from Wesleyan in
1857. As a student at Wesleyan, he was a member of the Mystical Seven secret society
and the Missionary Lyceum. Starting in 1856, he served as president of the
Missionary Lyceum and as president of the senior class. Longstreet was politically
active while at Wesleyan, campaigning for John C. Fremont during the 1856
presidential campaign. He was a member of the Republican Party, and active in their
group on campus. Longstreet was vocal about his abolitionist views, and expressed
pleasure in reading the writings of Frederick Douglas. During the summers and
winters he taught school in various locations, especially in North Guilford and
North Branford (both in Connecticut). After graduating from Wesleyan, Longstreet
taught in Croton Falls, NY, from 1857 to 1858. From 1858-1860, he attended the
Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, NY, receiving the degree of
Masters of Arts. He married Josephine Christopher of Croton Falls, NY, on July 7,
1859. In 1860, he joined the Troy Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He
was a preacher at Hyde Park, Vermont, from 1860 until his death in 1861.</p>

<p>William Phoebus Lyon was born on January 25, 1813 at No. 5 Bayard Street in New York City. From 1819 to 1822 he lived with his father on a farm two miles from Ithaca, New York. In 1822 he returned to New York City for two years only to move to another farm in Haverstraw, New York in 1824. After two years on the farm, his family returned once again to New York City where after a year Lyon became a clerk in a dry goods store working for his uncle Edward Lyon. From October 1828 to February 1829, he studied at a New York high school, after which he became a teacher in the New York schools from February 1829 to May 1832. After studying law in New York from May 1835 to June 1837, Lyon pursued and was unsuccessful in business enterprises in Chicago; Haverstraw, New York; and New York City. On April 15, 1834, Lyon married Harriet Wood and on May 29, 1835, the couple had a son, William Roscoe. </p>

<p>William P. Lyon is most noteworthy as the founder and senior principal of the Irving Institute, located in North Tarrytown, New York. In 1837, William and his brother Charles Lyon founded the private boarding school for boys in North Tarrytown, later renamed Sleepy Hollow. William P. Lyon was the editor and publisher of the <title render="italic">Pocantico Gazette</title>, later known as the <title render="italic">Irving Banner</title>, one of the first newspapers in Tarrytown, New York. On August 5, 1840, Wesleyan University bestowed upon him the honorary degree of A.M. through the influence of Wesleyan President Nathan Bangs. In the summer of 1841, Lyon took a trip to Wesleyan University in order to review the examinations of the student body. He was also a prominent member of the New York Conference of the Methodist Church. William P. Lyon died August 10, 1884.</p>

David Park McAllester was born in 1916, the youngest of four children. He grew up in Everett, Massachusetts, where he often accompanied his mother on natural history walks as she collected material for her weekly column in the <title render="italic">Boston Sunday Herald</title>. Professor McAllester traces his ultimate career as a specialist in Native American culture to an early exposure to reading animal tracks in the snow as well as to the literature of Ernest Thompson Seton, Bret Harte, James Fenimore Cooper and Henry David Thoreau. He was also musical; he sang as a boy soprano beginning around the age of eight and attended private voice lessons with the original intention of becoming a professional singer.</p>
<p>David McAllester attended Harvard University, entering in 1934 and graduating in 1938. There he continued his dual interests in anthropology and music. He took classes in southwestern ethnology and linguistics with Clyde Kluckhohn and sang as a soloist with the Harvard Glee Club. Music led him to his future wife, Susan Watkins, during a joint performance with the Radcliffe Choral Society. After graduating from Harvard, he started at Juilliard; however, he continued to do field work during the summers at an archaeological dig at the Lindenmeier site in Colorado, an activity he had started while at Harvard. He also started taking classes at Columbia University, notably George Herzog's "Primitive Music" class. By the spring of 1940 he had made the decision not to pursue music as a career and had started in the PhD program in anthropology at Columbia with a focus on American Indian music. In the summer of 1940 he joined a linguistic field study of the Comanche in Oklahoma where he did research on peyote songs and rituals. With the war looming, he and Susan were married in September 1940. He spent academic year 1940-1941 at Columbia where he met such luminaries as Franz Boaz and Margaret Mead.</p>

<p>Although not raised in the Quaker tradition, David McAllester had deeply felt pacifist beliefs and joined the 15th Street Meeting of the Society of Friends while living in New York City. With the entry of the United States into World War II he filed for, and was granted, conscientious objector status. He spent the next two years working with the Civilian Public Service (CPS) in a forestry camp in Cooperstown, NY, and the following two years working with the CPS at the Connecticut State Hospital in Middletown, CT.</p>

<p>When the war ended in 1945 he returned to Columbia where he began work on his dissertation on peyote songs. He had a part-time job in the Archive of Primitive Music there and supplemented this with adjunct teaching at Brooklyn College. He was awarded his PhD from Columbia University in 1950. In 1947 he was invited to join the faculty at Wesleyan University where he remained until his retirement in 1986.</p>

<p>Professor McAllester has been active in the development of the field of Ethnomusicology. When he first came to Wesleyan he had a joint appointment in Psychology and Biology. In 1952, at the American Anthropological Association meeting in Philadelphia, he was introduced to Alan Merriam by Willard Rhodes of Columbia University. These three joined forces with Charles Seeger to create a newsletter focused on ethnomusicology, first published in December 1953. The four men founded the Society for Ethnomusicology in 1955. David McAllester broadened the music curriculum at Wesleyan to include non-European music in 1956 with his course Music 31, Ethnic and Folk Music. The World Music Archives at Wesleyan University developed out of the field recordings of Native American ceremonies that he made in the 1940s and '50s, and it was partly his influence that led to the establishment of the department of Anthropology at Wesleyan in 1967. He was appointed professor of Anthropology and Music in 1972.</p>

<p>Professor McAllester traveled extensively during the course of his professional career. He received a Guggenheim grant in 1957 and spent a year in Arizona studying the Navajo Blessingway ritual. In 1960 he was Carnegie visiting professor at the University of Hawaii. In 1972 he spent a sabbatical visiting Japan, Indonesia, India and Finland. In 1978 he taught as a visiting scholar at the University of Queensland, Australia, as a recipient of the Fulbright-Hays Award. His recordings of Comanche and Navajo music led to the establishment of the World Music Archives at Wesleyan University in 1953. This has grown extensively since then with contributions by Professor McAllester and his colleagues.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1979, Professor McAllester taught one full semester per year at Wesleyan, spending the remaining eight months at his home in the Berkshires. He retired fully in 1986. Since then he has continued to be involved in the Society for Ethnomusicology, writing professional book reviews, and has been very involved in his local newspaper.

<p>William Edward Mead was born on October 25, 1860 in Gallupville, New York. His father, Merritt B. Mead was a Methodist minister. He attended Wesleyan and graduated with the Class of 1881 with special honors in English literature. He stayed at Wesleyan as a graduate student and assistant librarian until 1882 when he became the associate principal of Ansonia high school in Ansonia, Connecticut. In 1884, he returned to Wesleyan as assistant in rhetoric and also teaching history at the Normal School in New Britain. The following year, Mead became principal of a high school in Troy, New York. He went abroad to study for the next five years in Germany, Paris, and London. While abroad, he became acquainted with Kate Hurd who was traveling for pleasure. Mead returned to Wesleyan in 1890 as Associate Professor of English, became full professor in 1893, and emeritus in 1925. A listing of many of Mead’s many publications can be found by searching the Wesleyan Library Catalog and the separate card files of faculty and alumni publications in Special Collections and Archives.</p>



<p>Kate Campbell Hurd was the daughter of Dr. Hurd of Newburyport, Massachusetts. She was born on April 6, 1867 in Danville, Quebec, Canada, and graduated from the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1888. She continued her medical studies at New England Hospital in Boston and at various universities in Europe and the Johns Hopkins Medical School. From 1890-93, she was medical director at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore.</p>



<p>William Mead married Kate Hurd on June 23, 1893. After their wedding, they went on a trip to Norway and Europe. They took up residence in Middletown and stayed until 1929 when they moved to Sunnymede, a house overlooking the Connecticut River, in Haddam. A photograph of the house appears in the 1932 correspondence folder (Series II, Box 9, folder 49). The Meads traveled extensively throughout the world, especially after Professor Mead’s retirement from Wesleyan in 1925. </p>



<p>Kate Hurd Mead died at her home of a heart attack while assisting a groundskeeper who had collapsed while fighting a brush fire on the Mead estate. At the time of her death on January 1, 1941, at age 73, Kate was a widely known medical author and practicing physician. She was the first woman doctor in Middletown. She had published A History of Women in Medicine, covering ancient times through the 18th century. A second volume was at the printers, and a third volume was almost finished.</p>



<p>Professor Mead died on July 12, 1949 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown. He was 88. The Meads had no children.</p>

<p>During the years 1968 and 1969, military recruitment on the Wesleyan University campus became a heated issue. In February of 1969, Navy recruiter Lieutenant Kehoe came to campus to conduct interviews with students in North College. Approximately 30 Wesleyan students and 3 faculty members crammed the room, making the proceedings impossible, while about 100 more students gathered outside to protest the military presence on campus. In order to deal with the crisis, the University, under the presidency of Edwin Etherington, created a referendum amongst the student body through the College Body Committee, which was followed by a faculty vote. By November 1969 they had arrived at a new policy. Etherington resigned shortly thereafter and was succeeded by Colin Campbell. The full-time position of an Advisor on Military Programs was created and Philip Rockwell took the job. Meetings with military representatives would from then on take place based solely on student request and were to be organized by Philip Rockwell. All interviews, examinations, and tests for military entrance would be done off campus at the appropriate location. </p>
<p>In December 1970, Colonel Kerrigan of the US Marine Corps informed Wesleyan that, due to his interpretation of the University's policy, the Secretary of Defense was advised that Wesleyan was barring military personnel from campus because of the requirement for a student request for a Marine officer visit. The justification for this was, according to Kerrigan, the NASA Act and the Armed Forces Appropriation Act. The University, in its response, was able to clarify its policy and successfully dispute the accusation. Simultaneously, Professor of Philosophy Paul Reynolds was a member for the anti-war Union for Progressive Action, and actively protested recruitment on campus. In numerous documents, he objected to what he called the University sanctioning <emph render="doublequote">executive sessions of classified government personnel</emph> with members of the community. He maintained that a member of the government under <emph render="doublequote">security clearance</emph> has no claim to academic rights, and therefore executive sessions being held on campus threatened the academic climate of the University, and legally required a warrant to be held on public premises or at the University. He also objected to the Office of Career Planning helping to recruit students for espionage in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or National Security Agency (NSA). According to documents from the University administration, there were not any executive sessions or espionage recruitment. When the draft and the Vietnam War ended in 1973, much of the conflict on campus seems to have died down. </p>

<p>The Middletown Scientific Association was founded on March 17, 1871 by Wesleyan University faculty and residents of Middletown, Connecticut. Its purpose was to encourage scientific investigation and curiosity among members and to receive papers from members and other scientists regarding popular topics in all fields of science, history of science, and education of science. The association was one of the very first <emph render="doublequote">town and gown</emph> organizations at Wesleyan University. Founding members included John Johnston, E. P.

Members of the association, in addition to Wesleyan faculty, included physicians, ministers, and teachers. Women were admitted into membership beginning in 1880.</p><p>Regular meetings were often held in the Hall Laboratory of Chemistry, Scott Laboratory of Physics, and Shanklin Laboratory of Biology at Wesleyan University. Occasional field meetings were held, during which members would learn first-hand about botany, geology, and other topics of natural history. Early in the association's history, papers were given at regular meetings on a variety of scientific topics in all fields, usually by members of the association, and occasionally by outside scientific experts. As membership grew, lecturers were more frequently invited from abroad to speak to the association.</p><p>The Middletown Scientific Association disbanded in 1968, after attendance at regular meetings was limited to those members who had been invited to dinner to meet with the lecturer. Though membership numbers and satisfaction with the organization remained high, there appeared to be a consensus among members that individuals were <emph render="doublequote">too busy</emph> to attend. The final meeting was held on April 8, 1968.</p>

<p>In the first constitution, adopted October 27, 1834, the name of the organization was announced: <emph render="doublequote">This society shall be called the Missionary Lyceum of the Wesleyan University.</emph> In the minutes which were kept of the meetings, various recording secretaries referred to <emph render="doublequote">Missionary Lyceum,</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Lyceum,</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Society,</emph> or <emph render="doublequote">Missionary Society.</emph> However, the minutes of the September 6, 1845 meeting begin: <emph render="doublequote">A special meeting of the M &amp; T [Missionary &amp; Theological] Lyceum was convened . . . .</emph> It was referred to as the Theological and Missionary Lyceum in minutes for every meeting thereafter. A revised constitution and <emph render="doublequote">bye-laws</emph> were discussed also, and while no revised constitution for 1845 is recorded, Article I of the May 1, 1848 revised constitution states: <emph render="doublequote">This society shall be styled the Theological and Missionary Lyceum of the Wesleyan University.</emph></p>

<p>A previous missionary society, which Price refers to as being <emph render="doublequote">literary in character,</emph> was begun at Wesleyan on November 21, 1831, but folded the following spring. It appears, however, that the members of the Missionary Lyceum were also conscious of the necessity of a strong background in writings pertaining to theology and missionary work. Daniel P. Kidder, first corresponding secretary of the Lyceum, wrote to the Rev. R. Spaulding on November 6, 1834, announcing the formation of the Lyceum and explaining its goals:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">That . . . which at present seems most favorable for awakening Christian sympathy and calling forth benevolent action is the collection and communication of <emph render="underline">facts</emph>, illustrative of those whom we commiserate. This will chiefly be done through the medium of domestic and foreign correspondence and the embodying and condensing of intelligence as may reach us through the press.</emph></p>

<p>In a letter from Dr. Fisk (June 8, 1837) to the Lyceum, he advocated the enlargement of their museum and the beginnings of a library of missionary literature:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">[Another] process of exciting the missionary spirit and aiding the missionary cause, through your society, is that of collecting a library, that shall have a direct relation to the missionary work. Although your library is still small yet it is a number around which future accumulations will I trust be collected, until the <emph render="underline">Missionary Library of the Wesleyan University</emph> shall contain all that is important to the missionary student . . .you have from the Wesleyan Missionary Society, in London, their Reports and missionary notices, from the Commencement of that very efficient missionary Institution, an Institution which for its activity &amp; vigor and the extent of its beneficial results &amp; direct &amp; collateral influences, is second to no other Mis. Society in the Christian Church - you have also from that unrivaled Institution, the <title render="doublequote">British &amp; Foreign Bible Society</title> 124 vols. Embracing the different versions of the bible and parts of the Bible in 81 different Languages and Dialects, all of the first workmanship, literary and mechanical.</emph> </p>

<p>Correspondence was an important function of the Lyceum. Letters were received from and written to missionaries all over the world; ministers and members of other missionary societies also wrote to Wesleyan to acknowledge honorary memberships, and a student at Iowa Wesleyan University asked how to set up a missionary society similar to the Lyceum.</p>

<p>The corresponce of the Lyceum traces the origins of its missionary museum, later part of the Wesleyan Museum. Corresponding secretary, Daniel P. Kidder, wrote to the Reverend Mr. Spaulding on November 6, 1834, requesting his <emph render="doublequote">African curiosities</emph> to be housed with the society as the beginning of a museum. In 1835, Kidder sent a form letter to several missionaries, requesting information about their activities and artifacts for the museum. In 1840, Joyn Seys wrote from Monrovia (Liberia) that he had sent the Lyceum</p>

<p><emph render="italic">. . . a box of shells, &amp;c, which I beg the gentlemen of the Lyceum to accept of, and to place, if they consider them of sufficient value, among the other curiosities of their cabinet.</emph></p>

<p>Dr. Fisk also wrote the Lyceum:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">This society will aid the [missionary cause] . . . by . . . its Missionary Cabinet or Museum. In this you have already a good beginning; but we hope that the members of the society, both the graduates and undergraduates, will exert themselves to enlarge this museum.</emph></p>

<p>Dr. Fisk was most influential in the dealings of the Lyceum and remained devoted to its objects until his death in l839.</p>

<p>The Lyceum's correspondence was varied. James Fulton of Shelbyville, Kentucky wrote six letters in 1835, one of which described what he had learned about methods of Chinese printing. Jonas King wrote from Constantinople on March 18, 1836, detailing his duties there and the hardships of life as a missionary. From his mission post in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, Daniel P. Kidder wrote in February, 1836, that Roman Catholicism seemed distressingly prevalent there, but that he was optimistic of converting people. Former Lyceum member, H.A. Wilson wrote from Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1841, conveying some frustration with his teaching duties in the mission there:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">The school includes both sexes and hitherto have been accomodated in the same room. I had much rather have a school of one hundred in any part of New England than one of 50 in [Buenos Aires]. They are the mostungovernable set of children that I ever saw . . . When they are out of school . . . they run wild and require to be sassed in order to tame them down and ring them under any kind of discipline. School keeping here is truly a work of patience.</emph></p>

<p>The Lyceum took an innovative step in 1848 by according honorary membership to a woman. Adelaide Fitzgerald of Middletown wrote on July 22 to acknowledge the honor and to thank the members of the Lyceum.</p>

<p>Although the Lyceum at times could boast of more than forty active members, its appeal declined somewhat in the 1850s. The led to an <emph render="doublequote">advertisement</emph> to members in the records book in 1858, proposing a new constitution, new amendments, by-laws and amendments to by-laws, in order to <emph render="doublequote">rejuvinate</emph> the almost inactive society. The last recorded minutes were for January 1871, and the last students to sign the roster were members of the class of 1873. The custom of annual commencement sermons delivered before the Lyceum continued until 1878, however.</p>

<p>In spring 1974, Professor Stephen Dyson of the Classics Department took his Introduction to Archaeology Class on a preliminary excavation in Lyman Orchards in Middlefield, Connecticut. This was a test to see if there was potential for an archaeology class based on fieldwork. The excavation was successful and archaeology classes continued to visit sites in Connecticut, particularly within Middlesex County.</p>

<p>The first time Wesleyan did a European excavation was in 1969 when it joined with Brown University in Buccino, Italy to excavate Roman villas. Later, in 1974, Dyson took a group of students to the town of Cosa, Italy for a dig. In 1982, Professor Stephen White of history and medieval studies and Clark Maines of art history coordinated with Dyson to take a Wesleyan crew to Soissons in France to study the Augustinian abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes. These trips occurred during the summer and often times they would return for several consecutive summers.</p>

<p>As of 2008, the archaeology program continues conduct excavation labs within Middlesex county. </p>

Lynn Smith Miller entered Wesleyan in the Fall of 1910 and graduated with the Class of 1914. At the time of his matriculation, his Freshman class was the largest in Wesleyan's history—a total of 121 students. While at Wesleyan, Miller was a member of Delta Upsilon (the Omega Phi chapter at Wesleyan). He graduated with a B.A. </p>
<p>
Lynn Smith Miller was born on November 29, 1891 in Oneonta, New York to Merritt James Miller and Rita Louise Smith Miller. His older brother, Floyd Josiah Miller, also attended Wesleyan and graduated with the Class of 1907 with a B.A. in the Classics (Latin and Greek). Lynn Smith Miller was the president of his graduating class from high school—which consisted for six students—and was awarded Second Prize for General Scholarship. Having graduated high school at the age of 14, Miller would wait four years before matriculating to Wesleyan. During Miller's freshman year, he resided in North College (indicated by the abbreviation "N.C." in his diary—included in the collection) with his roommate William Munroe Dox, also of New York. Highlights of Miller's Wesleyan career included recreational basketball, baseball and tennis; attending Vespers and football games; participating in the "cannon scrap," which Miller's class won in their freshman year; and going to movies at the Nickel Theater and plays at the Middlesex Theater both in downtown Middletown. </p>
<p>
After graduating from Wesleyan, Miller and his brother edited and managed the <title render="italic">Spectator</title>, a weekly newspaper serving an area of North Indianapolis, Indiana. Miller then joined the U.S. Army in July 1917 and served in World War I in the infantry. After the war, Lynn Smith Miller teamed up again with his brother Floyd and bought a small weekly newspaper in Royal Oak, Michigan on the outskirts of Detroit. When Detroit grew, so did the newspaper and soon its circulation was up to 60,000. </p>
<p>
Miller was first married to Roxie Andrews on August 31, 1922, but later had the marriage annulled. He then married Marie Hellen Walcott Fritzinger on September 25, 1929 and had three sons with her. His son John W. Miller graduated Wesleyan with the Class of 1953. Lynn S. Miller died on January 26, 1962 in Royal Oak, Michigan.

<p>The Monday Club was founded in 1892 for the wives of faculty, wives of resident trustees, wives of administrative officers, the associate librarian when a woman, and other female relatives living with faculty members. It was intended as an inclusive gathering in which each woman had an opportunity to serve as president. Members sought social and intellectual enjoyment through a variety of activities: reading of papers by members and guests, teas, musical programs, annual theme parties, and original skits. A topic was chosen each year as the intellectual theme for weekly programs during the academic year. The Monday Club served as one of the primary social gatherings for women in the Wesleyan community.</p>

<p>By the late 1960s, eligibility requirements and functions began to change, and membership included a broader group of women, including local professional women. The group stopped meeting in the mid-1990s.

<p>Music has been part of the Wesleyan University experience since the early days of the
institution. Known as a "singing college," Wesleyan inherited a tradition of music
from the hymnody of its Methodist roots (see David B. Potts's <title render="italic">Wesleyan University, 1831-1910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England</title>).
The first music performances at the university were organized by volunteers and
sponsored by groups such as the Middlesex Musical Association. Beginning in the
1840s, glee clubs were created for special occasions, and in 1862 Wesleyan singers
had their first public tour. In 1882 the university hired a professional musician as
glee club coach, and the group gave standing-room-only public appearances, including
an 1888 concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. From the 1880s on,
undergraduate students as well as alumni composed songs; these were collected in the
Wesleyan Song Book, first published in 1901. Weekly sings took place on the chapel
steps beginning in about 1901, and in about 1913 the university began offering a
small stipend to students who participated in the chapel choir.</p>
<p>During the 1920s, the music program at Wesleyan became more formalized. In 1921, the
Music and Dramatics Board was created to supervise musical and dramatic
organizations and arrange concerts and trips. The university also offered its first
course work in music. In the academic year 1925/26, Hugh L. Smith (class of 1915),
an assistant professor in the Department of Romance Languages, offered a course on
the history and appreciation of music. In 1928/29, courses in dramatic music and
harmony were added. Then, in 1929, alumnus John Spencer Camp (class of 1878) donated
a large sum to set up a chair of music at the university. Joseph Stephen Daltry was
appointed to the newly endowed chair, and the Music Department was established. </p>
<p>The music program at Wesleyan continued to expand over the years. By the late 1940s,
two professors--Joseph Daltry and George McManus--were offering about ten courses a
year. In 1949, Richard Winslow (class of 1940) joined the staff. By the mid-1950s,
singers performed not only with the Chapel Choir and Glee Club but also with the
Choral Society, a male quartet called the Jibers, and a group of eight or nine
called the Cardinals. The Wesleyan Band performed at football games and various
campus affairs, and a woodwind and brass ensemble played several recitals a year.
The Music Department, at that time housed in Judd Hall, had several sound-proof
studios and an extensive collection of phonograph records. By the late 1960s,
musical opportunities at the university included private lessons; the Wesleyan
University concert series; the college orchestra, a "town-gown" organization; the
Wesleyan String Quartet; and the Collegium Musicum, which performed medieval and
Renaissance music.</p>
<p>A significant development in the music program that occurred around the middle of the
twentieth century was the introduction of the study of music "as a universal
phenomenon beyond the confines of Western European tradition" (<emph render="italic">Wesleyan University Bulletin</emph>, 1956/57). In 1956/57, associate professor
David McAllester, an anthropologist whose specialty was the culture and music of the
Navajo, first offered Music 31, Ethnic and Folk Music, in addition to the
anthropology courses he taught in the Department of Psychology. In 1961, McAllester
teamed up with Robert E. Brown, a specialist in the music of India, to teach classes
in the university's new World Music Program. McAllester and Richard Winslow proposed
an advanced program of study, and in 1966 the department began offering a doctorate
in ethnomusicology in addition to undergraduate and master's degrees. By the 1970s,
courses taught by resident and visiting members of the department's faculty covered
Western classical, Afro-American, South Indian, North Indian, and Japanese music;
the 1970/71 catalog listed some thirty-two courses and seminars in non-Western
music. Study groups were organized focusing on the music of South India, Japan,
Persia, Korea, and the Javanese gamelan.</p>
<p>In 1973, Wesleyan opened its Center for the Arts, a complex of eleven buildings
housing undergraduate programs in art and art history, dance, theater, and music, as
well as the graduate program in ethnomusicology. The Center comprises classrooms,
galleries, and studios, and its music facilities include a recording studio, a
computer and experimental music studio, Crowell Concert Hall, and World Music Hall. </p>
<p>The Music Department currently provides course work and performing opportunities in
music from around the world. More than sixty courses are offered. A number of
activities--including a variety of chamber ensembles and ensembles in Asian,
African, American, and European traditions--are available to students. Music
facilities include a collection of instruments from many different cultures; a
music-instrument manufacturing workshop; a scores and recordings collection; and a
world music archives. An ongoing departmental colloquium presents lectures on issues
in the world of music by students, faculty, and outside speakers. In addition, the
department sponsors events such as concerts by world-renowned jazz artists, the
Wesleyan World Percussion Festival (2000), New England Gamelan Weekend (2002), the
Celtic Routes Festival (2003), and the annual Navaratri Festival. </p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Social Credit has been an economic theory, a social philosophy, an ideology, and a political
party in England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States since it was first
advanced in 1920 by Major C. H. Douglas. He believed finance capitalism deprived individuals of
sufficient purchasing power to buy otherwise available products. To overcome this Douglas
proposed offering to every citizen dividend payments based on the community's real wealth. As
monetary reform and as social theory Social Credit attracted intellectual support in England and
the United States especially during the 1930s. Only in Canada, however, did Social Credit become
an important movement with a political base and there only in the provinces of Alberta, British
Columbia, and Quebec.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">In the United Kingdom: </emph>
</p>

<p>In <title render="italic">The Long Week End</title> [<title render="italic">The Long Week End:
A Social History of Great Britain, 1918-1939 </title>(New York: Macmillan, 1941), pp. 296-297],
Robert Graves and Alan Hodge pointed out that the British proletariat between the wars was
attracted <emph render="doublequote">by more plausible remedies than a revolution.</emph> One of
the remedies to economic ills was Social Credit. Graves and Hodge continue: </p>
<p>
<emph render="italic">Major C. H. Douglas, a retired Royal Engineer, had been propounding his
theory of Social Credit in a series of books and pamphlets for over ten years. In the thirties
a Social Credit party was formed; its members adopted the new political habit of wearing
coloured shirts as uniforms, and chose green. <title render="italic">The Daily Mail</title>
honoured the party with a mention in its Year Book for 1935. Serious economists criticized it
in the serious weeklies, and T. S. Eliot, who had banking and commercial experience as well as
literary eminence, welcomed it as a promising solution of the world's troubles. By 1935 the
movement had spread to the Dominions. In Alberta, Canada, a Social Credit party was elected to
the provincial legislature, pledged to distribute dollar bills periodically to the electorate.
But like all economic plans, however sound in general theory, it could not be applied in a
single isolated context, and many banking and business interests in Alberta took flight to
other provinces of the Dominion; so that the Social Credit party, which was not even unanimous
on practical policy, was starved into surrender.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">The Social Credit plan was to distribute national dividends to everyone
through the central banks. The basis of the value of these dividends was supposed to be the
capital equipment and the energy possessed by the community. The present financial system,
Major Douglas held, did not reflect the real credit of the community. To prove this, he
developed a theory meant to show that some of the country's income was continuously lost by the
interest charges of the banking system. <title render="doublequote">Dividends for All</title>
would remedy this by bringing a country's purchasing power up to the level of its productive
power. Social Credit took for granted that modern science enabled productive power to be
increased limitlessly, even to the point of luxury for all. From this followed the first step
in its argument: that only a lack of purchase power prevented the masses from enjoying the
natural increase.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">Serious people were glad to find a theory which seemed to provide a
non-political solution for the world's troubles, the more so because the banks seemed the
obvious scapegoats for the Depression. Not many people knew what was the function of banks, and
the rest could easily be induced to look on them as concerns that exploited the public for the
benefit of their directors. Major Douglas himself, however, pointed out that he regarded
bankers not as dishonestly anti-social, but as victims of their own system. He wrote in 1934 of
<emph render="doublequote">the necessity for exalting the individual over the group. I mean by
that the exact opposite of what is commonly called Socialism. The direct road to the
emancipation of the individual from the domination of the group is, in my opinion, the
substitution, to an increasing extent, of the dividend in place of the wage and salary.</emph>
Such words were more than welcome to people who feared that their lives would be exactly
regulated by Socialist or Totalitarian economics; but neither the orthodox nor the Socialist
economists had any difficulty in pointing out the flaws in his argument. The Social Credit
theory was never adopted by any influential political group in Great Britain. It merely
provided another controversial topic.</emph>
</p>

<p>Although Social Credit attracted only a small following in Britain, its roots must be
remembered to have been English. For this reason, brief sketches of the key men are included in
these outlines, which will set the stage for a better understanding of the migration of Social
Credit to Canada and to the United States.</p>

<p>CLIFFORD HUGH DOUGLAS, 1879-1952. An engineer with experience in India, Douglas attained the
rank of major in the Royal Aircraft Establishment during World War I, retiring in 1918. His
ideas on Social Credit were first advanced in articles in <title render="italic">The English
Review</title> and <title render="italic">The New Age</title>. His earliest books were <title render="italic">Economic Democracy</title> in 1920 and <title render="italic">Social
Credit</title> in 1924. Little is known either of his personal life or his professional career.
Having had no training in economics, Douglas looked upon Social Credit as a total solution to
the world's problems and, consequently, rejected such rival approaches as Guild Socialism,
Fabianism, Socialism, or Bolshevism. He may be said to have opposed capitalism on economic
grounds and Socialism on political grounds. Social Credit as an idea never escaped its founder's
fear of political leadership which he coupled with a messianic approach and inept propaganda.
Thus Douglas agreed to advise the Social Credit government in Alberta in 1935, but disagreements
led quickly to his resignation. He corresponded with Munson and other Social Credit advocates in
the United States and, in 1934, visited New York and Washington. That his style was enigmatic is
shown by his belief in individual freedom while insisting, whenever invited to be active in an
organization to promote Social Credit, on total power for himself. Thus in 1933, when asked to
join the National Credit Association, Douglas demanded <emph render="doublequote">absolute
authority, a Douglas veto over any proposed members of the conference, and a preliminary agenda
committee appointed by Douglas personally.</emph> [John L. Finlay, <title render="italic">The
English Origins of Social Credit</title> (Montreal and London: McGill-Queen's University Press,
1972), p. 133.] This flaw coupled with his anti-Semitism reduced his influence after 1935.</p>

<p>Major Douglas viewed payments made by a productive organization as falling into two groups. He
labeled payments made to individuals Group A, those to other organizations Group B. This was
explained, as can be seen below, but the A Plus B Theorem became a kind of shorthand for
adherents of Social Credit, for Douglas advanced it as an indication and test of Social Credit
genuineness. This is his explanation:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">Group A--All payments made to individuals (wages, salaries and
dividends). Group B--All payments made to other organizations (raw materials, bank charges, and
other external costs). Now the rate of flow of purchasing power to individuals is represented
by A, but since all payments go into prices the rate of flow of prices cannot be less than A +
B. The product of any factory may be considered as something which the public ought to be able
to buy, although in many cases it is an intermediate product of no use to individuals, but only
to a subsequent manufacture; but since A will not purchase A + B, a proportion of the product
at least equivalent to B must be distributed by some form of purchasing power which is not
comprised in the descriptions grouped under A. It will be necessary at a a later stage to show
that this additional purchasing power is provided by loan credits (bank overdrafts) or export
credit.</emph> [Clifford Hugh Douglas, Credit-Power and Democracy (London: Cecil Palmer, 1920),
p. 22; rev. ed. (London: Stanley Nott, 1934), pp. 19-20.]</p>

<p>ALFRED RICHARD ORAGE, 1873-1934. As editor of the influential New Age from 1907-1922, Orage
gave the ideas of Social Credit their first continuous exposition. Orage opened its pages to
Major Douglas beginning in 1918. He was important in both England and the United States as a
spokesman and interpreter of Social Credit thereafter. After 1922, Orage was drawn to Georgi
Gurdjieff's psychological method for the harmonious development of man. In 1932 he founded the
<title render="italic">New English Weekly</title>, as a Social Credit organ. [See Herbert B.
Grimsditch, A. R. Orage, <title render="italic">Dictionary of National Biography,

Kegan Paul, 1974.)]</p>

<p>H. E. B. LUDHAM. A Coventry printer prominent in a rightwing split in the Social Credit
movement that began at the Swanwick conference in 1925. This group, which also included
Frederick Soddy, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, and Arthur Kitson, called itself the Economic
Freedom League. Ludham edited the League's journal, the <title render="italic">Age of
Plenty</title>. Favoring centralization and political action, Ludham stood for election in the
1938 Coventry municipal election and lost. In the late 1920s and in the 1930s, Ludham became
associated with John Strachey and Sir Oswald Mosley of the British Union of Fascists. (See
Finlay, <title render="italic">English Origins</title>, pp. 126-29, 206, 211.)</p>

<p>JOHN HARGRAVE, 1894-1982. A man of great personal force, unorthodox in the fullest sense,
greatly interested in monetary reform, Hargrave did not come to an awareness of Social Credit
until 1927. Earlier he was interested in scouting and led such off-beat organizations as the
White Fox, Wa-Whaw-Goosh and the Kibbo Kift. Courted by social crediters running the <title render="italic">New Age</title> as well as by the rival Economic Freedom League in its columns
in the <title render="italic">Age of Plenty</title>, Hargrave tended toward the former but
favored mass action through a Third Line between Fascism and Communism. He quickly became the
most prominent social credit man in England, apart from Douglas, leading a movement with a
succession of different titles: the Economic Party, 1929-1930; the Crusader Legion in Coventry,
1930-1933; an inner elite known as the Iron Guard and then as the Green Shirts; the Green Shirt
Movement for Social Credit, 1933-1935; and finally, the Social Credit Party of Great Britain.
Traditionally antiparliamentary, the Social Credit Party ran a candidate for the House of
Commons in South Leeds but gained only 11 per cent of the vote. Hargrave feuded with Douglas,
and the Green Shirts, in uniform, broke up a Social Credit reception for one of Douglas's
Hargrave had become an hysterical mystic, and the militant Green Shirts was largely ended by the
Public Order Act outlawing the use of uniforms for political purposes. For some years, Hargrave
edited <title render="italic">This Week's Message from Hargrave</title>. He rejected both
Fascism and Communism and believed that only a monarch could stand up to the conspiracy of the
money trust and, on this ground, took the side of Edward VIII in the abdication crisis of 1937.
(See Finlay, <title render="italic">English Origins</title>, chapter 7.)</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">In Canada</emph>
</p>

<p>The best concise summary of the kindling of Social Credit in Canada is to be found in The
Oxford Companion to Canadian History and Literature, by Norah Story (Toronto, London, New York:
Oxford University Press, 1967, p. 772), quoted here in full:</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">Social Credit Party. A popular movement, led by William Aberhart, that won
the Alberta provincial election in 1935, it was disciplined into a political party that has
remained in power in Alberta, has invaded the federal field, and has spread to other provinces.
It came into power in British Columbia in 1952.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">The intricate monetary scheme and social philosophy known as social credit
was enunciated in England by Maj. Clifford Douglas. At the instigation of William Irvine,
Douglas was brought to Canada in 1923 where he was invited to explain his views to the House of
Commons' Select Committee on Banking and Commerce. He made a poor impression on all but the UFA
(United Farmers of Alberta) members, who distributed social credit in their province. The
theory of social credit was brought to the attention of William Aberhart, a high-school
principal in Calgary whose Sunday radio broadcasts as head of the fundamentalist Prophetic
Bible Institute had a large and enthusiastic following. In 1932 Aberhart began to introduce his
own vague theories of social credit into these broadcasts, recommending a redistribution of
purchasing power and later, as head of the Social Credit Party, promising a social dividend of
$25 a month to every citizen. Followers of Douglas attacked his interpretation, and the
resulting public debate and paper warfare stimulated public interest. In 1934 Douglas was
brought to Alberta as 'reconstruction adviser' to the UFA government. This move created an
outpouring of sentiment on behalf of Aberhart. Social Credit candidates were selected in the
constituencies, but Aberhart personally chose which of these should stand. They swept the
province in the election of 1935 and Aberhart became the premier.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">Acts passed in Alberta in 1937 to implement social credit monetary
theories were disallowed by the federal government or declared unconstitutional. The Social
Credit Bill of Rights, passed under Aberhart's successor, E. C. Manning, was appealed to the
privy council where it too was declared unconstitutional. These decisions have given impetus
to campaigning for seats in parliament in the hope that, with a majority, the constitution
could be amended. The party gained 17 federal seats in 1935. Thereafter membership fluctuated
until 1958 when no member was elected, but 30 seats were won in 1962 and 24 in 1963 when the
representation was weakened by the members from Quebec who organized as a separate
group.</emph>
</p>

<p>ABERHART SOCIAL CREDIT DOCTRINE. The conditions of life in Alberta during the Great Depression
made social credit attractive: they also modified the ideas of Douglas. The class makeup of
Alberta and the debtor position there had produced a tradition of looking for monetary cures to
economic troubles. Additionally there was a strong predilection for prophetic religion so that a
leader of Aberhart's charismatic traits easily gained a large following. <emph render="doublequote">These three circumstances made Alberta, as a community, far more receptive
than was England to a monetary reform doctrine with spiritual overtones. They made it possible
for social credit to become a mass movement, and in so doing ensured the vulgarization of the
social and economic doctrine of Major Douglas.</emph> [C. B. Macpherson, <title render="italic">Democracy in Alberta: The Theory and Practice of a Quasi-Party System.</title> (Toronto:
University of Toronto Press, 1953), p. 148.] Aberhart reduced the Douglas doctrine to the simple
points of <emph render="doublequote">A plus B,</emph> the unearned increment, the basic
dividend, and the just price.</p>

<p>ALBERTA SOCIAL CREDIT PROGRAM, 1935-1943. As premier of the first social credit government in
the world for eight years, William Aberhart's program has been characterized as politically
radical but economically conservative. He and his constituents wished to divorce themselves from
the central government in Ottawa without making profound changes in Alberta. Three key measures
were enacted in 1937: (1) the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, (2) the Bank Employees Civil
Rights Act, and (3) the Judicature Act Amendment Act. A stunning thing then happened. Under its
federal system, the central government in Ottawa <emph render="doublequote">disallowed</emph>
these provincial statutes and this was upheld in rulings of the Canadian Supreme Court and the
British Privy Council. There is much more to the story, but in 1938 the essence of the Social
Credit program was dead. It meant that Aberhart's program of social credit eventually failed
even in name. [J. R. Mallory, <title render="italic">Social Credit and the Federal Power in
Canada. </title>(Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1954), pp. 57-90.]</p>

<p>SOCIAL CREDIT IN CANADA, 1943-1976. With a hold on Alberta established, Social Credit
developed branches in other provinces, first in Saskatchewan and then in British Columbia where
it came to power in 1952. [See Martin Robin, <title render="doublequote">The Social Basis of
Party Politics in British Columbia,</title> in H. G. Thorburn, ed., <title render="italic">Party Politics in Canada,</title> 2nd ed. (Scarborough, Ont.: Prentice-Hall of Canada, Ltd.,
1967), pp. 201-211.] At the provincial level in recent years, the Social Credit Party has shown
significant strength in Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec. In federal elections its chief
strength has been in Quebec where 20 per cent of the total vote has been won, while elsewhere
Social Credit has fallen to less than 5 per cent. [For a close examination of the appeal and
success of Social Credit in the 1962 elections in Quebec Province, see Maurice Pinard, <title render="italic">The Rise of a Third Party: A Study in Crisis Politics </title>(Englewood
Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1971). For a sociological and political study, see
Michael Stein, <title render="italic">The Dynamics of Right-Wing Protest: A Political Analysis
of Social Credit in Quebec</title> (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1973).]</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">In the United States</emph>
</p>

<p>The Social Credit ideas of Major C. H. Douglas were adopted in the United States by a small
group of intellectuals who advanced this monetary reform from 1932 to 1945 through a succession
of small organizations and publications. Electoral support was never sought as in Canada. The
early influences were from Ezra Pound, the self-exiled poet and A. R. Orage, the English editor
who lived in the United States in the twenties. Pound first wrote about the wisdom of Major
Douglas in <title render="italic">The Little Review</title> in April 1920. He became a zealous
advocate of Social Credit and influenced such figures as William Carlos Williams and, later,
James Laughlin IV. Orage's influence is difficult to calculate, but his impact on artists and
writers in New York was profound, as they have attested. He cultivated an American readership
for his Social Credit journal, <title render="italic">The New English Weekly</title>, founded in
1932. More than any other single element, this publication marked the beginning of the organized
study of Social Credit in the United States.</p>

<p>Gorham Munson was the most eloquent and durable Social Credit leader in the United States. In
1932, he became American correspondent for <title render="italic">The New English
Weekly</title>, defended Social Credit in <title render="italic">The Nation</title> and helped
form a key Social Credit organization, the New Economics Group of New York. In 1933 he initiated
a vital Social Credit journal of the arts and public affairs, <title render="italic">New
Democracy</title>, and was its chief editor during its three-year life. Beginning in 1935,
Munson was an active lobbyist working with such congressmen as T. Alan Goldsborough and Jerry F.
Voorhis in seeking national Social Credit legislation. During the middle thirties there were
short lived or temporary organizations, national in scope, that espoused Social Credit, among
them the National Social Credit Association, the League for National Dividends and the Committee
in Support of H. R. 7188. In 1938 Munson led convinced Social Crediters in the formation of a
more permanent organization, the American Social Credit Movement (ASCM), for which he served as
General Secretary throughout its existence from 1938 to 1945. </p>

<p>ASCM encountered several difficulties in spreading Social Credit in the United States. Its
membership was limited to persons subscribing to the Douglas Theorem and three specific national
legislative goals, which meant that some independent Social Crediters and hosts of plain money
reformers were excluded. Social Credit bills in Congress were diluted and became progressively
less satisfactory to the ASCM. New Deal reforms and the coming of World War II lessened interest
in basic economic change. Some money reformers, including Ezra Pound and Major Douglas, became
loudly anti-Semitic. This Munson dealt with squarely and courageously but, even so, the Social
Credit movement in the United States ended, chiefly due to the War.</p>

<p>In 1945 Munson published a book entitled <title render="italic">Aladdin's Lamp: The Wealth of
the American People</title> summing up his critique of the private monopoly of banks which held
down the credit power of the American people.</p>

<p>THE ROLE OF A. R. ORAGE, 1931-1934. The importance of A. R. Orage in the Social Credit
movement in England has been remarked upon above. This exceptional man also played an important
role in the formation of the movement among American intellectuals as a sponsor of the ideas of
the Gurdjieff system. This occurred during the late 1920s when he travelled between New York and
Fontainebleau. In New York he organized groups for instruction in the <emph render="doublequote">Gurdjieff system</emph> and there met Gorham Munson, Elizabeth Delza, Margaret Anderson, Jane
Heap, Van Wyck Brooks, Lawrence S. Morris and others. At the depth of the Great Depression Orage
again drew upon his knowledge of Social Credit to win American intellectuals to this view, as
Munson has recalled: <emph render="doublequote">Shortly before the end of his American stay,
Orage took the initiative and rented a room at the New York School of the Theatre to give a
series of four lectures on Social Credit in the early part of 1931.</emph> About fifty enrolled
to hear his plea that Financial Credit reflect Real Credit. He also struck a note for increasing
the distribution of leisure, defined as <emph render="doublequote">the economic condition of
<emph render="underline">voluntary activity</emph>.</emph> Orage left the United States soon
afterwards to return to England where he established the <title render="italic">New English
Weekly</title>. In New York <emph render="doublequote">a study group under the leadership of
Schuyler Jackson began meeting at Muriel Draper's home, and from this group of enthusiasts came
the founders of the New Economics Group of New York in the fall of 1932.</emph> [Gorham Munson,
<title render="italic">The Awakening Twenties</title>, Brom Weber, editor, Berkeley and Los
Angeles: University of California Press, forthcoming 1977.]</p>

<p><title render="italic">NEW ENGLISH WEEKLY</title>, 1932-1947. Begun in London on April 21,
1932, the <title render="italic">New English Weekly</title> under A. R. Orage sought a wide
audience for its Social Credit message. Major Douglas, Ezra Pound and Orage--whom T. S. Eliot
called <emph render="doublequote">a tireless and wholly disinterested evangelist of monetary
reform</emph>--were frequently featured. <title render="italic">NEW</title> was a clearinghouse
for the movement through its <emph render="doublequote">Credit Forum</emph> carrying
organizational news from all countries. Gorham Munson was on the masthead from the very first
issue as American Representative. Through its circulation here Munson helped crystallize
activity for Social Credit in the United States. [See Gorham Munson, <title render="doublequote">American Intelligentsia, Advance,</title>
<title render="italic">New English Weekly</title>, Vol. 2, Dec. 29, 1932.]</p>


<p>NEW ECONOMICS GROUP OF NEW YORK, 1932-1938. A number of valuable functions were performed by
the New Economics Group of New York following its formation in December, 1932. Its study
meetings broadened knowledge of Social Credit. It sponsored and provided editorial and business
offices for <title render="italic">New Democracy</title>. Its technical committee drafted the
National Credit Issue Bill, a model for bills introduced for legislative consideration in
Washington, London, and Ottawa. It conducted major public lectures on the subject of Social
Credit: Archibald MacLeish in 1933, Major C. H. Douglas in 1934, and the Very Reverent Hewlett
Johnson, Dean of Canterbury in 1935. Board members included Allan R. Brown, Blanche Brownell
Grant, Paul Hampden, Elizabeth Sage Holter, Lawrence Morris, Gorham Munson, and W. A. Nyland.
After 1935 the New Economics Group of New York experienced a decline caused in part by personal
disagreements and factionalism.</p>

<p><title render="italic">NEW DEMOCRACY</title>, 1933-1936. A fortnightly and later monthly
review of economics and the arts, <title render="italic">New Democracy</title> was published in
New York for three years beginning August 15, 1933. Its announced policy was <emph render="doublequote">Social Credit in the United States at the earliest possible date.</emph>
To achieve this, <title render="italic">New Democracy</title>'s columns were packed full with
Social Credit -- news notes, articles, poems, letters, book reviews and organizational items.
This review also published major documents of the movement in the United States: the text of
speeches by Major douglas and the Dean of Canterbury, the Goldsborough Social Credit Bill and
significant commentary. Gorham Munson was the editor throughout the three years, joined by
Herbert Bruce Brougham in 1933-1934, by Lawrence Morris in 1934-1935, and by Paul Hampden and
Elliott Taylor in 1935-1936. W. A. Nyland of the New Economics Group of New York was the
publisher.</p>

<p><title render="doublequote">NEW DIRECTIONS,</title> 1935-1936. Under Munson, <title render="italic">New Democracy</title> in its final year of publication included a distinguished
literary page with the title <title render="doublequote">New Directions,</title> edited by James
Laughlin IV. Scion of the Pittsburgh steel family, in 1935 a student at Harvard, Laughlin had
been introduced to Munson by Ezra Pound. He opened the page with this declaration: <emph render="doublequote">New Directions. The great new direction is, of course, Social Credit, with
its changed conception of the means, and the ends of life.</emph> Not all contributions dealt
with economics or Social Credit, however, as Laughlin published T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore,
Henry Miller, e. e. cummings and Kay Boyle. Pound's great Bank of England CANTO, XLVI, which
Laughlin called <emph render="doublequote">definitely the epic of Social Credit,</emph> was
published in the March, 1936 issue of <title render="italic">New Democracy</title>. The literary
page ended, but its name was adopted by Laughlin for his avant-garde New Directions publishing
house.</p>

<p>NATIONAL SOCIAL CREDIT ASSOCIATION, 1934-1935. In 1934 W. A. Nyland of the New Economics Group
of New York tried to federate local organizations across the United States into the National
Social Credit Association. His capacity for leadership was insufficient, and established local
independence prevailed. Philadelphia's Retail Discount Organization, formed in 1931 and led by
Edward F. Harvey, was the oldest Social Credit local in the country. Others were New Economics
Groups led by Social Credit pioneers: Herbert Bruce Brougham in Washington, Mrs. E. Sohier Welch
in Boston, Luther Whiteman in San Francisco, J. Crate Larkin in Buffalo, and A. M. Edwards in
Detroit. There were smaller groups in Carmel, Los Gatos, and Pasadena, California; West Palm
Beach, Florida; Peekskill, New York; and Colorado Springs, Colorado. These organizations
continued even after the National Social Credit Association failed in 1935.</p>

<p>LEAGUE FOR NATIONAL DIVIDENDS, 1935-1936. Formed in San Francisco in June 1935, by Elliott
Taylor, editor of the magazine <title render="italic">Controversy</title>, the League for
National Dividends aimed <emph render="doublequote">to build up a mass-demand for the issuance
to al of national dividends.</emph> Following the Social Credit sweep in Alberta Province on
August 22, 1935, and the introduction of the Goldsborough Bill in Congress, the headquarters of
the League for National Dividends was moved to the offices of <title render="italic">New
Democracy</title> in New York. Soon Gorham Munson was Acting Secretary, council members
included Howard Buck, Walter Hampden and William Carlos Williams, and the League spoke
militantly: <emph render="doublequote">WANTED: SOCIAL CREDIT SHOCK TROOPS.</emph> Low
productivity was attributed to the lack of consumer purchasing power. The League argued that
<emph render="doublequote">new money must be issued by the Government as potential production
warrants it.</emph> There is no evidence of a rise of interest in Social Credit on account of
the League. There were only brief hearings on the Goldsborough Bill and 1935, and by August
1936, the League for National Dividends had dissolved.</p>

<p>GOLDSBOROUGH SOCIAL CREDIT BILL, H.R. 9216, 74th CONGRESS, 1935-1936. Congressman T. Alan
Goldsborough (D., Md.) in August 1935, sponsored the first bill embodying Social Credit
principles to be introduced in any legislative body in the United States. This was largely in
the form drafted by a committee of the New Economics Group of New York consisting of Allan R.
Brown, Edward F. Harvey, W. A. Nyland, Carle C. Conway, Jr., and H. B. Brougham. Its short title
was the <title render="doublequote">National Income and Credit Issue Bill</title> introduced on
August 22 and, as Brougham wrote in New Democracy, embodying <emph render="doublequote">the
tenets of Douglas without any frills. The bill presents straight out Social Credit
measures.</emph> It would establish the National Credit Account, defined in Title I as <emph render="doublequote">the money valuation of the annual unused capacity of the industries and
people of the United States to produce wanted goods and services.</emph> The Treasury would
produce non-interest bearing credit certificates, not to exceed the National Credit Account,
<emph render="doublequote">to circulate as money throughout the banking system only.</emph>
These certificates would finance a discount on prices to consumers at retail. They would also
provide a national <emph render="underline">per capita</emph> consumers dividend of $5.00 a
month. This consumers' dividend and other features of the bill would be administered by an
independent regulatory agency called the Federal Credit Commission. Should the Commission
records show an unduly expanded monetary condition then a Credit Retirement Fund would set aside
a portion of national revenues to retire Treasury credit certificates. The bill was discussed
and analyzed at length in <title render="italic">New Democracy</title>, advocated by the League
for National Dividends and, with Goldsborough as the ranking member of the House Committee on
Banking and Currency, there were brief hearings on H.R. 9216 in the 74th Congress. On this
occasion, Paul Hampden testified for the Social Credit bill at the invitation of Goldsborough.
The bill lapsed at the end of the 1936 session.</p>

<p>COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 7188, 1937-1938. Twenty Social Crediters formed the <emph render="underline">ad hoc</emph> Committee in Support of H.R. 7188, to lobby for Goldsborough's
revised bill in the 76th Congress, 1937-1938. The final report of the Committee's Secretary,
Gorham Munson, describes the frustrations experienced in seeking Social Credit legislation. The
bill, H.R. 7188, had several basic weaknesses: it neglected the crucial fact of an inherent
shortage of money in consumers' hands and it presented the retail price discount as merely an
emergency device for economic slumps to be snapped off on recovery. Although Munson twice
testified, the hearings were not satisfactory from his viewpoint. Leading Social Credit figures
who were members of the Committee in Support of H.R. 7188--Wallace Clark, Raymond Haight, J.
Crate Larkin, C. E. Luntz, Allan T. Gwathmey and Elliott Taylor--did not appear. Yet, three whom
Munson regarded as eclectic Social Crediters--Allan R. Brown, Herbert Bruce Brougham and Edward
F. Harvey--participated in the hearings. Munson interviewed several congressmen in Washington.
Paul Hampden acted as technical adviser to the Committee. Mrs. E. Sohier Welch served as
Treasurer. Despite disappointment, Munson praised the efforts of Congressman Goldsborough and
concluded that future legislative efforts should not allow compromise with Social Credit
Principles.</p>

<p>AMERICAN SOCIAL CREDIT MOVEMENT, 1938-1945. The culminating voluntary association promoting
Social Credit in the United States was the American Social Credit Movement, founded on October
5, 1938. Gorham Munson was General Secretary. Paul Hampden served as Acting Secretary while
Munson was on leave in Washington, 1939-1940. ASCM sought public support but limited its
membership strictly <emph render="doublequote">to those who after sufficient acquaintance with
the ideas of Social Credit are prepared to subscribe to the Theorem and the Three
Demands.</emph> As a result of experience with the second Goldsborough Bill, the three demands
were to establish the Federal Credit Commission, the Compensated Price and the National
Dividend. Eclectic money reformers were thus excluded and membership in ASCM never reached one
hundred. The American Social Credit Movement maintained a book service, sponsored lectures and
study meetings, issued weekly bulletins and worked for legislation. Munson cooperated with
Representative Jerry F. Voorhis (D., Cal.) in framing Social Credit bills in 1939-1940,
1941-1942 and 1943-1944. He also prepared a special series of bulletins on Social Credit called
<title render="italic">Men First</title>. Activities diminished after 1942 and ceased
altogether in 1945.</p>

<p>WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS AND SOCIAL CREDIT, 1933-1941. The Rutherford, New Jersey, physician
and poet William Carlos Williams (1883-1963) was a member of most of the Social Credit
organizations led by Gorham Munson. Williams was persuaded to his Social Credit beliefs by Ezra
Pound. He wrote for <title render="italic">New Democracy</title>, heard Major Douglas speak in
New York in 1934, and was a member of the League for National Dividends and the American Social
Credit Movement. Wile Williams had a continuing interest in Social Credit, he was not a very
active participant in the organizations he joined. Williams joined Munson, Laughlin, Walter,
Paul Hampden, and others in 1936 and the University of Virginia where he attacked bankers and
declared that money reform would bestow cultural benefits. Pound's addiction to Fascism and
Douglas's to anti-Semitism made Williams flee the Social Credit movement. [A good study is Reed
Whittemore, <title render="italic">William Carlos Williams: Poet from Jersey</title> (Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company, 1975), pp. 259-264.]</p>

<p>EZRA POUND AND SOCIAL CREDIT, 1920-1945. American poet Ezra Pound (1885-1971) in the 1920s and
1930s argued insistently in prose and verse that usura, or credit capitalism, was the root of
all evil in the world and Douglas Social Credit reforms was the best cure. This view permeated
most of his writings especially the middle Cantos, of which CANTO XLV on usury, and CANTO XLVI
on the Bank of England published in <title render="italic">New Democracy</title> are noteworthy.
In 1920, he reviewed Douglas's <title render="italic">Economic Democracy</title> for an American
audience in <title render="italic">The Little Review</title>. He wrote regularly for New
Democracy, and numerous letters harangued Munson about Mussolini, Roosevelt, the New Deal,
bankers, Jews and Social Credit. Pound left the United States in 1908, lived in England until
1920, in Paris until 1928, and Rapallo, Italy until 1945. After 1937, Munson did not think Pound
to be a real Social Crediter. Pound attached himself to Social Credit while dabbling in other
theories of money reforms. Because of his fascination with the Corporate State, and his ultimate
lapse into anti-Semitism, he gave Social Credit a black eye. On account of paid broadcasts to
American troops and related overt acts in wartime <emph render="doublequote">with the intent to
adhere to and give aid and comfort to the Kingdom of Italy, and its military allies,</emph>
Pound was indicted by the United States for felonious, traitorous and treasonable actions.
Removed to Washington, Pound was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and so was confined
to St. Elizabeth's Hospital from 1945 to 1958 when he was allowed to return to his home in
Rapallo. [For some works explaining the context of Pound's economic thought, see Earle Davis,
<title render="italic">Vision Fugitive: Ezra Pound and Economics</title> (Lawrence, Kansas:
University Press of Kansas, 1968); Hugh Kenner, <title render="italic">The Pound Era</title>
(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1971); C. David Heymann, <title render="italic">Ezra Pound: The Last Rower </title>(New York: Viking Press, 1976).]</p>

<p>ANTI-SEMITISM IN SOCIAL CREDIT, 1938-1941. Gorham Munson led the American Social Credit
Movement in repudiating those money reformers guilty of anti-Semitism by linking usury, banking
and Jews together. ASCM took this official position:</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">American Social Credit stands for the liberty and equality of opportunity
of the individual irrespective of race, creed or color. We abominate anti-Semitism. The Money
Question and the so-called Jewish Question have NOTHING to do with each other and we will let
no one confuse this fact.</emph>
</p>

<p>Munson was obliged to apply this principle to Major C. H. Douglas, the originator of Social
Credit, in 1938 and he did so with dispatch, disowning Douglas for anti-Semitism while staying
pledged to Douglas economics. Munson also shed all responsibility for Ezra Pound well before the
United States entered World War II. Munson was an outspoken critic of anti-Semitism in private
correspondence and in public statements. [See Gorham Munson, <title render="doublequote">A New
Attack on Anti-Semitism,</title>
<title render="italic">Opinion: A Journal of Jewish Life and Letters</title>, September
1939.]</p>

<p><title render="italic">ALADDIN'S LAMP</title>, 1945. As ASCM activities lessened during World
War II, Munson completed a book criticizing the banking-credit system and advocating Social
Credit as a vitally needed reform. The book, entitled <title render="italic">Aladdin's Lamp: The
Wealth of the American People</title>, won favorable reviews and many laudatory letters. Its
publication in the spring of 1945 marked the end of Munson's active advocacy of Social Credit
and of the American Social Credit Movement. Munson had occasion, in answering a friendly letter
questioning the value of Social Credit, to sum up his feelings about the reform he had
championed actively since 1932:</p>

<p><emph render="italic">Social Credit is not a cure-all. Our dogmatism goes only this far: we
assert that credit reform must have priority over any other reforms; we assert it is
fundamental. We can then tackle with some hope of success other bad features of <emph render="doublequote">capitalism.</emph> Beyond this are the psychological problems of the
<emph render="doublequote">good life</emph> to which Social Credit provides no key. Even with
Social Credit human nature would be plenty troublesome. But I do not think it would act, as
does chronic money shortage, to whip people up to greed and war. On the contrary, it would give
humane education a real chance--but only a chance. It can't accomplish what is ultimately the
function of culture.</emph> [GM to H. W. Cross, August 19, 1945.]</p>

<p>The Wesleyan Museum (1871-1957) was an integral part of the science curriculum at Wesleyan University. Materials collected by faculty, students, and other donors were intended to help students study the natural world. Materials collected included shells, rocks, fossils, wood specimens, mineral specimens, birds, fish, animals, insects, and dried plants. In addition, American Indian artifacts, coins, certain artworks, and a mummy also found a home in the museum. Wesleyan closely followed the 19th century <emph render="doublequote">curiosity cabinet</emph> model of natural history museums.</p>
<p>The Museum opened on the third and fourth floors of Judd Hall in 1871. By the end of the decade, a number of students and faculty members were using the museum's materials in their research. It later expanded into some rooms on the second floor of the building in 1886. In the late 1880s, the museum added a focus on ethnological collections, related to humans.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 1890s, the institution's interest in the museum lessened, with less funding alotted. The museum moved out of the second floor of Judd Hall. New faculty preferred laboratory work to studying museum specimens, and the museum became less relevant to the curriculum. The Museum remained open but largely unused in the curriculum.</p>
<p>In 1938, the museum had an offical re-opening to signify renewed interest in the museum. Funds were alocated for repairs and remodeling. School groups regularly toured the museum, and were perhaps its primary visitors until the Museum closed in 1957.</p>
<p>When the Wesleyan Museum closed, there were thousands of specimens to disperse. Many went to the Smithsonian Institution; others were donated or put on loan to Connecticut institutions. Some of the materials were divided up among science departments at Wesleyan. Other materials were dispersed to storage locations across campus, often without a record of the transfer.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, some faculty took an interest in cataloging the materials within their own departments, especially archaeological and anthropological materials. The museum's mummy came to national prominence in the late 1970s when it was unwrapped and studied by Professor Stephen Dyson.</p>

<p>Wesleyan University hosted both V-5 and V-12 Naval Training Units on its campus during World War II. The V-5 Unit was also called the Navy Flight Preparatory School, and stayed at Wesleyan from January 1943 until August 1944. Coursework focused on aerology and naval science. The V-12 Unit, also known as the Navy College Training Program, began in July 1943 and included coursework more akin to Wesleyan's traditional liberal arts curriculum. The program continued until the end of World War II in August 1945. </p>

<p>Stephen Henry Olinwas born in 1847 on the Wesleyan University campus
while his father, Stephen Olin, served as its second president. Olin compiled this scrapbook
when he was 13 years old, presumably as an admirer of the <emph render="doublequote">Gallant Seventh.</emph></p>
<p>After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1866, Olin graduated from the Law School
of the University of Albany and began practicing as a lawyer in 1869. His law
practice centered on issues of copyright and trademark, particularly in literary
publications. Olin was a trustee of Wesleyan University from 1880 to 1925, and
in 1922 he also served as acting president of the university.</p>

<p>The Parley Committee of 1930 described the Wesleyan Parley as follows: <emph render="doublequote">This parley is offered to the friends, guests and students
of Wesleyan with the basic assumption that we as students have no prerogative to
be utterly carefree or completely cloistered from the stress and flux of affairs
'off-campus.' We believe that without scorning campus interests a student may
wisely concern himself with the interwoven political and economic forces that
have given his people prosperity - and in turn have given him his Alma
Mater.</emph></p>
<p>
<emph render="doublequote">In a day when our government is groping through new and
bewildering mazes, it seems no more than decently sporting that we students
grapple these problems…Though in some campus circles this is treason, we
cordially invite you to make the most of it.</emph>
</p>
<p>Wesleyan parleys were arranged by the Parley Committee of the College Body (the
student government) with secretarial assistance from the Christian Association. The
Parley Committee generally consisted of four to ten students, along with faculty
help until 1930. The annual conferences featured scholars from around the country
discussing some of the day's most controversial and important topics, including
labor, crime, race, marriage, and foreign policy. The tradition of Wesleyan Parleys
began in 1924 and lasted until about the early 1960s.</p>

<p>The Physiological Society of Wesleyan University was a direct response to <emph render="doublequote">Grahamism,</emph> a movement concentrating on regulating
diet and lifestyle to temper impulsiveness, mental health, and sexuality. Grahamites
practiced a strict vegetarian diet, also cutting out sugar, white bread, and most
importantly, alcohol. The Grahamist movement was inspired by American reformer
Sylvester Graham, who in 1829 invented <emph render="doublequote">Graham
bread,</emph> today know as the Graham cracker. Graham wrote extensively for his
followers, but his best known works were the <title render="italic">Lectures on the
Science of Human Life</title> (Boston, 1839), and <title render="italic">Lectures to Young Men on Chastity</title>. The ties that Wesleyan’s
Physiological Society held to the Grahamist movement are evidenced by an
announcement of the club's inception in the 1839 edition of The Graham Journal of
Health and Longevity, as well as in the Society’s own records. The Society appears
to have disbanded for good sometime in April 1844, seven years before Sylvester
Graham's own death and a subsequent decrease in Grahamism's popularity.</p>

<p>This collection of poetry is comprised of information regarding the poetry presented
at the Honors College. The Honors College, housed in Russell House, was a program
for distinguished students in the Wesleyan community. In addition to informal
lectures by young men and women distinguished in the arts, sciences, and
professions, the Honors College hosted for its members (and later, the public) a
series of music concerts and poetry readings by distinguished, young American poets
beginning in either 1964 or 1965. The poetry series at the Honors College also came
to include an opportunity for Wesleyan students to share their own work for an
audience. In April of 1984, the Honors College hosted an anniversary poetry festival
with over 30 poets participating to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Wesleyan
Press Poetry Program.</p>

<p>Another large part of this collection is the work with the Connecticut Poetry
Circuit. The Connecticut Poetry Circuit is a non-profit organization that provides
three poetry reading programs for colleges and some preparatory schools. The
Connecticut Poetry Circuit was founded as the New England Poetry Circuit in 1963,
but after August, 1968, the New England Poetry Circuit split into the New England
Poetry Circuit and the Connecticut Poetry Circuit. The intention of the circuit was
to bring established yet unpublished poets to colleges and universities, as well as
a competition among students throughout Connecticut to travel the circuit as student
poets. The winners of the competition (usually four students, sometimes five) are
chosen by a selection committee to tour the state reading their poetry. The first
group of student poets to tour around Connecticut was in 1970. While not a major
part of the poetry circuit, the Connecticut Commission on the Arts awards grant
money to the circuit to allow for the poets to tour. The connection between the
Connecticut Poetry Circuit and Wesleyan University is that Jean Maynard, the
assistant director of the Honors College, was the director of the Connecticut Poetry
Circuit. She organized the committee to select the student poets, as well as find
and invite poets to join the circuit.</p>

<p>The Press Archives began at Wesleyan University in 1952 with a grant from Gannett
Foundation. After three years the project lapsed, but was re-started around 1958 by
professor Sigmund Neumann. He intended the Press Archives to be a resource for
students and faculty in the then-new Public Affairs Center.</p>
<p>In a 1962 index of materials in the Archives, Jane K. Parker, Curator,
wrote <emph render="doublequote">The purpose of the Press Archives is to collect and
organize material from newspapers into subject headings of primary interest to
various departments on campus. These articles, clipped, pasted, and filed,
constitute research material for faculty and students who are interested in
following contemporary, day by day developments and reactions to current
problems and concerns.</emph></p>
<p>According to a 1975 note, the Press Archives ceased operation upon Neumann's death in October 1962, and
the contents were eventually transferred to a faculty member at what is now Central
Connecticut State University.</p>

<p>Daniel Curtis Rand was born February 1, 1820, and grew up in Charleston, New
Hampshire. He attended from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, and
graduated with the class of 1839. Rand attended Wesleyan University in Middletown,
Connecticut, and graduated in the class of 1843. After a short traveling tour in New
York and Connecticut he settled in Middletown for a little while longer and worked
with his sister Lucia at the powder mill his family owned. An informal ledger of
mill accounts can be found in the middle section of Rand's journal. Rand eventually
settled in Pittsford, New York where he opened his own powder mill, manufacturing blasting powder used in New York stone quarries and Pennsylvania coal
mines, in addition to regular gun powder. Rand entered into a business partnership
with Mortimer Wadhams, and they named their plant Rand and Wadhams Manufacturing of
Mining, Blasting and Sporting Powder. It remained so until 1900 when it was renamed
the D. C. Rand Powder Co. Daniel married Wadhams' daughter Stella in 1864, and the
couple had four sons, Mortimer, Robert, Samuel, and Phillip, and three daughters,
Lucia, Lucy, and Stella. Upon Rand's death, Stella and her 14-year-old son Phillip
took over the business, which continued to operate until about 1910 after a series
of unfortunate explosions. The site of the Rands' home was called Oakridge, and this
property is now a part of a county park, aptly named <emph render="doublequote">Powder Mills Park.</emph></p>

<p>Born in 1845, William North Rice, of Springfield, Massachusetts, entered Wesleyan University in August 1861 at the age of fifteen. He graduated in 1865 as the valedictorian of his class, and went on to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University to receive the first Ph.D. awarded in the United States in geology in 1867. After further study in Europe, he returned to Wesleyan to teach natural science courses, a very new field in the existing academic world of Greek and Latin literature and mathematics.</p>
<p>He served as Professor of Geology and Natural History, 1868-1884; G.I. Seney Professor of Geology, 1884-1918; G.I. Seney Professor of Geology Emeritus, 1918-1928; and as acting president of the university, 1907, 1908-1909, and 1918. He died 13 November 1928, after a 67-year association with Wesleyan. </p>
<p>Rice was distinguished not only for his knowledge of geological formations throughout the mountains of Connecticut and Massachusetts, but also for his many publications and sermons as a Methodist minister.</p>
<p>In addition, Rice was a prolific writer. Along with several books, he wrote dozens of sermons and lectures which were published in newspapers and journals. He was a frequent contributor to <title render="italic">Zion's Herald</title>, a religious publication of the Boston Wesleyan Assocation, as well as to other religious and secular newspapers. His writings often dealt with the conflict many people experienced, in the first half-century after the publictaion of Darwin's <title render="italic">Origin of the Species</title>, between new scientific thought and Biblical tradition. Other lectures and sermons were strictly theological in nature.</p>

<p>In 1923, the Rosa Club was founded by the members of the defunct Radio Club. The Rosa Physics Club was named for an Wesleyan alumnus, Edward B. Rosa, class of 1886, a physicist, and physics professor. The purpose of the Rosa Club was <emph render="doublequote">to promote an interest in physics and its applications,</emph> and this collection documents the club's existence from 1923 until 1952. The club was made up of physics students and a few professors. There were annual officer elections each May for the executive committee positions of faculty representative and student president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer, who was the student responsible for taking the minutes of each meeting. According to the minutes, there were requirements to be part of the club, mostly in regard to the number or level of classes taken in the physics department, meaning that the members were exclusively physics majors, mostly juniors and seniors, although any physics graduate students and professors were welcome to join the club. The meetings were held twice a month, and each meeting included a report of the previous meeting, new business, a presentation of some scientific news, and a speaker, often a professor or student presenting research.

Marjorie Suzanne Rice Daltry Rosenbaum was born on May 10, 1921 in Hartford, CT to Louis Haskell Rice and Guilelma Murray Rice, and was the older sister of Charles Murray Rice. She was a resident of Connecticut her entire life, and lived in West Hartford until relocating to Middletown in the 1950s. She attended school within the West Hartford public school system until her graduation from Hall High School. In 1943, she graduated with a BA from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA, with a major in English and a minor in music.
</p>
<p>
After graduating from college, she returned to West Hartford and took up a teaching position at Sedgwick Junior High School. She remained there until 1957 as the chairman of the English department and as an instructor of both choral music and social studies. While at Sedgwick, she also completed a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) in music, theatre, and art in 1955 at Wesleyan University. In doing so, Marjorie became one of the original graduates of Wesleyan's Graduate Liberal Studies Program (GLSP). During her life, Marjorie also completed additional graduate work at Harvard University, the University of Connecticut, and Central Connecticut State College.
</p>
<p>
Between 1957 and 1973, Marjorie continued to teach in the West Hartford, Haddam, and Middletown public schools until she retired in June 1973 after 30 years of service. She also performed in and directed a number of concerts and musicals in both a professional and recreational capacity. A number of these productions were in Wesleyan's student run '92 Theatre or for the Theatre Department including <title render="italic">The Tempest</title>, a Cole Porter concert, and a number of cabarets. She also made the Broadway cast of <title render="italic">Kiss Me Kate</title>, which came to Broadway in 1948.
</p>
<p>
In 1956, she married Joseph S. Daltry, founder, chairman, and first instructor of the Music Deparment at Wesleyan University and director of the MALS program. The two remained together until Joseph S. Daltry's death in 1967 at age 68.
</p>
<p>
She did not just dedicate her life to teaching within an establsihed system, but sought to create a new and better educational experience for students within the public school system. To this end, she founded C.A.U.S.E. (Community And University Services for Education) in 1967. C.A.U.S.E. was set up as a cooperative program meant to facilitate projects between Wesleyan University and the Middletown community and public and private schools in the area. She felt that a university, any university, owed something to the community it was in. By 1980, C.A.U.S.E. had either been involved in or supported over 45 distinct programs to support the schools in the Middletown area. These projects ranged from breakfast programs, to enrichment summer school, to art and dance programs, and adult education. She remained C.A.U.S.E.'s principal strength throughout her life. She later became chief administrator of Wesleyan's Educational Studies Program from 1973-1985.
</p>
<p>
She remarried Wesleyan Professor Emeritus of Science and Mathematics Robert A. Rosenbaum and remained with him until her death on October 20, 2013 in Delta, Colorado. Marjorie was a woman who always gave back and always sought to make the experience of others as beneficial and exciting as possible. As her obituary in the <title render="italic">Hartford Courant</title> wrote, "She was a woman of cultured substance, demonstrative presence, and memorable performance."</p>

<p>This collection concerns Phase II of the Science Center. Phase I was the construction of Hall-Atwater Laboratory, which was completed in 1967, preceding the rest of the center. The project began when Victor Butterfield was President. In the mid-1960s, the student population of the University was augmented by 510, approaching the population of the 1990s-2000s. Wesleyan had to meet the need to accommodate more students than the previous Hall Laboratory could, as well as meet competitive standards in the fields of science. These two factors justified the cost of the new Science Center, which in the end was approximately 18 million dollars. Phase II was completed in 1970 and the Science Library switched from the Cutter classification system to the Library of Congress classification system. In 2002 the Science Center was dedicated to Charles E. Exley, Jr., class of 1951, for his generous contributions to the University.

<p>Second Stage is an organization of students at Wesleyan University dedicated to
producing theater and other performances. Founded in 1973 by Jan Eliasberg (class of
1974) with Samuel Miller (class of 1975), it originated as an alternative to Theater
Department productions. In 1973, the Wesleyan Theater Department moved from the '92
Theater building (now known as the '92 Patricelli Theater) into the new Center for
the Arts theater. This made it possible for Second Stage to use the '92 Theater
space , and they frequently staged noontime performances of theater, music, and
poetry. Second Stage soon began to produce full-length shows, with each production
running for several days.</p>

<p> The mostly volunteer student group manages the administration, staging, finances,
and selection of approximately thirty-five shows each academic year. Second Stage
provides an opportunity for aspiring playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians
to stage their very own productions. Many, but not all, of the fifteen or so Second
Stage staff members are theater majors. A Managing Liaison, a Building/Maintenance
Liaison, and a Lighting and Rigging Liaison, the only paid members of Second Stage,
serve as links to the Theater Department, which does not have oversight of the
group. However, the department and Second Stage work closely together, sharing
facilities and equipment. Second Stage is funded by the Wesleyan Student Assembly,
and the paid staff members are funded by the Theater Department. </p>

<p>Shanklin Laboratory at Wesleyan University was originally built in the late 1920s,
finished in 1928. The funds for the building were donated by the friends of late
University president William Arnold Shanklin, and its construction was part of a
1.25 million dollar building initiative on campus. The Shanklin renovation
initiative (beginning in 1963) was a result of the University’s decision to increase
the size of the student body by 510, and to put a greater emphasis on scientific
research and competitive science programming. Additionally, the University was
pushing forward a huge building plan for the new Science Center (renamed Exley
Science Center in 2002), which broke ground in 1965. The Shanklin renovations were
completed in pieces; most phases were done room by room as funds became available.
Accordingly, many of the papers in this collection are correspondence between
individual professors and administrators lobbying for personal offices and labs to
be renovated and updated. A summary of all renovations completed year-by-year can be
found in Folder 17 (Subseries 5.1: Planning Correspondence).</p>

<p>Nathan Comfort Starr was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1896. He received degrees
from Harvard and Oxford Universities. It was a class at Harvard, taught by G. H.
Maynadier, which first piqued Starr's interest in the Arthurian legends. He would go
on to teach courses in Arthurian literature and write <title render="italic">King
Arthur Today: The Arthurian Legend in English and American Literature,
1901-1953</title>, a study of modern Arthurian adaptations. During his career,
Starr taught English at Harvard, Radcliffe College, Colgate University, St.

<p>
During the early 1960s, Tobias held positions in journalism and education. From 1967 to 1970, she was assistant to the vice president for Academic Affairs at Cornell University, with special emphasis on implementing the Kahn-Bowers report on undergraduate education. As part of what was first thought to be a "January Term" activity, she launched one of the first women's studies courses later to become one of the first women's studies programs in the country.</p>
<p>
In 1970, she became associate provost at Wesleyan University. Her primary administrative focus was on helping Wesleyan make the transition to coeducation for a second time (the first period of coeducation was 1872-1909), which began in 1968. This included the hiring of women faculty and other key personnel. She also co-organized a New England-wide Higher Education Resource Service for women academic professionals, which later grew into the HERS Bryn Mawr Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration. She taught American Studies 210, "Gender and Politics," "Men and Women in Wartime." In 1978, she left Wesleyan to become director of the Math Anxiety (training trainers/dissemination) Project, Washington School of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>
Since 1978, Tobias has worked as an educational consultant, engaging in a research and writing assignment for the Research Corporation, working for the Sloan Foundation in its development of the professional science master's degree, and conducting a long term association with the Universities of Leiden and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, among many other activities.</p>

Vanderbilt clerked in the Newark law firm of Sommer, Colby and Whiting.
In 1913, upon admission to the Bar, he practiced for two years with
Jerome T. Congleton, later to serve as Mayor of Newark. From 1915 to
1947, Vanderbilt engaged in individual practice in Newark. </event>
<event>Vanderbilt's practice largely represented fire insurance companies,
corporations, and banks. He was engaged in equity receiverships,
particularly the <emph render="italic">Virginia Carolina Chemical

Board of the Public Fire Insurance Company and the Public Indemnity
Company, both of Newark, New Jersey from 1928 to 1933, and served on the
board of directors of various banks, and corporations. An increasing
amount of his professional work came from other lawyers and, hence, he
became known as a "lawyer's lawyer." </event>
<event>Served as New Jersey's counsel for the Port of New York Authority
from 1926 to 1927. </event>

<event>Trial and appellate work continued through all these years. These
included notable civil liberties cases. In the Paterson textile strike
of 1926 Vanderbilt represented Roger N. Baldwin, Secretary of the
American Civil Liberties Union, and won this early state case upholding
the constitutional right of public assembly. [<emph render="italic">State v. Butterworth</emph>, 104 N.J.L. 579, 142 A. 57 (1928).] Ten

<event>During the 1930s Vanderbilt was among the most active lawyers in
trial and appellate litigation in the country. Between 1928 and 1932 he
argued twenty-one cases before the New Jersey Court of Errors and
Appeals and won them all. He successfully represented claims of teachers
without tenure in Seidel v. Ventnor City, 110 N.J.L. 31, 164 A. 901
(1932) and in Downs v. Hoboken Board of Education, 113 N.J.L. 401, 181
A. 688 (1935). He was a specialist in municipal law, handled anti-trust
matters, and dealt with a major government contracts case during World
War II. [Copies of all court briefs prepared by Arthur T. Vanderbilt are

continuing education of the bar and to engage in co-operative projects
of reforming and simplifying the law. </event>

<event>"It was therefore, fitting that the building on Washington Square,
New York City, for which he, by prodigious effort raised the building

with the American Bar Association as a member of the General Council
from 1932 to 1934; as founder and first chairman of the Section on
Insurance, 1933-1934; as a member of the Executive Committee, 1934-1935;
and on the Board of Governors, 1935-1937. Long active in the state bar,
Vanderbilt became vice president and member of the Board of Trustees of
the New Jersey State Bar Association between 1934 and 1937. During
1937-1938 he served as president of the American Bar Association. </event>
<event>During his term of office, the American Bar Association established
an ad hoc committee on the Bill of Rights to provide counsel to anyone
who felt that his civil rights were violated. This committee worked with
the American Civil Liberties Union and filed an amicus curiae brief in
<emph render="italic">Hague v. C.I.O.</emph>, 307 U.S. 496 (1939),
among others. </event>
<event>The American Bar Association also advocated a simplification of the
federal court system. The Section of Judicial. Administration was
established during his presidency of the A.B.A. with Federal Circuit
Judge John J. Parker as chairman. Studies by the Judicial Administration
Section resulted in seven committee reports of suggested reforms and
standards. These reports, along with Vanderbilt's <title render="italic">Minimum Standards of Judicial Administration</title> (New York: New
York University Law Center, 1949) have been stimuli for several states
to reform judicial administration. </event>

<event><emph render="bold">Improving the Administration of Justice.</emph>
Vanderbilt's ideals over many years of leadership in law practice, legal
education and bar association activity were to see that the courts
functioned properly, to improve their personnel and to revise their
procedures to accommodate modern conditions. He worked closely with
Roscoe Pound (1870-1964) whose now famous speech to the American Bar
Association in 1906, entitled "The Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction
With the Administration of Justice," awakened national interest in the
subject. Judge John J. Parker was a close associate of Pound and
Vanderbilt in this movement. Vanderbilt's preeminent place in the
movement to reform the administration of justice is neatly captured in
the following assessment: </event>
<event>"Before long, public-spirited members of the bench and bar began to
take notice. The chief vehicle for their early efforts at reform was the
American Judicature Society, formed in 1912. In the 1930s, the organized
bar began to lend its strength to the growing movement, largely as the
result of the enthusiasm of Arthur T. Vanderbilt, who was destined to
become not only president of the American Bar Association, the American
Judicature Society, and the Institute of Judicial Administration, as
well as chief justice of New Jersey, but also the acknowledged leader of
the entire movement." [Delmar Karlen, "Judicial Administration," <title render="italic">International Encyclopedia of the Social
Sciences</title> (1968), vol. 8, p. 298.] </event>

<event>Vanderbilt's detailed activities are amply shown in his papers and
the positions he held listed in the short biographical sketches listed
below. His own formulation of the problems and solutions are expressed
most profoundly in two of his books, <title render="italic">Minimum
Standards of Judicial Administration</title> (1949) and <title render="italic">The Challenge of Law Reform</title> (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1955). </event>

<event>He served as chairman of the New Jersey Judicial Council from 1930 to
1940. He was also chairman of the National Conference of Judicial
Councils from 1933 to 1937 and chairman of its executive committee from
1937 to 1957. </event>

<event>In 1938-1939 Vanderbilt chaired a committee named by the Attorney
General to consider reforms in administering the entire federal court
system. As a result, the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts was created by act of Congress approved August 7, 1939 (53 Stat.
1223; 28 U.S.C. 601). </event>

<event>From 1938 to 1946 Vanderbilt chaired an advisory committee to the
Supreme Court on federal rules of criminal procedure. The work of his
committee resulted in adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. </event>

<event><emph render="bold">Attorney General's Committee on Administrative
Procedure.</emph> In December 1938 the Attorney General of the
United States in a letter to President Roosevelt stated that "there is
need for procedural reform in the wide and growing field of
administrative law," and recommended the creation of a committee to make
the necessary studies and recommendations for Congressional
consideration. (S. Doc. No.8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 251) Vanderbilt
was among the persons named to the resulting Attorney General's
Committee on Administrative Procedure, and with Carl McFarland and E.
Blythe Stason filed minority views in 1941 which became the direct basis
for the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. This act aimed to
establish reasonable uniformity and fairness in administrative
procedures throughout the Federal government. It was really the result
of a nine-year study of administrative justice with Vanderbilt's ideas
coming into the proceedings at numerous points. [For a cogent
legislative history, see House Report No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.,
reprinted in <title render="italic">U.S. Code Congressional
Service</title>, 1964, pp. 1195-1206. For the statute itself, see
Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 237, 5 U.S.C. 551.] </event>

<event><emph render="bold">Uniform, Code of Military Justice.</emph> At the
conclusion of World War II, there was much criticism of the justice
systems of the Army and the Navy which then embraced all the military
services. As a result both departments created independent boards to
study their courts-martial systems. Vanderbilt, in 1946, chaired an
advisory committee to the Department of War. Hearings were held
throughout the country and the committee recommended taking away from
field commanders the power of appointment and review of courts martial
and other modifications of the Articles of War. After the Department of
Defense was established, many of the proposals of the Vanderbilt
Committee were utilized in drafting the Uniform Code of Military Justice
enacted into law May 5, 1950. [For a legislative history, see the
committee reports reprinted in <title render="italic">U.S. Code
Congressional Service</title>, 1950, pp. 2222-2269. Also, see
Uniform Code of Military Justice of 1950, 64 Stat. 108, 10 U.S.C. 801.] </event>

<event>Vanderbilt also chaired the National Committee on Traffic Law
Enforcement from 1945 to 1956 and advocated unification of legal codes
to overcome the widely varying statutes from state to state. From 1945
to 1957 he was also on the President's Highway Safety Conference. His
concern for traffic law later resulted, in 1951, in <title render="italic">Traffic Law Enforcement and the Sixteen Resolutions
of the Chief Justices and the Governors</title>. </event>

1941-1942, Vanderbilt was a member of the New Jersey State Constitutional
Revision Commission and from 1942 to 1945 served as an assistant to the
attorney general to defend the constitution when it came up for referendum.
The proposed constitution was defeated in the elections of 1944; however, a

<event><emph render="bold">Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme
Court.</emph> On November 3, 1947 Vanderbilt was sworn in as a New
Jersey Circuit Judge, a prerequisite to his eligibility for appointment
to the new state Supreme Court. In December, 1947 Governor Driscoll
nominated him and the Senate confirmed him as the first Chief Justice of
the new Supreme Court then in formation under the New Jersey
Constitution of 1947. On September 15, 1948, he formally assumed his new
duties serving until his death in June 1957. </event>
<event>An innovation in the state constitution made the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court the administrative head of all the courts in the state.
Vanderbilt took the leadership in soliciting suggestions from all
sources for improving justice under this new system and the Court issued
on June 21, 1948, <title render="italic">Rules Governing the Courts of
the State of New Jersey</title>. As Chief Justice, Vanderbilt
followed through in setting standards for swiftness in settling cases,
working to keep the courts staffed, staying abreast of judicial
business, and conferring and corresponding with judges at all levels
throughout the state. He thus inaugurated the improved judicial system
of New Jersey. </event>

<event>During nine full terms as Chief Justice, Vanderbilt wrote 166
opinions. His court's work is embraced in the first 24 volumes of the
new series of <title render="italic">New Jersey Reports</title>. [See

<event><emph render="bold">The Conference of Chief Justices.</emph>
Vanderbilt was one of the organizers in 1949 of the Conference of Chief
Justices, now composed of the Chief Justices of the courts of last
resort of the fifty states and Puerto Rico. Its purpose is to provide
for the exchange of information and ideas on the operation of the
judiciary and for consultation pointed to improvement of the
administration of justice. The Conference is affiliated with the Council
of State Governments. Vanderbilt was the elected chairman of the
Conference of Chief Justices in 1953-1954. [For reports on the work of
the Conference and of the state of judiciary, see the standard biennial
reference work <title render="italic">The Book of the States</title>,

<event><emph render="bold">Continued Leadership in Legal Education.</emph>
During his years as Chief Justice, Vanderbilt continued to bring ideas
into the N.Y.U. Law School at Washington Square. In 1948 he became a
member of the Council of New York University and served as president of
the Law Center Foundation. In 1951 he helped in the initiation of the
Root-Tilden Scholarship Program at the Law School, awarded yearly to
twenty students as a means of competing with other law schools for
promising applicants by providing special seminar and independent study
opportunities. </event>
<event><emph render="bold">Citizenship Clearing House.</emph> Vanderbilt
persuaded the governing bodies of the American Bar Association and the
American Political Science Association to endorse the idea of an
organization to promote the teaching of "practical politics" in college
in order to prepare educated men and women for political activity after
graduation. He organized a founding conference for 300 at the
Waldorf-Astoria in September, 1947; enunciated the central ideas and
purposes of the Citizenship Clearing House; won key foundation support;
and established its permanent headquarters at Washington Square in close
affiliation with the New York University Law School. C.C.H. changed its
name to the National Center for Education in Politics (N.C.E.P.) in 1962
and that organization expired in 1966. During its existence this
Vanderbilt-created organization held numerous conferences on politics
throughout the country and brought countless professors and students
into touch with campaigns and other political activity. A major force in
its day, the Citizenship Clearing House was one of several vehicles for
the reforming zeal of Arthur T. Vanderbilt." [See <title render="italic">Political Education and Political Science: The National Center for
Education in Politics, 1947-1966</title> by Bernard C. Hennessy
(1966), N.C.E.P. Mimeographed Report, 161 pages.] </event>

<event><emph render="bold">Institute of Judicial Administration.</emph> In
1952 Vanderbilt established the Institute of Judicial Administration at
N.Y.U. School of Law. Chief Judge Charles Clark of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote in 1963, "The Institute of Judicial
Administration is a permanent non-profit corporation chartered under the
laws of New York of over 600 leading lawyers, judges and laymen charged
with the task of a continuing study--originally on a national, and now
on an international basis--of the problems of court organization,
administration and procedure with the purpose of developing an art as
well as a science of judicial administration. So long as he lived, Chief
Justice Vanderbilt was its president, and it has already become the
outstanding center for correlating all source material and research
publications in its unique field. It has already developed a series of
advisory and consultative studies where its advice has been sought here
and abroad in problems in original or improved court organization. A
broadened field of opportunities open before it continuously. It was
uniquely designed to carry on the faith and perpetuate the ideals of the
most notable law reformer of an era." [See Klein and Lee, <title render="italic">Selected Writings</title>, vol. 1, p. xxiii.] </event>

<event><emph render="bold">Honors.</emph> Vanderbilt was awarded thirty-one
honorary degrees in the United States and Canada. In 1948 he was awarded
the Gold Medal of the American Bar Association, given rarely. He also
won numerous other honors. [See details in <title render="italic">Who

<head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
<p> In 1927, The Voluntary Committee of Lawyers, Inc. was organized by a group of young
New York lawyers who felt that the national prohibition law was both unjust and
unenforceable. Its leaders were Joseph H. Choate, Jr., who served as chairman of the
Executive Committee, and Harrison Tweed, Treasurer. The organization existed to
organize like-minded associates, take opinion polls of lawyers across the country,
issue bulletins and annual reports reciting arguments against the Eighteenth
Amendment to the Constitution, and work closely with the Association Against the
Prohibition Amendment. They stressed that a Repeal Amendment should provide for
ratification by state convention and then proceeded to prepare and place before all
state governors in February 1933 draft bills providing for election at large of all
delegates. The alertness and prestige of the members of the Voluntary Committee of
Lawyers contributed to the fact that most states enacted the model convention bill
verbatim. When the Twenty-First Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933, the
Voluntary Committee of Lawyers disbanded. </p>

<p>JOSEPH H. CHOATE, JR. was the acknowledged leader and moving force in the Voluntary
Committee of Lawyers, Incorporated. His interest in this subject was preceded by an
association during World War I and the 1920s with the chemical section of the Alien
Property Custodians Bureau where he came to know A. Mitchell Palmer, also later to
be active in the repeal movement. Upon ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment in
1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Choate, a Republican, chairman of the
Federal Alcohol Control Administration. He served in this position for two years. </p>

<p>He was born in New York February 2, 1876. His father was Joseph H. Choate, a famous
lawyer and Ambassador to England from 1899 to 1905. Joseph H. Choate, Jr. graduated
from Harvard College in 1897 and from Harvard Law School. At his death in 1968, at
age 91, he was counsel in Choate, Regan, Davis and Hollister in the Graybar Building
in Manhattan. He had residences at 950 Park Avenue, New York, in Mount Kisco, and in
North Haven, Maine. [See <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, January 20,
1968, p. 29.]</p>

<p>HARRISON TWEED served as treasurer of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers and did so
in the spirit of civic interest that marked many other of his activities. The task
was done with easy dispatch but with gusto as one of a string of similar public
activities he believed should concern lawyers. While he was one of the country's
best known and most successful lawyers, Tweed worked for years in the legal aid
movement to extend legal services to the poor and underprivileged. In 1963 he joined
Bernard Segal of Philadelphia as co-chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law, formed at the invitation of President John F. Kennedy at a White
House meeting. Tweed served as president of the Association of the Bar of the City
of New York from 1945 to 1948 and was also president at different times of the
American Law Institute and of the National Legal Aid Association. </p>

<p>Tweed was born in New York on October 18, 1885 of New England ancestry, not related
to William Marcy Tweed, the Boss of Tammany Hall in the l870s. Tweed's father,
Charles Harrison Tweed, was general counsel to prominent railroads while his mother,
Helen Minerva Evarts, was the daughter of William M. Evarts who was successively
Attorney General, Secretary of State and a United States Senator between 1868 and
1891. Tweed was himself little interested in genealogy. He graduated from Harvard in
1907 and the Harvard Law School in 1910. At the end of his career he was a partner
in Milbank, Tweed, Fadley &amp; McCloy at One Manhattan Chase Plaza. His home
was at 10 Gracie Square. Tweed died on June 16, 1969 at the age of 83. [See <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, June 18, 1969, p. 41.] </p>

<event>THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT. The evolution of prohibition covers the entire
sweep of American history beginning with colonial settlement in the 17th
century. The clergy, the educated, and other members of the Eastern elite at
first practiced and advocated temperance. Over several generations and as a
part of the movement West and the democratization of elite values,
temperance came to hold an appeal for the middle and lower classes. By the
second third of the 19th century temperance was a widely enough shared value
in the United States that organized advocates sought to outlaw alcoholic
beverages. Statewide prohibition came first in the State of Maine in 1851
through the leadership of Neal Dow of Portland, later a candidate for
President on the Prohibition Party ticket. The Woman's Christian Temperance
Union (WCTU) led by Frances Willard was the most prominent of many 19th
century organizations which sought state prohibition or, at least, local
option laws, of which many were enacted by the turn of the century. [The
best intellectual account is Joseph R. Gusfield, <title render="italic">Symbolic Crusade</title> (Urbana and London: University of Illinois
Press, 1966).] </event>

<event>THE ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE OF AMERICA. A more militant organization that was
prohibitionist in spirit was founded at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio in
1893 called the Anti-Saloon League. After forming chapters in most
communities in the state, led mainly by Baptists and Methodists, Ohio became
a model for similar organizations throughout the country. With a mass
following, well-financed, closely related to fundamentalist churches, with
full-time staffs and dynamic leaders, the Anti-Saloon League's work
exemplified skilled lobbying and had the services of zealous and able
lawyers like Wayne B. Wheeler. An increasing number of states went dry by
voting in prohibition laws. In 1913 the Anti-Saloon League of America voted
to seek national prohibition through a constitutional amendment. With wide
popular support, especially from among the leading Progressive politicians
of the day, and by persisting, Congress was persuaded to submit a
prohibition amendment on December 18, 1917. Ratification was completed on
January 16, 1919. The amendment took effect one year later. [For an
exposition of the view that the appeal of prohibition "lay largely with the
oldstock, middle class section of the American community" which
"constituted the backbone of the Progressive Movement," see James H.
Timberlake, <title render="italic">Prohibition and the Progressive Movement
1900-1920</title> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963), pp. 2-3.]
The Anti-Saloon League continued on to help draft the Volstead Act and to
administer national prohibition, and began only after Wheeler's death in
1927 to decline. [For a contemporary, muckraking account by a political
scientist, see Peter Odegard, <title render="italic">Pressure

<event>ASSOCIATION AGAINST THE PROHIBITION AMENDMENT. There had always been
opposition to laws banning the sale of alcohol and the most important single
voluntary association to enlist in the campaign for the repeal of the
Eighteenth Amendment was officially formed on December 31, 1920. The
organization called the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment had
been advocated as early as November 12, 1918 by Navy Captain William H.
Stayton. By the mid-1920s, a group of wealthy businessmen who had earlier
thought the Amendment might be beneficent joined the AAPA because they were
alarmed "over the rising crime rate, the violence of the enforcement effort,
the growth of federal power, and the perceived threat to constitutional
liberties." They included Pierre and Irenee du Pont, John J. Raskob, James
W. Wadsworth and later, Jouett Shouse. By publicity, state organization and
attention to lobbying Congress, the AAPA was always in the forefront of the
campaign to see a repeal amendment proposed by Congress. Their success came
when a repeal amendment was proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933. [For
the best account of the arguments against national prohibition by amendment
and of the organized activities of the AAPA, see David E. Kyvig, "In Revolt
Against Prohibition: The Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and

<event>VOLUNTARY COMMITTEE OF LAWYERS, INC. In 1927 some young New York City
lawyers who believed national prohibition to be wrong and unenforceable
public policy formally established a single-purpose organization called the
Voluntary Committee of Lawyers. In the lead were Joseph H. Choate, Jr., who
served as chairman of the Executive Committee, and Harrison Tweed,
Treasurer. As lawyers they believed the Eighteenth Amendment to be
illegitimate as well as unwise policy. They organized associates in every
state, took polls on the opinions of city lawyers across the country, issued
bulletins and annual reports reciting arguments against the Eighteenth
Amendment and worked closely with the Association Against the Prohibition
Amendment. The papers of Choate and Tweed in the Collection on Legal Change
today show that the most important contribution of the VCL was in the
ratification process. They stressed that a Repeal Amendment should provide
for ratification by state convention and then proceeded to prepare and place
before all state governors in February 1933 draft bills providing for
election at large of all delegates. The alertness and the prestige of the
members of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers contributed to the fact that
most states enacted the model convention bill verbatim. This helps to
account for the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5,
1933. The VCL then closed its books. [For an account based on these papers

<p><emph render="bold">This essay by University Archivist Suzy Taraba was originally published in <title render="italic">Wesleyan: the University Magazine</title> in the Winter 2003 issue.</emph></p>
<p>Did you know that Washington's Birthday was once one of the most festively celebrated holidays at Wesleyan? From at least 1863 until 1929, this holiday was a focal point of social life at Wesleyan, perhaps as important as the proms of later years.</p>
<p>Nationally, George Washington's birthday was first celebrated in Richmond, Va., in 1782, even before he became the first President of the United States in 1789. Early celebrations were erratic and sometimes controversial, particularly among the Antifederalists. By the time of Washington's death in 1799, however, he was considered a national hero. The celebration of his birthday united political factions in near universal support for honoring his memory. By 1832, the centennial of Washington's birth, commemorative celebrations in February were firmly established. At the University of Pennsylvania, for instance, festivities began as early as 1794 and had become so important by the end of the 19th century that President Grover Cleveland was an invited speaker.</p>
<p>At Wesleyan, the earliest documented celebration of Washington's Birthday was in 1863, although earlier celebrations may still come to light. Two tickets to the 1863 events survive in the Wesleyan University Archives, as does a nearly complete set of Washington's Birthday celebration programs from 1866 through 1929. From the 1860s through the 1880s, the sophomore class hosted the events, which focused on music, orations, and, most important, the public reading of Washington's famous farewell address. Throughout the 19th century, the tone of the celebration was primarily patriotic. Decorating efforts of the sophomore class proved to be particularly memorable in 1885, as reported in the <title render="italic">College Argus</title>: <emph render="doublequote">[These are the] finest decorations which have ever been seen in Memorial Chapel. The stage was draped with red, white, and blue, with a background of flags. Over the speakers was suspended an imitation of the Liberty Bell, made by ivy leaves on a wire frame. White immortelles marked the fissure in the bell, while the tongue was of white and purple flowers. . . . The organ-loft was draped with flags, in the midst of which hung a portrait of Washington, and above that a mounted eagle.</emph> In 1888, a spoof of the program was apparently staged--or at least a satiric program was prepared--featuring irreverent activities with <emph render="doublequote">Fatty Hancock</emph> serving as master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>By 1891, the tradition of patriotic music and declamations had given way to a gala banquet, at which the celebration of the country's Founding Father merged with revering Wesleyan, the Alma Mater. Alumni figured prominently among the prime revelers, and a series of toasts became a central feature of the program. The banquet was held at a variety of local venues until the opening of Fayerweather Gymnasium in 1894. Not all Wesleyan men were equally enthusiastic about the festivities: One copy of the program for the 1896 banquet includes unsigned manuscript annotations listing the order of speakers and commenting <emph render="doublequote">Newhall at every opportunity,</emph> in reference to William Rice Newhall, the toastmaster that year.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, the Washington's Birthday bash became ever more focused on Wesleyan alumni relations. In 1902, the alumni office mailed a postcard to announce the events and encourage alumni to attend, stating, <emph render="doublequote">We believe that the Washington's Birthday Banquet will bring together the largest and most enthusiastic body of Wesleyan men ever assembled.</emph></p>
<p>In this period, such longstanding Wesleyan traditions as the <emph render="doublequote">cannon scrap,</emph> a contest between the freshman and sophomore classes, became part of the weekend of Washington's Birthday festivities. In some years, Washington's Birthday was a time for <emph render="doublequote">sub-freshmen</emph> (the <emph render="doublequote">prefosh</emph> of their day) to visit campus; in others, it was an alumni weekend, featuring seminars and vocational programs. The 1920 Washington's Birthday events were among the most elaborate. In addition to the banquet, events included Visitors' Days, during which classes and laboratories were open to visitors; the Fourth Annual Wesleyan University Teachers' Conference, aimed at the 26 percent of Wesleyan graduates engaged in teaching; and athletic events, concerts, and a student theatrical presentation, <emph render="doublequote">The George Washington Follies,</emph> preceded by a very early performance of jazz by the college orchestra.</p>
<p>Although Wesleyan's celebration of Washington's Birthday began as a reflection of a national holiday, by the 1920s it no longer mirored the national scene so closely. In fact, the national celebration of Washington's Birthday peaked in 1932, the bicentennial of his birth. At Wesleyan, the main event that year was an exhibition of Washingtonia in Olin Library, a very distinguished collection of documents and memorabilia from a variety of sources, but a far cry from the heyday of the gala banquet just a few years earlier. The final documented Wesleyan Washington's Birthday celebration was in 1941, when New York alumni gathered at the Hotel Roosevelt for a banquet and reenactment of the cannon scrap of 1917. Many of the attendees were graduates from the World War I era, fondly remembering their college days.</p>

<p>The following historical note was taken from the WSA's website, <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/about/history.htm" show="new" actuate="onrequest" linktype="simple">http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/about/history.htm</extref>, on 21 June 2006.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) is the legislative and deliberative body of the Wesleyan College Body. The WSA is comprised of 37 members and consists of nine standing committees: the Executive Committee, Coordinating Committee, Community Outreach Committee, Educational Policy Committee, Finance and Facilities Committee, Student Affairs Committee, Student Budget Committee, Independent Projects Committee, Student Trustees Committee and the Student Institutional Advisory Priorities Committee. The WSA responsibilities include allocating the College Body Tax to the 170+ student groups, meeting regularly with President Bennet, serving on the standing committees of the Board of Trustees, affecting academic and non-academic policy and improving Wesleyan-Middletown relations. The WSA maintains its offices at 190 High St. Cari Macdermott served as the WSA office coordinator from 1978 until her retirement in the spring of 2005. She was replaced by Lisa Hendrix, the new WSA office coordinator.</p>

<p>Student government originated as the College Body Senate in 1903. "The College Body of Wesleyan University" was formed in 1963 in response to a desire for better organization and was directed by the College Body Committee, comprised of five elected undergraduates. In 1975, the Wesleyan Students' Union was to fill the need for an organization to lobby specifically on behalf of student interests. A $1 membership was required. In 1978, 89% of the voting population approved a campus-wide referendum and the Wesleyan Student Assembly was formed. The Assembly was comprised of seven standing committees with 45 members serving during the fall term and 38 members during the spring term. Membership was distributed across the geographic boundaries of the campus stretching from In-Town to Butterfield.</p>

<p>The WSA has undergone a number of changes in composition throughout its history. In 1980, the Assembly had 37 members, in 1981 the membership was 27 members. The Assembly was again altered in 1984 to 28 members and persisted in this form until 1992 when the organization was expanded to 40 members. Representation has been changed from geographically based to year based and the leadership was shifted from the Coordinator position to a President, Vice-President format during the 1990's. In 1997, the WSA underwent its last iteration and now stands at 37 members.</p>

<p>The WSA enjoys a storied history of successes, reforms and restructurings as well as dramatic resignations and heated debate. In 1994, the Assembly experienced the "comedy of errors" when WSA elections were invalidated when an inadequate number of representatives were elected. In 1998, the absence of funding for the Film Board sparked the Film Series Controversy. Over the previous two academic years, the Assembly has played an integral role in the University's recent efforts at curricular renewal and reform of graduation requirements as well as influencing party policy, residential life issues and supporting efforts at responsible investing.</p>

<p>Wesleyan Clinic Escorts is a group that trains and organizes students to escort patients past anti-abortion protesters at women's clinics in Connecticut, primarily at Summit Women's Center in Bridgeport, CT. The group was founded by Wesleyan student Jessica Fondy in 1991 when she discovered that Summit was being picketed by protesters. The group was initially a subsidiary of Students for Reproductive Choice, but as interest in SRC dropped, Wesleyan Clinic Escorts became a separate entity. As of spring 2008, Wesleyan Clinic Escorts is still in existence.

<p>What would come to be called WESU began in 1939 when two students living in Clark
Hall connected a transmitter to a phonograph and began broadcasting short
transmissions down their hall. As time progressed, the pair extended their broadcast
range by illicitly attaching their transmitter to the network of water pipes beneath
Wesleyan, slowly expanding until most of the campus had become an antenna. From
these mischievous beginnings, the station quickly became a legitimate campus
fixture, broadcasting throughout the Middletown area in the early 1940's on an AM
signal under the call letters "WES". In 1950, updated Federal Communications
Commission law granted the station its four-letter moniker "WESU." In 1967, WESU
underwent two crucial changes-the station switched over to FM broadcasting, and its
broadcasting license was transferred to the Wesleyan Broadcast Association, a
non-profit corporation founded by the WESU Board of Directors as an entity
independent from Wesleyan University. The years that followed saw an increase in
non-Wesleyan involvement in the station, as members of the surrounding community
came to serve as DJs and, by the mid 1990's, hold positions on the Board of
Directors. In 1980, WESU precipitated a nation-wide college boycott of Arista
Records regarding what the WESU board saw to be the unfair treatment of college
radio stations. In 1990, however, the Wesleyan Broadcast Association forfeited its
incorporated status. In 2003, Wesleyan University entered into negotiations to
acquire the license back from WESU, and it succeeded. The years that followed saw
the University's addition of NPR programming to the WESU broadcast day, and the
University's reconfiguration of the WESU Board, removing non-Wesleyan community
members from voting positions.</p>

<head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Moses Clark White was born in Paris, Oneida County, New York on July 24, 1819. He was a graduate of the Wesleyan Class of 1845. By the time of graduation, White had already decided that he would devote his life to missionary work in China. He had been influenced by a sermon, <title render="doublequote">A Call to the Ministry</title> by the Rev. Stephen Olin, around 1835 and entered the Cazenovia Seminary in 1840. In February 1842, he entered Wesleyan and graduated in 1845. Under Olin's guidance, he spent two years after graduation in New Haven studying medicine and theology at Yale. He sometimes preached in the neighboring town of Milford.</p>

<p>He married Jane Isabel Atwater of Homer, Cortland County, New York on March 13, 1847. Born on August 26, 1822, she entered the Oneida Conference Seminary at Cazenovia in 1839 and graduated in July 1842 with high honors. At the seminary, she formed a close friendship with Mary Seely and it is here that she met Moses White who was preparing for college. From 1842 to February 1847, she was a teacher in the Sabbath School in Rochester, N.Y. </p>

<p>Jane also had a missionary calling and together they sailed on the <emph render="italic">Heber</emph> for Fuh Chau, China, on April 15, 1847. They arrived there after a five month voyage on September 7, 1847. Jane became sick shortly after arriving and died seven months later of consumption on May 25, 1848 at the age of 26. </p>

<p>At Fuh Chau, White served as both doctor and missionary, and conducted a school for the secular and religious instruction of the Chinese of that city. He studied and treated the toxic effects of opium, as well as translated the Gospel of Matthew. It was the first Christian document ever published in the colloquial dialect of that region. </p>

<p>Moses White was married a second time to Mary Seely in Foochow in 1851. Mary Seely was from Onondaga, New York and went to China as a missionary with Dr. Isaac W. Wiley and his wife. It was by Mary that Moses had children. (Isaac Wiley received an honorary degree from Wesleyan in 1864.)</p>

<p>Mary Seely White returned to New Haven in 1852 because of poor health. Due to his own bad health, Moses White also left China in 1853 for New Haven where he resumed medical studies at Yale and began a medical practice which he continued until the end end of his life. He received an MD degree from Yale in 1854. Mary White died in 1887. Moses White died on October 24, 1900.</p>

<p>In January 1916, Wesleyan University first started an elective course in military science. Once the United Stated entered the war in April 1917, Wesleyan established an infantry unit of the Reserve Officers Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) and a Certificate of Military Training. This certificate was a three year course designed for students under 21 years of age to become officers in the national army. Major Henry Sollet Wygant, U.S.A (retired) was the professor of Military Science and Tactics. </p>
<p>In August 1918 the draft age dropped from 21 to 18. The university immediately adopted the Student Army Training Corps (S.A.T.C.), which the War Department created to replace the R.O.T.C program. This program allowed the students to continue with their education as well as prepare them for warfare. It divided their courses into five areas of study correlated to the different branches of the military. Group A included infantry, artillery, and machine gun; Group B, aviation; Group C, quartermaster corps; Group D, chemical warfare services; and Group E, truck and transport services. The students were divided into four groups according to their age: Class I- 20 year olds, Class II- 19 year olds, Class III-18 year olds, and Class IV were volunteers who were under 18 years of age. However once the armistice with Germany was signed on November 11, 1918, the Wesleyan S.A.T.C. demobilized starting on December 10 and was completed by December 20, 1918. On January 2, 1919 the university reopened with all work on a civilian status.

<p>Wesleyan University began offering classes about women's issues in the early 1970s, which was shortly after the first women were admitted to Wesleyan in 1968. Women's Studies was housed within the American Studies program for the duration of the 1970s. In 1980, a Women's Studies Program was formed, but it did not become an official major until 1989.</p>

<p>The name of the program was changed to <emph render="doublequote">Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies</emph> in 2006 to better reflect the changing nature of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Henry Merritt Wriston was born on July 4, 1889 in Laramie, Wyoming, and grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts. Wriston graduated from Wesleyan University with a bachelor's degree in 1911, a master's degree in 1912, and then earned his Ph.D. at Harvard University. After serving as an instructor and then full professor of history at Wesleyan from 1914 to 1925, he was appointed president of Lawrence College (now University) in Appleton, Wisconsin. At the age of 35, Wriston was reported to be the youngest college president in the country.</p>
<p>In 1937, Wriston became president of Brown University. He made major changes to the curriculum and the faculty, encouraging students to do their own research and drop in on classes in which they were interested. The changes prompted John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to donate $4 million in 1955 in recognition of Wriston's accomplishments.</p>
<p>In 1954, John Foster Dulles appointed Wriston to a committee to improve the efficiency of the diplomatic corps. Wriston continued to be involved in politics and public issues following his departure from Brown in 1955. In 1960, President Eisenhower appointed him as chairman of the Presidential Commission on Nation Goals. He also served in various capacities with the American Assembly, the World Peace Foundation, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Wriston died on March 8, 1978. His first wife, Ruth Colton Bigelow, preceded him in death. Wriston was survived by his second wife, Marguerite Woodworth, whom he married in 1947. Wriston was also survived by two children, Walter B. Wriston and Barbara Wriston.</p>

<p>The Young Men's Republican Club was Wesleyan's first Republican political
organization. It was founded on June 21, 1856, with the goal of aiding in the
election of John C. Fremont to the presidency (and William L. Dayton to the
vice-presidency) of the United States. The election of 1856 was the first in U.S.
history to be contested by the newly formed Republican Party. Fremont ran on a free
soil platform, opposing the expansion of the institution of slavery to Kansas. Many
of his most vocal supporters were abolitionists, and many northern Methodists were
<emph render="doublequote">free soilers</emph> (who opposed the expansion of slavery) or abolitionists. A
significant number of Wesleyan students were vocal supporters of the Republican
Party in the early years, and much of their rhetoric centered on their opposition to
slavery in Kansas. </p>

<p>Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts (CFA) complex of buildings, designed by Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo and Associates, opened in 1973. One building was designed as a new gallery space, known as the CFA galleries, to be dedicated primarily to contemporary art and student works. After construction, the gallery was occasionally divided into two separate exhibition spaces, known as the CFA North and CFA South galleries. This space augmented the university’s Davison Art Center gallery, whose focus was primarily on printmaking and photography. The CFA gallery was renamed the Ezra [Wesleyan class of 1947] and Cecile Zilkha Gallery in the fall of 1982 in honor of a gift from The Zilkha Foundation, Inc.
