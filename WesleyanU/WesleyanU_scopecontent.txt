<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
This collection contains the surviving records of the club. The two scorebooks provide detailed inning-by-inning statistics for Agallian players for each of the recorded games; most games have dates and duration of time ascribed to them and scorer and umpire identification. Some matches which are recorded in these volumes took place against other Wesleyan teams as well as Connecticut baseball clubs and teams from other universities.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
This collection consists of a single document, an 1805 ship's manifest, which lists the cargo of the Brig Thetis of Hartford. The Brig Thetis was owned by Joseph W. Alsop of Middletown and David Watkinson and William Watkinson of Hartford, and captained by Alsop. According to the manifest, the cargo listed was taken aboard at St. Croix and Turks Islands on December 6, 1804 and was bound for Middletown. The manifest also suggests that the Brig Thetis itself was built in Middletown. Items listed in the manifest include rum, molasses, empty bottles, coconuts, oranges, sugar, salt and old iron. The back side of the manifest was completed on October 12, 1805, presumably upon the ship's arrival in Middletown. The surveyor George Wolcott acted as witness, signing his name and verifying the manifest as accurate.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection contains anecdotes written by Wesleyan alumni from the classes of 1859 to 1936. Major topics include their experiences with former Wesleyan professors, pranks performed with their classmates, the burning of North College in 1906, and the arrival of women on campus in 1872. Some sample reminscences:</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Herbert L. Connelly, class of 1909:</emph> The frequenters of the front porches of Beta Theta Pi, Alpha Delta Phi, Eclectic, and Psi Upsilon after many and sundry observations during a period extending over month and even years finally came to the brilliant conclusion that Professor Armstrong, while en route from his home to Fisk Hall, had developed a custom, either consciously or unconsciously, of telegraphing to the world his plans of the ensuing class session. It was all a question of what clothes and decorations the Professor had on as he passed these hot beds of research. Hundreds of observations had proved to these young savants beyond all peradventure of a doubt that <emph render="doublequote">Army's</emph> plan to give a lecture or hold a recitation were indicated as follows:</p>
<p>Dark Coat, lights trousers, and jewelry across the vest = Lecture</p>
<p>Light Coat, dark trousers, and no jewelry across the vest = Recitation</p>
<p>The students planned accordingly.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">M. Eugene Culver, class of 1875</emph>: I do not wish to close these rambling recollections without speaking of the first girls who came to college. My class of '75, of course, entered in 1871, but in 1872 the first co-eds were entered in college. There were four of them: Jennie Larned, Phebe Almeda Stone, Hannah Ada Taylor and Angie Villette Warren. I used to feel sorry for them because they could not join any of the fraternities, and have the pleasure that the rest of us enjoyed. They roomed somewhere on William Street and used to go parading up the College walks to recitations two by two. All I could thing of was the old song about Noah building an ark and <emph render="doublequote">put in the animals two by two, the elephant and the kangaroo.</emph> They were good scholars, all of them. Jennie Larned, the youngest girl, from Tennessee, who used to wear her hair flowing down her back in very luxuriant style, reminded me of a Shetland pony with his mane hanging down. As I recall it, she came nearest to having the highest marks of anybody in the class, but I believe that George Coleman exceeded her by a small margin. All of the other girls made Phi Beta Kappa, and Phebe Stone got first grade, the same as Jennie Larned. Co-education was not popular with our class. Some of the boys were very outspoken with reference to it; but one of them, Leonard L Beeman, married Phebe Almeda Stone. He afterwards became a minister and went to Vermont. It was currently reported that, if he was indisposed when Sunday came, Phebe Almeda went into the pulpit and preached for him. </p>

<p><emph render="bold">Nelson C. Hubbard, class of 1892</emph>: Anyone who was in college when Woodrow Wilson was there will remember his interest in the football team and his habit of carrying a wrapped umbrella which he used as a cane. In those days sparring ability served linesmen in good stead, and we were not always able to measure up to the quality with which our much larger opponents would be equipped. Those were the days, by the way, when signals were given, not in numbers but in phrases, and when one of our most energetic and efficient rushers, on receiving the ball, would automatically stop, throw his cap on the ground, and then proceed bareheaded on his diligent way. The first time I ever saw Woodrow to know him was at a football game, when he was excitedly marching up and down opposite the line-up, and when his uncapped fellow was slugged and knocked flat, he completely lost his temper, flourished his umbrella-cane in the air, and loudly yelled, <emph render="doublequote">Kill him! Kill him!</emph> I remembered this a good many years later when he was scheduled to address the New York Wesleyan alumni group on <emph render="doublequote">Peace</emph> or some such matter, and I planned to attend and confront him with his record, but was unable to go.</p>

<scopecontent><p><title render="doublequote">The Songs of Alpha Delta Phi</title> was originally released as a set of three 78 RPM records. Unfortunately, no date is printed on the record labels, so we do not know when these recordings were made. Because the lyrics of <title render="doublequote">We Come With A Shout And A Song</title> require the singers to insert the name of their college, we know that the performers are from the Cornell chapter. The authors, where known, are listed as they appear in the <title render="doublequote">Song Book of Alpha Delta Phi</title> published in 1912.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent><p>Contains CDs.</p></scopecontent>

<p>This collection includes operating documents, memoranda, correspondence and notes of
the Wesleyan chapter of the AAUP from 1973 to 1987. It also includes published
information from the national AAUP and from AAUP branches at other institutions,
most notably Yale and Trinity College. It also contains books and pamphlets put out
by the AAUP, mainly from the 1970s, as well as membership kits from several years.
The chronological files contain notes, memoranda, and correspondence from members of
the AAUP to the group, and between the AAUP and the administration.</p>
<p>The largest portion of the collection, Series 1: Accession #2010-10, consists of
chronological files from the Wesleyan chapter, beginning in 1973 and ending in 1986.
There is a gap with only a few documents from the 1978-1979 school year. The greater
part of the documents from 1978-1979 are contained in box 5. The first two boxes are
entirely chronological, spanning from August 1973 to May 1982. Box three completes
the chronological files up until December 1986. It also includes folders containing
undated documents and collected documents on several subjects, including documents
from the national AAUP, compensation information from various institutions,

on lined paper. Many of the documents are on AAUP letterhead.</p>

<p>During the early period, major correspondents include then-President of the
University Colin Campbell and Wesleyan AAUP president pro tem Victor Gourevitch.
Campbell remains one of the main correspondents in the collection throughout the
period from 1973 to 1987. Beginning in 1977, much of the correspondence from the
administration is signed by Nathanael Greene, then VP for Academic Affairs, while
others are signed by Richard W. Greene. AAUP documents beginning in early 1977 are
often signed by Vernon K. Dibble, Peter Kilby, Erhard Konerding, Richard Boyd,
Meredith Swenson and/or Andrew Szegedy-Mazak. Of interest in the period of 1975-1976
are several letters to and from then-CIA director George H. W. Bush regarding the
activities of the CIA on university campuses. In 1978, several documents feature the
signature of Hayden White, then director of the Wesleyan Center for the Humanities.
In the later period, (beginning in 1979 or so) Burton Sonnenstein becomes one of the
main correspondents for the AAUP. Correspondence from U.S. representatives Sam
Gejdenson and Toby Moffett relating to AAUP issues is featured during 1982.
Beginning in 1985, David Adams, Henry Abelove, Paul Haake, and Donald Moon were all
major correspondents.</p>
<p>The major topic of this collection is the various disputes and negotiations between
the AAUP and Wesleyan’s administration in the period between 1973 and 1986. Other
topics addressed include the political activities of the AAUP on the national level.
Box 1, folder 14 contains documents relating to the AAUP’s opposition to what it saw
as the infiltration of universities by the CIA. Of interest are letters to and from
the CIA director at the time, George H. W. Bush, as well as printed materials put
out by the AAUP on the subject of the CIA’s dealings with universities. In box 3,
folders 10-15 are arranged thematically. Folder 10 contains AAUP documents published
by the national organization during 1985 and 1986. Folder 11 contains information on
compensation at various colleges and universities considered to be Wesleyan’s <emph render="doublequote">peer institutions.</emph> Folder 12 contains historical
documents on the reactivation of the AAUP at Wesleyan, as well as a draft of the
group’s constitution. Folder 14 contains documents sent from the national AAUP to
the chapter head at Wesleyan, and Folder 15 contains collected salary information
from Wesleyan and its peer institutions throughout the period of 1973-1986. Box 5,
folders 1 and 2 are AAUP office files covering 1986-87 and contain an agenda,

contains documents relating to the Center for the Humanities and Wesleyan

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
The content of the John E. Andrus Papers collection spans many subjects and years. The earliest documents are found in the first folder and are from his final years at school. The folder otherwise consists of general letters written and received by Andrus throughout his life. A few are about his time at school, but most are in reference to his later occupations, including his teaching position and tenure as Mayor of Yonkers. A particularly touching letter is in response to a note of bereavement from a friend or acquaintance. Andrus's response thanks this person, and describes his deep sadness at the loss of his wife in poignant prose. Another personal letter is to his daughter, Ida, expressing his desire to help with her (unstated) illness in whatever way he can. A final letter in the collection is to then-President of McConaughy of Wesleyan, announcing his resignation from the position of trustee at Wesleyan due to his declining health.
</p>

<p>The second folder contains a single document, a selection from an alumnus newsletter in 1930. This newsletter announces Andrus' recent distinction as oldest living alumnus, and includes a rather touching and fascinating letter from Andrus to the University community. In this letter, Andrus recounts a rather amusing story about his journey from New York to Wesleyan in the late 1850s and expresses his hopes for Wesleyan students and alumni.</p>

<p>The third folder consists of a collection of general notes and writings, including papers related to do the Union Line Railroad and the United States Treasury. There is also an unlabeled and rather unusual, poetic document that discusses what Andrus (presumably) would bequeath to seven grandchildren. Additionally, there is a long handwritten speech, presumably given to a group of Wesleyan Alumni sometime after the turn of the century.</p>

<p>The final folder includes a collection of academic essays written by Andrus, presumably in his time at school, on a range of subjects from science to religion.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection contains meeting notes from the April 29 Coalition and their arrangements for the May 12, 1982 North College Sit-in to reinstate Wesleyan University's aid-blind admissions policy. Since this occured before the invention of cell phones, there are many letters written by the 19 students who spent 150 hours locked in North College. The coalition had a team of runners that would deliver supplies and messages to those locked in. The sit-in was also during the same time as reading week and the annual Spring Fling concert.</p>

<p>The sit-in caused some unusual problems. For example, the university locked the students out of the bathroom facilities. If they were to leave to go to the bathroom they would be locked out. In response to this situation, students used a bag in a corner of one of the administrators' offices and periodically lowered the bag of refuse out the window. In response, the administration reported them to Student Judicial Board (SJB) and tried to shut the sit-in down. The SJB decided that the bathrooms should be unlocked, the students should be allowed support runners, and the students should move to more public offices. </p>

<p>The collection includes meeting notes of the April 29th Coalition and a series of press releases sent out about the status of the negotiations with President Colin Campbell. Separate from the movement, there is a letter of solidarity written to the students of Medgar Evers College. Even though their grievances with their administration were different (such as the lack of a black studies program even though the campus was 90 percent black, and the lack of day-care facilities at a school with 73 percent female enrollment, over half of them with children), they shared in their goal for equal access education and student power in decision making.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The bulk of the Apostles Club Records are meeting minutes, which were recorded
beginning in 1894 until the last meeting in 1967, although they become increasingly
more detailed in later years. Up until early 1952 the minutes were recorded in
journals, but after that the secretaries began to type them. The minutes specified
host and presenter for each meeting, as well as the topic of discussion. In addition
to minutes, there are a few pieces of correspondence from 1939, two clippings about
the Apostles Club from 1895 and 1897, and lists of members between 1920 and 1965. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
Content of this collection spans from about 2005 to about 2008.
</p>
<p>The first folder consists of three cloth signs emblazoned with slogans supporting the tenure of Professor Isaac. </p>
<p>The second folder contains a CD with a variety of documents. A few dozen photos from a rally for Professor Isaac's tenure, a letter to then-future President Roth about the Isaac issue, a Wespeak about Asian American studies, and miscellaneous meeting notes and attendance sheets, are among the documents. </p>
<p>The third and last folder includes paper copies of some of the photos from the rally to support Isaac, a letter to various Asian American activist listservs about the Isaac issue, a letter to Williams BiLGATA about protesting Wesleyan President Douglas Bennet's honorary Williams degree because of his lack of support for Professor Isaac, and numerous letters from concerned students and alumnus to President Roth expressing support for Isaac. Also included is a pamphlet entitled "Diversity University?-Asian American Studies at Wesleyan, Past, Present, and Future" which highlights some of the protestor's key issues. Other documents have more to do with the AASC as a student group-meeting and organization fliers, a letter to the Student Budget Committee (SBC) about funding requests, mission statements, and an Asian American Studies Cluster introduction. Finally, a letter detailing the request to reconsider Professor Isaac's tenure, signed as a petition by hundreds of students. </p>

<p>As much as possible, the original folder titles have been maintained. In the
container list below, these titles have been transcribed as accurately as
possible. There is not a distinction made between the original folder titles and
those provided by the processor.</p>

<p>Bennet's papers are filed in reverse date order, with the most recent in front.
This arrangement has been maintained where found within a folder. The folders
themselves are arranged in progressive date order. Thus, folders will be filed
January to December, but within the January folder the first page would be
January 31.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series I: Executive service</emph>
</p>

<p>Bennet worked for the State Department for much of his professional career. His
first professional assignment, from 1963 to 1966, was in India as assistant to
the economic advisor for the Agency for International Development, and then as
special assistant to Ambassador Chester Bowles. Bennet was Assistant Secretary
of State in two capacities: for Congressional Relations from 1977 to 1979, and
for International Organization Affairs from 1993 to 1995. He also served as
administrator for the Agency for International Development (AID) from 1979 to
1981. Bennet's executive service also included employment as a speech writer for
Vice President Hubert Humphrey from 1967 to 1968. The collection contains realia
from the 1968 Humphrey/Muskie presidential campaign.</p>

<p>This series contains "chron files," which are chronological correspondence. Files
labeled "personal correspondence" are formal letters which relate to
professional issues. The series also contains many speeches written by Bennet
during his India days, as well as speeches written for Vice President Humphrey
during his 1968 bid for the presidency. Bennet traveled extensively as
administrator for AID and this sub-series contains many photographs.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series II: Legislative service</emph>
</p>

<p>Bennet was administrative assistant to two senators, Thomas F. Eagleton of
Missouri from 1969 to 1973, and Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut from 1973 to
1974. Bennet made an unsuccessful run for the House of Representatives in 1974,
and went on to be staff director of the newly formed Senate Budget Committee
from 1974 to 1977.</p>

<p>The Eagleton sub-series documents the fraught 1972 campaign with Eagleton as the
running mate of George McGovern. The series documents Bennet's active role in
framing the 1972 Democratic platform. There are also extensive newspaper
clippings as well as files on the pivotal 18 days in July of 1972 when Eagleton
was under siege and eventually withdrew. A PDF containing a list of magazines
with coverage of this event which were removed from this part of the collection
is available at: <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/MagazinesRemoved.pdf">Magazines Removed</extref>
(http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/MagazinesRemoved.pdf).</p>

<p>The documentation of Bennet's brief tenure as administrative assistant to Senator
Ribicoff is minimal. It is represented only by "memos," which are the equivalent
of "chron files." His departure was voluntary, driven by his decision to run for
the House of Representatives in the 1974 election. This section of the
collection is interesting for the insider's guide it provides to mounting a
national campaign. This sub-series consists entirely of correspondence and
subject files.</p>

<p>The Senate Budget Committee (SBC) sub-series contains chron files and subject
files, including some speeches. The bulk of the series, however, is composed of
the history of the SBC during its first two years. A PDF containing a list of
government documents removed from this part of the collection is available at:
<extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/GovDocsRemoved.pdf">Gov Docs Removed</extref>
(http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/GovDocsRemoved.pdf).</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series III: Roosevelt Center for American Policy
Studies</emph>
</p>

<p>The Roosevelt Center series documents Bennet's 18 months as president of a new
public policy think tank. The papers document his active engagement in the
creation of this organization. They also document his dismissal by the chairman
of the board.</p>

<p>Because Bennet was between jobs from January to December of 1981 and from June to
December of 1983, this series contains materials that precede and extend beyond
his actual tenure at the Center.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series IV: National Public Radio (NPR)</emph>
</p>

<p>The bulk of Bennet's papers from his ten years as president of NPR are held at
the <extref href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/"> National Public Broadcasting
Archives</extref>, [http://www.lib.umd.edu/NPBA/].</p>

<p>The papers contained in this series give evidence of Bennet's success in bringing
that organization from a tenuous financial position to one with a bright future.
Much of the series is composed of speeches and articles from that period. There
are also files on speech topics of particular interest to public radio. The
subject files span the ten years, from early objectives to his eventual
departure. A PDF containing a list of books removed from this part of the
collection is available at: <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/BooksRemoved.pdf">Books
Removed</extref>
(http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/BooksRemoved.pdf).</p>

<p>Subjects such as "AID correspondence" fall under this series due to their date
range and original location within the papers, even though they are not directly
related to NPR.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series V: Personal</emph>
</p>

<p>The personal series has three sub-series: correspondence, education, and subject
files. Since these are primarily professional papers, personal correspondence is
not well represented, although there is a collection of family Christmas cards
sent by Bennet's parents throughout his childhood. There are also letters from
his time in India from 1963 to 1965.</p>

<p>The education sub-series contains class notebooks, papers, and bibliographies
from Bennet's years at Wesleyan, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. Of particular note is
the file: "EQV: a history" [EQV stands for Esse Quam Videre]. This file
documents Wesleyan's break with the fraternity Alpha Chi Rho on the grounds of
intolerance, an event in which Bennet played a significant role.</p>

<p>Noteworthy in the subject files is a family scrapbook. The items in this
scrapbook were not pasted in and are now housed in an acid free folder. Included
are handwritten notes, presumably from Bennet's mother, explaining some of the
documents. The scrapbook also contains an embroidered 19th century sampler.</p>

<p>
<emph render="bold">Series VI: News Clips</emph>
</p>

<p>News Clips are compilations of clippings prepared by the State Department's
Office of Press Relations in the Bureau of Public Affairs. They were published
daily. This series is a substantially complete run from 1993 March to 1995 May,
during Bennet's time as Assistant Secretary of State for International
Organization Affairs.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>



<p>The diary of Lorenzo Whiting Blood was written from 1835 when he was a freshman at Wesleyan, to 1844, when he was a Methodist minister in Mystic, Connecticut. During this period, Blood traveled throughout much of Connecticut, along with some stops in Massachusetts (where his future wife lived)and New York City. Blood wrote about many Methodist ministers, especially his professor Dr. Fisk, as well as many parish members throughout his travels. Blood does not dwell too often on any one person; though he does occasionally mention his wife, Elizabeth Smith and first child, Mary, it is only when something dire occurs that they are mentioned. Blood dwells heavily upon his faith towards God, often ending almost every entry with some assurance to his everlasting devotion to the Almighty. There are also three brief mentions of Blood's sentiments towards abolitionism. </p>

<p>Blood often remarked about Wesleyan University's student body being somewhat unfaithful towards the Methodist faith, and expresses his sentiments towards a more conscious school. There are many Methodist churches written about by Blood in his diary, including, <emph render="doublequote">The African Church,</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Farm Hill,</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Westfield Baptist Church,</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Staddle Hill,</emph> along with the churches in Litchfield and Mystic where he was a minister. Blood also spends a great deal of time discussing the educational facilities of Wesleyan University and the Amenia Seminary, along with schools he created in Cheshire and Bradleysville. Blood also took part in many of the regional Methodist quarterly meetings, including the North East conference at Lymn. The diary is written to page 131 but pages 4 through 12 are blank. Also, the physical design of the diary is about 200 pages, but there is nothing written from page 131 to 200, except for a few names in the very back of the book. The diary is entirely handwritten in cursive, and although the first page appears to be written in Latin, the rest of the book is completely in English. </p>


<p>The majority of the diary entries date from Blood's time at Wesleyan University from 1835 to 1838. Blood starts the journal with a look into his past as he explains being raised by Hindal, a cloth trader, who used to beat him regularly. He then identifies himself as a freshman at Wesleyan University, who is training to be a minister of the Methodist faith. During his freshman year he became a member of the Missionary Lyceum, and mentions a <emph render="doublequote">member of Colored Preachers</emph> who was very helpful. After completing his exams, Blood traveled to the state prison in Wethersfield where he preached to about two hundred inmates with good behavior. Also during his summer break, Blood visited a school for the deaf at Hartford where he was amazed at the <emph render="doublequote">conversations with their hands.</emph> He also attended a Methodist quarterly meeting where there were <emph render="doublequote">joyous celebrations all night.</emph> After the Annual Commencement at Wesleyan on August 23, 1835, Blood spoke at the African Church on September 27, where he was shocked at their zealousness. </p>

<p>On November 14, 1835, Blood left Wesleyan University to teach at a school in Cheshire; however, on March 10, 1836 Blood had to close his school. Blood then returned to Wesleyan University, but unfortunately had to take twice the normal course load. Back at Wesleyan, he preached at the Alms House and Farm Hill, but he still wished to do more. After his sophomore examinations, Blood went to his hometown to visit his mother and his future wife, Elizabeth Smith. At home he discovered his brother was planning to leave on a whaling voyage, so he rushed off to Coostan, Massachuetts to stop him. Though finding his brother's ship to have terrible living standards, Blood let his brother go because he wanted to explore the world. During the start of the new semester, Blood writes that he has doubts about his faith towards God and it makes him want to cry. However, Blood recovered and on November 3, 1836, he left Wesleyan University again, this time to teach at the Amenia Seminary. </p>

<p>After some initial hesitation, Blood became fully acquainted with the Amenia Seminary and became a valuable member of the school. On March 16, 1837, Blood contracted the measles, leaving him on the verge of death for two months during his stay in the Amenia Seminary. However, with the help of Dr. Stanton and Mrs. Clark, he was able to recover and returned to Middletown. Soon after returning, however, Blood was called back to the Amenia Seminary by the new headmaster, Clark. After the term finished on October 13, Blood traveled to New York City, then back to Middletown. By winter break, Blood was again near the top of his class in most of his studies and was preaching frequently at Staddle Hill. His last semester at Wesleyan University passed by uneventfully, and after he completed his final examination, Blood went to Litchfield where he preached in different three churches. On August 4, 1838, Blood went back to Middletown for his commencement where he graduated with 26 other men. After returning to Litchfield, Blood decided to set up a select school in Bradleysville on November 13. </p>

<p>In the February 2, 1839 diary entry, Blood crosses out a large portion of the entry seemingly because it discusses the adultery of a parish member and questions whether the husband will ever come back to the family. In the following entry, another section is crossed out which reads that the husband did in fact come back. </p>

<p>On March 1, Blood had to close his school yet again, and decided to go on a <emph render="doublequote">pilgrim to sojourns.</emph> After his travels he decided to go to the Methodist North East Conference at Lymn, where he was upset about the lack of discussion of abolitionism. On June 19, 1839, Blood married Elizabeth Smith and received notice that he would be preaching in a small Methodist church in South Hadley. Here he lived in a one room apartment near the Church, which though it was small, was comfortable. On March 1, 1841, Blood's first daughter, Mary, was born, and soon after Blood was ordained as deacon to Stafford. On June 17, 1843, Blood attended the Eastford Conference, which to his bitterness upheld the doctrine of slavery. The issue was once again brought up at the General Conference, but out of the fear of the southern Methodist breaking away from the Church, slavery was again upheld. The diary ends with Blood being appointed to Mystic, Connecticut, as the Methodist minister there.

Victor Butterfield's reports on his interviews with those in education in the Middle East give a clear picture of the situation at that time (1952-1953). The details reflect Butterfield's values. While Butterfield was making his study, the Fund for Advancement of Education, a division of the Ford Foundation, under whose auspices he made the study, was reorganized and its field limited to the United States. Butterfield's study was then transferred to the Overseas [Activities] Division of the Ford Foundation, which was concentrating on projects to help the countries economically. They had no interest in Education - rather in agriculture and engineering. Leadership in the Ford Foundation also changed. Butterfield later mentioned his report to the new head who knew nothing of it. Nothing was ever done.

<p>Excepting two copies of court records from 1851 and 1853, the collection contains correspondence addressed to Arthur Benjamin Calef dating from 1856 to 1861. John Woodruff is the author of the bulk of the correspondence; his letters - usually marked <emph render="doublequote">private</emph> - chiefly relate to the political situation in Washington, D.C. and Connecticut, especially with regards to pre-Civil War tensions, campaigning, and Calef's appointment to the position of Middletown Postmaster. Other letters are also primarily politically motivated, but include requests for references from Calef or requests that he exert his influence to procure letter-writers certain positions, etc. These letter-writers include Connecticut Governor William A. Buckingham. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Albert Camus Papers consist of correspondence, manuscript and typescript drafts of Camus writings, photographs, and a questionnaire completed by Camus, which was sent to him by Wesleyan Professor Carl Viggiani. All materials are in French.
</p>
<p>The four pieces of correspondence are all from Camus. One is to Wesleyan English professor Fred B. Millett, dated 1946, in which he declines an invitation. A second piece of correspondence, dated 1957, is addressed to Romance Languages and Literatures professor Carl Viggiani, and addresses questions that had been posed by Viggiani. The final two letters are to Wesleyan President Victor Butterfield, dated 1959. In the first, dated Feburary 18, Camus declines an honor that has been offered him by Wesleyan University--possibly an honorary degree. The second letter, dated March 18, thanks Butterfield for his gift of a set of William Faulkner books.</p>

<p>The circa 1957 questionnaire is fourteen pages, and inquires about Camus' family, studies, experiences, opinions, and feelings, specifically for the time period 1913 to 1943. Camus has replied to all questions in pencil.</p>

<p><title render="doublequote">Hellenisme et Christianisme,</title> written about Plotinus and St. Augustine, was Camus' thesis for the University of Algeria, submitted to the Faculty of Letters. A manuscript and typescript of this work can be found in this collection. A two page manuscript of aphorisms, and a piece of writing entitled <title render="doublequote">Les Mines de Tipasa</title> is present in both manuscript and typescript.</p>

<p>The photographs include pictures of Camus, his friends, his mentor Jean Grenier, and his work in directing <title render="doublequote">Caligula</title> and <title render="doublequote">Requium.</title> One photo features his children, Catherine and Jean. There is also a photogrpah of a manuscript page from <title render="italic">The Rebel</title>.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The first series, Manuscripts, contains manuscripts and corrected typescripts created by John Cage and used in speeches, performances, and published articles. Most were later collected by Cage for publication in his books. In many instances, both the original text and a later version corrected for publication exist and are housed together. This series is arranged alphabetically by title. In some instances, short pieces as well as individual book titles appear within the arrangement. Therefore, when searching for a particular piece, one should look for it under both its title and the title of the book in which it may have appeared.</p>

<p>The collection was arranged by Cage himself before transfer to Wesleyan, and this arrangement has been retained in nearly every instance. Folder titles that appear in quotation marks are Cage’s original folder titles for each piece, in which he also included the title of the book in which it was later published, i.e. <title render="doublequote">Composition (<emph render="italic">Silence</emph>).</title> Cage also noted unpublished pieces, i.e. <title render="doublequote">Listening to Music (unpublished)</title> and this convention has been retained in the finding aid. Many pieces noted as unpublished by Cage have subsequently appeared in print, notably in <title render="doublequote">John Cage, Writer: Previously Uncollected Pieces, Selected and Edited</title> by Richard Kostelanetz. New York: Limelight Editions, 1993. Folder titles not appearing in quotation marks were either not labelled by Cage or are later additions to the manuscripts series and have been added by the archivists.</p>



<p>Cage often typed a short note of explanation to accompany each piece that would supply background information, such as original titles or the context of its first appearance in print or when/where it was delivered. He called these notes <emph render="doublequote">headnotes</emph> and they have been noted or transcribed in the finding aid, within quotation marks, where they occur. Some folder titles had been changed by Cage or crossed out; these are also noted in the finding aid.</p>

<p>Other items described here are Series 2, Interviews with Cage; Series 3, Fan Mail and Mail Art; and Series 4, Cage Ephemera.</p>

<p>This finding aid does not presently include clippings, gallery and exhibition catalogs, a collection of Cage's books and serials, posters, objects, exhibition and literary announcement postcards, and brochures from conferences and other organizations. These are also part of the Wesleyan Cage collection and will be described in additional series.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Center for Advanced Studies Records consists of four series: Administrative Files, Fellows, Persons Under Consideration, and Recordings. Throughout the collection, documentation from 1967 to 1969 is somewhat sparse. In some cases, the original file folders have been retained to preserve documentation on them.</p>

<p>The Administrative Files include annual reports, conference and seminar information, correspondence, publicity documents, photographs, and Monday Evening Papers, which were brief publications based on evening lectures given by the fellows.</p>

<p>The Fellows series is an alphabetical listing of some (but not all) of the fellows of the CAS. Folders typically contain correspondence, lists of accomplishments while in residence, newspaper clippings, and resumes, among other documents. The Persons Under Consideration series is an alphabetical listing of people suggested or self-nominated to the selectors. Folders in this series typically include correspondence and memoranda.</p>
<p>The Recordings series contains audio tape recordings and transcripts of some of the recordings. These were typically speeches or interviews given by fellows or at CAS events.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection is primarily comprised of Joseph Cummings' annual reports on Wesleyan University for the years 1857-1874, excepting the 1866-1867 school year. These reports contain censuses of Wesleyan's student body, including lists of students that have died or taken seriously ill during the school year. They also include Cummings' recommendation that women be admitted into Wesleyan and his suggestions for allocation of funds, most prominently with regards to building and maintaining a library. The collection also contains Cummings' correspondence, including with Julia Olin and W.O. Atwater (primarily regarding securing Atwater's employment), as well as Cummings' official acceptance of the position as president at Wesleyan University. Also included are several articles by Cummings, a petition against his resignation from the professorship, and his wife D.S. Cummings' correspondence.

<p>The Reader File series contains all outgoing correspondence from the Congressman's Washington office. One carbon copy of each letter is included. These are fastened in manilla folders in chronological order and are continuous from January 3, 1961 to December 31, 1970. Incoming correspondence and some related replies, duplicated in the reader file, are scattered through other series.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Handwritten and typewritten drafts, mimeographed and some printed copies of speeches, statements, articles, and press releases. These are arranged chronologically. Articles by other persons also included.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>About 100 telecasts to his Connecticut constituents from WTIC-TV Hartford, WHNB-TV New Britain, and WNHC-TV New Haven. These are entitled <title render="doublequote">Your Congressman from Connecticut.</title> These are dated but not marked as to subject.</p>
<p>Special items include film of Daddario with President Johnson (about 2 minutes); a V.I.P. Tour in South Vietnam with shots of Daddario and other congressmen dated November 20, 1965 from the Army Pictorial Center.</p>
<p>Ten audio tape recordings include Congressional reports, a Daddario address on patents to the Chamber of Commerce, May 21, 1961; his address delivered to the Interparliamentary Union Conference in Tehran, Iran, October 1, 1966 (broadcast over Voice of America); and his Trumbull Lecture, <title render="doublequote">The Crucial Half-Century for Science and Society,</title> to the Yale Science and Society Forum, Yale University, November 17, 1969.</p></scopecontent>

As these materials come solely from the Congressman's Washington office, this is not the kind of full file that developed in his headquarters in the state.</p></scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Communications pertaining to matters as varied as the plight of the New Haven Railroad and individual social security and immigration claims. The topics are enormously varied and correspondence illustrates how Daddario dealt with the very complex as well as some quite humble demands. The correspondents are chiefly from his own district and the topics mostly confined to Connecticut.</p></scopecontent>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>Almost the entire collection is in German, except for two documents.</p>
<p>The collection contains two secretary's books, covering the years 1909-1920 and 1946-1955, with the minutes and protocols from the meetings, the group's constitution, and various mementos from the given dates. Photos and invitations to the group's theater performance in 1910 are also included. The folder with miscellaneous documents from 1931 to 1938 contains a program for another play put on in 1930, and an invitation to the Christmas party in 1938. Of particular interest is a short story dated 1934 by T.M. Campbell about an American who wakes in the forest to stumble upon the cottage of Goethe, and has a somewhat mystical encounter with him where the famous writer reveals some of his writing genius.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two folders dedicated to the Golden Anniversary of the club in 1960. One folder contains the speeches of L.E. Gemeinhardt and Sten Flygt given in English, and almost 80 telegrams and letters from former members on the occasion in both German and English. The guest book from the occasion is also included.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
The collection consists of over 800 surveys received from individual women graduates as well as computer printouts of data gained from these surveys. </p>
<p>
Most of the surveys are labeled with a number on the upper right-hand side. Surveys 1-821 are labeled, with the possible exception of numbers 15, 65, 185, 441, 459, 509, and 591, which are missing. 23 surveys are unlabelled, or perhaps have lost their labels over time. The surveys are stored in order of numbered label, with the unlabelled surveys stored in a separate folder.</p>
<p>
Delegard sent the surveys to approximately 2,000 graduates from the classes of 1970-79, 1984, and 1990. The surveys ask a series of biographical questions such as year of graduation at Wesleyan, parents' education level and occupation, and personal marital status. The surveys also ask a variety of questions about the graduates' decision to attend Wesleyan and their experiences while at Wesleyan, particularly with gender, sexism, and feminism. Though many of the women wrote in brief answers, others provided lengthy responses. Delegard quoted extensively from the written answers and used the multiple choice or short answers for substantial statistical analysis. </p>
<p>
Included in the collection are the computer printouts from Delegard's statistical analysis of the surveys. Comprising three boxes, the printouts show the extent of Delegard's data exploration of the surveys she received, and provide an excellent example of early 1990s computer processing and research techniques. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The diary of Reverend Holden Dwight was written from August 18, 1837 to November 18, 1843. The diary begins as Dwight professes his excitement about returning home after working in Georgia for nearly two years. From Columbus, Georgia, Dwight traveled to Augusta, Georgia by stagecoach, then by railroad to Charleston, South Carolina, then to New York City by steamer. On his way back to his hometown of Southbridge, Massachusetts, Dwight stopped by his alma mater, Wesleyan University, whereupon he met with Mr. Charles Ser, an old acquaintance. After a brief conversation, Dwight then continued to Hartford, Connecticut where he stayed the night. In the morning, he took a stage to his hometown and arrived in Southbridge during the afternoon. At once he noticed the changes the local temperance movement had made upon his town, for now many of the taverns had been shut down. Once arriving home his family and friends greeted him with joy.</p>
<p>After the excitement of his arrival settled down, his family and friends began to question him on his stance of slavery. Dwight responded to his critics, <emph render="doublequote">. . . the efforts of the abolitionists themselves tended to prejudice the south in favor of slavery and to perpetuate the evil which they willed to be abolished . . .</emph> Though the abolitionists tried to persuade him, Dwight held to his beliefs in slavery, despite their constant criticisms. In the end, Dwight predicted that this question could potentially dissolve the Union.</p>
<p>Dwight spent the next few weeks at home with his family until they decided to travel to the examinations of Wilbraham Academy, his former school. Here Dwight watched his sister's examination, and listened to a few more arguments on the abolitionist movement. After the examinations, Dwight traveled back to Wesleyan University to watch the commencement of that year's class. He found the University to be unchanged from his days as a student, though he remarked that a house was being built for the president of the university. While at Wesleyan, Dwight attended an oration by his Honor George Banonoft sponsored by the Philorhetorian and the Peithologian Societies of Wesleyan, which he found to be exquisite. Dwight also remarked on the great donations Dr. Willbur Fisk was able to obtain while traveling in Europe, including bibles and testaments in many different languages, which he donated to the Missionary Lyceum, a student group. Dwight complimented Reverend Rice's excellent sermon delivered to the Youth's Missionary Society of Middletown. After a long day of excitement, Dwight returned home to Southbridge.</p>
<p>Dwight's next entry was dedicated to his resentment of corporations and the government's stronghold on the economy. He seemed to dislike any form of government involvement with the economy and even went as far as to write a letter to the legislative councils of the nation.
After a month of staying with his family, Dwight decided to return once more to Georgia. While traveling toward Georgia, Dwight remarked on how railroads were changing the nation into a better a place and how their might would benefit the New England area. Dwight also stopped off in Philadelphia to visit a school for the deaf and dumb, but they were out of session. On his train ride from Philadelphia to Washington D.C., Dwight was fortunate to see some of the most prominent men of his time including John Quincy Adams, whose personal appearance <emph render="doublequote">disappointed</emph> Dwight. After arriving in Washington, Dwight attended the extra sessions of Congress where he got to see many prominent senators such as Daniel Webster (Massachusetts), Henry Clay (Kentucky), William Campbell Preston (South Carolina), Thomas Hart Benton (Missouri), John Caldwell Calhoun (South Carolina), and Silas Wright, Jr. (New York). </p>
<p>After two weeks of travel, Dwight arrived back in Georgia where he opened a school in Columbus. The next few entries detail some interesting conversations Dwight had including one with a certain Dr. Gibson on the recent phenomenon of animal magnetism. Unfortunately on December 22nd, Dwight was forced to close his school in Columbus because, according to Dwight, there was no literacy in that city. On January 8, 1838 Dwight traveled to New Orleans, Louisiana where he was frightened to find people working on the Sabbath. Despite his initial fears, Dwight decided to open another school, on January 11, 1838, with the help of Mr. Hamilton of the local Methodist Church. During this time, Dwight decided to learn French from Professor Laurent because he hoped this will help him spread the word of God. On May 29, 1838, Dwight was again forced to close his school, but the local Methodist elder appointed him as a missionary for New Orleans' third municipality. During this time, Dwight was able to open a Sunday school and spread the word of the Methodist Church among the many Catholics in the area. </p>
<p>On July 29, 1838 Dwight accepted an invitation from Judge McGehee to tutor his children in Woodville, Mississippi. After two months, however, Dwight left the judge's home in order to teach at the Preparatory Department in the College of Louisiana. The following entries feature interesting conversations or sermons Dwight has heard and his comments on them. Dwight most notably discusses Professor's Woolbridge's sermons about the afterlife, and contemplates his own soul because of the sermons. On November 16, 1840 Dwight notes that the reason he hasn't written in so long is because he was <emph render="doublequote">. . . reduced near the grave</emph> with sickness. However, Dwight assures the reader that this has only deepened his faith in God and his commitment to his word. On November 13, 1840, Dwight writes that he has been blessed with a son despite the fact that Dwight had yet to mention his wife in the diary What follows next in the diary is Dwight's comments on a series of essays in the <title render="italic">Methodist Quarterly Review</title>, such as, <title render="doublequote">The Rich Against the Poor,</title> <title render="doublequote">Intelligence of Angels,</title> and <title render="doublequote">The Oxford Tract.</title></p>
<p>It is at this point that Dwight does not write in his journal for almost a full year. His next entry apologizes for his lack of punctuality in keeping the journal and continues with a full synopsis of his past few years. Dwight finally mentions his marriage to Almena Marietta Pelton on June 13, 1839. The two met at Wilbraham Academy, and then later fell in love while Dwight was working at the College of Louisiana. When Dwight decided to leave the college, he then opened up his own academy in Clinton, Mississippi. However, Dwight and his wife's attempts to run the school was in vain for a few months after opening the academy, both were stricken with illness. With no one left to run the school, the academy inevitably failed leaving Dwight unemployed yet again.</p>
<p>On May 12, 1841, Dwight and his family left Clinton in search of new employment in the north. After traveling around the Pittsburg, Pennsylvania region, Dwight eventually found a position in the Department of Natural Science in the Norwalk Seminary in Ohio. On January 16, 1842 Dwight again became seriously ill with an ear infection and a severe headache to the point where they fetched a doctor. Dr. Baker then treated his symptoms by bleeding him profusely, putting a roasted onion on his ear, and then giving him 0.5 grams of morphine. After a few months Dwight recovered once more and was also reassigned to the Latin and Greek Department of Norwalk Seminary. During the seminary's summer break, Dwight convinced his sister to come work at in the female department of the seminary, but also debated whether his salary was sufficient to provide for his family. Dwight ends his diary with doubt in his faith because compared to his idol, Dr. Fisk, Dwight's committment seems weak. He also touchingly describes the death of his infant son, Wilbur Fisk. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection comprises some 800 examinations given at Wesleyan from 1868 to 1970. Of these, close to 300 are from the nineteenth century. The 1960s are relatively poorly represented, with only 38 items. About 480 examinations are printed, 44 are manuscript and the remainder are either typed or mimeographed. Examinations dated after 1930 are almost exclusively comprehensive examinations, while earlier examinations include entrance examinations, mid-term and final examinations, and competitive examinations for named prizes awarded for academic excellence. </p>

<p>The present collection is drawn from several sources. A large number of the nineteenth century examinations are contained in a scrapbook presented by the Eclectic fraternity. Most comprehensive examinations from the late 1920s through the late 1950s were catalogued by department for the Wesleyan University Archives. With the exception of those contained in seven bound volumes, these comprehensive examinations have been boxed together by department. The following list integrates holdings found in two archival boxes, seven bound volumes, and the Eclectic scrapbook. </p>

Fisk's own writings can also be found in this series, on topics ranging from
abolitionism to Methodist issues. A number of Fisk's early schoolwork, featuring
reports and poems, is listed under Compositions. Addresses and sermons written and
delivered by Fisk can also be found in the Papers series.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The collection is housed in two boxes. The first box is made up of Glee Club programs and announcements of the concerts from 1869 to 1923. The second box has later Glee Club concert programs and announcements, from 1926 to 1972. It also includes programs of the annual Christmas candlelight concert held in the chapel. Most of Glee Club concerts took place off-campus and are programs from these concerts are not included in this collection; however, every year until about the 1940s, the Glee Club held a mid-winter concert and a commencement concert on-campus, and programs for these performances are included. Beginning around the 1960s, the Glee Club participated in more performances with other glee clubs or other choirs, particularly from women's schools (mostly Wheaton College and Smith College). In working with the women's choirs, the groups often selected music from a previously-written production and held performances at both of the participating schools, which is noted on the programs. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Harrington Papers are organized into 5 series and span the years 1880-1968. Most interesting is the Correspondence. It appears that John Spaeth, the first unofficial university archivist, grouped Harrington's correspondence (Series I, Box 1, folders 1-7) by topic or subject and wrote brief summaries for each folder. These summaries are included in each folder. Spaeth's organization by folder, along with his summaries have been maintained.</p>

<p>The following descriptions have been taken from Spaeth's summaries: Correspondence for the period November 1907 to March 1908 includes letters from Charles O. Judkins, (Class of 1895; Trustee 1910-1919) F.M. Davenport, and others concerning a proposal that Frederick M. Davenport, Class of 1889, be considered for election to the Wesleyan presidency. (W.A. Shanklin was elected president by the Board on November 13, 1908.)</p>

<p>Correspondence from July 1908 to February 1919 includes an interesting letter by Harrington to the Wesleyan Board of Trustees which is a proposal for the establishment of a woman's college under Wesleyan's auspice. His proposal is acknowledged by J.M. Buckley in a letter of November 20, 1908.</p>

<p>There is correspondence for 1916 with Dr. Olin concerning a new organ for Memorial Chapel.</p>

<p>There is correspondence is with Wesleyan official and contractors and relates to the electrification of the South College chimes in the folder covering the period February 1919 to December 1921.</p>

<p>Correspondence covering the years November 1925 to May 1942 is primarily between Harrington and President McConaughy and concerns such matters as salary, retirement, office accommodations, etc.
</p>
<p>Folder 5 correspondence covers the years March 1922 to September 1952. This folder ends with a "Bon Voyage" farewell to Harrington and his wife, Jennie, as they move from Wesleyan to California with their daughter, Mabel Potter (Mrs. George), in 1951. There are long letters by the Harringtons to the Dutchers and Spaeths, also a photocopy of a letter by Dean Acheson.</p>

<p>Correspondence covering the years 1954-1960 includes letters of sympathy to Mrs. Harrington on the death of Karl Harrington. There is some business correspondence relating to the publication of Third Year Latin and other works. Some of the letters are between Mabel Potter and John Spaeth, but also with the publishers.</p>

<p>The last folder of correspondence covers the years 1961-1981 and contain letters between Mabel Potter and Verna and John Spaeth. Topics relates to the re-publication and copyright issues of some of Karl Harrington's writings.</p>

<p>Series II: Writing include some papers presented at the meetings of the Conversational Club and Apostles Club. They also reflect his interests in railroads, Middletown, and Wesleyan history. Harrington's notes and manuscript drafts on Latin are in Series III. His musical interests are reflected in Series IV. Harrington made several attempts at keeping a diary but without much success. Three very incomplete volumes of the diary can be found in Series V. Also in this series is a copy of Harrington's manuscript autobiography. </p>

<p>Series VI consists of 11 volumes of scrapbooks that were kept by Karl Pomeroy Harrington covering the years 1878 through 1936. Volumes are large and very fragile. The scrapbook paper is very deteriorated, pages crumble, items have become loose. The scrapbooks document events at Wesleyan, Middletown, and Harrington's interest in the Methodist Episcopal Church and music. They also contain information relating to other places that Harrington lived or taught, for example, North Carolina.</p>

<p>It should also be noted here that two items were not found when processing the K.P.H. Papers in 2005. The items are: <emph render="doublequote">Twentieth Century Club. Annual Report, 1911.</emph> Copy of typescript, 5p. and Tibullus Notes IV. These items were present on a preliminary list done in 1984.</p>

By breaking the Confederate line here, Richmond was evacuated that night and the Confederacy dissolved like a broken bubble.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
Bertha Hartzell kept journals and diaries throughout her life. Many of her journals are simple and brief recordings of the general nature of her days. However, some of her most extensive writing comes from her travel diaries, written during her time in Europe. These offer a fascinating and beautifully rendered picture of the life of well-to-do, educated Americans touring through the Old World. Clear and concise, her writing paints vivid scenes of perilous donkey rides to recently discovered ruins in Greece, of visits of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, and of boat trips through the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>
The diary she kept in Germany in 1900 includes frequent references to the time she spent with young Artur Rubinstein, who would become the famous concert pianist. Rubinstein borrowed this diary from Bertha's son, Karl, as source material for his memoirs. He used red pencil to mark the portions that he would use for his writing, and these marks are still present, as is a portion of envelope in which Rubinstein shipped the book back to Karl after he had completed his research.</p>
<p>
Her other diaries provide a look at the life of an unusually educated woman living in early 20th-century New England. These diaries include notes on social visits and events (in her younger years, visits from what appear to be suitors were very common subjects) as well as notes on her work as a student and later as a librarian. She also, unsurprisingly, recorded information about the state and activities of her family. Morton's work was a frequent topic while he was alive, but the goings-on of her son Karl and her father were often discussed thereafter.</p>
<p>
Three other diaries are included in the collection that were not written by Bertha. Two are diaries from the Civil War era that apparently belonged to Bertha's father, Charles A. Drew. Another appears to have belonged to Bertha's husband Morton, and includes notes on religious philosophy as well as records of visits to (presumably) members of his congregation.</p>
<p>
In addition, there are documents dealing directly with Bertha's life and with those of her family and friends, including a selection of Drew/Hartzell family letters spanning from the early 1900s to the 1970s, photographs, and clippings.
</p>

<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>
The Bertha Drew Hartzell Papers are in three Hollinger boxes. Box 1 contains her diaries, which are in chronological order. A few of her diaries/notebooks are not included in Box 1, generally because they are oversized or otherwise unsuited to the arrangement or content of Box 1. Vertical markers in Box 1 mark these missing items' chronological places and note the box in which they may be found.</p>
<p>
Box 2 consists of five folders, the first three of which contain an oversized diary and the last two folders contain a series of loose page-a-day notes.</p>
<p>
Box 3 consists of family notebooks and papers: Charles Acton Drew's diaries from the Civil War era, Bertha Hartzell's general notebooks from the early 1900s, Morton Hartzell's notebook, Hartzell family papers and letters, and family photos and memorabilia.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>Materials include items specifically related to Wesleyan's V-12 program as well as writings, research, and published works related to naval wartime training and higher education during wartime in general. The first series, Wesleyan Navy V-12 Program, includes correspondence belonging to Herge and other Wesleyan figures regarding V-12 at Wesleyan; student publications and other student guides and programs; articles about Wesleyan's V-12 program published in campus publications; a report assessing Wesleyan's program; and a list of people involved in the V-12 at Wesleyan. The second series, Research and Writings, includes writings by Herge as well as research reports and other data used in his writings. Most of the writings are undated but seem to date from the mid- to late-1940s and are mostly in a draft, typescript format. Topics of the writing and research are higher education during wartime and wartime training. The third series, Other Publications, consists of journals, pamphlets, and other published materials that belonged to Herge. The subjects include wartime naval training, the Navy V-12 program, naval curricula information, and higher education in general.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>In an effort to convey a sense of the dynamism of the history of racial diversity at Wesleyan, the materials are arranged under headings relating to student, faculty, and administrative groups rather than by racial categorizations. To order the large number of materials under such general headings as "African-American," "Asian-American" or "Latino/a" would be reductive. To do so would deny historical context, the ways in which groups often struggled with and against each other (and among themselves) over issues, from black-Asian conflict in the late 1970s and early 1980s to the formation of the Tri-Minority Council (TMC, later the Student of Color Council) in 1989.</p>



<p>Such categorizations also do not allow for the ways in which administrative initiatives geared toward one group often affected another group. For example, admission policies aimed at matriculating more African-American students opened doors for increased Latino presence. General racial designations are themselves historically contingent, products of particular cultural moments and political exigencies. This is not to deny the ways in which groups are identified and choose to self-identify. Rather it is to encourage enumeration and fuller illumination of the many meanings and manifestations of racial diversity. Finally, separate categories wrongly emphasize that the history documented in this archive is the sole property of the ethnic and racial groups under whose heading it falls, rather than the property and legacy of the institution as a whole.</p>



<p>In this vein, the collection is divided into three series, and sub-groups within each:</p>

<p>Series 1: Documents, photographs, and textiles collected by the Hewlett Pluralism and Unity Project to document the history of diversity at Wesleyan University;</p>

<p>Series 2: Audio material and transcriptions documented by Hewlett Fellows as part of the project; and</p>

<p>Series 3: Documents relating to the Hewlett project and its participants.</p>



<p>Within the first series, there are folders on topics such as admissions, educational funding, curriculum, racial statistics, administration and faculty, students, alumni, student groups, campus events, racial incidents, special interest housing. Included are documents from and about the 1969 Fisk Hall takeover, which resulted in the first attempt at an Afro-American Studies curriculum; the lampooning of Boon Tan, an Asian member of the class of 1980; and the racist letters to the Malcolm X House and the campus response in 1980. Also included are documents concerning Wesleyan-Middletown relations and collaboration.</p>



<p>Student groups are an integral component of any campus; accordingly, the archive includes papers of many of these organizations. There are extensive papers of the Asian-American Cooperative Theater (AACT) in particular. Also interesting are the papers of inter-ethnic groups such as Society Organized Against Racism (SOAR) and Racism Awareness Workshop (RAW). It is important to note that names of these organizations changed periodically to reflect new nomenclature and new missions. For example, Asian and Asian-American students first organized as Wesleyan Asian Students Party (WASP), later renamed themselves Wesleyan Asian Interest Group (WAIG), then Wesleyan Asian/Asian-American Student Union (WAAASU), and now, in the most recent incarnation, as Asian-American Pacific Alliance (AAPA). Student publications are also included, as well as event fliers, invitations, and notices of speakers.</p>



<p>There is also an array of documents concerning admission strategies and curricular development. Particularly interesting are admission brochures and booklets aimed at recruiting students of color dating back to 1975. There are also admission policy statements and minutes from Board of Trustees meetings; "special minority group" admission profiles; and recruitment strategies developed by task forces of color. There is extensive documentation of the founding and growth of the Afro-American Institute, the first attempt at instutionalizing African-American Studies and a center for black culture and research; and of the first Asian-American Studies course offered in the 1985-86 school year. Juxtaposed with these files is the Ford Foundation Grant for Multicultural Perspectives in Curriculum, submitted by Joanne Creighton, Vice President of Academic Affairs, in September 1991. One can also find administrative documents on the ethno-cultural houses.</p>



<p>Throughout the last 35 years, there have been many committees, task forces, and ad-hoc groups that have sought to make sense of and improve racial diversity and racial interaction on campus. Papers from some of these groups are gathered here, including the Multicultural Committee, the Committee on Human Rights and Relations, and the Presidential Commission on Race Relations.</p>



<p>There are also documents from the various Alumni Councils. We are fortunate to have some of the papers of the late Professor of German Theodore Chadbourne (Chad) Dunham, among the first faculty to teach a course with racial themes; a folder entitled <title render="doublequote">Alumni of Color in the Arts,</title> which showcases some of the work of Glenn Ligon '86 and Olivia Astrid Smith '92, both accomplished photographers; and speeches of Edwin (Ted) Etherington '48, president of the University during the turbulent period of 1968-1970. Finally, there is a 1980 Alumni Reunion T-shirt <title render="doublequote">Where Is Boon Tan?</title></p>



<p>The second series continues with material collected by Hewlett Fellows, and includes audio tapes, including Edgar Beckham's seminars, various interviews with alumni produced by students of the seminars, and speeches by distinguished guests to the campus.</p>



<p>The third series is documentation of the Hewlett Project itself, incorporating the work of the Summer Research Fellows (including the various publication indices), Fellows' research notes, various tutorial readings and assignments, the original grant proposal and progress reports, and further documents and directories on diversity. This series provides an understanding of the scope and mission of the project.</p>



<p>A final note: It is the hope of participators in and shapers of the Hewlett Project and the Hewlett Diversity Archive that this collection will continue to grow and expand, that students, faculty, and administrators, past and present, white and of color, will contribute documents and memorabilia to the archive. The history and memory of Wesleyan's commitment to racial diversity is the property and responsibility of all of us, just as the course of Wesleyan's future is our collective obligation.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>There is no comprehensive collection of materials pertaining to and arising out of Holland's
rich life. However, the materials described here and held at Wesleyan University do touch, in
some measure, nearly every part of his long career. The bulk of the collection contains
manuscripts, field diaries, publications, reports, silent films, artworks, and books related to
wildlife conservation and game protection in the United States, from 1903 to 1970. It also
contains a small amount of diaries, scrapbooks, correspondence and personal family items
spanning 1872 to 1970. </p>

<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>Richard Estabrook of the class of 1974 assisted in the organization and description of the
Holland papers. The collection is organized into ten series: Family Materials, 1872-1974;
Holland Writings, 1903-1965; Wildlife Photographs, 1910-1965; Migratory Bird Conservation,
1913-1937; American Game Protective Association, 1911-1969; International Association of Game,
Fish and Conservation Commissioners, 1912-1970; <title render="italic">Field &amp;

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection consists primarily of recordings of Hawaiian songs and dance notations by Huapala used to teach the hula. There are several books and some printed material on Hawaiian history and culture, and tapas.</p>


<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>

<p>Series I: Records</p>
<p>Series II: Dance Notations</p>
<p>Series III: Books, Record Jackets, and Printed miscellaneous</p>
<p>Series IV: Tapas</p>

</arrangement>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The records are arranged numerically and an Excel spread sheet (converted into PDF) was created to provide the following information:</p>
<p>Field A: Box and record number. (For example, record number 55 can be found in
box 1; record number 240 is in box 6.)</p>

<p>Field B: Side A Information. Provides names of all the artists (if listed) and the songs that are contained on side A of the record.</p>

<p>Field C: Side B Information. Provides names of all the artists (if listed) and the songs that are contained on side B of the record.</p>

<p>Field D: Record Company Number. </p>

<p>Field E: Notation. This lists whether or not the record matches up with any of the dance
notations. For example, if <emph render="doublequote">A</emph> is listed in the field, that means that there is a
notation that matches the song on side A. If <emph render="doublequote">A, B</emph> is listed, that means that
there is a match to one/all of the songs on sides A and B of the record. As an
example, the track on Side B of #14, <emph render="doublequote">Kawiahe,</emph> matches up to a dance notation,
<emph render="doublequote">Kawiahe,</emph> so it is listed as <emph render="doublequote">B.</emph></p>
<p>A PDF containing information about all of the records in series 1 is available at: <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/Huapala_Records.pdf">http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/Huapala_Records.pdf</extref></p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Dance Notations are arranged alphabetically by song title. Almost all of the dance notations have a match with one of the records in boxes 1-6. If <emph render="doublequote">No Corresponding Record</emph> is noted, that means that the dance notation does not have a match.</p>

<p>The notations in box 10 are duplicates of the ones in boxes 7-9. these are also arranged alphabetically.</p>

brought before the Board of Trustees. Notable subject groupings for these dates
include Buildings and Grounds and the Carnegie Foundation accreditations. These
records are not a complete collection of Trustee business, but complement other
Trustees' holdings in the Wesleyan University Archives.</p>
<p>According to a June 19, 1918 memo from Secretary of the Board David Downey, James was
responsible for holding important Trustee documents. Most of the James
administrative papers are marked copy or have been copied, many of annotations.
Several documents in this collection are not represented in other Trustee

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>The John Johnston Papers include correspondence, biographical information, materials about the study of science at Wesleyan University, and a scrapbook of programs from 19th century Wesleyan events.</p>
<p>The correspondence of John Johnston contains much interesting material on and around the formative years of Wesleyan University. Many of the letters deal with science (fossils and minerals); the teaching of science (textbooks, lab experiments, and equipment); letters of inquiry and requests for catalogs from prospective students; addresses at commencement; and contributions to Frankfort Mineral Cabinet. The collection is especially useful on the topics of science and science vis a vis Methodism at the dawning of Darwinism. Other letters in the collection discuss the Civil War and Wesleyan University.</p>

<p>The correspondence of J.G. Blair is notably interesting for comments on the Civil War and on science education in relation to religion, or <emph render="doublequote">inquiries into the mysteries of God's great laboratory.</emph> (January 27, 1863)</p>

<p>A. Rollins' letter for February 3 is an interesting diatribe on the suspect morals of a Wesleyan student. A letter (May 6, 1851) from M. C. White from China contains the flavor of his life as a missionary as he <emph render="doublequote">tries to preach in Chinese on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays in a little room opening to the street between the river and the south gate of the city.</emph> Many of the J. Holdich letters of the 1860s deal with the politics as well as the sorrow of the war. Among other Johnston correspondents are Nathan Bangs, Cyrus Foss, Joseph Cummings, the Hoyts, and Orange Judd. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The diary of Harriet Stewart Judd was written between the years 1872 to 1873, during Judd's travels throughout the Eastern Coast of the United States and much of Europe. Judd describes many acquaintances she met during her travels, including a former Wesleyan graduate, Mr. Coe, but Judd focuses mainly upon herself and her family. The main family members mentioned are Orange Judd (husband), Sarah (stepdaughter), Charles (son), and George (son). The diary is centered around the Judd family's travels and the attractions they come across on their journey. Judd describes many of the palaces, castles, and other points of interest with thorough architectural details along with some historical background on its origins. Judd's diary also allows the reader to glimpse the lifestyle of a traveling family, many of whom are often stricken with illness. In a number of Judd's passages she mentions how her husband, Orange, has become sick again, usually with a cold or headache. The diary also describes how the family used different forms of transportation such as steamboats, carriages, donkeys, rail carts, and tunnels in order to reach their destinations. There are not many organizations or businesses mentioned in her diary, but Harriet often spends her time shopping throughout her journeys. The diary is 176 pages in length and is entirely handwritten in cursive.</p>

<p>The first entry in Harriet Judd's diary is titled <title render="doublequote">Notes of Travel – No. 5</title> and opens with the family already traveling in Italy. Thus, it is assumed that this diary is part of a series of diaries, despite this volume being the only one in Wesleyan's Special Collections &amp; Archives. The diary begins with the family waiting to travel to Naples on October 30, but they were delayed due to the large number of troops around the train station. After they arrived in Naples and checked into the Hotel de Russie, the Judds began their tour of the castle of Carthusian Monastery and other museums. After a few days rest they traveled to the ancient city of Pompeii where Judd spent a good deal of time describing the runes.</p>

<p>Sunday, after the Judds attended mass, they visited the St. Januarius Cathedral, the San Pauli Maggio church and La Capella de san Serreze church, where she detailed the history and beauty of these places. The next day, Judd went to the Grotto of Pausilippo, the temple of Jupiter-Serapis, the temple of Neptune, the temple of Nymphs, the temple of Apollo, the village of Baccoli, and the Hot Baths of Nero. She regretted the decay of these places, but decided it was inevitable once the Roman Empire fell.</p>

<p>On November 6, after thoroughly enjoying Naples, the family decided leave Italy for Paris, France, by way of carriage. It was a freezing ride to France during the late season, and Harriet doubted if they will ever make it to the city. On November 9th, however, they finally reached Paris and after they checked into the Hotel de Lourdes on the Rue Castiglione, Judd went to see the Palais Royal. The family spent a few days shopping in this <emph render="doublequote">fashionable</emph> city, and then decided to move on to London on November 12. After having a relatively smooth ride across the channel, the Judds check into the Queen's Hotel whereupon they decide to travel to Liverpool. It is at this point that Judd stops writing about her trip. On the following page in the diary Judd begins a new journey in America. </p>

<p>The next section of the diary is titled <title render="doublequote">Notes of Journal Commenced</title> and accompanying Harriet on this journey to the southern United States is Orange (husband), George (son), and Charles (son). On February 15, 1873, the family left their hometown of Flushing, New York to travel to Washington D.C., during which Orange was already sick. After leaving Washington for Richmond, Virginia, their train underwent a malfunction and the family was forced to stay in a barn overnight. After reaching Richmond, the family then traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they met Mr. Coe, a Wesleyan graduate. He accompanied them to see superphosphate mines found near Charleston, South Carolina. The family then traveled among the mines and noted the superphosphates' importance during the Civil War.</p>

<p>After reaching Savannah, Georgia, the family traveled once more to their destination of St. James, Florida. At this point, the diary begins to skip several days without any explanation of what occurred during this time when the family traveled around Florida. In Florida, the Judds visited a few points of interest including the Grace Spring and Green Cave Spring, and they met many entertaining acquaintances. After spending over a month in Florida, the family traversed the long journey back to Flushing where Harriet noted she was thankful for all that God had given her.</p>

<p>The final section of the diary is titled <title render="doublequote">Journal for tour commenced</title> and details another of Judd's European journeys. On August 9, 1873 Harriet, Orange, Sarah, and "the two little boys" left America by way of steamer for Ireland. After a 12-day journey, the family finally arrived with not even Orange getting sick. After staying in Ireland a few days, the family traveled to England where they visited William Shakespeare's grave. However, on August 25, Judd announced that she would stop writing in her diary for a while because it was giving her headaches Thus when the diary begins again on November 27, the family had moved to Geneva, where the boys were being taught by Mr. Louis Dalaprez. Harriet and Sarah have also taken lessons in French, while Orange and George have been sick in bed for a while. However, on December 4, the family decided to travel to Italy in hope that the warm weather would heal the invalids.</p>

<p>The family decided to take first-class carriages to Italy because they wanted to be comfortable on the long ride. After traveling for many days, Judd finally reached Italy, by way of the famed Mount Cenis Tunnel, and checked into Hotel D'Europe in Turin. However, Orange and Geroge were still severely sick and they decided to call a physician who prescribed them some prescriptions from the <emph render="doublequote">druggist.</emph> After visiting the armory and Royal Palace of Turin, Judd decided that they should travel to Genoa, where she believed there was much more to see.</p>

<p>On December 9, Judd left Turin by carriage and encountered an unfortunate event. While traveling, she was stopped by two burly men who demanded that they be stowed away with the Judd family. Though they tried to resist, the men found a way in. Luckily, nothing serious occured other than a trip with two men who <emph render="doublequote">smelled terribly.</emph> Eventually the family reached Genoa, after making a few stops to see the city of Alessandria and the battlefield of Marengo, and checked into a hotel. The next few days were spent visiting the tourist spots such as the Palace Reale of the Durazzo family, the Church Sa Annunsiata, the Spinola Palace, the Cathedral of San Lorenzo, Rossi or Brignole Sale Palace, Serra Palace, the church of St. Maria di Carignano, and the Doria Palace. Each of these places is described in grand detail, and with Judd showing a loving appreciation for the marble architecture.</p>

<p>An interesting event occurs when the family visited the Genoa hospital for the poor on December 13. Here they find a hospital that could house thousands of people, and took care of the many orphans of Genoa. Here the orphans were trained in furniture making, and most of them seemed absolutely content in what they were doing. Judd was relieved to see charity in Genoa, but was also surprised to see so many <emph render="doublequote">dwarfs</emph> in the hospital. The next few days were again spent sight seeing, including the Villa Pallavicini, the Durazzo and Balbi palaces, and the gardens Resazzia. Again all of these are described in flowing details by Judd. However, after spending 13 days in Genoa, the family decided that it was time to move on to Naples.</p>

<p> n December 22nd, the Judds left Genoa via a steamer. However, before reaching Naples, the boat first made a stop over in Pisa where Judd decided to visit the city. They immediately traveled to the cathedral group in Pisa where she was at a loss of words to describe the Leaning Tower of Pisa. They also visited the Cathedral, the Bell Tower, and the Campo Santo, all of which are described in great detail. After an exciting day they returned to the boat and in two days they reached their final destination of Naples on December 25. They quickly checked into the hotel Crocelle, and then went to the Cathedral to celebrate Christmas mass. It is here after thanking God and wishing her family well on Christmas that the journal abruptly ends.</p>

<p>There is a bit of wear and tear to the cover. Some of the leather has become brittle and is beginning to fall off of the spine of the book. Despite the degrading quality of the leather, the book is completely intact and well bound. Some of the ink has begun to fade, but all pages are still legible.</p></scopecontent>

<scopecontent>
<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection begins in 1946 with documents from Knapp's time as a Beta Theta Pi pledge. One is a letter from the pledge-masters with a task (involving a trip to Connecticut Women's College) as well as Knapp's partial documentation of that task. The other is a Beta Theta Pi banquet program.
</p>
<p>The collection continues with letters that Knapp wrote home to his family. He typically writes to some combination of his mother, father, and sister. These letters are often long and detailed, and usually include information about his daily life at school.
</p>
<p>Knapp spends a lot of time describing various events he went to and people he knew, as well as his academic and social concerns. He is also, however, unusually explicit about other aspects of Wesleyan life, including drinking, gambling, dating, and sex. He describes a few trips taken to other schools by himself and the brothers, as well as other Beta Theta Pi events.

<head>Collection Overview</head>

<p>These letters were handwritten while Legg was a student at Wesleyan (1900-1904) and kept by Legg's mother. In 1907, when Legg married, he and his wife, Nellie, typed them up and they were kept in storage until his wife died in 1968. At that point, many of the letters has been eaten by silverfish. In 1972, at the age of 92, Legg went through the half-eaten letters and added some notes and tried to fill in the missing information. The typed transcripts are 175 pages with the letters filling the pages.</p>
<p>The Howard Legg Letters are about life on the Wesleyan University campus while Legg was a student between 1900 and 1904. He wrote about life as a freshman, such as trying to become a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, as well as his his classes and the work that came with them. He was on the track team and wrote about the practices and meets. Legg was interested in the other athletic achievements of the university, especially when his friends were part of them, particularly the football team. He was a member of various campus groups and described his activities. For the most part, the letters specifically to his father are more business-like than those to the whole family or just his mother. He often mentioned finances in the letters to his father. While it is only mentioned in the very last letter in the collection, Legg delivered a speech, <title render="doublequote">The Sense of Responsibility,</title> at his commencement ceremony, but the text is not included in this collection of letters.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection consists of James O. Longstreet's personal diary from the year 1856.
The diary covers the second semester of his junior year at Wesleyan, as well as the
first semester of his senior year. Many events are recorded in the diary, including
the 1856 presidential election and the founding of the Middletown chapter of the
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. Other notable subjects discussed in the manuscript
include the caning of Charles Sumner on the U.S. Senate floor, President Buchanan's
interest in the annexation of Cuba, Methodist missionaries in Fiji, abolitionism,
temperance, the Mystical Seven, Psi Upsilon, the Eclectic Society, and other
Wesleyan activities and organizations.</p>
<p>The diary begins in North Guilford, CT, where Longstreet was employed as a schoolteacher
for the winter break. While serving as a teacher, he participated in the conversion
to Methodism of several individuals, including Carrie and Evan Bartlett, Charles
Fowler, Alden Fowler, Dwight Hall, Mary Ann Norton, Mary Chittenden and Cynthia
Scranton. Longstreet's strong Methodist faith is in evidence throughout the diary.
During the winter of 1856, he began leading prayer meetings in his schoolroom to the
consternation of some local religious leaders, who appear to have viewed him as
competition. On January 8, the diary records Longstreet's budding affection for one
of his students, Miss Lois Dudley, whom he describes as <emph render="doublequote">so smart.</emph> Longstreet's school was kept in working order with the help of
several friends from the neighborhood of North Guilford, including students of his
and participants in his prayer meetings, notably Anson Fowler and Edwin Bartlett.
The arrival in mid-January of Mr. Dutton, another Methodist preacher, seems to have
disturbed Longstreet as Dutton would eventually take the meetings <emph render="doublequote">out of (his) hands</emph>, according Longstreet's December
31 year-in-review entry. Dutton would move into the parsonage and take Longstreet's
place as preacher.</p>
<p>On January 18, Longstreet describes the conversion of Carrie Bartlett, a girl who he
will counsel for much of the remainder of the year on matters of faith. On January
31, he notes that <emph render="doublequote">Fowler hinted strange</emph> against
his prayer meetings in the school building. The opposition voiced by Fowler made him
feel <emph render="doublequote">a little bad.</emph> On February 3, <emph render="doublequote">Fowler again hinted at me for doing meetings in the
schoolhouse but he may hint on and it will do no good.</emph> In mid-February, a
property dispute appears to have arisen between Longstreet and a man named Tobey. On
February 13, he quips <emph render="doublequote">Oh! Tobey, what a liar!</emph> The
debate is further explicated on February 16, when Longstreet notes that Tobey is
currently in possession of goods formerly belonging to a Mr. Britton. Those goods
appear to have been claimed by both Tobey and Longstreet, although Longstreet
repeatedly calls Tobey a liar. Meanwhile, Longstreet's teaching job was nearing its
end. He remained in North Guilford for two weeks after his engagement was over. On
March 9, he heard a temperance lecture from a Mr. Cue which he described as <emph render="doublequote">in most respects the most absurd thing I ever heard.</emph>
His issues with Mr. Dutton continued, and on March 12 <emph render="doublequote">the
girls</emph> were <emph render="doublequote">annoyed</emph> that Dutton gave
Longstreet no chance to speak at the meeting. Anson Fowler, Edwin Bartlett, and
Charles Fowler helped Longstreet to plan the exhibition for the end of school, which
<emph render="doublequote">went well except some of the singing</emph> on March
19. On that date, he received the gift of <emph render="doublequote">a beautiful
gold pencil and pen</emph> from a student named Augusta. His school ended on March 20, and he
departed for Middletown CT and college on March 22.</p>
<p>Once at college, Longstreet attended the first of many
meetings of the Mystical Seven secret society. He took classes including Mineralogy
and Mechanics. During this time and afterward, he would often spend evenings at the
home of Brother Fox, apparently a popular hangout for students at the time. On March
31, Longstreet went to Mr. Tobey's store to resolve their dispute over Mr. Britton's
goods. Tobey agreed to <emph render="doublequote">divide Britton's yard</emph> or
else sell his half to Longstreet for $80. After carefully examining the goods,
including 75-100 <emph render="doublequote">good books,</emph> he determined that
the goods would sell for 70-80 dollars and determined to offer Tobey 20 dollars for
his half of the goods. On April 7, he concluded a deal to purchase the other half of
the goods from Tobey at a price of $38. <emph render="doublequote">That way if they
sell well, I will get my pay.</emph> In May, classes continued including German
and Logic. On May 29, Longstreet mentions the health situation of Charles Sumner,
the recently caned Republican abolitionist Senator, stating that he <emph render="doublequote">is worse.</emph></p>
<p>On June 6, Longstreet appears to have received marks. <emph render="doublequote">Made
5 in Logic and German and 4 in Geology,</emph> he wrote. Throughout his diary,
Longstreet questions the strength of his faith, including on June 7 when he worries
that he is <emph render="doublequote">too lifeless in (his) religion, tho still
trusting with trembling.</emph></p>
<p>On June 21, he mentions attending a Republican meeting. <emph render="doublequote">I
am determined to get up a platform,</emph> he reports. On June 22, he notes that
Carrie Bartlett is <emph render="doublequote">discouraged trying to be a
Christian,</emph> a situation she seems to find herself in repeatedly. On June
25 he reports that the local Republican club has <emph render="doublequote">adopted
the constitution that we drew up.</emph> More political news follows, with a
<emph render="doublequote">grand Democratic splurge</emph> on July 17. <emph render="doublequote">Fremont men [including Longstreet] cheered after meeting
adjourned.</emph> He describes how <emph render="doublequote">some Democrats,
headed by Putnam, made [Brother] Fox run for his life. He hid in Mc.
Donough.</emph> On July 21, he commenced reading Frederick Douglass. <emph render="doublequote">I like it well.</emph></p>
<p>The diary describes the founding of the Middletown chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity. On July 23, Longstreet's friend Powers (probably Orville Watson Powers,
class of 1856) contacted him because his society, known as the Lebanians, wanted to
<emph render="doublequote">become a chapter of ΑΔΦ and he wants me to recommend
his society to Head.</emph> Also on that date <emph render="doublequote">fire
broke out in the college barn. Buddington's horse was burned.</emph> Longstreet
wrote the recommendation letter for Powers on July 24. On August 1, Longstreet
writes, <emph render="doublequote">This morn have learned that the Betrians and
[Powers' group] have united and come out ΑΔΦ!!!</emph></p>
<p>On August 7 was commencement, and in possibly the first recorded instance of its kind
at Wesleyan, <emph render="doublequote">Carr was rejected by ΑΔΦ and feels
dreadfully.</emph> After commencement, Longstreet visited family in New York. On
September 4, he returned to school. September 9, Longstreet was elected president of
the Missionary Lyceum. <emph render="doublequote">I don't like the responsibility of
the office,</emph> he wrote. Longstreet was involved actively in cultivating new
members for the Mystical Seven during this period, including Wardell, Edson and
Gould. Competition between the societies (Longstreet mentions Mystical Seven, Chi
Psi, Eclectic, Alpha Delta Phi and Psi Upsilon) was sharp. October 7 he had tea with
Professor Van Vleck. On October 9, he and Lois, Ella, Mary E.C., Katy D., Carrie, Mary
B., Anson, Edwin, Harrison and Fayette went to the state fair in New Haven.</p>
<p>On October 17, Longstreet reports that Buchanan had won the presidential election.
According to Longstreet, <emph render="doublequote">. . . the country will go to the
Devil.</emph> He showed great interest and involvement in the Republican cause,
even after John C. Fremont's electoral defeat. His diary records the widespread
interest in the election. For example, when he went for dinner at his friend Mr.
Blake's house on November 5, he reported that, <emph render="doublequote">They are
very much excited about the election. They think old Buck (Buchanan) will make
slaves of us all.</emph> On November 11, Longstreet was hired to teach school in
North Branford, CT, for the winter. On a few occasions, most recently on December 30,
1856, he reported that he was reading about Methodist missionary work amongst the
Feejies (Fijians).</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Of Interest:</emph>
</p>
<p>Several Wesleyan faculty appear repeatedly in the diary, including Professor True,
Professor Johnson, Prof. Huber in German, Professor Lindsay who <emph render="doublequote">preaches a good sermon,</emph> and Professor Van Vleck.</p>
<p>Longstreet often worried about his health. February 14 he complained of back pains,
while on March 2nd it was <emph render="doublequote">pain in the back and
shoulders.</emph> June 11, he was in bed all day with headache. June 13, he
remained in bed but was feeling better. December 4, <emph render="doublequote">looseness of bowels</emph> sent him <emph render="doublequote">with haste to
the barnyard</emph> several times during the night. On December 20, he said
<emph render="doublequote">Don't feel well. Am conscious I am going <emph render="underline">down</emph>. Oh God if consistent give me good
health.</emph> He complained of headache and general sickness.</p>
<p>On February 12, Longstreet recorded sending a letter to the <emph render="doublequote">Honorable J. Longstreet,</emph> possibly his father's name.
His mother's name is not mentioned.</p>
<p>
<emph render="bold">Longstreet's Year in Review</emph>
</p>

<p>James O. Longstreet's diary in unusual, in that it contains a sort of <emph render="doublequote">year in review</emph> section in which he reflects on his
experiences in 1856. The following is a full transcription of this section. The
underlines (and grammatical irregularities) are Longstreet's own. This section is
followed, in the manuscript, by Longstreet's personal financial accounts.</p>

<p>12/31/1856 (Wednesday)</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">The school today has been <emph render="underline">very</emph>
noisy and <emph render="underline">most</emph> tired me out. Fine winter weather
tho just at night it was snowing some. Lydia, Mr. Chidsey's daughter has gone to
a party. Eve Fayette called at my room. This day closes up the year 1856. It is
with rather sober feelings that I look over the past year and into the new one
just at hand. When this year came in I was at North Guilford teaching the
pleasantest school I ever expect to have. Soon after the commencement of the
year, Lois R. Dudley, a young lady of about 16 came into my school. Of her more
anow. When 1856 came to us I was having good times in school and had begun to
hold religious meetings in school room and they were interesting. Anson Fowler
and I did most all the work but as the winter went on the interest increased. We
had after a time a prayer meeting and a class meeting every week. In the course
of the winter Edwin Bartlett, Charles Fowler, Alden Fowler, Dwight Hall, Carrie
Bartlett, Mary Ann Norton, Mary Chittenden and Cynthia Scranton gave good
evidence of conversion and Fayette, Augusta and Ada Rassiter, Myrta Heall,
George Hall, Mary Bartlett, Louise Norton and Ella Dudley were deeply interested
until Mr. Dutton came and took the meetings out of my hands, then all interest
died out. I was greatly opposed by both churches and when Mr. Dutton came I had
nothing to see to except the class meetings which I kept. Where all these are
tonight is more than I can tell. I fear only a very few are trying to be
Christians. Oh God save them going to perdition.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">My school closed March 20th. Eve before, had exhibition which
went off well. 28 of my scholars presented me a beautiful gold pen and pencil
which I now prize <emph render="underline">very highly</emph>. Parted with my
school in tears and on March 22nd went to Middletown. Worked hard 'til end of
term, passed examinations and spent one week of vacation visiting North
Guilford. Went back to college and in July came again for a few days. Passed
examinations at the end of the year and became a <emph render="underline">senior</emph>. Went home. Stayed 3 weeks. Bought for sisters a Melodian
(cost $90). Leave home with tears and come back to college. During fall made
several fruitless attempts to get a school for the winter and at last determined
to go home. Packed my trunk and got excused from college November 10th. Came
to North Guilford to make short visit and while there had offer of district
school in North Branford at $35 and found per month of 20 days each and I took
it. So here I am at the close of the year teaching within four miles of where I
was one year ago. This year which is just leaving has been in some respects the
best of my life and will be long remembered. Last winter was a bright page in my
history. But what is my present situation, prospects and c.? Not as good as I
could wish. My school is too large and by no means a pleasant one. My boarding
place is worse than the school. The board is the worst I have ever had in my
life and if I could move my quarters I would do it suddenly. My room is
comfortable and my bed good. I now expect to preach at North Madison every other
Sunday during the winter. I hope God will use me for accomplishing some little
good. My health is not good. I have had several poor days this winter,and feel
that I am going downhill. I work pretty hard and have poor fare and grow poor
under it. I hope and pray for health, for if that leaves me, I am gone for I
have nothing to live upon, much less to pay my debts with.</emph>
</p>

<p>
<emph render="italic">I have been dreaming for some months about getting married.
Not that I wish a wife now, but I would like some Yankee girl in about two
years. I have been on the look out for some time but have seen none that quite
suit me. I want a good, pious girl, well educated and moderately handsome and a
good singer and a <emph render="underline">neat</emph> housekeeper. For quite a
while I have had Lois in my mind and I cannot get her out, though I know in all
reason she can never be my wife. She is smart enough and good enough and her
singing will do and I am sure that she is neat and she is pretty good looking
and has a <emph render="underline">good</emph> figure; but am some six years the
older, she has not yet sufficient education, though she might improve that
before I should want her, and she has red hair. These are some objections on my
part and no doubt on her part there are many more, so that if she was
alright it might do me no good. She is a blessed good girl and I shall not only
keep alive our acquaintance but push it further, but must do it cautiously. At
present I think more of her than all the other girls in the world but shall not
allow the back part of my head to run away with me. I have prayed and continue
to pray, <emph render="doublequote">Oh God, direct me in so important a matter
as the selection of a wife.</emph> Well here I am truly just on the brink of
the old year's grave. In looking over my life for the past year I can see some
things which I did and am now sorry for but my fault has been not so much in
positive evil acts as in living at too great a distance from God. I have not
been spiritual enough through this whole year. I think on the whole I have
improved in some respects. I think I have a more settled Christian character
than I had one year ago but am not more <emph render="underline">alive</emph>.
Will I do better for the future? I am almost afraid to promise, for I see no
reason to think I shall keep it any better than I have kept others. But Lord if
thou will assist me to keep my promise I will agree to live nearer thee.</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph render="italic">Another year has gone and I am one year nearer my grave. I
have one year less in which to do good. Oh, how swiftly does time move on. Soon
my work will be ended, or at least my time for work and I shall be in the
presence of my judge. Oh God, help me to live so that I can give up my account
with joy. Show me my duty oh Lord that I may do it. Will thou have me to preach
thy gospel? Prepare me for the great work and I will go forth. My trust in God
tonight it strong. I give my all into his hands and firmly believe that he will
direct my ways. Tonight I am comfortable and happy. Where will I be in one year
from this night? Perhaps in eternity. Oh Lord thou alone canst tell, prepare me
for what is before me. Old year I sigh to bid you adieu. 1857 may be as
pleasant, but thy face is familiar. Thy name I have learned to love, and what
the next day may bring no mortal knows. I am almost afraid to trust it, but thou
canst no long stay so good bye, old year, good bye. Thou hast been my friend,
and in thy new made grave I drop a tear. Well little book I have about done with
thee. Thy page will tell truthfully the most of my history for the past year.
Thou has been willing to receive my sorrows and trials as well as my joys, and
in after time I will love to hear the stories that thou will tell of my course
through the year 1856. Little book I am now to place you among my old friends.
Good bye.</emph>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The <title render="doublequote">Journal of a Trip to Middletown, 1841</title> was written from June 29 to July 3, 1841, by William P. Lyon. It mostly describes Lyon's time in Middletown, Connecticut, but the journal also briefly describes his time in New York City. Throughout the diary Lyon mentions many new acquaintances from Wesleyan University, and dwells heavily on President Nathan Bangs, Professor Harvey B. Lane, Professor John Johnston, Professor Augustus W. Smith, Professor William M. Willett, Professor Jacob F. Huber, as well as many of their <emph render="doublequote">ladies.</emph> Lyon also writes about his family and how lonely he feels when apart from his wife, Harriet, and son, Roscoe. Lyon's main reason for writing this journal was to record his journey to Wesleyan, but more specifically to detail the final examinations of the Wesleyan student body. Although Wesleyan University exams are the main topics of this diary, Lyon also describes the <emph render="doublequote">Oriental Society</emph> at Professor Willett's house and his private school, the Irving Institute. This is a photocopy of the original diary which was handwritten in English and contained 47 pages.</p>

<p>The diary begins on June 29, 1841, as the Lyon family departed from their home on the Columbus steamer from Tarrytown, New York, destined for New York City. On board the couple had a lengthy argument about the salary of the recently appointed Methodist pastor, Reverend Abm. Francis, and how it was insufficient for even the most meager lifestyle. Lyon concluded the argument with hopes that his case would be supported at the Quarterly Conference in August. After reaching the city, the family rode to a Mr. Leder's home where they decided to stay the night. During the evening, Lyon remarked on his son's infatuation with the scriptures after his son Roscoe thank God upon seeing an alarmed fire engine go by.</p>
<p>
In the morning (June 30), Lyon left his family behind as he traveled by the <emph render="doublequote">Gladiator</emph> steamer towards New Haven, Connecticut. On board he met several acquaintances also bound for Wesleyan University, including Rev. H. Chase and the two brothers Gabriel P. Disosway and Cornelius R. Disosway. After arriving in New Haven, Lyon took an hourlong train ride to Meriden, followed by a two hour coach ride to his final destination of Middletown. After arriving at Wesleyan University, Lyon met with Rev. Horace Bartlett, the steward of the university, who showed them to a wash area and the large dining hall. After dinner, the group went on a tour of the university, followed by a visit to the home of the Wesleyan president. Lyon and President Bangs immediately became well acquainted and the president hoped Lyon would call upon him again. Lyon then returned to the Steward and was introduced to Professor Willett who accompanied him to the chapel to pray. At the chapel, Lyon was quite upset as most of the student body paid no attention to the lecture and instead nodded off. After prayer he went to Prof. Willett's estate south of the university, where Lyon came across a very interesting meeting. It seems at Professor Willett's home there were <emph render="doublequote">. . . half a dozen of students who assembled to form an Oriental Society</emph> (pg. 13); however, this is the only mention of the society and Lyon gives no other details. After this encounter Lyon attended a General Class Meeting of Students, and then decided to return to Professor Willett's house to sleep. </p>



<p>The next morning (July 1), Lyon left Professor Willet's home and returned to the President's room where he met with the Exam Committee. Lyon includes notes on each student's progress through a series of exams over two days. The notes range from a simple <emph render="doublequote">very good</emph> to a small description of how badly the student failed. During the next two days, Lyon was able to observe examinations in thirteen different subjects including: moral philosophy, the United States constitution, political economics, combined mechanics, analytical geometry, declaration, logic, mental philosophy, law, geometry, astronomy, trigonometry, and national history, for which Lyon wrote, <emph render="doublequote">I am the Committee.</emph> In addition to evaluating each student on how well he did on the examinations, Lyon also occasionally commented on their attractiveness. After the exams were over, Lyon had dinner with Professor John Johnston, and then decided to lodge with Professor Harvey B. Lane for the night. That evening, Lyon attended a Committee meeting where they decided to <emph render="doublequote">pass upon the students.</emph> </p>



<p>The final entry in the diary details Lyon's trip back to New York City on July 3, as well as his summary of Wesleyan University. Lyon bragged that both Professor Willett and Johnston wanted him to stay at their houses during his trip, and that the President demanded that next time William visited, he must lodge with him. Lyon then gives a summary of his experiences with each of the professors he met and their personalities including: Professor Lane, Professor Johnston, Professor Smith, Professor Haber, Professor Willett, Professor Huber, and President Bangs. William also describes the <emph render="doublequote">ladies</emph> of these professors including: the president's wife, Professor Johnston's wife, Professor Lane's wife, and Professor Willett's wife. William concluded that he was disappointed overall in the Wesleyan student body, for they seemed to be tested only on the basic principles. The last sentence of this diary summarizes these sentiments: <emph render="doublequote">I candidly think that one year in Irving would be better for those freshmen than both Soph and Junior year in College.</emph></p>

<p>A typed transcript of Lyon's diary is also available. However, this copy is only from the time that Lyon reached Wesleyan and does not include the time spent with his family in New York.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of correspondence in this collection. The first letter of William Lyon is written to Professor Jacob F. Huber on August 18th, 1840. This letter describes William's gratitude for Wesleyan University granting him an honorary A.M. degree. However, William writes that there is no convenient way of getting his diploma, so he hopes that Professor Huber will forward it to H. + S. Raynor who will pay for the required fee. </p>



<p>The second letter, also to Professor Huber, tells of Lyon's acceptance to the Examination Committee for Wesleyan University. He writes that he has some hesitance in accepting this position because his school is still in session, but recognized that it was too grand of a proposition for him to deny. </p>



<p>A one-page biography of William Phoebus Lyon is details his life from 1819 to December 4, 1841. It names the places he took up residence, a few of his jobs, and his family affairs. However, none of these events are explained in any detail and most only give the years, not the exact dates.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
The David McAllester collection documents McAllester's interests in writing, research, music and ritual. Early folders in Series I: Writings, feature short stories and poetry which he submitted for consideration to magazines like <title render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. David McAllester also published widely, in scholarly journals, book reviews, encyclopedias of music, and materials for teachers. Drafts of his work and correspondence relating to his writings are contained in Series I.</p>

<p>The bulk of David McAllester's professional life consisted of his long tenure at Wesleyan University. Series II contains field notes and an exhaustive correspondence with colleagues in the fields of anthropology and ethnomusicology. Professor McAllester had close relationships with members of the Navajo Nation whom he worked with during field research. He was interested in the ceremonies of the Navajo people, and did extensive work on the Blessingway healing ceremony. He also had close ties to members of the academic world who either acted as a mentor to him, such as Lee Wyman, or whom he mentored, such as Charlotte Frisbie. His field work was an attempt to understand the differences and find the commonalities between people through music and ritual.</p>

<p>The circle of people in his life expanded ever outward and he kept in touch by voluminous letter writing as evidenced in Series III, Correspondence. This series contains both professional and personal letters since David McAllester never clearly drew the line between the two. In all of his correspondence, he kept carbons of letters he wrote, so the collection is easy to follow and rich in detail.</p>

<p>As a young man at the beginning of his career, his studies in anthropology at Columbia were interrupted by World War II. Documents in the beginning of Series IV, Personal History, show his application for Conscientious Objector status and the activities he was involved in during the four years he was in the Civilian Public Service (CPS). Projects of interest to him after formal retirement in 1986 are found in the second half of this series. His writing and administrative talents were put to use for the <title render="italic">Monterey News</title>, a local newspaper, for ten years. His humanism shows itself again in his involvement with the Never Again Campaign, a project between the US and Japan to promote understanding and the prevention of the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>David McAllester was married to his wife Susan from 1940 until her death in 1996. Series V contains letters she wrote to him, correspondence of her own with friends, and papers surrounding her final illness.</p>

<p>Series VI consists of a photograph album, circa 1894 from the family of David McAllester's mother, Maude Helen Park McAllester. The photographs are portraits of family members, individually and in groups. Some are labeled with names. They are mostly tintypes.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Wesleyan University Media Collection is arranged in series by media type. Material within
each series is arranged in numerical order. Each series starts with Box 1 and item one, so that
new material can easily be added without shifting boxes or changing box numbers. An earlier
system, for example, did not always distinguish between a reel-to-reel audio tape and an audio
cassette. Both would be given the next number and then housed in the same box. Housing material
in different formats in the same container has been discontinued. </p>

<p>Eight series have been established. Series I: Tape recordings consists of reel-to-reel
audiotapes. The tapes carry the prefix TW followed by an item number. Items that are on
audiocassettes are found in Series III. Series II: Video recordings consists primarily of films
on videocassette. These items carry the prefix VTW followed by an item number. The
videocassettes are primarily in VHS format, although a few are Betamax and are noted in the
listing. Series III: Audiocassettes consists of material on audiocassette and carry the prefix
AC followed by a number. Since some cassettes had been accessioned as a TW number, cross
references have been placed from TW to AC. Example: Wesleyan Spirits in Concert at Alpha Delta
Phi (TW 86) see: Audio Cassette AC 5. Series IV: CD format. Series V: Oversize items, followed
by a number. There are cross-references from the original series to the oversize location.
Series VI: Unprocessed material consists of music disks and reel-to-reel films in metal
canisters. Some general description of this material is available in the collections file for
this series. Series VII: DVD format. Series VIII: Record albums.</p>

<p>Some items are available in more than one format. When this occurs, a cross reference is made.
For example, the Jeffrey Schiff videotape of the Library Project Symposium is also available as
a DVD, so a cross reference is made from VTW 38 to CD/DVD 1. It should be noted that there is
one tape (TW 32) that is labeled as confidential. </p>

<p>The history detectives investigate a silver bar, with a strange mark, from the Atocha
shipwreck; a man in Portland, Oregon who may own a typewriter that belonged to famous war
correspondent Ernie Pyle; and a copy of August Spies’ autobiography originally owned by Lucy
Parsons, one with the only known copy with her stamp on the front, currently housed in the
Special Collections and Archives library of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.
Parsons sold this book to raise money to defend her husband, Albert Parsons, who was in jail,
accused of participating in the Haymarket Tragedy in Chicago in 1886. Albert Parsons and
August Spies were both executed, although there was no evidence to support the accusations.
The Haymarket is an important milestone in labor history and the history of radical political
movements.</p>

<p>Film about African-American students at Wesleyan by Jane Charles-Voltaire (class of 2007)
and Simone L. Collins (class of 2007).</p>
<p>Face Forward is a short photo essay that explores Black identity and community at
Wesleyan.</p>

<p>It was designed to start a conversation about community and what it really means to be a
Black community. Too often, the term community can be restrictive and at Wesleyan, there
often is a sense of disjointedness within the Black community. The central issue was that
while individuals identified themselves as being Black, that didn’t necessarily mean that
they were the same. So, in many ways, the focus of this project was to show the many faces of
Blackness and how we all fit together at Wesleyan. </p>

<p>Methodology:</p>

<p>To better understand our own Black community, specifically who we are and where we came
from, we chose to interview and photograph approximately 50 Wesleyan students, each of whom
identifies as Black. These students represented a multitude of backgrounds, nationalities,
interests and majors. We sought to understand their Black identity as relative to others but
perhaps also figure out how each of these unique identities could come together to form a new
understanding of Blackness and ultimately, a community.</p>

<p>We also wanted to consider the fact that we are all part of a much larger Wesleyan
community and visually reference the legacy we have been left with from previous generations
of Black students. The historical photographs are of Wesleyan students in the 1960's and
1970’s.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Mead Papers consist primarily of diaries, with one volume for each year from 1880 to 1944, with the exception of 1887 and 1922 for which no volumes exist. These volumes are arranged chronologically in Series I, Boxes 1-8, folders 1-30.</p>



<p>Mead inserted, pasted, or paper-clipped correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and other such items into his diaries. Until about 1920, few such items appeared and they have usually been left in place, especially if the item was small and related to the diary entry for a particular day. After 1920, Mead inserted more things into the front or back covers of the diary. These loose items, especially folded correspondence, programs, and clippings, were removed from the diary and placed in Series II in chronological order. </p>



<p>For 1891, the year that Mead traveled to Iceland, there is one separate two-volume journal and one photograph album covering the period 1891 July 8 to September 1. These items are housed in Series III, Box 9, folders 58-60. For the period before and after the Iceland trip in 1891, there is an 1891 diary housed in Series I, Box 1, folder 4. The diaries provide insight into the daily life style of a well-established Wesleyan faculty member. Entries relate to weather, visitors and visiting, travel, and reading. Some entries mention his wife, but for the most part, they are concerned with what William did. When traveling, many of the entries give a location with the date.</p>



<p>The Mead diaries are noteworthy for recording the amount of traveling that Mead did both before he married Kate, and throughout their married years, especially in the 1920s and 1930s. In a May 1922 article for the Wesleyan Alumnus, Mead writes about their travels to Paris, Rome, Cairo, and Jerusalem. They were again on a world tour after Meads retirement from Wesleyan in 1925. This tour lasted about five years. They spent much of 1926 touring Europe, London, Spain, Francis, Tunis. An article in the December 1926 issue of the Wesleyan Alumnus mentions that Professor and Mrs. Mead have postponed their visit to China. (The Meads did not travel to China until 1936.) In 1927, they journeyed to the Canary Islands, Naples, Pompeii, Athens, Tripoli. In 1928, they were in Rangoon, Bombay, Athens; and 1929 London, Paris Rome. They returned home to Haddam on October 4, 1929. Another item of note that appear in the collection is a ten page typescript by Kate, dated May 30, 1932, (Box 8, folder 49) giving an account of a trip soth to New Orleans. Diaries entries give location where the entry is written: Haddam, at sea, etc. Traveling continued until Kate’s death. </p>



<p>In 1936, the Meads traveled to China. They began their journey from Connecticut to China on January 4 when they drove from Haddam to New Haven and took a train to New York. By the morning of January 7, they crossed the Mexican border at the Rio Grande at Laredo. On January 8, they were in Mexico City, and on the 24th they boarded the President Hoover in San Francisco, and arrived in Honolulu on the 29th. On the 28th of February the Meads were in Shanghai where they were met by John McGregor Gibb, Wesleyan Class of 1904, who was in the exporting business. The Meads were in Canton in early March. They had dinner with E.K. Smith, Wesleyan Class of 1895, on March 23 and visited the Great Wall on March 24. William’s diary provides a daily record of the China trip from the time he and Kate left Haddam in January until they returned home to Haddam on May 17.</p>



<p>The summer of 1937 found the Meads in London, Paris and Amsterdam. In April 1938, William broke his hip. There was not much traveling until May 1939 when they drove cross country. In July 1940 through August, the Meads drove to Canada and Nova Scotia. William notes in his diary that he is now 80 years old.</p>



<p>Although Mead was associate principal of Ansonia high school for only two years, he seemed to maintain contact and interest in the school. In the correspondence files, there is a copy of a graduation program for March 28, 1884 and photograph of students and teachers dated 1883 (Series II, Box 8, folder 31). An article about the retirement of Mary E. Lathrop as Librarian of Derby High School, from the Ansonia Evening Sentinel, dated July 29, 1932, is filed in the 1932 correspondence folder (Series II, Box 9, folder 49). The 1933 folder (Series II, Box 9, folder 50) contains an article from The Observer titled, “1933 Looks Back to 1883,” by Lois Davidson about the first class to graduate Ansonia High School in 1883 that mentions Mead.</p>



<p>The collections contains some family correspondence especially with Kate’s sister, Mabeth Hurd Paige. Mabeth was a member of the Minnesota state legislature. Her husband, James Paige, died on February 4, 1940. Mabeth had two daughters, Emma and Elizabeth. Kate’s brother, Randolph Campbell Hurd (1872-1956) was a member of the Wesleyan Class of 1895, but left school in his sophomore year. He received an M.D. degree from Harvard in 1897.</p>



<p>Kate Mead seemed to forsee her death. In November 1940, on a trip to New York with her sister, Mabeth Hurd Paige, Kate discusses how William should be cared for in the event of her death. Shortly after Kate’s death, Mabeth typed up a document outlining Kate’s wishes that William signed. This <emph render="doublequote">contract</emph> appears near the front cover of the 194l diary. With Kate’s death, William appeared to decline quickly. His handwriting deteriorated, entries became shorter, and he did not travel or want travel. His last diary entry is for April 5, 1944, five years before his death: <emph render="doublequote">Haddam Overcast . . . ? Read as usual.</emph> William died in 1949 at the age of 88. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection is divided into five folders. The first and second folders are general correspondence between Wesleyan and the various branches of the military, during the years 1968-1971, and 1972-1975, respectively. This correspondence is mostly generic in nature: military requests to visit campus, University responses to these requests, University inquiries about military programs, and military mailings and brochures detailing their career options for students.</p>

<p>The third folder is the Policy folder, and it contains the documents pertaining to the creation of the University's policy towards military presence on campus. Because of student and faculty protests about the military actively coming on campus and conducting interviews with students, the University created a new policy whereby there was an Advisor on Military Programs for students who scheduled meetings with the military based solely on student request. There was some controversy, as the Marines accused Wesleyan of barring the military from the campus, and due to a Public Law in the NASA Act (enclosed in the collection), the university could have been penalized by the Secretary of Defense by having funds denied to it. The information pertaining to this conflict is all enclosed in the third file.</p>

<p>The fourth file is the Philip Rockwell file. It includes several articles from the <title render="italic">Argus </title>and the <title render="italic">Middletown Press</title> from 1968 and 1969 about military protests by students, and the University's decision to create a new position for an <title render="doublequote">Advisor on Military Programs.</title> It is at this time that the University created a new policy toward the military on campus. This file contains information about the creation of this office, a handwritten essay by Rockwell entitled <title render="doublequote">My Stand on Position of Advisor on Military Programs,</title> correspondence, and his annual report of activities from 1969 to 1972.</p>

<p>The last file in the collection is the Paul Reynolds file. Paul Reynolds was a professor at Wesleyan who vocally protested the Vietnam War and military presence on campus, for various reasons. This file mostly contains his writings, his letters to the administration, the Argus, and detailed written explanations about his beliefs and actions toward military and espionage recruiters on the Wesleyan campus as well as the administration's response to this accusations and inquiries. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The records of the Missionary Lyceum survived in five volumes of varying sizes, entitled Account book, Records, Register, Correspondence, and Letter book. In the fall of 1978, in order to preserve them longer, the letters were removed from the letter book, put into folders, and the decaying volume discarded. An alphabetical index of letter-writers was made. The small amount of correspondence in the Correspondence volume was also removed and the volume discarded.</p>
<p>The contents of the Correspondence volume are now found in Folder 1. They include 16 letters to and from the Lyceum, copied over by the corresponding secretary. The file also includes <title render="doublequote">Memorandum of the correspondence of the M. Lyceum</title> and lists of corresponding members, honorary members, and honorary members ex officio. </p>
<p>The correspondence that was removed from the letter book is now in folders 2-14. A name index to the correspondence in folders 1-14 is as follows:

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This Middlesex County Archaeological Digs Records were compiled by Stephen Dyson. They document his archaeology labs conducted in the field and courses focusing on local Connecticut sites. It includes student essays, student field sheets, student lab inventories, grant proposals, Connecticut Historical Commission Inventory sheets for sites in the Middlesex area, and photos of mid-19th century topographic and housing maps of the towns of Middletown, Middlefield, and Cromwell, Connecticut. </p>

<p>There is a 1977 report written by Stephen Dyson (Box 1, Folder 10) which reviews the findings and the importance of the class after their first three years. He wrote about the Magill House, their second site of excavation, and the conclusions that were made about the wealthy Captain Magill of the 19th century. After their third excavation at Kelly's Pet Store, formerly known as Doc Hall's House, he was able to compare the different life styles of the two families. The Hall House residents lived a more reserved life and preferred the pipe over drink. The class concluded that the Magill House was full of luxuries through analysis of pottery found during the excavation. Dyson wrote that, with the success of his class excavating the Middlesex County area, it would soon include the community and start a program with children from the community.</p>

The collection consists of a scrapbook that Miller kept during his four years at Wesleyan, anniversary medals presented to Miller by Wesleyan in 1931, two diaries covering his Freshman year (1910-1911) and second semester of his Junior year (January-June 1913), and a supplemental binder. Highlights of the scrapbook include playbills for both Wesleyan and local productions, scorecards and tickets relating to various sporting events on campus, a number of Miller's semester and examination schedules, items related to the Omega Phi chapter of Delta Upsilon, cigarettes and cigars (including Turkish), and photographs (mostly unidentified). The supplemental binder includes a short biography done by Miller's son John W. Miller, transcriptions of the diaries, genealogy of the Miller family, family photos, tributes to Miller, and photocopies of various items in the scrapbook.

requirements, including budget information. McAllester's proposal for an
anthropology department, dating to roughly the same period, is also included. The
meeting minutes, memoranda, correspondence, and grant proposals relate to the
creation of the ethnomusicology doctoral program. An NDEA fellowship application and
a report entitled Program for Advanced Studies in World Music are also included. The
Creative Arts Program documents contain information on the ethnic music component of
the music program.</p>
<p>Series 2, Photographs, comprises images and printed material relating to music
performances by members of the Wesleyan community or artists visiting the
university, circa 1947 to 1988. Approximately 400 print photographs--as well as
contact sheets, negatives, and slides--are included. The photographs are arranged in
two subseries: Faculty and Student Groups, and World Music Performers. The Faculty
and Student Groups subseries includes images of Music Department staff and student
music group members, either posed or during concerts. Photographs in the World Music
Performers subseries show visiting artists who specialized in African, Indian,
Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Native American music. Instruments shown include
the Indian been, kanjira, mrdangam, sarangi, sarod, sitar, tabla, tambura, and vina;

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The papers of Gorham Munson (1896-1969) deal almost wholly with his support of Social Credit
and are confined to the years 1932 to 1945. There is almost no information about his career as a
literary critic, book editor, and teacher of writing. The material includes articles, books,
correspondence, pamphlets, and scrapbooks </p>
<p>The collection grew out of Munson's interconnected roles as organizer, publicist, fund-raiser,
editor, promoter, lobbyist, propagandist, theorist, leader, and diplomat for a succession of
Social Credit organizations from 1932 to 1945. Published materials provide the best
documentation of the development of the theory of Social Credit in England, Canada, the United
States, Australia, and New Zealand. The politics of individual and factional differences within
the American movement is represented best by the files of correspondence.</p>

<p>Munson's most revealing correspondence is with the slightly-known figures in the Social Credit
movement. The chief exception to this is the correspondence with Ezra Pound, his father Homer
Pound, James Laughlin IV and, to a lesser degree, William Carlos Williams. For England there is
strong documentation in the letter files of the <title render="italic">New English
Weekly</title>, Major C. H. Douglas, John Hargrave, Philip Mairet and Stanley Mott. For Canada
the documentation lies more in published material Correspondence between Munson and R. Halliday
Thompson is revealing of the difficulties of conducting an international Social Credit review,
<title render="italic">The Beacon</title> of Winnipeg, which incorporated <title render="italic">New Democracy</title> in 1937-1939. For Australia and New Zealand there is
published material and some correspondence such as that with Lilly Bierne.</p>

<p>For the United States the internal dynamics of the Social Credit movement are manifest in many
files, especially those of Herbert Bruce Brougham, Allan R. Brown, Howard L. Buck, A. M.
Edwards, Paul Hampden, Laurence Morris, W. A. Nyland, A. H. Spencer, Elliott Taylor, and Mrs. E.
Sohier Welch. Congressional correspondents include Charles G. Binderup, Fred L. Crawford, T.
Alan Goldsborough and Jerry F. Voorhis. </p>
<p>Correspondence will be found in four difference series in the Munson papers, arranged
alphabetically in each by the name of the writer of the letter. In searching for material on any
single individual the listings in all series should be consulted.</p>
<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged into the following series:</p>
<p><ref target="s1"><title render="italic">New Democracy Correspondence,
1932-1938</title></ref>: Office correspondence to and from staff: Gorham Munson, Herbert Bruce
Brougham, W. A. Nyland, Lawrence and Paul Hampden. Occasional items outside the period that
pertain to New Democracy and Social Credit are included.</p>
<p><ref target="s2">ASCM Correspondence, 1938-1945</ref>: Office correspondence of staff,
especially of Gorham Munson and Paul Hampden. Some items predate the founding of the American
Social Credit Movement in October 1938.</p>
<p><ref target="s3">Social Credit Subject File, 1932-1945</ref>: Materials from a succession of
Social Credit organizations in which Munson was engaged, publications with which he had
business (including New Democracy), and individuals associated with him. The series is divided
by country. Contents of folders vary and include correspondence, memoranda, mimeographed and
printed material. A few items stemming from the 1920s are included.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Wesleyan Museum Records contains annual reports, correspondence, invoices, inventories, catalogues, accession books, photos, and other materials. It is organized into four series.</p>
<p>Series 1 contains Annual Reports of the museum. Series 2 contains Administrative materials, such as correspondence, used in the daily operations of the museum. Series 3, the largest series, is Accessions, Catalogues and Inventories. These materials reflect the museum's natural history focus, with many bird, fish, mammal and insect specimens. There are also detailed lists of shells, minerals, wood samples, coins, marbles, and even a detailed description of the museum's mummy. There are also catalogs of some of the curiosities donated to the museum by collectors or groups. Series 4 is Images, a small collection of photographs and negatives.</p>

</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>The Annual Reports contain summaries of changes in administration or procedure, major acquisitions, number of visitors, and any other notable happenings. The reports from the 1970s relate to the anthropology and archaeology collections, some of which came from the original Wesleyan Museum.</p>
<p>In most cases, the photocopies of the 1877-1892 annual reports should be used to prevent wear and tear on the originals.</p>
</scopecontent>
<scopecontent>
<p>Administrative materials include correspondence, reports, forms, registers of visitors, and other documents used in the administration of museum operations.</p>

<p>New accessions to the museum, organized by genre, were carefully recorded by hand in bound volumes or notebooks. Each accession was assigned a number.</p>
<p>Catalogues are inventories of particular collections, usually assembled by a single collector or small group of collectors.</p>
<p>Inventories are lists or descriptions of items in the museum.</p>
<p>These materials reflect the museum's natural history focus, with many bird, fish, mammal and insect specimens. There are also detailed lists of shells, minerals, wood samples, coins, marbles, and even a detailed description of the museum's mummy.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Stephen Henry Olin Regimental Scrapbook consists of two sections. The first
begins with a hand-painted title page and dedication page, and then continues with
about 15 pages of newspaper clippings detailing the travels of the 7th Regiment of the New York Militia in
1860. The second section begins after a number of blank pages and consists of
humorous newspaper clippings including puns and moral stories. In the middle of the
second section are two more hand-painted pages, these dedicated to the New York Fire
Department.</p>
<p>This scrapbook predates the start of the war, and instead details much lighter
subject matter. The first portion of the book consists entirely of newspaper and
magazine clippings (many from <title render="italic">Vanity Fair</title>) detailing
a trip that the 7th Regiment made to Washington D.C. in February 1860. Specifically,
the trip was made to attend the inauguration of a new statue of George Washington.
The Regiment was apparently extended the invitation by the Honorable John Cochrane,
who made promises of great hospitality. Many of the clippings in this scrapbook are
of a cartoonish nature, and show the 7th Regiment facing misfortunes and snubs--
first being stood up at the station after a long train ride, then wading through
feet of mud in the streets, and finally finding that their host had left the city.
There are also articles about the inauguration ceremony itself, as well as a copy of
an order sent to the 7th Regiment by Colonel Marshall Lefferts before the trip, but
mostly the material laments the <emph render="doublequote">hardships</emph> of the
regiment in a rather tongue-in-cheek manner. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This book contains the records of two incarnations of the early Wesleyan University
student group, the Physiological Society. The first section begins with a
constitution written in 1839 with articles concerning the election of leadership,
and goes on to by-laws explaining how meetings should be run, and what form they
should take. Next are entries of minutes for the nine meetings held between May and
November 1839, and then the account skips to an entry written in May 1842 explaining
how the Society disbanded in November 1839. The second section contains a new and
more detailed constitution and a comprehensive members list. Minutes of meetings for
this later incarnation of the group date from May 1842 to April 1844.</p>
<p>Generally, the first half of this collection is very formal and not entirely
informative about the Society's aims. There is much discussion about electing
leadership, raising funds to create library, and generally setting the groundwork
for a structure. The second half of the record, however, is much more detailed. In
the second constitution, the Society speaks of the virtues of physical purity,
mental and moral improvement, and the <emph render="doublequote">all controlling
sympathies which exist between body, mind and spirit.</emph> The Society brought
in honorary members such as local physicians and Wesleyan professors to speak and
lead meetings, although there was also a great tradition of student oration: topics
included Tobacco, Animal Heart and Muscular Action, and <title render="doublequote">Savage Life Considered with Reference to Health and Longevity.</title>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection of Public Information Press Releases is comprised of the press releases Wesleyan University sent out between 1961 and 1978, mostly to Connecticut publications and occasionally to publications throughout the United States. Many of the press releases are about the Wesleyan athletic teams, including scores, upcoming games, individual achievements, and team statistics. Other press releases detail cultural and academic activities on campus, such as visiting lecturers and guest speakers, musical performances, plays, workshops, movies shown on campus, and lectures by and discussions with Wesleyan faculty. In May of each year, a press release was sent to the hometown paper of each graduating student and again in the fall for the incoming freshmen. Any announcements of awards given to students, either academic or athletic, were sent to hometown papers as well. Press releases also noted any information regarding achievements of faculty, including faculty receiving tenure and announcements of new faculty to Wesleyan.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection contains issues of over 490 different gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender periodicals published between 1966 and 1998. The bulk consists of English-language titles from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, though examples from the European continent, Russia, and Israel are also present. The extent of each title may vary from a single issue to several complete (or near-complete) volumes. The collection is arranged into three separate series by size, and alphabetically by title thereunder.</p>


<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>In the Box List, each title's contents are listed at the issue level. The first and last issues of each volume generally include an added date for reference. For longer runs of a single title, the first and last issues contained in each box are also listed by date. Titles that have been published with incorrect issue statements are listed, with a correction in parentheses if necessary. Multiple copies of a single issue are occasionally present in the collection, and have been noted. Some dates have been supplied for titles and appear in parenthesis. A comprehensive <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/library/schome/FAs/1000-65_location_index.pdf">city/state/country index</extref> has been added to this finding aid, as well as a <extref href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/library/schome/FAs/1000-65_timeline.pdf">separate timeline</extref> that can be used to locate titles by publication date or date range.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The Daniel C. Rand Journal, which covers his four years at Wesleyan University,
is highly informative in nature. Just like many other young men
of the time, Rand treated his journal as a ledger with no expense too trivial to
record. There are limited portions where Rand writes a paragraph or two about the
end of a semester, or his journey from New Hampshire to Connecticut, but generally
these portions are very formal. Rand recorded purchases and expenditures by date
over the first fifty pages of the journal. These fifty pages take the reader from the fall
of 1839 as Rand journeyed to Wesleyan as a freshman, to the late summer of 1843 when
he graduates. Included in his expenses are book lists, tuition, clothing, and little
incidentals such as outings on the river or peaches from local farmers. His
collection of lists paints an image of a time when a semester's tuition was less
than $40, when students attended lectures on such stylish subjects as phrenology for
entertainment, and when a month-long trip to New York in the summer was the height
of luxury. Marginal notes about items such as his acceptance of a teaching position at a Middletown school for $17
a month in 1841 or his attempts to record step-by-step instructions to popular
dances add a dose of character to the journal. Other
highlights include dues paid to the mysterious Pi Omicron Psi society, which Rand
always writes in Greek letters.</p>
<p>There are two other sections in Rand's journal. The first is his written
accounts of business conducted at his family's powder mill in 1844 and 1845, and the
second is the minutes, constitution, and by-laws of the Union Eloquium's Society in
Meriden, New Hampshire. It appears that Rand was the secretary of this society
before he left for college in 1839.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection contains primarily nineteenth century individual portrait photographs. A small portion of photographs is of identified individuals. When the photographer or sitter is known, the identification is noted in the listing. The images include daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes (also called ferrotypes), card images, and card images in an album. Most dates are approximate ones determined by internal evidence. Photographers are noted when known.</p>

<p>The album is 50 pages with two carte-de-visite to a page. Annotations identify some images and/or photographers. Pencil erasures at top of some pages, apparently names of individuals depicted in images once in the album. It is in poor condition with detached covers; repairs to front and back pages, and spine, using canvas; the lower latch is missing.</p>

<p>The images are organized by type, cased images precede uncased images; identified images precede unidentified images. Unidentified images are arranged by size, then in approximate chronological order.</p>

<p>The Diaries and Correspondence series includes personal diaries and account books kept by William North Rice during his time as a Wesleyan University student, and correspondence from family members, friends, colleagues, and fellow alumni from throughout his life.</p>
<p>Diaries date from Rice's years as a student at Wesleyan, and include information about academics, social life, campus groups, and other Wesleyan-related observations. Some transcripts, made by Rice's grandson, are available in this collection as well. The "Letters Home from Wesleyan" were mainly written to Rice's father, William Rice, who served on the Wesleyan Board of Trustees. Some of these letters also include paragraphs separately addressed to other family members. Other letters were specifically addressed to other family members. Other correspondence addresses the issue of coeducation at Wesleyan during its first phase of admitting female students. There is also congratulatory correspondence regarding Rice's 50th anniversary of graduation from Wesleyan and his 80th birthday. Rice also corresponded frequently with his son about Wesleyan topics.</p>
<p>The final part of this series consists of letters arranged by the last name of the correspondent. Most of these writers were Wesleyan alumni, and most only wrote one or two letters. Topics include opinions on trustee matters, campus politics, selection of presidents, alumni affairs, coeducation, student discipline, and faculty recruitment.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
The Marjorie Rice Daltry Rosenbaum Papers contain both work and personal papers relating to her educational programs and life. The majority of the papers in the collection relate to C.A.U.S.E. and its corresponding programs, but there are documents that relate to other programs that she was involved with during her life. The work papers in the collection are made up of photos, newspaper articles and general press, meeting minutes, proposals, evaluations, and correspondence with principals or directors of certain schools and programs. The personal papers include personal correspondence, drawings, resumes and vitaes, and papers corresponding to specific individuals. The correspondence for the programs generally concerns how the program is fairing or requesting certain aid or resources. The personal correspondence ranges from the familial to more business oriented topics.
</p>

<arrangement>
<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>
The collection is arraged in 5 series. Each folder either corresponds to a specific program, year range, individual, or type of paper (for the personal papers). For those programs that are contained in multiple folders--including C.A.U.S.E., M.E.S.S., and High School Humanities--the folders are arranged so as to relate to a specific topic within the program. The folders are either arranged alphabetically by last name or program title or chronologically as in the series of newspaper articles and press.

<scopecontent>
<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection is organized into ten folders. The first folder has various types of documents pertaining to the overall project and the planning process involved. The second folder deals specifically with the issue of space allocation, and how the Building Committee had to work with the various science departments to plan out exactly how much space would be needed and how it could be distributed. The third folder contains documents and correspondence about the difficult issue of air conditioning in the Science Center. Folders 4 and 5 are both meeting minutes from the Smith Haines Lundberg and Waehler architecture firm. The sixth folder is similar, but from the E &amp; F Construction Company. Folder 7 is the research and planning behind the Science Library. There was much discussion and research into what would be the final product. Folder 8 contains the documents reflecting the actual construction and furnishing of the library, installing bookstacks, and finding a good spatial layout. There was much correspondence sent between people involved in the process of creating the Science Library, most prominently university librarian Wyman Parker, and these are contained in folder 9. Finally, folder 10 contains documents, memos, and notes that did not fit with any of the categories above, or could not be deciphered.

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>This collection contains the papers of E. E. Schattschneider, a political scientist who spent the majority of his career at Wesleyan University. This collection is organized into seven series and primarily reflects Schattschneider's research interests from the 1950s until his death in 1971. All series are arranged alphabetically by name or subject and chronologically thereunder, with the exception of Series 3, Teaching, Wesleyan Government Department, Student Papers, each section of which is arranged chronologically, and alphabetically thereunder. Schattschneider's original order and nomenclature for folder titles have been retained throughout wherever possible; renaming and further description is present where the original titles have been nonexistant or extremely misleading.</p>

<p>Series 1, Correspondence, includes primarily incoming correspondence concerning professional activities, teaching, speeches and publications. Other notable groups include correspondence with Schattschneider's publishers concerning several of his books, organizational correspondence relating to Schattschneider's NBC television series <title render="doublequote">American Government and the Pursuit of Happiness</title> (1957), and correspondence concerning visiting professorships at American universities. Correspondents include many elected officials from Connecticut from the 1940s-60s including Chester Bowles, John Dempsey, and Abraham Ribicoff. Other correspondents include Harold H. Burton, J. William Fulbright, Samuel P. Huntington, Estes Kefauver, Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson, and Arthur T. Vanderbilt. Cross-references have been noted for persons appearing in more than one location if their corporate or university affiliation changes. Correspondence notation lists the amount of incoming correspondence first, followed by outgoing correspondence (e.g. Brown, Joseph R. 3/0, 1967-68).</p>

<p>Series 2, Writings and Speeches, contains notes, drafts, corrected typescripts, and author proofs for several of Schattschneider's books including <title render="italic">Party Government</title>, <title render="italic">A Guide to the Study of Public Affairs</title>, <title render="italic">The Semi-Sovereign People</title>, and <title render="italic">Two Hundred Million Americans in Search of a Government</title>. This series also contains documents, including corrected typescripts, for an unpublished volume or volumes titled, at various times, <title render="italic">The Great American Experiment</title> and <title render="italic">The Resolution of Conflict - An Explanation of American Government</title>, the latter of which Schattschneider was completing at the time of his death, and typescripts of several unpublished speeches and lectures.</p>

<p>Included in other series are student projects from Schattschneider's seminars on performing local community surveys, subject files of background material and notes for individual books as well as general subject files, family photographs, a documentary film written and presented by Schattschneider, and a collection of books annotated by Schattschneider.</p>

<head>Collection Arrangement</head>
<p>The papers are organized into twelve series: Education, 1902-1957; Law Practice,

<p>These papers were organized by Arthur T. Vanderbilt and his secretaries during
his lifetime and placed in storage immediately after his death in 1957. They
remained in storage in Summit, New Jersey until moved in bulk to Wesleyan in
1971. A true lifetime of record keeping meant that their rich quality was
matched by their quantity, totaling 11,000 pounds. </p>

<p>Numerous books and bound serials not previously among its holdings have been
catalogued and placed on the shelves on the Wesleyan University Library. A
selection of duplicate books written or edited by Arthur T. Vanderbilt are

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>The collection consists of two bound volumes, and an unbound photocopy of one of the volumes. The collection is housed in two half-letter size boxes.</p>

<p>Bound volume, <title render="italic">Copy of Manuscripts by Moses C. White, M.D., Pioneer Missionary, Relating to the Founding of Methodist Missions in Foochow, China. Presented to the Wesleyan University Library by his Niece, Cornelia C. White, 1930.</title> (There is also an unbound photocopy of this volume.) In addition to presenting a copy of this volume to Wesleyan, Cornelia White also gave copies to Yale University and the New Haven Colony Historical Society. </p>

<p>Cornelia White appears to have transcribed and copied both published and unpublished material in order to compile this volume. Although pages are not numbered in consecutive order, some of the material in the order that it appears is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Moses Clarke White, a biographical obituary sketch retyped from the original in the <title render="italic">Yale Medical Journal</title>, Dec. 1900, v.7, no.6. </p>

<p>2. Moses Clarke White, biographical obituary sketch retyped from original in the New York East Conference Minutes for 1901, in the General Minutes of the Spring Conferences for 1901, page 116.</p>

<p>3. Article by S.H. Gage which appeared in the <title render="italic">Journal of Applied Microscopy and Laboratory Methods</title>, vol. 4, no. 1, Jan. 1901. </p>

<p>4. Founding and Early History of Our Chinese Mission, 1847-1853 by Moses C. White , being an address delivered at Boston, September, 1887. Copied by C.C. White with permission of M.C.W.</p>

<p>5. Transcription of letters by Elijah Hedding, Rufus Anderson, J.H. Woolcott, Charles Pittman, etc.</p>

<p>6. Cornelia C. White writes: The following article I pasted, in 1896, in one of my Scrap-books, and from its appearance I judge it was taken from an issue of the Christian Advocate near that date (1848), probably one that my parents saved. C.C.W. (pages 1-5)</p>

<p>7. Early History of the China Mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church By Rev. Moses C. White, M.D. Contains typescript of a letter by Frederick Thomas Keeney, Resident Bishop, Methodist Episcopal Church, Foochow, China to Mrs. Mary E. King (grand niece of MCW), 1923 Dec 4. </p>

<p>8. Toward the end of the volume there is material that is described in the following words: " Copied August 21, 1898, from data given by Rev.M.C. White, and from papers published by him in 1897". Included here is a moving biographical sketch and tribute to Jane Isabel White, transcribed from <title render="italic">American Missionary Memorial, including biographical and historical sketches.</title> Ed. By H.W. Pierson. (N.Y.: Harper, 1853.) </p>

<p>The second item is described in an old inventory as a Common Place Book, dated May 24, 1845. Handwritten information on the inside cover of the volume: <emph render="doublequote">The Property of Moses C. White, Middletown, Ct., May 24, 1845.</emph> There is a date stamped on an inside page of the volume as October 20, 1937 which is probably when the Wesleyan Library acquired the item. The volume is a combination of diary, notes on lectures that he has attended, Bible references, and scrapbook. Some pages are interleaved with loose correspondence, notes, and plant leaves. There is a page with Chinese characters. A letter or page of Chinese is inserted into the front of the volume. </p>

<p>The first entry in the volume is dated Wesleyan University, Saturday evening May 24, 1845, several days after the end White's last term at Wesleyan. Several entries are dated as Wesleyan, but approximately one-third of the way through the volume is an entry titled, <emph render="doublequote">Fokien Examination Hall at Fukchan</emph> followed by another titled, <title render="doublequote">Sketches relating to Christianity in Java</title> which begins <emph render="doublequote">On my return from China in Jan 1853 the ship in which I sailed met with an accident in the Java Sea.</emph> It appears this volume was started at Wesleyan, taken to China, and back.</p>

<p>The third item in the collection is the Gospel of Matthew translated into the Fuhchan colloquial dialect. It was prepared from the classical Chinese version in 1851 for the Missionary Lyceum of Wesleyan University. </p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>After World War I was over, the Wesleyan Alumni Council sent a form requesting military service records of students and alumni involved in the war. These forms were meant to be published as a permanent memorial to those who served. However, no evidence that this book was ever produced has been found. Wesleyan had a total of 1,169 men involved in the war effort, of whom 26 died. The majority of Wesleyan men were involved in the Army, S.A.T.C., and Navy. A few of the specific occupations were as chaplains, ambulance drivers, quartermasters, pilots, and engineers of chemical warfare. </p>
<p>The first page of the form requested basic biographical information of each man: name, address, marriage status, education, and occupation before entry into service. The middle section asked for the War Record: Date entered in service, location of training, promotions, location where stationed abroad, date of when they first went into action, injuries, date discharged from service, and occupation after the war. On the back of the form, sent to those who survived the war, was a questionnaire asking about their impressions on the war, what mental/physical effects they had, how their Wesleyan education benefited them, and their feelings toward universal training. The forms also requested that they send additional documents: a photo of themselves before the war and a photo of them in military uniform. Very few actually sent in photos. Among those who did was Captain Frank E. Wing, class of 1900, who made an album of the Red Cross in France from March 1918 to February 1919. There are also many letters of correspondence between Arthur B. Haley, who was in charge of creating this collection, and those who filled out the forms. The widow of Joseph H. Hefflon, class of 1894, transcribed a collection of letters from her husband and other YMCA men that were stationed with her husband. The letters tell her husband's story of immediately being torpedoed once shipped out, the way he served as a father figure and the respect that he developed with the other men, and then finally of his dying of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Of those who completed the questionnaire, almost all of the responses to the first question indicated a sense of patriotism, duty, and pride in enlisting to help their country. Many wrote that they regretted not signing up sooner. The most common responses to how Wesleyan benefited them were: training through R.O.T.C. and S.A.T.C., athletics, math, and languages. Philip Prescott Frost, class of 1902, wrote: <emph render="doublequote">Hazing is a good introduction to the military discipline. Two fraternity brothers saved my life by getting me away from my officers and from the front after I was gassed and had gone back too soon. Credit Psi U.</emph></p>
<p>Many who were in favor of universal military training cite it as good for the nation so long as the U.S. did not follow the German model of militarism common at this time. More than a dozen cited the Swiss model as a positive idea. A certain percentage, despite their patriotism, had strong feelings against universal military training. One example is Theodore Foster Comstock, class of 1913. Although he said he would not have <emph render="doublequote">missed it for anything</emph> he did not believe in universal military training: <emph render="doublequote">Believe in maintaining a reasonable standing army of men fit for nothing else, but not in wasting the time of better men in training for war or in risking the development of a desire for war in the minds of men with military knowledge for which they have no immediate use.</emph></p>

<p>The single volume of the Young Men's Republican Club of Wesleyan University Records
consists of an account of the activities of the club in the first year of its
existence, 1856. It begins with an account of the first meeting of the club. On June
21, the group selected as its first chairman William J. Foss, class of 1856. The
group also inaugurated its tradition of speechmaking at meetings, with Mallalieu,
Upham, Elmer, Ela, Longstreet, Ginn, Johnson, Shepard, and Buddington listed as

<p>The section of the book that follows consists of accounts of several meetings of the
club.</p>
<p>At the first regular meeting on June 26, 1856, the executive committee and club
officers were elected. H. P. Foss was elected as president, J. M. Pomeroy as vice
president, E. A. Winchell as secretary and D. H. Ela as Treasurer. The remaining
members of the executive committee were to be E. Johnson, W. F. Mallalieu, N. Fellows
and W. C. Finn. The meeting also saw the selection of <emph render="doublequote">Smith, Pomeroy, and Powers</emph> to
a subcommittee tasked with coordinating the efforts of the Wesleyan club with the
Middletown Fremont Society. </p>
<p>The second set of meetings on June 27, 1856, began with a meeting of the Executive
Committee which saw the adoption of <emph render="doublequote">a tax of a few cents,</emph> that is dues, to be paid
by the members of the club. Pomeroy and Foss were tasked with contacting the
Middletown Fremont Society. The executive committee also provided for a list to
collect the names of club members <emph render="doublequote">willing to speak on behalf of Fremont and
freedom.</emph> At the evening meeting of the full club, Smith, Pomeroy, and Powers
reported on the meeting with the Middletown Fremont Society and their report was
<emph render="doublequote">accepted</emph> by the club. Also, <emph render="doublequote">motion was carried to send for two copies of the
Campaign Tribune.</emph> </p>
<p>The next meeting on July 5, 1856, included the acceptance of the first report of the
executive committee and speechmaking. The report describes the selection and
election of club officers and subcommittees that had occurred at the prior meetings,
and reports on the progress of the group so far. The executive committee report also
reveals that a <emph render="doublequote">ratification meeting</emph> was <emph render="doublequote">held in the city</emph> on June 25, and
provides a list of the members that spoke at the event.</p>

<p>At the meeting on July 26, 1856, the report of the Executive Committee was heard and
accepted, and speeches were made. <emph render="doublequote">President being absent, VP presided.</emph> The report
follows the relationship between the Wesleyan Young Men's Republican Club and the
Middletown Fremont Society. It notes that the subcommittee had been enabled to
contact the Middletown group, and that the Middletown organization had appointed a
liaison, <emph render="doublequote">probably of a temporary nature,</emph> to attend the Wesleyan club's meetings.
The Wesleyan club had by then been assured of the <emph render="doublequote">hearty cooperation</emph> of the
Middletown club. The report itemizes campaign materials to be bought with club funds,
including, <emph render="doublequote">1 copy of Upham's Life of Fremont, 1 copy of History and Principles of
the Republican Party, 2 copies of Facts for the People [and] 2 copies each of the
publication of the Washington Republican Association.</emph> The report reveals the
concerns of the Executive Committee, noting that, <emph render="doublequote">great care</emph> must be taken to
<emph render="doublequote">avoid offending anyone</emph> on the subject of the Vice Presidency, <emph render="doublequote">because pleas for
either Dayton or Johnson could have an injurious effect on the vote for Fremont in
this state.</emph> The club was instructed not to make <emph render="doublequote">any offensive remarks about Mr.
Fillmore,</emph> and to confine their remarks as speakers to the official platform so as
not to <emph render="doublequote">distract and divide.</emph></p>
<p>The meeting of September 6, 1856 marked the beginning of a new school year. The
minutes of the meeting describe the election of new members and a new Executive
Committee. G. F. Comfort became chairman, and A. Eggleston, H. Shuster, G. Squire,
Worth, and Anthony were elected as new members. New elections also included William
J. Elmer as president, E. A. Winchell as vice president, J. R. Ercanbrack as
secretary, and S. Fuller as treasurer, while the election of the remaining Executive
Committee members-at-large was deferred until the following meeting. It was also
resolved at this meeting to form a glee club <emph render="doublequote">in connexion [sic] with the Repub.
Club.</emph></p>
<p>September 10, 1856, the president of the Executive Committee and members of the
subcommittee were selected. <emph render="doublequote">Were present Elmer, Winchell, Fellows, Mallalieu and
Ercanbrack.</emph> Mallalieu was made president of the committee, and Fellows, Winchell,
and Mallalieu were elected to the subcommittee. Provisions were also made for the
posting of advertisements for speeches to be made by club members. </p>
<p>September 13, 1856, the third report of the Executive Committee was <emph render="doublequote">listened to and
accepted.</emph> The following new members were elected to the club: <emph render="doublequote">Mssrs. Mandell,
Clement, Fisk, Simmons, Spalding, Mattison, Sharp, Stowers, Bulkley, M. P. Kinney,
Cary, Sweetser, Danes, W. C. Morgan, Glaats, J. Hibbard, Sewell, J. E. Pawins, Nichols
and C. Lorin.</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Ellis, Longstreet, Comfort, and Ercanbrack</emph> were <emph render="doublequote">invited to sing
for the club.</emph> It was also <emph render="doublequote">voted that the Executive Committee make arrangements for
going to the Meriden mass meeting on next Saturday.</emph> </p>
<p>Evening of November 4, 1856, the group <emph render="doublequote">shouted uproariously</emph> but was brought to
order by President Elmer. <emph render="doublequote">The glee club, Ellis, Longstreet, Gould, and Ercanbrack
discoursed music from time to time according to the call of the society.</emph> <emph render="doublequote">Many
enthusiastic speeches were made. Mallalieu was funny, Fellows was pathetic.
Ercanbrack was impudent, Elmer was enthusiastic and all were in for free Kansas. The
club adjourned, resolving to do their whole duty on the morrow.</emph> Signed: <emph render="doublequote">J.R.
Ercanbrack, Secretary.</emph></p>
<p>November 6, 1856. <emph render="doublequote">Republican club convened. Elmer presided. The club bewailed the
probable result of the national election. Each and all joined to assert that they
would remain firm advocates of Republican principles. Voted that these records be
placed in the college library for the investigations of future classes who shall see
fit to engage in politics. Club adjourned sine die.</emph> Signed: <emph render="doublequote">J.R. Ercanbrack, cur.
Sec.</emph> </p>
