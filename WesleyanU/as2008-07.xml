<p> The Asian American Student Coalition or AASC, "strives to strengthen the voices of Asian Americans through social awareness, progressive action, and political empowerment," according to the mission statement on the University's student groups listing. In 2007, the AASC became particularly vocal after The Board of Trustees denied Allan Isaac tenure. Students protested throughout the year, and Professor Isaacs was ultimately tenured the following spring.</p>

<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>
The period which these documents cover was a particularly tense one for the University and the Asian American Students Coalition, which seemed to take on a somewhat representative role for many dissatisfied students of all ethnicities at this time. 
</p>
<p>In January 2002, the Freeman Foundation gifted $1.9 million to the University over four years to fund visiting professors at the University who specialized in Asian American studies. According to a May 2008 Argus article, this grant was in an effort to gauge interest in Asian American studies at Wesleyan. It is unclear the extent to which students were interested in this focus of study; a Wespeak included in this collection suggests that there was chronic under-enrollment in the courses, but the May 2008 <title render="italic">Argus</title> article suggests that enrollment was high.</p>
<p> Things came to a head, however, in the spring of 2007. Not only did the initiative expire, but the Board of Trustees also denied Professor Allan Isaac of the English Department—then the only professor with a requirement to teach Asian American Studies in his job description—tenure. Isaac had the support of the English Department in his tenure application, and it reportedly came as a shock to many when he was rejected. Students organized protests about the Professor Isaac tenure denial, highlighting broader issues of cultural inclusion and knowledge in academia and the Wesleyan community at large. </p>
<p> The protests included a variety of methods; students held at least one rally in support of Isaac, and engaged in several paper campaigns. Hundreds of students signed a petition, many handed out pamphlets, and a series of personal letters were sent to the new President Michael Roth to express support for Issac's tenure. The protestors utilized a canary symbol in their materials, referencing the idea of a "canary in the coalmine." According to the protestors, just as the death of a canary can signal a gas leak in a coalmine, the denial of Professor Isaac's tenure pointed to a dangerous cultural heterogeneity in Wesleyan's academic life.</p>
<p> In an unusual move, the Board of Trustees tenured Professor Isaacs in the spring of 2008; professors generally do not get appeals for tenure. This did not entirely appease activists, however. Calls for an Asian American Studies Department continued, and students remained disappointed by the University's failure to make institutionalized change in the study of Asian American issues at Wesleyan.</p>

<head>Collection Overview</head>
<p>
Content of this collection spans from about 2005 to about 2008.
</p>
<p>The first folder consists of three cloth signs emblazoned with slogans supporting the tenure of Professor Isaac. </p>
<p>The second folder contains a CD with a variety of documents. A few dozen photos from a rally for Professor Isaac's tenure, a letter to then-future President Roth about the Isaac issue, a Wespeak about Asian American studies, and miscellaneous meeting notes and attendance sheets, are among the documents. </p>
<p>The third and last folder includes paper copies of some of the photos from the rally to support Isaac, a letter to various Asian American activist listservs about the Isaac issue, a letter to Williams BiLGATA about protesting Wesleyan President Douglas Bennet's honorary Williams degree because of his lack of support for Professor Isaac, and numerous letters from concerned students and alumnus to President Roth expressing support for Isaac. Also included is a pamphlet entitled "Diversity University?-Asian American Studies at Wesleyan, Past, Present, and Future" which highlights some of the protestor's key issues. Other documents have more to do with the AASC as a student group-meeting and organization fliers, a letter to the Student Budget Committee (SBC) about funding requests, mission statements, and an Asian American Studies Cluster introduction. Finally, a letter detailing the request to reconsider Professor Isaac's tenure, signed as a petition by hundreds of students. </p>
