            <abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">The music program at Wesleyan University
                dates back to the early days of the institution, when informal singing groups
                performed for special occasions. As the program expanded and became more formalized,
                courses were offered, and in 1929 the Music Department was established. Performance
                groups came to include the Glee Club, the Chapel Choir, the Choral Society, the
                Jibers, the Cardinals, the Wesleyan Band, and a number of instrumental ensembles.
                During the 1950s, associate professor David McAllester introduced world music
                courses into the curriculum, and in 1966 the department established a doctoral
                program in ethnomusicology. Visiting artists from various regions around the world,
                including Africa, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea, have performed at the

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Music has been part of the Wesleyan University experience since the early days of the
                institution. Known as a "singing college," Wesleyan inherited a tradition of music
                from the hymnody of its Methodist roots (see David B. Potts's <title render="italic"
                    >Wesleyan University, 1831-1910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England</title>).
                The first music performances at the university were organized by volunteers and
                sponsored by groups such as the Middlesex Musical Association. Beginning in the
                1840s, glee clubs were created for special occasions, and in 1862 Wesleyan singers
                had their first public tour. In 1882 the university hired a professional musician as
                glee club coach, and the group gave standing-room-only public appearances, including
                an 1888 concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. From the 1880s on,
                undergraduate students as well as alumni composed songs; these were collected in the
                Wesleyan Song Book, first published in 1901. Weekly sings took place on the chapel
                steps beginning in about 1901, and in about 1913 the university began offering a
                small stipend to students who participated in the chapel choir.</p>
            <p>During the 1920s, the music program at Wesleyan became more formalized. In 1921, the
                Music and Dramatics Board was created to supervise musical and dramatic
                organizations and arrange concerts and trips. The university also offered its first
                course work in music. In the academic year 1925/26, Hugh L. Smith (class of 1915),
                an assistant professor in the Department of Romance Languages, offered a course on
                the history and appreciation of music. In 1928/29, courses in dramatic music and
                harmony were added. Then, in 1929, alumnus John Spencer Camp (class of 1878) donated
                a large sum to set up a chair of music at the university. Joseph Stephen Daltry was
                appointed to the newly endowed chair, and the Music Department was established. </p>
            <p>The music program at Wesleyan continued to expand over the years. By the late 1940s,
                two professors--Joseph Daltry and George McManus--were offering about ten courses a
                year. In 1949, Richard Winslow (class of 1940) joined the staff. By the mid-1950s,
                singers performed not only with the Chapel Choir and Glee Club but also with the
                Choral Society, a male quartet called the Jibers, and a group of eight or nine
                called the Cardinals. The Wesleyan Band performed at football games and various
                campus affairs, and a woodwind and brass ensemble played several recitals a year.
                The Music Department, at that time housed in Judd Hall, had several sound-proof
                studios and an extensive collection of phonograph records. By the late 1960s,
                musical opportunities at the university included private lessons; the Wesleyan
                University concert series; the college orchestra, a "town-gown" organization; the
                Wesleyan String Quartet; and the Collegium Musicum, which performed medieval and
                Renaissance music.</p>
            <p>A significant development in the music program that occurred around the middle of the
                twentieth century was the introduction of the study of music "as a universal
                phenomenon beyond the confines of Western European tradition" (<emph render="italic"
                    >Wesleyan University Bulletin</emph>, 1956/57). In 1956/57, associate professor
                David McAllester, an anthropologist whose specialty was the culture and music of the
                Navajo, first offered Music 31, Ethnic and Folk Music, in addition to the
                anthropology courses he taught in the Department of Psychology. In 1961, McAllester
                teamed up with Robert E. Brown, a specialist in the music of India, to teach classes
                in the university's new World Music Program. McAllester and Richard Winslow proposed
                an advanced program of study, and in 1966 the department began offering a doctorate
                in ethnomusicology in addition to undergraduate and master's degrees. By the 1970s,
                courses taught by resident and visiting members of the department's faculty covered
                Western classical, Afro-American, South Indian, North Indian, and Japanese music;
                the 1970/71 catalog listed some thirty-two courses and seminars in non-Western
                music. Study groups were organized focusing on the music of South India, Japan,
                Persia, Korea, and the Javanese gamelan.</p>
            <p>In 1973, Wesleyan opened its Center for the Arts, a complex of eleven buildings
                housing undergraduate programs in art and art history, dance, theater, and music, as
                well as the graduate program in ethnomusicology. The Center comprises classrooms,
                galleries, and studios, and its music facilities include a recording studio, a
                computer and experimental music studio, Crowell Concert Hall, and World Music Hall. </p>
            <p>The Music Department currently provides course work and performing opportunities in
                music from around the world. More than sixty courses are offered. A number of
                activities--including a variety of chamber ensembles and ensembles in Asian,
                African, American, and European traditions--are available to students. Music
                facilities include a collection of instruments from many different cultures; a
                music-instrument manufacturing workshop; a scores and recordings collection; and a
                world music archives. An ongoing departmental colloquium presents lectures on issues
                in the world of music by students, faculty, and outside speakers. In addition, the
                department sponsors events such as concerts by world-renowned jazz artists, the
                Wesleyan World Percussion Festival (2000), New England Gamelan Weekend (2002), the
                Celtic Routes Festival (2003), and the annual Navaratri Festival. </p>
