<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">Captain Joseph Wright Alsop (1772-1844)was the eighth child and second son of Richard Alsop II, who was the first of the Middletown Alsops and a prominent merchant trader at the time. He was raised primarily by his mother after his father Richard died when he was four years old. In his youth, he struggled with a gambling addiction, though he overcame this vice and made his way up the seafaring hierarchy. Eventually becoming a captain, he reopened the West India trade, which was originally established by his father. He married Lucy Whittlesey in 1797 and had six children with her. Alsop was said to enjoy a popular reputation within Middletown.</abstract>
<abstract encodinganalog="520">The Joseph Alsop Ship's Manifest is a single 1805 document, which lists the cargo of the Brig Thetis of Hartford. The Brig Thetis was owned by Joseph W. Alsop of Middletown and David Watkinson and William Watkinson of Hartford, and captained by Alsop. According to the manifest, the cargo listed was taken aboard at St. Croix and Turks Islands on December 6, 1804 and was bound for Middletown. The manifest also suggests that the Brig Thetis itself was built in Middletown. Items listed in the manifest include rum, molasses, empty bottles, coconuts, oranges, sugar, salt and old iron. The back side of the manifest was completed on October 12, 1805, presumably upon the ship's arrival in Middletown. The surveyor George Wolcott acted as witness, signing his name and verifying the manifest as accurate.</abstract>

In response, students from a group called the April 29th Coalition protested the University's decision. The organization collected 1,284 signatures of students demanding Wesleyan return to an aid-blind system. They also demanded several changes to the financial aid and admissions system. Later in the semester, students held a 150 hour sit-in on the second floor of North College, one hour for each year that the University had existed. Although their primary demand for reestablishing the aid-blind system was not met by the end of the semester, President Colin Campbell wrote a statement that the students' demands would be addressed at the next the Board of Trustees meeting and that reinstituting the former policy would be given the highest priority if and when circumstances permitted.</abstract>

<abstract encodinganalog="520">The volume is a 131-page manuscript diary kept by Blood from May 17, 1835 to July 28, 1844. All entries are shorter than a full page, apart from a few exceptions. The diary begins with Blood describing his abusive childhood, and he then introduces himself as a freshman at Wesleyan University. During his freshman year, he became a member of the Missionary Lyceum student organization, and he traveled across Connecticut preaching at the Connecticut State Prison in Wethersfield, the American Asylum, at Hartford, for the Education and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb (now American School for the Deaf), Middletown's African-American Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church, and many other Methodist churches. On November 14, 1835, Blood left Wesleyan University to teach at a school in Cheshire; however, the following March the school was shut down. He returned to Wesleyan University a semester behind but took twice the course load to catch up. On November 3, 1836, Blood left Wesleyan University again, this time to teach at the Amenia Seminary. He relished in the chance to preach, but on March 16, 1837, he came down with the measles, leaving him the verge of death for two months. Blood did recover and went on to graduate Wesleyan University near the top of his class in 1838. After commencement, he received a job in Litchfield, and then decided to set up a select school in Bradleysville on November 13, 1838. During this time, Blood dealt with an adulterous husband, whose wife feared that he will leave the family; curiously the majority of this entry is crossed out in the diary. After his school was shut down, Blood married Elizabeth Smith and moved to a small Methodist church in South Hadley. On March 1, 1841 their first daughter, Mary, was born and on June 13, 1841, Blood was ordained as deacon to Stafford. The diary ends after Blood was appointed the Methodist minister to Mystic, Connecticut. Blood often felt incapable of preaching God's work, and continually admitted it through his entries. Blood also occasionally remarked on his support for the abolitionist movement, with hope that the Methodist Church would follow suit.

<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">Wesleyan University went through two phases of coeducation, the first of which lasted from 1872 to 1909, and the second from 1970 to the present. In the first phase, women represented a small minority of the undergraduate community, and only forty-three women graduated in the period from 1872 and 1892. However, female admissions increased in 1898, which led to a corresponding decrease in male admissions. From 1900 onward, the decline in Wesleyan's overall admissions contributed to the movement against coeducation, as many feared that the college had become too "feminized." In 1909, the Board of Trustees decided to end coeducation at Wesleyan, which would remain an all-male institution until 1970.</abstract>

The entries range from a few sentences to upwards of eight pages. Judd titles her diary, <title render="doublequote">Notes of Travel â€“ No. 5,</title> which suggests there are more diaries of this nature that have been produced, but their locations are unknown. The diary begins abruptly with Harriet Judd and her family traveling near Rome, Italy, on October 30, 1872. What follows are Judd's recollections of the destinations to which she and her family traveled including Naples, Pompeii, Paris, London, and Liverpool. After about forty pages, her first journey ends on November 18, 1872, but the journal continues with another tale of travels on the following page. During this trip, from February 15, 1873 to April 16, 1873, Harriet and her family traveled from their home of Flushing, New York to Washington D.C., then to Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and St. James, Jacksonville, and St. Augustine, Florida. An interesting detour occured when Harriet met a Mr. Coe, a Wesleyan graduate, who traveled with them to see the super phosphate mines found ten miles from Charleston. This section of the diary is only thirty pages long, but still describes much of the early American landscape and attractions. The last section of the diary is 94 pages and contains a record of another trip across Europe. This section begins on August 9, 1873, when the family arrived in Ireland and began to travel across England. After a few entries, Harriet decided to take a break from the diary and did not write again until November 27, 1873 when the family was leaving Geneva for Italy. In Italy they explored the regions and cities of Piedmont, Genoa, Pisa, and Naples finding many exciting attractions, which Harriet describes in great detail. While in Genoa, the family visited the Genoa hospital for the poor where they were amazed by the orphans who spent their days making furniture. The diary ends on December 25, 1873, when Harriet attended Christmas mass and thanked God for all that he had given her. Throughout her travels, Judd visited many of the tourist attractions and described the art and architecture of these cities' cultures, as well as the hotels and landscape of Europe and America. Harriet was also a loyal Methodist and attended sermons on Sundays whenever possible during her travels. Harriet also described the many forms of transportation available while traveling in Europe and America, as well as her experiences shopping for luxury goods. Harriet's journal frequently mentions her husband's illnesses and a few times mentions some treatments for it.

<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">Social Credit has been an economic theory, a social philosophy, an ideology, and a political
party in England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States since it was first
advanced in 1920 by Major C. H. Douglas. He believed finance capitalism deprived individuals of
sufficient purchasing power to buy otherwise available products. To overcome this Douglas
proposed offering to every citizen dividend payments based on the community's real wealth. As
monetary reform and as social theory Social Credit attracted intellectual support in England and
the United States especially during the 1930s. Gorham Munson (Wesleyan class of 1917) was the most eloquent and durable Social Credit leader in the United States. In
1932, he became American correspondent for <title render="italic">The New English
Weekly</title>, defended Social Credit in <title render="italic">The Nation</title> and helped
form a key Social Credit organization, the New Economics Group of New York. In 1933 he initiated

material includes articles, books, correspondence, pamphlets, and scrapbooks. The collection grew
out of Munson's interconnected roles as organizer, publicist, fund-raiser, editor, promoter,
lobbyist, propagandist, theorist, leader, and diplomat for a succession of Social Credit
organizations from 1932 to 1945. Published materials provide the best documentation of the
development of the theory of Social Credit in England, Canada, the United States, Australia, and
New Zealand. Major correspondents include Ezra Pound, his father Homer Pound, James Laughlin IV,
William Carlos Williams, Major C. H. Douglas, John Hargrave, Philip Mairet, Stanley Mott, Lilly
Bierne, Herbert Bruce Brougham, Allan R. Brown, Howard L. Buck, A. M. Edwards, Paul Hampden,

<abstract label="Abstract" encodinganalog="545">In 1927, The Voluntary Committee of
Lawyers, Inc. was organized by a group of young New York lawyers who felt that the
national prohibition law was both unjust and unenforceable. Its leaders were Joseph
H. Choate, Jr., who served as chairman of the Executive Committee, and Harrison
Tweed, Treasurer. The organization existed to organize like-minded associates, take
opinion polls of lawyers across the country, issue bulletins and annual reports
reciting arguments against the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and work
closely with the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment. They stressed that a
Repeal Amendment should provide for ratification by state convention and then
proceeded to prepare and place before all state governors in February 1933 draft
bills providing for election at large of all delegates. The alertness and prestige
of the members of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers contributed to the fact that
most states enacted the model convention bill verbatim. When the Twenty-First
Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933, the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers
disbanded. </abstract>

transactions of the organization, all known publications, and a original
correspondence.</abstract>
