    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Alexander Hemenway was born in Boonville, Warrick County, Indiana, March 8, 1860, the son of William J.L. and Sarah (Cleland) Hemenway. He attended the common schools in Boonville through the eighth grade. In 1878 Hemenway homesteaded in Kansas, but soon lost his claim and returned to Indiana in 1879. There he studied law, while working at other jobs. In 1885 he was admitted to the bar and began to practice in Boonville, Indiana. He was elected prosecuting attorney for the second judicial circuit in 1886, a member of the Republican State Committee in 1890, Congressman in 1895, and in 1905 was appointed Senator to finish the term of Charles Warren Fairbanks. He was defeated for reelection in 1908 and resumed his practice in Boonville in 1909. In 1916 he was appointed a member of the Republican National Committee. He died while on a visit for his health in Miami, Florida, on February 11, 1923.</p>  </bioghist>
