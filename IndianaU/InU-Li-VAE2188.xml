    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Florence Norton was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the daughter of Henry H. Kratzig, clergyman.  She studied at William and Mary College and Columbia University.  She became a member of the editorial staffs of American Mercury, Freeman Magazine, Henry Regnery Company and the Readers' Digest.  Her article on "Farewell to Good Music" appeared in American Mercury for July 1951.  Miss Norton married Guy Ponce de Leon, author of Les enfants du seigneurs.  Fondness for cats resulted in a number of letters being written to and from her pets.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The letters chiefly are to Max Eastman, 1883-1969, author, for whom she did editorial work and later was employed as his editorial assistant at Readers' Digest.  Some of the letters are written from Europe while on tour for editorial projects.  The correspondence reflects much of the inner turmoil of editing a book or article for publication and contacts with people of literary and editing circles.  In addition Miss Norton took care of financial accounts for Max Eastman. <lb/></p><p>The writings consist of some twenty-nine poems which apparently are unpublished.  In a few instances the poems served as letters. </p>  </scopecontent>
