    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The French mss., 1951-1955 consists of correspondence and notes by poet Ezra Loomis Pound (1885-1972) to William French. Born in Idaho, Pound later studied at the University of Pennsylvania, though he afterwards transferred to Hamilton College. He returned to the University of Pennsylvania for a literature MA in 1906, and began a teaching career at Wabash College the next year. In 1908, he moved to London and became known for his poetry, and in particular for his role in the movement of Imagism: a movement originally taken from Chinese and Japanese poetic styles, and propelled further by Pound along with other figures like James Joyce and William Carlos Williams.  Pound is most known for his works <emph render="italic">Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</emph> (1920) and the epic but unfinished <emph render="italic">The Cantos</emph> (1917-1969). As an editor of poetry magazines, he also helped popularize figures such as T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, and Ernest Hemingway.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>

Also present are four letters and postcards from Dorothy Pound either to French or to his wife, Gloria; one letter from Westbrook Pegler to French; and one letter from Gloria French to her husband. </p><p> Accompanying the collection are a <title render="doublequote">Preface,</title> <title render="doublequote">Index,</title> and <title render="doublequote">Supplemental Notes,</title> all prepared by William French as explanatory of the correspondence. Except where actual dates or postmarks are present, thus justifying rearrangement, the order in which Mr. French placed the material has been retained. In a few instances French has included a photocopy of his letter to Pound as supplemental information regarding date and content of Pound's letter. </p><p> A few printed pieces, all described by French in his documentation, complete the collection. </p><p> Collection size: 90 items</p>  </scopecontent>
