    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Waynflete Carter, 1905-1975, was an English bibliographer and antiquarian bookseller. With Graham Pollard he wrote <emph render="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</emph> (1934), which exposed the forgeries of book collector T.J. Wise. He is also the author of several canonical works on book collecting, including <emph render="italic">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</emph> (1948), <emph render="italic">Printing and the Mind of Man</emph> (1963), and <emph render="italic">ABC for Book Collectors</emph> (1952, with many later editions).</p><p>Carter was a student of A.E. Housman's at Cambridge, and Housman inspired him to collect Catullus. Carter edited Housman's <emph render="italic">Collected Poems</emph> (1939 onward) and <emph render="italic">Selected Prose</emph> (1961). With John Sparrow, Carter also compiled an annotated hand-list of Housman's work, first published in 1941 and revised 1952.</p><p>Alfred Edward Housman, 1859-1936, was a poet, classical scholar, and textual editor. The oldest of seven children, he was born in Worcestershire in 1859. He won a scholarship to Oxford, where he became friends with the bibliographer Alfred Pollard and with Moses Jackson, famously the object of Housman's unrequited love. Despite being a capable student, Housman failed his final examinations and had to return to Oxford for an additional semester, receiving a lower-level pass degree. In 1882, he took the civil service examination and worked as a clerk in the Patent Office in London while living with Moses Jackson and his younger brother Adalbert. He simultaneously worked in the evenings at the British Museum Library and began publishing well-respected papers of textual criticism on Greek and Latin authors, during which time he established his reputation as meticulous in his own scholarship and ruthless to other scholars whom he considered sloppy. In 1892, he applied to become the Latin Chair at University College, London. In 1896, he published at his own expense his first collection of poetry, <emph render="italic">Shropshire Lad,</emph> which became a popular success. In 1911, he received the Kennedy Professorship at Cambridge University and a fellowship at Trinity College. Between 1903 and 1930 Housman dedicated his considerable abilities in textual criticism to a five-volume critical edition of Manilius' Astronomicon. He published his second book of poems twenty-six years after the first, <emph render="italic">Last Poems</emph> (1922), at the age of 62. A third volume of poetry, edited by his brother, the writer Laurence Housman, was published posthumously in 1936.</p>  </bioghist>
