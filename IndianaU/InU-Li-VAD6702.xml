    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>John Henry Louden, 1835-1911, was a lawyer in Bloomington, Indiana. He was born on November 24, 1835 in Louden County, Pennsylvania. His family later moved to Dunlapsville, Indiana. Louden began attending Indiana University in the fall of 1857. Part of the diary he kept during his first year of college was later published in the <title render="italic">Indiana Magazine of History</title> as "A College Freshman in 1858." While at IU, he was a member of the Athenian Society and Sigma Chi. He graduated from IU in 1861 and received his law degree in 1864. On March 18, 1863, Louden married Elizabeth "Lizzie" Chestnut Hemphill in Bloomington, Indiana. They had three children together: Theodore James Louden, Ida Jane Coblentz, and William "Willie" McNary Louden. John Henry Louden died on June 3, 1911 and was buried in Bloomington.</p><p> Theodore James Louden, 1867-1957, was an Indiana lawyer, soldier, and professor. He was born on April 19, 1867 in Bloomington, Indiana, the son of John Henry Louden and Elizabeth Chestnut Hemphill Louden. After attending public school in Bloomington, Theodore Louden enrolled in Indiana University, graduating with a degree in literature in 1889 and a degree in law in 1891. In 1892, he formed a partnership with his father who was also working as a lawyer. He practiced in the circuit and supreme courts of Indiana, as well as federal courts, and he represented several prominent corporations in Monroe County. Louden was also a member of the Indiana National Guard beginning in 1898. He served during the Spanish-American War, and, after receiving several promotions, was ultimately commissioned as a colonel of infantry in 1912. He married Anna Reinhard on December 24, 1896 and they had four children: Mary Elizabeth, George Reinhard, Eleanor, and Katherine Ann. Thedore Louden closed his father's law office in 1950, the practice having been operated from that same location for nearly 90 years. He died on March 17, 1957 and was buried in Bloomington near his father. </p>  </bioghist>
