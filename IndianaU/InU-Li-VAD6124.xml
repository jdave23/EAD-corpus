    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Lewis Smith Bowman, 1867-1960, was an auditor and government researcher. Bowman was born July 31, 1867, on a farm near Hagerstown in Wayne County, Indiana. He taught school for fifteen years, beginning in 1888, and at the turn of the century began his public service career, holding various local and state offices for more than fifty years. Among the elected offices held were town clerk, Hagerstown; Jefferson Township trustee; Wayne County auditor; and one term as State auditor. He was active in the Republican Party virtually all of his adult life, serving eight years as county chairman, and from 1937 until his retirement in 1953, he was director of research for the Republican State Committee. Bowman passed away on March 18, 1960, in Indianapolis, IN, at the age of 92.</p>  </bioghist>
