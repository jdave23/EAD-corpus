The first diary, a computer printout (ca. 1970s), is titled Homeless in exile : days of persecution in fall and winter, 1938-39. It is by Harry Richard Loewenberg, written at the behest of his daughter, Barbara, and chronicles his life in 1930s Germany and emigration from Germany to England. Barbara's historical annotations about the fate of individuals and events after her father's return to Germany are incorporated into the typescript. The second, third, and fourth diaries, all ca. 1970s, are photocopies of typed transcriptions. The second diary is written by Peter Christian Loewenberg and is addressed to his own sons. It recounts his life in Germany throughout the war and in its immediate aftermath, including working under the Organisation Todt and the British army. The third diary, largely from Peter Christian's point of view with one section narrated by his wife, Irma, describes life in Germany after the war, emigration from Germany to the United States, and the first days of their lives in Connecticut. The fourth diary consists of anecdotes about Peter Christian's experiences as a practising physician, both in Germany and in Connecticut.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_762a2a97c9b5037207e209388e64a330" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dictionary of National Biography</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1906/1906">1906</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_a0a0315f6f46489912d21a15ff6873de"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2007</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_42ef6d37779c369d2534ec264c0f3362"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8444759</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_95b71d2c865bc14661c7f0d9ce203d7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Lilly Library copy is grangerized by the addition of twenty-four autographed letters, six photographs, and three engravings.

Written in Paris and Montmélian: 1 July 1794 to 1 April 1795. The diary is started during the Terror, just before the fall of Robespierre in July 1794. The diary covers a particularly significant period in de la Reyniere's life, just after the death of his father, the arrest of his mother by revolutionary forces, and his return to Paris after an absence of some years. The diary foreshadows his future as an influential food and restaurant critic and writer, a genre he founded and formed with his contemporary Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826). The diary provides insights into the core of Parisian society and the contemporary world of the revolutionary period.

The collection consists of 8-10 different sets of Persian playing cards ranging in date from ca. 1850-ca. 1950. Several of the cards (ca. 1850-1900) include portraits of Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar. Some of the cards display the rather typical Qajar "farangi" style (i.e., a fascination with European subjects such as women in décolleté). One card is tooled leather (or imitation leather) on wood. Description based in part on information from Christiane Gruber, professor of Islamic Art, Department of the History of Art, Indiana University, 10/07/09. Âs Nas is the game from which poker may have developed, and its earliest record dates back to 17th century Persia (see "Cards Without Traditional Suits, Âs Nas, https://web.archive.org/web/20090221095236/http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards79.htm). The majority of the cards bear hand-painted images such as the Sarbaz (the soldier), the Padishah (the king), the Bibi (the queen), animals, and flowers. Accompanied by a hinged red vinyl covered wooden box (ca. 1950?). In the lid of the box is a lacquered panel (6 x 23 cm.) illustrating a hunter, two Caspian tigers, three hares, and three gazelles.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_2a728a06dea8a80449a5443377d01902" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sam Loyd letter</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1896-06/1896-06">June 1896</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_dd0cc80790f4858d4e2f92169ccd4d84"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>2010.0</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_6135b320fd68d1e3df1164efae2bed43"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/11344520</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_65e41418c854806f7d7fa5daf295961a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Autographed letter, dated June 1896 in New York, from Sam Loyd to Mr. Raynor opining that Raynor's puzzle would not succeed because it is too similiar to previous puzzles, specifically the "15 Block puzzle" for which Loyd claimed credit.

Rehatsek reviews Mortimer Howell's A Grammar of the Classical Arabic Language. He concludes that it is a knowledgeable but impractical work since the advanced scholars who could best make use of it would go directly to the sources themselves. A more practical endeavor for Howell, who was in the employ of the government, would have been a descriptive catalogue of the Arabic and Persian manuscripts in the Northwest provinces, of which only those in Oude (Awadh) had been catalogued. Rehatsek, however, is not volunteering to compile said descriptive catalogue, for he is 62 years old and a liver complaint is his "inseparable companion for life". Included within the item are four leaves of manuscript revisions of the letter, possibly for publication.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_1ee00d8afe4ac1a1a99376d127a2fc92" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arabic-Latin lexicon</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1620/1620">ca. 1620?</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_9344ed983af94220dc907d3051b4282f"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2008</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_0a3b61052d2a5805f93c4a82098aa5e6"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8077416</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_0d514365575701eae18d258310c021eb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Extensive manuscript Arabic-Latin lexicon, very probably in the hand of Christoph Crinesus, inscribed on the front pastedown in a different hand from the manuscript itself, 'Opus M.

For as Shakespeare already wrote in King Lear: 'And worse may I be yet; the worst is not, So long as we can say This is the worst' (IV.1.27-28).

The letters discuss Grimm's translation of an article on Shakespeare, which led to the Hauffs receiving a half dozen of Emerson's essays in translation--translations so poor Hauff could do nothing with them. But the translations of Emerson he has now received [from an unnamed translator] seem to him much better. In subsequent letters the discussion over the translation of Emerson's essays into German continues. He raises specific objections to various words and phrases, although he suggests that it's a worthy effort for a woman...He eventually decides to revise the whole of the translation.
Herman Hauff became private secretary of the publisher Johann Friedrich von Cotta in 1827. Upon the death of his brother, Wilhelm Hauff, in that year, he took over as editor of the <i>Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände</i>, and remained in that post until his death. In addition to essays which he published in numerous journals, he was the author of <i>Skizzen aus dem Leben und der Natur</i>. He was active as both an editor and translator.
Wilhelm Hemsen (1829-1885) was a friend of Mörike nd Nerthold Auerbach, and an acquaintance of many famous literary figures. In 1869 he became the Court Librarian in Stuttgart.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_5d68c753e063fc4d56aecaa26d941e9a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ludwig Tieck letter</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1839-06-17/1839-06-17">17 June 1839</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_5e32b1d59326f0bc6ce5ae37bc003b34"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2008</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_a55bd0f9e28c03908bdd0eca96a88c46"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8264445</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_cf5fd520fc9344b11622741023608bdc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Holograph letter ([4] p.), signed, from Johann Ludwig Tieck to his publisher Georg Andreas Reimer (1776-1842), dated June 17, 1839, concerning his work (in collaboration with August Wilhelm von Schlegel) on the German-language edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works, which appeared in 1838/1840 in twelve volumes.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_6901c2173aa8d4b2959ccd5c4664c75c" level="file"><did><unittitle>The apple's wedding</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1900/1999" type="inclusive">[19--?]</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_9bfc973c1d81a0a9e83df7ecca90d528"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2006</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_a68fc60b98e5f55608d9e359be0a6839"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/7313610</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_0dc6c41e802846a3d63b33495f2bb73e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Holograph story in verse, with handcolored illustrations.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_a0d963762539880e40c591ebcb5b1ee2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mabel Decides to go to the Moon</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1950/1950">[ca. 1950?]</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_d41b3e5954dfcb1de7372258f41b080b"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2010</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_ee625e649752563ae4260cd9998bf751"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/11667614</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_cc13012374e9d2c6e6a8ead0ab87eb84"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A mouse named Mabel resolves to visit the moon, which she thinks is made of cheese.

Included are six pages of the taxonomy of the corresponding class and family, with descriptions and characteristics, as well as a full index and map. Also included is a twenty-page essay on fertilization with drawings. In all probability the author was influenced by Elizabeth Twining (1805-1867), who was a celebrated botanical artist from the north of England, and believed botany had a place in the education of women. Woodall's map provides the locations where she found her flora, mainly in Northeast England. The diary records Phyllis K. Jewson Woodall's daily travels in order to find different specimens. She then draws and describes each plant in great detail, illustrating one to a sheet mounted on heavier stock with description on the facing sheet. Her notes describe details after the specimen has been seen under a microscope.</p></scopecontent></c01><c01 id="aspace_c2be9ab42793565f18621a9ff910d5f1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Carte-de-visite for Louis Agassiz</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1867/1867">[ca. 1867?]</unitdate></did><acqinfo id="aspace_0d5e3bb101ea55e1e17147a27739f35e"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Purchase: 2010</p></acqinfo><odd id="aspace_ef2b8d212d6ed85dac9e04c752423184"><head>General</head><p>See IUCAT record: https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/9154900</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_6bd172c5d015d7e97d4e1fe9aa99cf16"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Head and shoulders portrait of 19th century paleontologist/geologist Louis Agassiz, taken when he was about 60 years of age.

He was a founding member of the American Academy of Arts, a Judge of Common pleas in Middlesex, Mass., and a founder of the Massachusetts Historical Society. Although his primary interest was in the interpretation of biblical prophecies, Winthrop was also interested in philology and languages.
