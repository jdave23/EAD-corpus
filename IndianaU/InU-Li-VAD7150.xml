    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bruce Walker is an artist of Largo, Florida. He was active during the 1970s and contributed articles about Robert Bloch to fan magazines. </p><p>Robert Bloch, 1917-1994, was an American writer who specialized in crime, horror, fantasy,  and science fiction. He is best known for his book <title render="italic">Psycho</title> (1959), the basis for the film of the same name by Alfred Hitchcock. When Bloch was a child, he became an avid reader of the pulp magazine <title>Weird Tales</title> and a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, who often contributed to the magazine. Bloch even wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft, who encouraged him to continue writing. Bloch would eventually publish his stories in several pulp magazines and other publications, including <title render="italic">Weird Tales</title> where he became one of their most popular authors. In 1945, Bloch adapted his stories for a radio series titled "Stay Tuned for Terror." By the 1960s, Block had moved to Hollywood to become a screenwriter. While living in Los Angeles, he wrote for television and film, including several scripts for <title render="italic">Star Trek</title> episodes and the screenplay for <title render="italic">The Night Walker</title> (1964). Over the course of his career, Bloch won several awards for his stories, and he became a member of both Mystery Writers of America and Science Fiction Writers of America. He published hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He died on September 23, 1994 in Los Angeles, California.</p>  </bioghist>
