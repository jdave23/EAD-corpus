    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Farrar mss., 1876-1889, consist of letters from Frederic William Farrar, 1831-1903, dean of Canterbury, to his friends.</p><p> In writing to H. Fedden, Farrar finds it necessary because of the pressure of duties to refuse a request to come to Bristol. </p><p> An invitation is extended to Holman Hunt, 1827-1910, painter, to come to dinner to meet the Bishop of Derry, "a poet and eloquent man." Furthermore he wants Hunt's advice on a book about Christianity and Art. </p><p> Marion Edith (Waugh) Hunt, the wife of Holman Hunt, is given directions for touring the cathedral. His daughter is dangerously ill and Mrs. Farrar cannot be present. </p><p> To Mr. Lucas, and old an valued friend, Farrar writes about the difficulties of leaving Marborough and going to Westminister; subsequently offers Lucas' son Frank a curacy; and talks at some length about his own children. </p><p> Samuel Morley, 1809-1886, a politician deeply interested in religious matters, is notified that Farrar will attend a meeting if canon Wilberforce will not be there. </p><p> The invitation of William Francis Cowper-Temple, baron Mount-Temple, 1811-1888, commissioner of works, to meet the Basil Wilberforces is accepted by Farrar.</p>  </scopecontent>
