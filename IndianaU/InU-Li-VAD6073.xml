    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Patrick O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ in Chalfont St. Peter, England, on December 12, 1914. His literary career began at the young age of 15 with the publication of his Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda-Leopard (1930). After trying unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, he married his first wife Elizabeth Jones in 1936 and started a family. In World War II, he served as an ambulance driver alongside the Countess Mary Tolstoy (nee Wicksteed). Russ and Tolstoy subsequently divorced their respective spouses and married each other. The couple moved to Wales in 1945 to begin their new life together, and Russ changed his name to Patrick O'Brian, under which he would publish his most successful books. </p><p>O'Brian wrote in a variety of genres, including novels, short stories, history, and biography. In the 1950s and 60s, he earned success as a French-to-English translator; his work in translation included Henri Charriere's Papillon and many of Simone de Beauvoir's writings . He penned detailed biographies of artist Pablo Picasso (Picasso, 1976) and the naturalist and explorer Joseph Banks (Joseph Banks: A Life, 1987). O'Brian was best known for his acclaimed Aubrey-Maturin series of 20 historical novels published from 1969 to 1999 (plus one unfinished work published posthumously in 2004). The Aubrey-Maturin series follows the friendship of Jack Aubrey, an officer of the Royal Navy, and Stephen Maturin, an Irish-Catalan naval doctor and intelligence agent, during the Napoleonic Wars. O'Brian was still working on the famous series and spent some time at Trinity College Dublin before his death on January 2, 2000, in Dublin, Ireland, at the age of 85.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Bennett, S. mss., 1985-1996, consist primarily of letters from author Patrick O'Brian, 1914-2000, to Stuart Bennett, a rare book and manuscript dealer based in London and northern California. The letters relate to O'Brian's writings — the Aubrey/Maturin novels as well as his biography of Joseph Banks; to rare books that O'Brian is interested in acquiring — the pseudonymous first edition of <emph>Candide</emph>, early editions of Jane Austen's novels, and Samuel Johnson's <emph>A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</emph>; and to books that Bennett has for sale. Of particular interest is the letter dated 4 August 1995 in which O'Brian gives his blessing to letting Bennett offer his two O'Brian manuscripts to the Lilly Library "to join the others ...if you feel so inclined." The correspondence also concerns more personal matters such as health, travels, and mutual visits. Interfiled with the Patrick O'Brian letters are a few from his wife Mary, usually addressed to Bennett's first wife Kate, or to both Bennett and wife, and a few retained copies of Bennett's letters to O'Brian. Also present are letters from publishers to Bennett, usually sending along a copy of O'Brian's most recent publication and in a few cases galleys of the American edition. Miscellaneous photocopied items relating to O'Brian's life and works complete the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
