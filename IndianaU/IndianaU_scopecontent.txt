<p>The University Interests Committee Collection consists of 12 folders covering the years 1926 to 1929. It is organized in three series: Correspondence, Administrative files, and Women's University Interests Committee.</p><p> Correspondence forms the bulk of the collection and is arranged chronologically in three broad groupings. The first consists of correspondence between several committee members on the Bloomington campus and potential leaders for the statewide organizational system the committee hoped to establish. The second includes correspondence between committee members and committee representatives, county chairs, and state legislators (including letters from President Bryan to state legislators). The third includes correspondence of William A. Alexander on behalf of the University Interests Committee in organizing for the 1929 legislative session. Arrangement within each chronological grouping is alphabetical by recipient and includes responses along with the initiating correspondence. </p><p> The Administrative files series consists of two folders. One folder contains questionnaires completed by Committee representatives as well as some miscellaneous reports. The questionnaires include data on legislators, community leaders, IU alumni, and newspapers in the Indiana towns and cities in which the representatives lived. The second folder contains lists of county chairmen and chairwomen, Memorial Regiment representatives, and state senators and representatives. </p><p> The final series, Women's University Interests Committee, consists of a single folder of minutes and reports of meetings and some correspondence of the Women's University Interests Committee.

<p>The Theodore W. Torrey Papers, 1945-1986, are organized in four series: Professional Materials, Sunday Evening Discussion Group, Speaking Engagements, and Personal Materials. With the exception of the items in Professional Materials, all items were forwarded to the Archives by Biology Professor L.S. McClung in 1983 and 1984. </p><p> The Professional Materials consist of two copies of one of his publications and an item from his course in Developmental Anatomy which correlates references in the lab manual to the 2nd and 3rd editions of his textbook and which was probably meant as a handout to students in the class. </p><p> The Sunday Evening Discussion Group Materials contain typewritten and handwritten copies of talks Torrey prepared, most probably, according to Professor McClung, for the Sunday Evening Discussion Group, a faculty group which included President Wells and which met in rotation at the members' homes for paper presentations and discussion. The Discussion Group materials, most of which are undated, are arranged by title. Although most of the items are undated, citations and references in a few of the texts give approximate dates of their creation. </p><p> Speaking Engagements Materials consist of typed and handwritten copies of speeches he gave and are arranged chronologically.</p><p> In Personal Materials are two items: a "Petition" presented to Torrey when he stepped down as chair of the department and "The Torrey Genesis," a genealogy he wrote.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection has been organized into five series: Correspondence; Financial records; Speeches; Testimony; and Administrative files. All files are arranged chronologically within their series. Because the Archives holds so little from Daily and his tenure as president of IU, this collection holds both his administrative records and a small amount of personal papers.</p><p> The collection begins with a Correspondence series and includes both university and personal correspondence. Prominent are letters written by Daily to his brother, "D.O." in Huntington, Ind., as well as letters written to Theophilus Wylie regarding his appointment at IU. </p><p> This is followed by a small series of Financial records, which has two receipts from Samuel Buskirk to the university. </p><p> The next series, Speeches, consists of formal addresses from Daily's presidency. Of note is a report on his fiery farewell address in February 1859. This latter item was not written by Daily; it appears to be in T.A. Wylie's hand.</p><p> The Testimony series chronicles the charges made against Daily in 1858 and 1859. Included are the initial charges brought by A.M. Murphy in August 1858 and testimony collected by Reverand F.A. Hester on behalf of the Methodist Church on Daily's immorality charges. Witnesses include several prominent Indianpolis citizens, including Benjamin Harrison, then an Indianapolis attorney, who went on to become the 23rd President of the United States. Also found here are responses of the faculty, written by T.A. Wylie. </p><p> Within the Administrative files, researchers will find additional records relating to Daily's dismissal, but also a subscription book of donations given to the university after the 1854 destroyed the First College Building, tuition announcements, and a resolution regarding standard text book adoption for the state.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Schuyler F. Otteson papers are organized into six series: Organizations and committees; Indiana University; Research and writing; Papers and talks; Conferences, Workshops, and Seminars; and Subject files.

<p>This collection contains the 1892 constitution of the four-member Moonlight Pleasure Club. This short constitution documents the club's rules, functions, purpose, and other details. It is a very 'pro-Hoosier' document that calls for the club members to enjoy their social lives together and to enjoy their time at Indiana University. The constitution appears to, at times, satirize formal IU student groups and their official documentation. However, the language in the document also seems to make a genuine point for the club to be a welcoming place for the members to enjoy their time together and to have fun.</p> </scopecontent>

The collection includes the originals of Vonnegut's letters to Fiene, and carbon or photocopies of Fiene's letters to Vonnegut.</p><p> Also present in the collection are a photograph of Vonnegut and Rait taken in Paris Oct. 28, 1972, a bumper sticker with an undated note from Vonnegut, and the photocopy of a text, "First meeting," by Fiene that was published in <title render="italic">Happy Birthday, Kurt Vonnnegut: a Festschrift for Kurt Vonnegut on his sixtieth birthday</title>, 1982.</p> </scopecontent>

It seems that David Inwood was of the Inwood family of [Inwoods Grocery] in South Bend, Indiana (included in the album is a photo of the storefront from the street). There are snapshot photos and nice portraits of girls and friends, friends' weddings turned to young families, outings around Indiana, campus photos, a trick/double exposure (he was part of the photography club!), a sculpture show at his art center, his friends with their '41 Chevy and '48 Studebaker convertible. Fun ephemera from this time include: his best bowling game scoresheets while at Purdue, university maps, class schedule, ID card booklet, draft registration booklet, a pocket-sized honorable discharge certificate, brochures from proms, matchbooks from Indiana, a lost and found posting in the newspaper with 'got back' written on it, a 1947 clipping of an anti-discrimination opinion piece in the Indiana University newspaper as well as other events and jokes, a diploma in Pinballogy from Dixie Bar-B-Q, stock certificate in The Pine, Inc., etc."</p><p>--Bookseller description, House of Mirth photos</p></scopecontent>

Included is his rejected application to become an army officer--he joined the transportation corps instead, and was a radio operator. He attended training for Transportation Corps in Denver, Colorado (where he writes he took a whole day off work to hitchhike to Estes Park in Colorado just to take pictures of the scenery!). Other photos in the states include a train to California, Camp Stoneman in California, and later a return to Missoula, Montana. In 1946 he deployed to Osaka, Japan. Included are many photos of Osaka--from rooftops, to city streets, to buildings reduced to rubble, and the 25 Club (a favorite hang-out). Also pictured include: Johnson Field (first concrete airstrip in Japan built by US Army), airplanes on the field (and some nudie paintings on the skybirds), "maneuvers" in Toyooka and Yokosuka (he participated in an 'amphibious maneuver' in Yokosuka, photos of these ocean views and a newspaper clipping included as well), Enoshima Island Buddhist statues and shrines, a racist caption of a country man and ox-drawn 'honey wagon' (included are several newspaper cartoons poking fun at honey wagons), Tokyo city views, stray cats, a street parade, Osaka Castle, Kyoto, planted fields, more 'bombed out' rubble, Nara, Wakayama, children gathered around an army fire in the cold in Kobe, Yokohama Harbor, and departing via ship."</p><p>--Bookseller's description, House of Mirth Photos</p></scopecontent>

<p>The Jonathan Krause Rare Newspaper and Magazine Collection consists of approximately 900 original issues of historical newspapers and magazines, with a focus on late 18th- and early 19th-century American publications. Mr. Krause's goal in building the collection was to focus on issues that included the texts of writings by important historical figures. This is an often overlooked area of historical research, in that many scholars look primarily at early monographic publications, rather than periodicals. Printed books and pamphlets typically cost a great deal more than periodicals, and so their readership was necessarily more limited in many respects. The essays, letters, speeches, and excerpts from larger works, which were often published in various periodicals, provide a glimpse into the ways these texts were disseminated to contemporary readers. </p><p> The newspapers and magazines are listed under categories and titles applied by Mr. Krause, with his notes on selected items included. Titles established by Mr. Krause are listed in all capitals.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The letters are concentrated in the years that Debs served a sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for his conviction of sedition in 1918 after criticizing the 1917 Espionage Act. Approximately seventy of the letters are undated, but a perusal of the contents separates them into "Pre-prison," "Prison," "Post-prison," and "Indefinite" categories. </p><p>The Pre-prison letters were probably written from Boulder, Colorado where he had gone to recuperate after suffering a physical collapse in 1917. The letters from Prison are largely personal in nature. The Post-prison letters are written on stationery for the Congressional Campaign of 1922 and from Lindlahr Sanitarium. The Indefinite letters belong to a period of time when Debs was traveling the country on lecture tours.</p><p> Throughout the letters Debs comments on many topics, such as his time at Lindlahr Sanitarium; a portrait that was to be painted by a Russian artist; the Pullman Strike of 1894, the death of Eva Amelia (Parke) Ingersoll, a meeting with labor organizer William Zebulon Foster, and smoking. He also mentions actress Helen Gardner; writer and labor activist Ralph Chaplin; Mrs. Lovejoy of Girard, Kansas; and Robert Addison Hague.</p><p>Other letters of Debs are written to Rosalie Heaton Goodyear, poet and editorial assistant for radical and liberal papers. Those written to her while in the Atlanta Penitentiary are on the backs of old envelopes. Goodyear in turn relates how she was introduced to Debs and how she received the letters via Mabel (Dunlap) Curry.</p><p>Other correspondents include Theodore Debs, 1864-1945, bookkeeper and younger brother of Eugene Victor Debs, and socialist official William H. Henry. Henry wrote to Debs while Debs was serving in the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia, prior to going to Atlanta.</p><p>The letters of 1945 relate to the writing of a biography of Debs by Irving Stone.</p><p>Several snapshots and photographs of Debs from 1897-1922 and a folder of printed pieces complete the collection.

Most correspondence related to Nancy Mitford (renowned 20th century author and socialite, who worked in the shop 1942-1945) can also be found here.</p><p> Much of the "Correspondence" subseries of "Lady Anne Hill" was organized to varying degrees by Lady Anne herself. As she organized mainly chronologically and thematically (e.g. "Cyprus trip 1968"), I chose to leave many non-correspondence material (such as programs, photos, catalogs, press clippings, etc.) in Lady Anne's original arrangement as they often cohere thematically or lend each other context. Notable correspondents that can be found in this series include author Frances Partridge and James Lees-Milne.</p><p> Due to the organizational system used in correspondence, a number of photos are in that subseries. Any photos without clear organizational logic, dates, or seeming relevance to the materials near which they were originally located were placed in the "Photos" subseries.</p><p> The "Personal" subseries to "Lady Anne Hill" contains many of the materials that were less organized/more loosely organized by Lady Anne. Some overlap between the folders can be found throughout the collection but especially in this subseries due to multiple processors who processed roughly half the collection.</p><p> "Jane Gathorne-Hardy" includes correspondence (some with Anne) as well as personal papers, documents, and photos of Lady Anne's aunt, Jane Ethel Gathorne-Hardy (Sept. 26, 1872-1943). According to Anne's papers, she seems to have been a suffragette and world traveler (she lived in France and Peruvian ID documents can be found under "Personal").</p><p> "Eddie Gathorne-Hardy" includes correspondence with and papers related to or belonging to Lady Anne's brother Eddie, including his correspondence with English travel writer Peter Mayne (1908-1979).</p><p> "Writings" includes Lady Anne's scholarship on Edward Trelawny, including correspondence and writings related to Trelawny's 1831 memoir, <emph render="italic">Adventures of a Younger Son</emph> (Anne contacted publishing houses to encourage them to publish a new edition in the hopes of writing the introduction) as well as Lady Anne's own book, <emph render="italic">Trelawny's Strange Relations</emph>, centered on his mother and sisters.

<p>In the collection are one hundred and fifteen letters from Robert Stephenson to Illingworth mostly written from Mariquita, Colombia, between September 1824 and November 1828 on the management of mining affairs in Colombia, mining laws in general and how they could be adapted to conditions in Colombia. Fourteen letters were written by Stephenson to Illingworth between 1848 and 1858 when both men were living in England which deal with news of their native country. Among the papers are also fifteen diaries of Illingworth, kept between 1816 and 1842, on the location of mines, including small sketches and positions of mines, reports, an informative and vivid description of a journey on land and aboard the Bongo boats giving a clear idea of the life, people, geographical position, and conditions in Colombia in 1829, a list of the staff and miners with comments on their work and character, supplies required, calculations and cost of mines, detailed mining information on selection and treatment of ores, and an account of a journey to the United States. Another important item is a thirty-nine-page report to the Board of Directors of the Colombian Mining Association. Of interest is also a detailed and descriptive itinerary of a journey from Mariquita to Arma in August 1826 written by Ed Walker.</p><p> A memoir, reports, observations, and several letters on mining written in French between 1823 and 1836 from Jean Baptiste Boussingault, the French agricultural chemist, who became famous for his discoveries on the absorption of nitrogen by plants, add to the value of the collection. Boussingault went to Colombia about 1813 as a mining engineer for the Colombian Mining company. During the insurrection of the Spanish colonies he was attached to the staff of Simon Bolivar and traveled widely in the northern parts of the continent. Included are also two letters, August 15, 1870, and March 20, 1872, discussing the Franco-Prussian war.</p><p> Four letters from Simon Bolivar and one from his nephew and secretary, Fernando Bolivar, in Spanish are of interest to the scholar because of their content. The first two letters to Jose Fernandez Madrid dated September 27, 1827, refer to finances in connection with his mines in Venezuela with special reference to a bill of exchange for twenty thousand pesos made out to Joseph Lancaster, the noted British educator, to help him further the cause of primary education in Caracas by importing the benefits of his system. The third letter was writen to the naval officer Juan Illingworth. In this letter of June 9, 1830, the Liberator expresses his affection and trust in Illingworth and asks him to turn over to Manuela Saenz the money coming from the impending sale of a mule. In the fourth letter which was written to Richard Stonhewer Illingworth dated August 2, 1830, Bolivar profusely thanks Illingworth for fulfilling a mission for him and adds that he is thinking of going to England at once to show how deplorable conditions are in Colombia and how much damage ships leaving the harbor of Cartagena have suffered. A brief note was appended to the letter from Bolivar's nephew, Fernando. On January 9, 1831, Fernando Bolivar wrote to Juan Illingworth thanking him for the valuable services rendered to his uncle and discussing the circumstances surrounding the Liberator's death. Something of a more personal nature in this collection is a lock of Bolivar's hair which was cut after his death and was given to Juan Illingworth on January 10, 1831, at Guaduas.</p><p> Six documents and copies of six letters in Spanish on the Panama Canal, 1825-1829, concerned with the mines and the Isthmus of Panama, add to the value of the collection.</p><p> Included are also forty-two water color drawings, one pencil sketch, and one pen and ink sketch by Stonhewer E. Illingworth, son of Richard Stonhewer Illingworth, 1797-1884; pen and ink drawing and description of a plan for the use of a distilling furnace; certificates of stock in the New Granada Mining company; and a printed account of the St. John del Rey Mining Co.</p><p> Some of the material is in an oversize folder.</p><p> Among the correspondents in the collection are William Pitt Adams, Juan de Dios Aranzazu, Charles G. Austin, Antoine Cesar Becquerel, William Matthews Blackford, J.H. Bodmer, Fernando Bolivar, Simon Bolivar, Jean Baptiste Boussingault, Patrick Campbell, John Chapman, Michael Adrian Coppinger, Juan Garcia del Rio, Thomas Longridge Gooch, Edward Hurry, Manuel Jose Hurtado, Jorge Illoyo, John Cordy Jeaffreson, Sir John Kirkland, F.

<p>The James mss., 1911?-1971, consists chiefly of those letters of musician Lesley Payne, 1891-1976, to artist Louis James, 1909-1971, concerning a copy of a life mask of the poet John Keats. With the material are two framed photographs: one of Lesley Payne and her mother, Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken sometime during their stay in Paris, 1908-1914, and one of Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken by James in 1930. Miss Payne, in a letter of February 20, 1971, commented on the recent death of Paul Hadley, who in 1917 had designed the Indiana state flag. </p><p> The copy of the Keats mask is present in the collection, along with a magazine clipping and James' information about it. The original of the life mask was made by Benjamin Robert Haydon in December 1816. This copy is presumed to have been the one given by James Whitcomb Riley to the Art Association of Indianapolis and acknowledged by them on October 24, 1911. Louis James, as Louis James Globenskey, attended the Herron School of Art between 1927-1933, during which time he acquired the mask in Indianapolis and at a later date gave it a terra cotta exterior. </p><p> A later addition of 7 scanned photo slides of the Paynes and John Keats' life mask completes the collection.</p> </scopecontent>

One address dealt with the exploits and significance of "Oliver Cromwell" in English history, while another was concerned with the problem of "New Imperialism" in the world during the latter half of the nineteenth century.</p><p> The area of the philosophy of history is well represented in Kohlmeier's speeches and they are a definite contribution in man's theoretical approach to history. Some examples are "Human Energy" and "The Incarnation of Thought." With respect to American history his speeches include: "The Undertow of Puritan Influence," "Revolution," "Social and Economics Aspects of the American Revolution," "Antecedents as Causes in History," and "Washington." The area of American historiography is represented by two selections entitled, "Historical Documents" and "Individual Consciousness." Great American statesmen are included as topics in the speeches, notably the one already mentioned on George Washington and the two addresses devoted to Abraham Lincoln namely, "Lincoln in Indiana" and "Lincoln, the Son of Man." The speeches are arranged alphabetically by title.</p><p> Included are also mimeographed course and reading outlines.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The collection covers the period of time, and just afterward, that Mountsier acted as Lawrence's agent in America. Several of the letters describe his relationship with, and opinions of, various American and English publishers, particularly Benjamin W. Huebsch, Martin Secker, and Thomas Seltzer. The letters begin the year before Lawrence left England for Italy, and eventually the United States. He thus writes from England, Italy, Germany, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, San Francisco, and Taos, New Mexico. Many of the letters in late 1922 mention Mabel Dodge Luhan and his feelings about living with her generosity but "smothering" attentions. There are also two letter from Frieda (von Richthofen) Lawrence to Mountsier, written on the versos of her husband's letters. Other correspondents present are Robert Mountsier, Giuseppe Prezzolini, Martin Secker, and Thomas Seltzer.</p><p> Early in 1923, Lawrence decided to break with Mountsier, apparently after a lengthy visit by Mountsier in Taos. Thus the last twenty letters or so in the collection deal with tying up their business together, including any continuing commissions for Mountsier and Lawrence's 1922 tax reports.</p><p> Heretofore unpublished, many of the letters will be in <emph render="italic">The Letters of D.H.

Two sayings(ḥadīth) of the Prophet of Islam.
1- (In <title render="italic">Thuluth</title> script at the top) "He who is content with his food (or earnings) is independent of mankind."
2- (In <title render="italic">Naskh</title> script at the bottom) Five are the people who are not in need and are still allowed to have interest in religious donations and charities:
• Those who fight with the enemies of God
• Those who works for them.
• Slaves or the one that has bought them.
• One that has a poor neighbor and wants to pass the donation or charity to the poor, however, the poor returns that as a gift to the one.
• and it is said too about "who has lost his money while traveling." [to these, I the calligrapher, profess]
3- (In <title render="italic">Naskh</title> script at the bottom a note from the calligrapher) I, Muḥammad Shafīq al-Sayfī, wrote this following Uthmān Ḥafiẓ's style. God forgive both of us.

<p>The foundation of the Sprague-Thacher-Ball-Lilly Library-Indiana University set of Signers of the Declaration of Independence lies in one of the three full sets formed by Dr. William E. Sprague, pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Albany, New York, who is generally believed to have originated the idea of collecting Signers. It is based on a collection presented by Dr. Sprague to his son, Edward Everett Sprague. The wrapper with presentation inscription is present in the set. It reads: "Autographs of all the Signers of the Declaration of Independence: a New Year's Present for my dear boy, Edward Everett Sprague 1861." This set is believed to have been completed as early as 1848, thus ranking as one of the first five completed sets. </p><p>Shortly before 1889 the younger Sprague sold the set to John Boyd Thacher of the Thacher Car Wheel Works of Albany, New York, a boyhood friend who served as a State Senator and Mayor of Albany. At the time of the purchase Thacher already possessed a partial collection of Signers, and he used the Sprague set to complete and enrich his own. Thacher died in 1909. His set of Signers was cataloged by the Anderson Galleries, New York, New York, in Part I of the catalog of the John Boyd Thacher sale, October 1913. A negative photostat of the pages of this catalog describing the manuscripts in the Thacher set of Signers is filed with the set. A comparison of the set as it is today with this catalog listing shows that no changes have been made in the set since Thacher's day. The collection of Signers was not sold at this time. It was withdrawn from the sale and was not disposed of by the Thacher heirs until 1924 when it was sold privately by Mitchell Kennerly of The Anderson Galleries to George A. Ball of Muncie, Indiana. It remained in his possession until 1953, when it was acquired by an anonymous donor for presentation to the Indiana University Library. </p><p>The Lilly Library, Indiana University, manuscript collections has a carbon copy of a typewritten volume entitled "The Indiana University Library Set of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, Acquired by Gift, November 2, 1953." It contains transcripts of the letters and documents in the set, made in 1953-1954 by Mary Lou Grobe, clerk typist, with an introduction by Doris M. Reed, Curator of Manuscripts.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Janes mss., 1865-1900, consist of letters to Lewis George Janes, 1844-1901, from William Lloyd Garrison, 1805-1879; William Lloyd Garrison, Jr., 1838-1909; William James, 1842-1910; and Herbert Spencer, 1820-1903. Many of the letters were written during the time that Janes was president of the Brooklyn Ethical Association, 1885-1896. The two Garrisons, however, writing in 1865 and 1866 respectively relate to Garrison, Sr. addressing the Union League of Rhode Island "upon our late lamented President." James writes about matters philosophical, including "the question of immortality," while Spencer's letters talk about his antagonists who continue to call him "a materialist whether you [i.e. he] like it or not," and about his poor health.</p> </scopecontent>

<p>The Lindsay letters, dating from June 1919 through March 1921, relate primarily to getting him for lectures and readings in Cincinnati, which was finally accomplished March 3, 1921. Two of the letters, June 26, 1919 and January 29, 1920, enclose printed statements written by Lindsay regarding the sort of recital engagement he prefers to make. The first is titled: The KIND of a VISIT I LIKE to MAKE, to which he has penned "This is to be read with a certain sense of humor and it is not for publication." The second is titled: A Letter For Your Wicked Private Ear Only, again with an inked note appended at the bottom. <lb/> The larger part of the collection consists of letters to Ruth Collins Allen relating chiefly to theatrical productions and to the placement of scripts for stage or film production. Included in this portion is a group of more than ninety letters, dating 1932-1965, from English writer and play producer Malcolm Morley. At some point prior to this correspondence, Morley had been in Cincinnati with the Allens and his friendship with Ruth and other members of her family continued over a period of nearly four decades. The first three letters are in fact addressed to Ruth's mother, Harriet Collins Allen, first as Mrs. Allen, then as "Dear American Mother". All the letters are chatty and particularly interesting for the London scene during World War II, and especially of economic conditions immediately following it. He also discusses throughout the plays and other writing projects he is undertaking, the theatrical adjudications he does both in England and during a couple of summer trips to Canada in the 30s, and the activities of some of the actors and other stage personalities that he and Ruth both knew. A four-page typescript titled "London Scene" and several news clippings and playbills connected with Morley complete this section of the collection. <lb/> Other, smaller correspondence files include Russian playwright, Nicolas Evreinoff; New York writer Edward Hungerford (including an exchange with George S. Kaufman on Hungerford's behalf); and French playwrights Henri-René Lenormand and MadeleLey. An inventory of all the correspondents is available in-house. <lb/> A water color paper doll rendition labeled "Miss Allen", writings of "The Devilish Geniuses of the Turret," 1876-1877, and a few miscellaneous printed items complete the collection.</p> </scopecontent>

In 1779 he became Chief Justice of New Jersey, serving ten years. In the Continental Congress of 1787, he protested against the unequal representation of the states in the proposed constitution, but voted affirmatively. He presided over the convention in New Jersey that ratified the Constitution. In the Constitutional Convention he was one of the eleven on the committee that decided the length of term for the presidency, and its powers.

In June of that year he had been succeeded as Governor of Virginia by Nelson, and some of his associates in the government of that state were trying to stir up trouble for him because the British had been so successful in their raids. It is hardly likely that Jefferson could have done anything to prevent these, at least Lafayette did not think so. He had such a high respect for Mr. Jefferson that their friendship continued for many years after the war."</p></scopecontent>

"Let Madame go," said the President, and at this two men conducted her to the door, where she was torn to pieces by the mob, who paraded her head on a pike under Marie Antoinette's windows at the temple.

I have taken all the care possible to see that there are no misdescriptions in my collection and when I discovered that the signature differs from the facsimile in Appleton, I had the question taken up with the New York Public Library. My letter was compared with those in the Emmet Collection. It seems that there were five George Masons in succession. The fourth George was the neighbor and intimate friend of George Washington. The handwriting in my letter is almost identical with a fourth George's letter in the Emmet Collection, but I found there a letter of the fifth George, which indicates that my letter was signed by the son, the fifth George.

Its reference to "Your Excellency" indicated that it might have been addressed to Washington, but that was only an inference. I have just been reading "With Americans of Past and Present days" by former Ambassador J. J. Jusserand, published in 1916. In it there is an article entitled "Rochambeau and the French in America - from unpublished documents," and on page 119 he says - 'The Countess de Rochambeau sometimes takes up the pen, and in one of her letters appeals to Washington in favor of dear Closen who, though he had every right to be included in it, had been forgotten when the list of the original Cincinnati had been drawn up. The request was at once granted.' Below there is an explanatory foot note and much to my surprise I find that he has quoted in full the identical text of my letter. I have written to the Ambassador telling him the story and asking him where he secured his data, sending him at the same time a photostat of the letter. His reply may throw some light on whether my letter is the identical one sent to General Washington, or a duplicate given by the Countess to Baron Closen."</p></scopecontent>

It is addressed to the MIlitary Committee of the National Assembly. He represents himself as having lost everything and existing with no resources, although he has nine children. He recites that in his very early youth he was a lieutenant in the Kings regiment, in which he had served during the War of 1757. He adds that M. de Menar will gladly place before the Committee the evidence which, the writer hopes, renders him worthy of the appreciation of the Committee. A postscript (on page 2) indicates his sympathy with the Revolution as indicated by his having accepted a position in the National Guard. On page 3 is another addition: If the Committee will not put him back as Lieutenant-Marshall, he desires to go back as a Captain of Dragoons. He earnestly pleads for this. "I am," he says, "without bread." Nine children (he has) and five of them, his sons, he has taught to love and respect the new constitution. At the foot of the document is the report, signed by nine members of the Military Committee: "Lieutenant-Marshals are regarded as disbanded in the decree which calls to duty for the positions of lieutenants of the National Gendarmie the disbanded officers."</p></scopecontent>

No reply was made by Wurmser who dispatched an Austrian Major with 1200 men on the indicated mission. Finding it impossible of accomplishment he returned to the main body and was put into irons by Wurmser.

She entered into correspondence with Lafayette, visited him in France, and in 1825 came to the United States where she purchased 2400 acres at Neshoba (now Memphis), Tennessee, and established there a colony of emancipated slaves whose social condition she sought to elevate. Neshoba, which was held in trust for her by General Lafayette, was restored by him when he discovered that her plans could not be carried out without conflicting with the laws of the state. The emancipated slaves in the colony were afterwards sent to Hayti. In 1833-1836 she appeared as a public lecturer in the eastern states where her attacks upon slavery and other institutions attracted large audiences and led to the establishment of "Fanny Wright Societies," but her freedom of speech caused great opposition and hostility of the press and the church. She then became associated with Robert Dale Owen in New Harmony, Indiana. In 1838 she visited France again and there married M. d'Arusmont, whose system of philosophy resembled her own, but she was soon separated from him, resumed her own name, and resided with her daughter in Cincinnati, Ohio until her death. She was benevolent, unselfish, fearless and eccentric."</p></scopecontent>

It came from a private collector in Germany and so far as I know it has never been published. When I realized that he therein characterizes as a colossal error the statement to the effect that Louis XVI and his Minister 'winked' at his coming to America, I felt that I should make absolutely sure of the translation, for this error is largely true of all his biographers and naturally robbed his exploit of some of its glamor and praise. While in Paris in May 1927 I had the honor of becoming acquainted with Marquis de Chambrun and Comte de Lasteyrie, both great grandsons of Lafayette. They expressed delight at learning of the existence of the letter and assured me that the translation gives a correct shading and significance of the French original. When studying the text of the letter I could not understand why Lafayette should be so reluctant to correct these errors by denouncing the Memoirs as full of inaccuracies. I discovered I had in my library the first edition (N.Y. 1824) of the book and a reading of its title page at once supplied the answer. It says "By General H.L. Villaume Ducoudray Holstein who contributed, under the fictitious name of Peter Feldmann, to his liberation from the prsions of Olmutz." The preface of the book states that it was hastily written and was being issued just as General Lafayette was arriving in America (1824) as the Gust of the Nation. The matter to which Lafayette took such strong exception appears on page 16 of this first edition as follows: "It is a fact well known that public orders were issued to prevent the sailing of the Marquis, but the truth is that the French Government connived at his undertaking." Evidently Lafayette privately remonstrated with his friend, the author, for, after some difficulty I located a copy of the second edition (Geneva, N.Y. 1835) and find that every 'error' mentioned by Lafayette is omitted from the text, which was very largely rewritten. The letter is addressed to "M. Masclet, Edinburgh." I could not find that name in any of the reference books. Holstein's first edition did not mention him, but in the second edition on page 200, the author has added to his original text a paragraph to the effect that Joseph Masclet, a French emigre in London, although not personally acquainted with Lafayette, had taken up his cause and under the pen name of "ELEUTHERE" had contributed articles to the Morning Chronicle and the newspapers of Holland and Germany. Austria, annoyed and uneasy, tried to discover the identity of this writer, but without success."</p></scopecontent>

He and his relative, Thomas Jefferson, split on the subject of Napoleon. He clashed with Calhoun and insulted Henry Clay, who challened him, but the duel was without injury to either. Randolph was sent by President Jackson as Minister to Russia, but shortly returned to oppose the President on "Nullification."

Holstein was born in Germany, became a General in the French Army under Napoleon - later went to South America and served under General Simon Bolivar - then settled in Albany, New York, where he became a teacher of languages in an academy. He is the author of "Memoirs of Lafayette." This is the book to which Lafayette, in his letter to Mascle (1825, August 13), takes many exceptions, although Lafayette's letter does confirm the statement made by Holstein on the title page of the "Memoirs," where he describes himself as the author "who contributed, under the fictious name of Peter Feldmann, to his liberation from the prisons of Olmutz." Holstein, in the text, represents that in 1795, he was requested by Von Archenholtz and Auguste Masson, the former aide-de-camp of Lafayette, to go from Hamburg to Olmutz and to be the medium through which Madame Lafayette was to write nad receive letters, Lafayette having given his word of honor not to write letters. Holstein claims that he was the Agent through which John Parish, the American Consul, disbursed the money from America. Holstein also tells of a day in August 1797 when Lafayette and his family were set free and how the party, of which Holstein was one, journeyed from Olmutz to Hamburg, and he mentions Altona."</p></scopecontent>

Being, however, without resources, he worked at 20 cents a day as an ornemanist on the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. Meanwhile he frequented the studio of the painter Jean Louis David, also that of the sculptor Roland, taking lessons in anatomy with his compatriot, Dr. Beclard. In 1814 he obtained the grand prix de Rome, where he resisted the influence of Canova whom he knew through the painter Louis David and applied himself to the study of the antique.

Before he was born and while he was still a child, she had devoted herself to the augmentation of his inheritance. In addition to the improvement in his feudal relations which she had effected by buying up the obligation of Chavaniac to its overlord and acquiring other feudal rights in neighboring towns, she had bought and sold woods and lands, and engaged in litigation to secure her rights against the claims of neighboring nobles. Upon her death (c. 1772) his estate as a Lafayette and a Champetiere was more compactly organized and more definitely secure than any of his immediate male ancestors had had time or inclination to make it; and to it, by the simple process of outliving closer relatives, he had added the huge fortune of the Marquis de La Riviere."

The letters describe a British soldier's daily life on the Indian and Mesopotamian fronts of the First World War. Letters include descriptions of the climate and surroundings, the various ailments of the troops, the health and wellbeing of Fred's friends Ralph, Godwin, Elgey, Pearson, and Allinson, thanks for parcels of chocolate, cigarettes, and socks sent from home, and the outcomes of sports matches played in camp.

<p>"The original manuscript of one of Charles de Kock's later novels, a closely written manuscript comprised of 19 chapters, with copious corrections, additions and deletions throughout, with occasional long notes in the margins. Written in May 1868, it was published by Ferdinand Sartorious as a 272-page book the same year. It reached a third edition by 1870. Kock appeared in Thackeray's <title render="italic">History of Pendennis</title> and James Joyce's <title render="italic">Ulysses.</title> A good natured story partly about a street violinist and singer, theatre, vaudeville, love, all of which includes a long chapter about preparing and eating a sumptuous meal, "Nouvelle omelette soufflee." Written near the end of Kock's long literary career, the romance was reprinted a number of times into the 20th century, as well as being translated into Polish in 1878. It's interesting that Kock would gravitate towards "Madame Tapin" as a fictional character 55 years after she appeared in his first book, <title render="italic">L'enfant de ma femme [the Child of My Wife]</title> (1813)." - Bookseller's description, Howard S.

<scopecontent id="aspace_f3c57139155d14537101a933757ca6e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Unique and unpublished late 18th century (ca. 1780 per dealer's description) cryptographic manuscript, with 15 handwritten pages of undeciphered code in the form of fractions, numerals and slash-marks. The manuscript's initial lines of code, which are shorter and centered on the page, suggest a title or attribution; these are followed by nearly 200 lines of encrypted text, which is divided into sections with alphabetical headings. The encrypted pages are for the most part interleaved with blanks, suggesting that the author may have intended the encrypted text to be decoded. Also included at the back of the volume are two additional, unrelated encrypted texts, both of which are signed and dated to the 19th century. The first is a lengthy series of mathematical exercises (143 p.) involving fractions signed, "Christophorus Althaus Münster 1817"; and the second a transcription of five German poems (7 p.), entitled, "Carmina diversa ex optimis poetis exce[r]pta" and dated 1867.

Rehatsek reviews Mortimer Howell's A Grammar of the Classical Arabic Language. He concludes that it is a knowledgeable but impractical work since the advanced scholars who could best make use of it would go directly to the sources themselves. A more practical endeavor for Howell, who was in the employ of the government, would have been a descriptive catalogue of the Arabic and Persian manuscripts in the Northwest provinces, of which only those in Oude (Awadh) had been catalogued. Rehatsek, however, is not volunteering to compile said descriptive catalogue, for he is 62 years old and a liver complaint is his "inseparable companion for life". Included within the item are four leaves of manuscript revisions of the letter, possibly for publication.</p></scopecontent>

The letters discuss Grimm's translation of an article on Shakespeare, which led to the Hauffs receiving a half dozen of Emerson's essays in translation--translations so poor Hauff could do nothing with them. But the translations of Emerson he has now received [from an unnamed translator] seem to him much better. In subsequent letters the discussion over the translation of Emerson's essays into German continues. He raises specific objections to various words and phrases, although he suggests that it's a worthy effort for a woman...He eventually decides to revise the whole of the translation.
Herman Hauff became private secretary of the publisher Johann Friedrich von Cotta in 1827. Upon the death of his brother, Wilhelm Hauff, in that year, he took over as editor of the <i>Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände</i>, and remained in that post until his death. In addition to essays which he published in numerous journals, he was the author of <i>Skizzen aus dem Leben und der Natur</i>. He was active as both an editor and translator.
Wilhelm Hemsen (1829-1885) was a friend of Mörike nd Nerthold Auerbach, and an acquaintance of many famous literary figures. In 1869 he became the Court Librarian in Stuttgart.</p></scopecontent>

<p>The Mellonee Burnim Collection consists primarily of analog field recordings of religious music in African American and African settings, most of which Burnim recorded between 1978 and 1996. The formats currently include 145 audiocassettes, 33 slides, 9 VHS videocassettes, 8 audiotape reels, 6 videotape reels, and 3 binders of documentation, as well as sheet music and song texts. These materials document over 150 hours of music and interviews recorded in the United States, Malawi, Liberia, and Cuba. Singers, composers, and gospel association leaders appear in recordings of worship services, funerals, choir rehearsals, gospel music workshops and festivals, and choral workshops. Burnim's interviews generally focus on the aesthetics and history of gospel music and its performance. The interviews include the perspectives of soloists, ministers, choral directors, congregants, and participants in gospel music workshops and the gospel music industry. </p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Series 1</emph> includes Burnim's earliest recordings, which were made in conjunction with her dissertation research for "The Black Gospel Music Tradition: Symbol of Ethnicity" (Ph.D. dissertation, Indiana University, 1980). The formats in this series include 104 audiocassettes, 4 audiotape reels, and 6 videotape reels. Burnim recorded nearly all of her dissertation field recordings in 1978 and 1979, and these are also cataloged in her dissertation on pages 200--205. The purpose of Burnim's dissertation was "to define the extent and the mechanisms through which gospel music serves as a symbol of ethnicity among Black Americans in the United States" (Burnim 1980, page 2).</p><p>Burnim's primary research populations included the predominantly African American congregations of Mercy Mission Apostolic Church of Bloomington, Indiana, (217 North Elm Street) and Grace Apostolic Church of Indianapolis, Indiana (643 East 22nd Street). At the time of her research, these two churches differed according to the proximity of their location to urban centers, the structures and styles of church leadership, and the compositions of their congregation in terms of gender, race, and class. However, the two congregations shared denominational ties to Apostolic Pentacostalism. Burnim compared the "musical traditions" (Burnim 1980, page 8) of Mercy Mission and Grace Apostolic to those of other churches in Teague, Texas (Federation of Choirs, St. James U.M.E. Church) and Atlanta, Georgia (Wheat Street Baptist). Recordings of the choir rehearsals, worship services, broadcasts, and other performances are located in <emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 1.1</emph> along with Burnim's recorded reflections on these events. This subseries contains 33 audiocassettes, 4 audiotape reels, and 6 videotape reels.</p><p>The 12 audiocassettes in <emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 1.2</emph> include detailed commentaries on gospel music performances solicited by Burnim through the use of feedback interviews techniques. Interviewees were primarily culture-bearers, but also included two European American researchers studying White Pentacostalism. Data also was generated through transcription and analysis of recorded performances and Burnim's journal entries of her own experiences during participant-observation.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 1.3</emph> includes 53 audiocassettes from additional short-term field research conducted at the August 1979 meeting of the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA) and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, which were both held in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as performances and participant interviews recorded by Burnim after the completion of her dissertation at various meetings of the GMWA and the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC) hosted throughout the United States in 1992-1995.</p><p>Burnim stated in a July 1997 interview with AAAMC staff that she recorded a cross-section of group activities occurring within each convention, including those involving no musical performance. Burnim feels this effort will support an accurate interpretation of the bodies, their meaning, and their significance to gospel music. Interviews probe the structure, history, and role of the GMWA and NCGCC conventions in African American gospel music. Such interviews include NCGCC President Kenneth Moales, GMWA Founding Member Ed Smith, NCGCC Historian Gladys Berryman, gospel pioneer Albertina Walker Brooks of the Caravans, and others. Burnim's recordings particularly document the participation of choirs and worshipers in the performance of gospel music at each convention--including instructional periods, rehearsals, and worship. Interviews with a Bahamanian choir director and a French singer document the international appeal of opportunities to learn more about gospel music in worship settings.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 1.4</emph> contains 6 audiocassettes with miscellaneous content--primarily lectures and commercial recordings--related to African American gospel and religious music.</p><p>The post-dissertation field recordings from Liberia, Malawi, and Cuba in <emph render="boldunderline">Series 2</emph> reflect Burnim's ongoing interest in African American religious music in cross-cultural contexts. The 4 audiocassettes in <emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 2.1</emph> were recorded in Santiago de Cuba circa 1990 and document Burnim's participation with a touring group of African American ministers and professors of music. This group was sponsored by African American churches of the United States to present African American religious music to a Cuban audience in a context that educated listeners in the religious and historical context of the music. Burnim explained in her July 1997 interview with AAAMC staff that she values the recordings as examples of cross-cultural musical interaction, particularly the Cuban audience's reaction to the African American musical styles. Ethnomusicologist and AAAMC founder, Dr. Portia K. Maultsby, participated as an organist for the group.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 2.2</emph> consists of 4 audiocassettes from Burnim's 1989 trip to Monrovia, Liberia. In the 1997 interview, Burnim explained that this research was intended to serve as a preliminary study for a longer ethnomusicological project examining the religious music of Americo-Liberians. The outbreak of civil war in Liberia after the conclusion of her visit there led Burnim to postpone indefinitely plans for further research in the area. According to Burnim, the recordings of worship and choir rehearsals of the interdenominational Tuesday Cottage Prayer Band and St. Peter's Lutheran Church confirm the presence of African American sacred songs in these West African congregations. Burnim's selection of research sites drew upon contacts made by ethnomusicologist Ruth M. Stone (Professor and Chair, Folklore Institute, Indiana University) during her long-term field research in Liberia. Burnim explained in the 1997 interview that her own Liberian field research directly offers data for comparison with ethnomusicological studies focused on indigenous Liberian music, such as Dr. Stone's study of Kpelle epic.</p><p>The 33 audiocassettes and 6 videocassettes in <emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 2.3</emph> were recorded during Burnim's residence in Zomba, Malawi--where she was visiting associate professor at Chancellor College of the University of Malawi (1991)--and her brief return as a director for the university's annual Choral Workshop in 1992. While there, Burnim conducted field research on music in several Malawian Christian communities. As in Liberia, Burnim investigated the use of African American religious music in Malawian contexts, primarily in the cities of Blantyre and Zomba. In addition to worship services in churches, Burnim recorded the Mhango Salvation Singers' gospel-styled performance at an outdoor festival and received a copy of a commercially-produced studio recording from the group. As with this tape, the commercially-produced recordings of the Burnim Collection generally offer supplemental information on the repertoire or broader musical scene of musicians Burnim recorded during field research.</p><p>Though English language predominates in the Choral Workshop recordings, most of the Malawian field recordings include music and speech in indigenous Malawian languages, particularly Chichewa. Therefore, Burnim obtained help from a few of her Malawian students, who served as field research assistants and translators. Several of the field recordings from Malawi contain sections where communications in an indigenous language are translated or summarized in English. Burnim noted in the July 1997 interview, however, that her limited familiarity with indigenous Malawian traditions necessitated additional clarification by Malawians. To assist in receiving Malawian interpretations of such field recordings, Burnim conducted feedback interviews with members of a church congregation. For these feedback interviews, she played a videotaped worship service and recorded the church members' responses (in their indigenous language) to the events of their service. The Burnim Collection contains both the videotaped performances used for the feedback interview and the audiotaped responses of the congregants.</p><p>In addition to performances featuring religious music in Malawi, Burnim recorded a concert featuring the Vaal Reef Choir of South African miners and interviewed one member of the all-male group. This performance presented--in the order printed here--repertoire from Western European art music, arranged choral (African American) spirituals, popular music in English, and indigenous South African music. According to Burnim's 1997 interview with AAAMC staff, this performance invited the examination of social issues. Burnim said that differences along the lines of gender, race, and ethnicity between the White South African director and the Black South African members of the Vaal Reef Choir are implicated in the musical performance and organizational operations of the group. At the time of the field recordings, South Africa's system of apartheid strictly enforced White supremist rule over the Black majority population.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 2.3</emph> contains 2 audiotape reels and two videocassettes with miscellaneous content and <emph render="boldunderline">Subseries 2.4</emph> contains of 33 slides related to Burnim's Africa research.</p><p><emph render="boldunderline">Series 3</emph> consists of 4 videocassettes of Black music performances hosted on the Philadelphia Stage at the Smithsonian Institution American Folklife Festival from July 1-17, 1984, while <emph render="boldunderline">Series 4</emph> contains 39 pieces of gospel sheet music and song texts dating from approximately 1861-1981.</p> </scopecontent>

Melody Maker (a London magazine) described the program as "a happy, unpretentious show that harks back to the halcyon days of R&amp;B" while a San Francisco Chronicle critic exclaimed, "if you would like an instant history of one large segment of popular music, The Johnny Otis Show must be one of the greatest blues/R&amp;B/rock &amp; roll shows ever put together as one act!"</p><p>The Johnny Otis's Oldies but Goodies musical revue was a live show in L.A., similar in nature to the popular television programs American Bandstand and Soul Train, where popular artists lip-synched to their hit recordings while members of the audience danced along. Otis's revue featured R&amp;B artists that had been popular during the early days of the rock &amp; roll era, hence the "oldies" designation. Griffiths taped many of these performances between 1975 and 1977, resulting in approximately five hours of footage and including nearly 100 hit songs. Between segments Otis casually chatted with guests before introducing their songs. Of particular interest are numerous performances by Etta James, who was originally discovered by Otis, and who teams up with Richard Berry on her hit song "Roll With Me Henry." Other performers include the Penguins, the Coasters, Richard Berry, Ted Taylor, Richard Berry, Shirley &amp; Lee, Bobby Day, the Medallions, Joe Houston, the Robins, Gene &amp; Eunice, and many more.</p><p>These videos are highly recommended for anyone interested in the history and development of black music and the classic sound of R&amp;B.</p> </scopecontent>

<head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection includes materials created during Johnny Otis's career as a musician, artist, writer, minister, civil rights activist and radio deejay. Personal papers consist primarily of articles, biographical information, programs and press clippings from 1949-2012. Writings include copies of Otis's L.A. Sentinel column "Let's Talk" from 1960-1964, an undated article on rhythm and blues music and books published from 1993-2009. Photographs span the years from 1940-1994 and feature portraits of Otis with many notable rhythm and blues artists, candid photos taken during camping and hunting trips, family portraits, and performances at various venues including the Barrelhouse and the Hollywood jazz club Shelly's Manne-Hole. Other images capture Otis in radio, television and recording studios and his participation in political activities.</p><p>The bulk of the collection documents "The Johnny Otis Show" radio programs through recorded airchecks, original handwritten cue sheets and tape logs compiled at Indiana University. The weekly radio programs are divided into two subseries, beginning with Otis's "Blue Monday" edition broadcast over KPPC-AM (Pasadena) from 1970-1972. In addition to playing the music of blues and rhythm and blues artists, the shows feature interviews and live performance segments by artists ranging from Freddy King, Joe Liggins and Frank Zappa to Shuggie and Nicky Otis. The majority of the airchecks are from the second subseries, broadcast from 1982-1994 over public radio stations KPFK (Los Angeles) and KPFA (Berkeley) and syndicated by Pacifica. These programs frequently include musical guests from the glory days of rhythm and blues as well as call-ins from radio listeners, while other programs follow the standard deejay hosted format with Otis introducing R&amp;B, jazz and gospel records and publicizing local events. In 1993, Otis opened the Johnny Otis Market and Cabaret in Sebastopol where he broadcast his show live, often featuring members of his band. The most notable live broadcasts were recorded at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1984 and Chicago Blues Festival in 1993; other shows were broadcast live from hotels where Otis was performing with his band.</p><p>Other time-based media in the collection includes Otis's appearance at the 1998 Society for Ethnomusicology conference at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he participated in an interview, forum, and performed at the closing concert with the IU Soul Revue.</p> </scopecontent>
