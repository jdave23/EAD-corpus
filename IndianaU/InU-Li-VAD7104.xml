<p>James Maurice Thompson, 1844-1901, who wrote under the name Maurice Thompson, was an American author and naturalist known for his regionalist works.</p><p>Thompson was born in Fairfield, Indiana, the son of a Baptist minister, and was raised in Georgia. He served in the Confederate army from 1862 to 1865. He moved back north to Indiana in 1868, where he worked in railroad engineering, then law. In 1884 he gave up practicing law in favor of writing full-time.</p><p>Thompson's prose and poems appeared in magazines such as <title render="italic">Appleton's,</title> The <title render="italic">Atlantic,</title> <title render="italic">Harper's,</title> <title render="italic">Independent,</title> <title render="italic">Lippincott,</title> and <title render="italic">Scribner's.</title> His first book was <title render="italic">Hoosier Mosaics</title> (1875), a collection of dialect sketches. His prolific literary output includes nature books, collections of poems, and several romantic historical novels, the most popular of which was <title render="italic">Alice of Old Vincennes</title> (1900), which depicted Indiana during the Revolutionary War.</p>  </bioghist>
