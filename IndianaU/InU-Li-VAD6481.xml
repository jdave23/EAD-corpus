    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>William Smith Harper was born in Dearborn, Indiana, on 21 June 1879. Graduating in 1900, he received training from Adrian College in Adrian, Michigan, to be a minister in the Methodist Protestant Church. He married May Million on Christmas Day, 1905, in Carroll County, Indiana. Ministers in the Methodist Protestant Church rotate to new churches often, and Harper served as a minister in Adrian, Michigan; Gosport, Indiana; Tippecanoe, Indiana; and Jonesboro, Indiana, before joining the Ku Klux Klan in 1922. He gave lectures at Klan meetings and was sent to take charge of the Minneapolis Klan in 1923. A year and a half later, he was dismissed from the Klan and moved to Muncie, Indiana, where he again worked as a Methodist minister. He later moved to Illinois, where he pastored churches in Proviso and Forest Park. Harper died in Richmond, Indiana, on 16 September 1951.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains material related to a white supremacist hate group.</p><p>The Harper mss., 1923-1925, deals chiefly with the North Star Klan No. 2 Realm of Minnesota and includes letters, newspapers, and other printed materials. Harper joined the KKK in 1922 when he was the pastor of the Methodist church in Jonesboro, Indiana. He began traveling around Indiana to deliver Klan lectures, and when the state convention convened at Kokomo, Indiana, on February 15, 1923, he met a number of national officers. Later that month, he was persuaded to deliver an address in Minnesota.</p><p>When Harper arrived in Minnesota in February 1923, he was told to stay and take charge of the Minneapolis Klan. By June 5, 1924, however, he had been dismissed from the Klan. He refused to leave Minnesota, and the National Committee took action and banished him that fall. In September, he requested his salary and moving expenses back to Indiana. On October 20, 1924, he received a letter about the Independent Klan of America with national headquarters at Muncie, Indiana, organized for the purpose of perpetuating true Klankraft. There is no further correspondence to indicate what steps Harper took.</p><p>Included is printed matter on the Ku Klux Klan and the Independent Klan of America. Copies of newspapers of the Klan are in an oversize folder.</p>  </scopecontent>
