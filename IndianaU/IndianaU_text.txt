The University Interests Committee, which had been organized in 1912, moved into action in the 1920s to lobby the state legislature for funds on behalf of Indiana University and to generate interest in the University among civic and community leaders throughout Indiana. Lobbying became necessary at this time because in 1925 the state legislature adopted legislative appropriation as the method to be used in determining funding for public higher education in the state (previous budgets had been based on a percent of the mill tax collected). In anticipation of the 1927 appropriations process, the University Interests Committee organized a statewide network of alumni, students, and community leaders to identify key legislators, assess their attitudes toward Indiana University, and press them to be favorable to IU in the allocation of funds. W.A. Alexander, who had headed the Memorial Fund Campaign, played an important role in the work of this committee as did the Memorial Regiment, an organization composed of participants in the Memorial Fund Campaign who had united earlier in 1926 to offer further volunteer service to Indiana University. The University Interests Committee set up the same kind of network for the 1929 legislative session. A Women's University Interest Committee paralleled and overlapped with the University Interests Committee throughout this period. 
Theodore W. Torrey was born in Woodbine, Iowa in 1907 and spent his early years in Colorado. In 1927, he graduated from the University of Denver and subsequently received his M.A. (1929) and Ph.D. (1932) from Harvard University. Torrey was a Professor in the Zoology Department at Indiana University from 1932 until his retirement in 1972. Torrey was Chairman of the Department of Zoology from 1948 to 1966. Professor Torrey taught courses in embryology and comparative anatomy for pre-medical students and advanced courses in experimental embryology for seniors and graduate students. He developed and taught a course in developmental anatomy. The focus of his research was on the investigation of vertebrate evolution, primarily the excretory and reproductive organs. In his teaching he was one of the pioneers for using three-dimensional photographs and visual aids in both lectures and the laboratory. His textbook, Morphogenesis of the Vertebrates went through four editions from 1962-1979.
Torrey died on August 31, 1986.
Founded in 1886 as an honorary society for science and engineering, today Sigma Xi is an international research society that strives to promote the health of the scientific enterprise and honor scientific achievement. With more than 500 chapters at colleges and universities, industrial research centers, and government laboratories, the Society boasts nearly 75,000 members worldwide. The Sigma Xi Indiana University chapter was chartered in 1904. The first officers were William Lowe Bryan, President (also president of the university), Arthur L. Foley, Vice-President, David M. Mottier, Treasurer and Edgar R. Cumings and Joshua W. Beede were named Recording Secretary and Corresponding Secretary, respectively. Throughout the years, a number of prominent IU faculty members either held officer positions or memberships in Sigma Xi, including Fernandus Payne, Alfred C. Kinsey, and Sid Robinson. Sigma Xi is still active at IU. 
William Mitchell Daily was born in Coshocton, Ohio, in 1812, but was raised in Indiana. He became a Methodist minister at the age of 19 and traveled throughout Indiana preaching. In 1835 he came to Bloomington with his ministry and began studies at Indiana University; he graduated the following year. Daily moved to St. Louis in 1838 and worked as an agent for the Missouri Conference. Shortly after this move he became a professor at St. Charles College. He returned to Indiana in 1840 to recover from a medical condition called hemorrhage of the lungs; upon recovery, he resumed his ministerial career. Daily married Permelia Northcraft in 1843 while he was a minister in Madison, Indiana. Beginning in December 1844 until November 1845 Daily served as Chaplain to the United States House of Representatives. Later he became an agent for Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw) and a member of the Indiana General Conference in 1852. Upon his return to Bloomington, he became a member of the Board of Trustees at Indiana University on February 10, 1853, and attended his first meeting on July 30, 1853. On August 3, a mere day and a half after the resignation of President Ryors, the Board elected Daily as the third president of the university. Daily's appointment came in the midst of rife sectarianism on campus and in the community. From the beginnings of the university, Presbyterians had constituted most of the school's staff and faculty. This caused the Bloomington community to raise questions about the diversity of the school and about the politics involved. The Indiana Methodist Conference, established in 1832, made it a priority to be represented at the university itself, not just on the board. The sect met with certain opposition. Samuel Bigger, who was elected Indiana governor in 1840, declared that "there was not a Methodist in America with sufficient learning to fill a professor's chair if it were tendered him." (Woodburn p.115) But in 1853 the state had a new governor, Joseph A. Wright, who believed Daily's status as a Methodist and a Democrat could help the institution with its financial troubles. Daily's lack of credentials as an educator, however, caused many members of the IU faculty to feel he was unqualified for such an important position. Daily's presidency was threatened in July 1858, when Dr. Alexander M. Murphy filed eleven separate charges against him. These charges included incompetence, plagiarism, and incurrence of debt. Other charges concerned incidents of sexual advances towards young women while his wife was away, with these being particularly damning. Murphy maintained that Daily was a "lecher and a lewd man at heart," and that he had used his position to seduce women. Murphy's statements were compounded by other incidents involving Daily at the end of 1858. Louisa J. Smith, who did not know Daily, stated that on December 29, a strange man had accosted her in the street-the man matched Daily's description. On New Year's Eve, prominent Indianapolis citizens William Wallace and Benjamin Harrison (future President of the United States) testified that they had seen Daily intoxicated in public. These complaints came to the Board with Murphy's charges in January 1859. The body decided that Murphy would need to produce a list of witnesses to sustain the accusations. The next morning, instead of producing this list, Murphy dropped the charges altogether. Although none of the charges against Daily were substantiated, he resigned his presidency on January 26, 1859, "in order that the unfavorable publicity connected with the trial might not be prejudicial to the University." (Myers p. 328) In a separate farewell address he delivered in February, Daily spoke of the affair as "slimy subterranean damnable conspiracies, brought about by malignant selfish, fiendish, devilish men who are instigated by malice." He also called the members of the faculty "a set of pusillanimous, narrow-minded bigots." Local Methodists were disappointed by Daily, who was the first major Methodist faculty member at the University. In October 1859, the Indiana Methodist Conference met in Bloomington to decide upon Daily's fate in the association. It was a closed meeting; there were no witnesses presented and no minutes recorded, except for the decision: William Daily was expelled from connection with the conference. Regardless of the university's decision, the Conference felt that Daily should have been free of all suspicion in his position. During the last years of his life Daily continued his ministry. Anxious to move South, he accepted the appointment of President Lincoln to become hospital chaplain in 1862. He served with the Louisiana Conference beginning in 1869. Daily was in the midst of this new career in the North New Orleans district when he became ill and died a few days later on February 5, 1877. He is buried in Madison, Indiana. 
Will T. Hale was born in Mobile, Alabama in 1880 to Foster Kirksey and Nettie Pope Hale. Developing an early appreciation for English literature, he graduated from his local high school in 1898 and then began his collegiate education by first attending Vanderbilt University where he earned his A.B. and A.M. degrees in 1902. He then proceeded to Yale University where he graduated with his Bachelors from the School of Divinity in 1905. After this, he began his teaching career when he became a professor of History and English at Morrisville College in Montana for a short period before moving on to the University of Texas, where he was an instructor of English from 1907-1910. Soon after, he obtained his Masters degree in English at Columbia University and graduated in 1912. He returned to Yale for his Ph.D., and graduated in 1914. His career at Indiana University began as an English instructor in 1913 and in 1918, he became an assistant professor. In 1924, he was promoted to associate professor and in 1929, he became a full professor. During his career, he specialized in Victorian poetry and Bible literature. He published and edited several books about popular authors, such as Brontë and Milton. He was also active in the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta, which he joined during his college years and as a faculty member, he aided the house in events and fundraising. Though only barely mentioned in biographical material, it is said he regularly helped young men complete college through monetary grants and offering room and board at his house. During his tenure at IU, Hale was regularly awarded the Brown Derby award, which was given to the most popular professor of the year. He was a member of the American Association of University Professors and the Modern Languages Association of America and the Faculty Club at IU. On a more personal level, he established the Browning Club of Indiana University and was a Mason for many years. He retired on July 1, 1950 but stayed active in the community as well as IU until his death on February 5, 1967. 
Scott Russell Sanders was a Professor at Indiana University for the duration of his teaching career, 1971-2009. He demonstrated an interest in both literature and science, initially attending Brown University on a physics scholarship before his graduate study in literature at Cambridge. As a member of the IU's English department, he became recognized as one of the finest essayists in the country, releasing more than twenty books, both fiction and non-fiction, including the science fiction novel Terrarium and the collections Writing from the Center, In Limestone Country, and The Paradise of Bombs. Sanders also played a large role in the Wells Scholars program during his Indiana career, frequently teaching courses in the program and serving as the program director from 1997-2003. His writings and courses both demonstrate an interest in natural history in addition to focusing on more traditional literary subjects, such as in his Imagining Nature courses and publications such as his 2009 A Conservationist Manifesto. 
William H. Nebergall was born in Cuba, Illinois on December 12, 1914. He received a Bachelor of Education degree from Western Illinois State Teachers College in 1939 and completed a M.S. degree in chemistry in 1939. This was followed by teaching appointments in chemistry at State Teacher's College in Johnson City, Tennessee until 1941. During the 1941-1942 academic year he taught chemistry at the University of Kentucky, and from 1942-1944 he taught chemistry at the University of Minnesota. While at Minnesota, he completed his Ph.D. In 1940, William Nebergall married Florence Eileen Johnson. The couple had two sons prior to Nebergall receiving a position at Indiana University in 1949, and a daughter was born a few years thereafter. He began his career at IU as an assistant professor of chemistry, and was promoted to associate professor in 1955. Nebergall authored many publications and was an active researcher. He collaborated with fellow professor F.C. Schmidt to write a combination textbook and laboratory manual. This resulted in two widely used textbooks, College Chemistry and General Chemistry. Nebergall's research interests were in organogermanium chemistry and the chemistry of organosilicon compounds. Beginning in 1950, he worked with Joseph C. Muhler and Harry C. Day in their study of fluorides in relation to dental caries. Financial support from Proctor and Gamble for research on products to prevent tooth decay led to their development of the basic composition for what would come to be the anti-decay ingredient used in Crest toothpaste. Many patents were made in Nebergall's name for compounds created during this research. In 1959, Nebergall was awarded a National Science Foundation faculty fellowship, which prompted him to take a sabbatical leave to conduct research in Germany. His health began to decline dramatically after his time in Germany. After years of ill health, he retired early at age 61 in 1975. He died in September 1978. 
Schuyler Franklin Otteson (Ott to his friends) was born on July 17, 1917, in Modena, Wisconsin. His father owned a country store in which Otteson frequently worked as a child and young adult and to which he attributed his interest in business and marketing. Otteson pursued this interest with business degrees from the University of Wisconsin and Northwestern University. After his graduation from Northwestern, he gained employment with the Fair Store in Chicago and with Montgomery Ward and Company as an assistant buyer. From 1943-1948, Otteson pursued a Ph.D. at The Ohio State University. During this time, he served on the faculty of Ohio Wesleyan University until he came to Indiana University in 1946 as an assistant professor of marketing. Otteson completed his Ph.D. in 1948 and was named a professor of marketing in 1952. From 1952 until 1971, when he became Dean of the School of Business, Otteson maintained an extremely busy calendar. He served as Director of the Bureau of Business Research (now the Indiana Business Research Center) from 1954 to 1960 and during that time, also became the founding editor of Business Horizons, a scholarly journal. As Director of the Bureau of Business Research, Otteson did much to make the Bureau an indispensable entity in the school and the state. In 1955, he edited a 14-volume study for the Office of the Governor entitled Indiana's Economic Resources and Potential which influenced state economic policy into the 1960s. Otteson was also named Sagamore of the Wabash, a high honor to citizens of Indiana, in 1956. Despite the heavy responsibilities at the Bureau and teaching, Otteson also continued his service to the University during these years. In 1960, he was appointed chair of the Marketing Department and then chair of the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program in 1965. He was active in administering the International Business Research Institute, which brought his international interests home to Indiana. In addition, he served on many University and School of Business committees, evidence of which can be found in his personal files. For example, Otteson was the secretary of the Faculty Council from 1970 to 1971, president of the Bloomington Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, and a member of the IU Athletics Committee. Always involved, Otteson also served (with prestige) as the national president of the American Marketing Association from 1965-1966. He was a member of the executive committee of the U.S. Department of Commerce National Marketing Advisory Committee during the latter half of the 1960s. From 1966-1968, Otteson was secretary and member of the executive committee of the International Marketing Federation. In addition, Otteson served on the Board of Governors of Beta Gamma Sigma (national business honorary society), was a co-founder of the Midwest Business Administration Association, and was president of the Indiana Academy of the Social Sciences in 1969. In 1971, Otteson was appointed Dean of the School of Business after Dean George Pinnell became vice president of the University. During Otteson's tenure as the sixth dean, the School of Business experienced a period of tremendous growth. When Otteson retired in December of 1982, the school had grown to include many more women and minorities, was routinely sending students to study abroad, and had gained the respect of the nation and world as a place to learn business administration. Schuyler F. Otteson passed away at the Meadowood Retirement Community in Bloomington, Indiana, on February 5, 2001, at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife, Marie, and their four children, Judy, Marty, Karn, and John. 
T. James Crawford was born on December 14, 1916 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and died on August 15, 2000 in Bloomington, Indiana. Crawford grew up in the Pittsburgh area where he would later receive both his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Pittsburgh. It was while he was attending the University of Pittsburg that he met D.D. Leesenberry, with whom he would later coauthor 20th Century Typewriting. Crawford would later return to the University of Pittsburgh to obtain his doctoral degree. In May of 1942, after serving as a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh and the Women's College of the University of North Carolina, Crawford came to Indiana University. His intention was to join the IU Summer Session faculty but instead was given the duty of assisting with the organization of the U.S. Naval Training School which was being started as a result of the war effort. While not yet in active duty, he became supervisor of instruction in the U.S. Navy School for Yeomen and Storekeepers. In that position, he helped design a program for the first group of WAVES that had been recruited by the Navy. In December of 1942 Crawford was provided his orders for active duty as a supply officer for a Seabee battalion. He would serve overseas for nearly two years. Following the war, Crawford returned to IU as a faculty lecturer in the School of Business. During his tenure at IU, he was chairman of the department of administrative systems and business education for 15 years. Additionally, he worked to initiate educational television by assisting in the development of some of the first television courses via the IU television network. Crawford's professional associations were with the Indiana Business Educators Club, the National Association for Business Teacher Education, and the State Association for Business Education for which he served for a period of time as president. Crawford retired from Indiana University in 1987. 
Toyoaki Uehara was born November 9th, 1924 in Okayama, Japan. He worked as a teaching assistant at Tenri University in Tenri, Japan from 1950-1951 and was heavily involved in the Tenrikyo movement that established the university. After moving to the United States he worked as an instructor in the Army's Defense Language Institute from 1954-1956. He then moved to Los Angeles on a scholarship, earning his Ph.D. in Religion with a minor in Asian Studies in 1960 at the University of Southern California, where he later lectured. After two years as assistant professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, Uehara was hired as an assistant professor in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literature (later East Asian Languages and Cultures) at Indiana University, Bloomington, in 1963, becoming a full professor in 1984.He retired in 1990 with the title Professor Emeritus of East Asian Languages and Cultures. While at I.U., Uehara coordinated the Tenri University student and faculty exchange programs from 1966 until 1989 as well as several additional Asian exchange programs from various institutions including United College in Hong Kong. He was an active member of numerous committees that enabled foreign language workshops, summer institutes, and campus courses to flourish. He collaborated in the authorship of several books and monographs, the most well-known being Fundamentals of Japanese, co-written with Gisaburo N. Kiyose and published by Indiana University Press in 1975, which became the primary Japanese language textbook of its time. He also translated a number of materials between English and Japanese and compiled comprehensive bibliographies of relevant language and religious materials with the assistance of various colleagues. Uehara continued to work as a consultant with Tenri University after retiring from I.U., traveling and maintaining his correspondence with former students and colleagues around the world. He passed away March 4, 1997. The IU Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures offers annual Uehara scholarships to undergraduate showing excellence in East Asian studies, named in honor of the late professor. 
Established in 1892, the Moonlight Pleasure Club appears to have been created exclusively for a small group of friends as a venue for them to enjoy their time together while at IU. The four individuals who founded the club included Grace H. Woodburn, Fred W. Truscott, Daniel T. Weir, and Maud Van Zandt, each of whom graduated from Indiana University in the 1890s. Minimal documentation regarding the club exists, and thus it is possible that 1892 was its only year of existence. 
Theodore R. "Ted" Bowie was a prominent faculty member at Indiana University, whose contributions to the field of the history of Asian Art made him a pivotal figure in the development of the University's Art History Program. Bowie's research and travel in Asia would contribute to a number of acquisitions for exhibitions which he organized, and inform his work in the development of the University Art Museum. His exhibition "The Arts of Thailand", opening at the Museum in 1960, would become one of the first of its kind to display Thai art in the West, going on to travel throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. Bowie was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1905 to a Russian mother and American father and grew up in both Nice, France, and San Francisco. Bowie received his bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1927 and stayed on to earn his master's degree in political science in 1929, and his doctorate in French literature in 1935. Turning from his early career in French literature, Bowie would go on to fulfill a number of roles relating to the study of art and art history at Indiana University. Beginning his career at Indiana University in 1950, Bowie would serve as Associate Professor in the Department of Fine Arts from 1950 to 1960. He then served as Associate Professor in the Graduate School from 1952 to 1960, and Professor from 1960 to 1975. While at IU, Bowie would also serve as Fine Arts Librarian from 1951 to 1960, as an unofficial Curator of Oriental Collections at the University Art Museum from 1962 to 1976, as Acting Chair of the Department of Fine Arts from 1970 to 1973, and as Chairman of the Arts Administration Program from 1969 to 1972. He received the title of Professor Emeritus upon his retirement in 1975. Theodore Bowie died of heart failure on March 5, 1995 in his home in Bloomington, Indiana in the company of his wife Marilyn (Miller) Bowie. 
Willkie Quadrangle, named after Wendell L. Willkie, opened in the fall of 1964 as a residence hall for men and women. Born in Elwood, Indiana, Wendell Willkie became an accomplished attorney, businessman, and statesman. He completed his bachelor's and law degrees at Indiana University. Construction of the Willkie Quadrangle buildings began in July 1963 and was completed in February 1965, but the first students were able to move in for the fall semester of 1964. At its opening, the Willkie Quadrangle residence hall was the tallest residence hall on campus, with two eleven-story buildings and accommodations for 589 men and 577 women. Each building had utility and laundry rooms, a student lounge, recreation and TV areas, and single and double bedrooms and a smaller lounge on each of the 11 floors. The service building had kitchen, dining and library facilities. Willkie Quadrangle had an organized student government, with governors representing each of the units to formulate dress codes, approve budgets, and create an election code. Willkie Quadrangle had its own newspaper staff, glee club, and at least two magazines: a literary magazine called The Thistle, and a general interest magazine called Willkie Life. There were two cooperative living units in the center building of the quadrangle, which housed 57 men and 57 women. Students who lived in these cooperative living units did their own housekeeping and performed dining hall duties, and in exchange they received housing at a cost lower than that of the regular residence halls on campus. In 1997, the board of trustees approved a $28 million renovation plan to convert Willkie Quadrangle from a traditional dormitory to a complex of suites and apartments. The renovation was completed in 1999, and in September 2000 the building was rededicated as the Willkie Residence Center. 
The Black Student Voice was a newsletter published by the "Office of Afro-American Affairs" at Indiana University. This group was established by Black student activists in the spring of 1968 as a means of advocating for the creation of a formal university office to oversee the academic, social, and financial wellbeing of Black students, faculty, and staff, as well as an academic program in Black Studies.
Besides the publication of the newsletter, the Office's lobbying efforts included presentations at the Board of Trustees meeting in September 1968 and Faculty Council meeting in January 1969. In April 1969, the Board of Trustees appointed Professor Orlando Taylor the Acting Vice Chancellor of Afro-American Affairs to oversee an official IU Office of Afro-American Affairs and the establishment of an Afro-American Studies department. However, because of Dr. Taylor's support of the students during the Ballantine Hall Lock-In, the Trustees withdrew the offer the following month. In February 1970, Herman C. Hudson, then an associate professor with the School of Education, was named Acting Vice Chancellor for Afro-American Affairs and then named Vice Chancellor in June 1971. 
The purpose of the Office of Afro-American Affairs was to organize some of the social and academic activities of Black students at Indiana University. The office grew over the years under the leadership of Herman Hudson. The office no longer exists but some of its efforts are now part of the work of the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs, which strives to cultivate a diverse, inclusive environment that supports equal access, participation, and representation on all IU campuses.

Indiana is a state that is part of the American Midwest. Sitting at the "crossroads of America," Indiana borders Lake Michigan to the north, Illinois to the west, Ohio to the east, and Kentucky to the south. Indiana was the 19th state to enter the union, being admitted on December 11, 1816. Indianapolis became the state capital in 1825. The state is known for its people, known as "Hoosiers,"; its industries, including agriculture, quarrying, and mining; and its transportation infrastructure. The area that would later become the state of Indiana was first inhabited by members of the Miami Confederation, including the Miami and Potawatomi. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, French traders established the first white settlements in the area. After the land was claimed for the United States during the American Revolution, it was added to the Northwest Territory by the Ordinance of 1787. The 18th century brought with it an influx of white immigrants and settlers to the area, leading to a series of conflicts with the native inhabitants. Battles continued until 1811, when the Battle of Tippecanoe was won by future-president William Henry Harrison. Further settlement of the area and statehood soon followed. 
David William Inwood was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1927. He graduated from Central High School in South Bend in 1944 and served in Japan in 1946. After the war, he attended Indiana University.

Born April 5, 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, William Charles Henderson attended Hamilton College and pursued graduate studies briefly at both Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. He and his uncle Howard Galloway started the small publishing house Nautilus Books in 1970, which then published Henderson's first novel The Galapagos Kid under the pseudonym Luke Walton. Neither the novel nor the publishing house proved successful. In 1973 Henderson launched the Pushcart Press with The Publish it Yourself Handbook-Literary Tradition and How-To Without Commercial or Vanity Publishers, compiled and edited by him. The handbook was not only successful but has seen several reprintings over the years. He started the Pushcart Prize series in 1976. This annual anthology that celebrates small presses and little magazines and their writers has continued without interruption. In 1982 Henderson started the Editors' Book Award for overlooked manuscripts. In this program he asks editors at commercial houses to nominate manuscripts they were not able to publish because of financial pressure. He then chooses one from these nominations and publishes it by Pushcart Press. Over the years several selections published in this series have been reprinted in mass market and trade paperback editions, occasionally by the very commercial house that had rejected them the first time around. In addition to his editing and publishing work, Henderson has also written several volumes of memoirs, essays and book reviews for the New York Times, Publishers Weekly and elsewhere, and has been a visiting lecturer at several colleges and summer writing programs.

The Finlay mss., 1953-1972 contains of correspondence and writings by Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006). An influential proponent of concrete poetry, Finlay moved from solely literary forms of poetry, drama, and short stories in the 1950's to kinetic forms of poetry expressed in stone, wood, neon and other tangible structures in the 1960's. Boats and boating, sails and the sea were used by Finlay to suggest poetic ideas in many of his poems such as Archangel of Archangel, Boatyard, Four Sails, The Four Seasons..., Homage to Gomringer, Little Drummer boy, The Old Nobby, Seashells, Sepia Barge and others. Sundials were used in like manner as in Arcadian Sundials, Biggar Sundial, and Land/Sea Indoor Sundial. Letters exchanged with woodcarvers, stone carvers, photographers, typographers, printers, and artists give the instructions for the creation of many of his works. A book of poems, Poems to See and Hear, was prepared especially to introduce to children Finlay's poetic concepts. During 1968 to 1971 there was much work by Films of Scotland in the preparation of the films Ocean Stripe 5 and KY 365 based on Finlay's life and poetry.

The Temperance Movement was a social movement against the sale or drinking of alcoholic beverages. In Britain, the movement reached its peak in the mid-to-late 1800s, as alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence was a wide-spread problem. Advocates formed numerous societies and associations to combat alcoholism, each group with their own ideas about how to go about stamping out the problem. Some advocated moderation in drinking, while others espoused complete abstinence; some focused on the religious message of temperance, while others sought to put pressure on the government to pass temperance legislation. The Central Association for Stopping the Sale of Intoxicating Liquor on Sundays, centered in Manchester, England, focused on petitioning Parliament to pass legislation that would close public houses and bars on Sundays. During the 1860s and 70s, the issue became highly politicized as the Temperance Movement became closely tied to the aims of the Liberal Party. 
The Brophy mss., 1962-1979 contains the correspondence of novelist and activist Brigid Brophy (1929-1995). Brophy was born in West London. In 1947, she won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was expelled after supposed indiscretions that she committed, which she since has refrained from publicly talking about save to say that they left her traumatized. Having recovered, she went on write her first book of short stories, The Crown Princess, in 1953. In that same year, she also published her now-beloved novel Hackenfeller's Ape. That work and subsequent writings would showcase her investment in animal advocacy. Throughout her life, she also became a staunch defender of gay marriage, as evidenced by her 1963 work, The Finishing Touch. With her husband, she also published the rather controversial volume Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without (1967), which helped to deemphasize the privileging of Victorian authors in the Western canon. This collection includes correspondence between Brophy and her editors and publishers. Most of it helps contextualize some of the editorial and creative decisions surrounding her own works."

As a scholar of library science, Walter Lange conducted several bibliographical studies, while actively working as a rare text collector. For his Master of Arts degree, Lange wrote a dissertation on the French Revolution and the "lost Dauphin," the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who was rumored to survive the French Revolution. Lange was also interested in the Wise Forgeries, concerning Thomas James Wise, a widely known book collector later turned out to be a forger. To investigate Wise's case, Lange exchanged correspondence with various scholars and collectors. One noteworthy part of the Lange collection is his own collection of the autographs related to the French Revolution. For several years, Lange conducted research on the rumor and the false claimants of the lost Dauphin, during which he created a collection of letters, hand-written documents, and notes of highly important figures, such as Karl Wilhelm Naudorff and Eleazar Williams, both widely known false claimants in the nineteenth century. His collection also encompasses first-hand records of the contemporaneity by French nobility and royal members, along with autographs and original letters of others who are less directly connected to the French royal family and the revolution.

Lange also left a vast amount of book and autograph catalogues along with letters with other book collectors, which reflect his deep bibliographic interest in various types of rare texts.

Ludwig Bemelmans was born on April 27, 1898, in Meran, Austria-Hungary (now Italy). When Bemelmans was a young child, his father left the family for a mistress, so in 1904, his mother moved the family to Germany where Bemelmans was educated. He returned to Austria to serve as an apprentice to his uncle Hans Bemelmans, a hotel owner, before emigrating to the United States. Towards the end of World War I, Bemelmans joined the U.S. Army and rose to the rank of Second Lieutenant, though he was not shipped with American troops to Europe on account of his German heritage. He obtained U.S. citizenship in 1918. Following the war, Bemelmans worked hotel jobs in New York to support himself while trying to transition into a career as an artist and cartoonist. He worked in pen and ink, watercolor, and gouache. In 1934, Bemelmans published his first children's book, Hansi, and in 1939, his big break came with the publication of the award-winning Madeline. The story of a red-headed French schoolgirl with iconic illustrations of the Parisian cityscape was turned into a successful series of books published from 1939-1999. Six of the stories were written and illustrated by Bemelmans, and a seventh story was published posthumously and illustrated by Bemelmans' grandson, John Bemelmans-Marciano. Though Bemelmans was most well-known for the Madeline series, he also authored travel and humor books, adult novels, and movie scripts, including the script for Yolanda and the Thief (1945). In the 1940s, he was commissioned to paint murals on the walls of a new bar at The Carlyle hotel in Manhattan's Upper East Side, now known as Bemelmans Bar. In the 1950s, he began to transition into oil painting and purchased a bistro in Paris to cover with his murals, but the project flopped with resistance from the French bureaucracy. Bemelmans passed away in New York City on October 1, 1962, at the age of 64. 
Sarah Ann Bement, the oldest child of Hiram Bement and Sarah Collins, was born ca. 1821 in New Hampshire. In 1834, the Bement family moved from the Northeast to Galena Township, La Porte County, IN. Isaac Ter Bush, son of John Ter Bush and Lydia Clearwater, was born October 9, 1815, in Wawarsing, Ulster County, New York. After the family moved to the Midwest, they dropped the first syllable of their surname. By 1840, the Bush family had moved to LaPorte County, and in 1850, they were located in the Kankakee Township. Isaac Bush and Sarah Ann Bement married on December 22, 1850, in LaPorte County, IN, and Sarah Ann Bement moved to Isaac Bush's farm in Kankakee. In addition to tending his farm, Isaac Bush served his local community by holding several township offices and supported the Republican Party. He passed away around the age of 48 in ca. 1864. Following her husband's death, Sarah Ann (Bement) Bush moved into the household of her younger brother, Orren Bement, for a time, and by 1880 she had taken in a young Swedish immigrant named Louisa Anderson.

Patrick O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ in Chalfont St. Peter, England, on December 12, 1914. His literary career began at the young age of 15 with the publication of his Caesar: The Life Story of a Panda-Leopard (1930). After trying unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, he married his first wife Elizabeth Jones in 1936 and started a family. In World War II, he served as an ambulance driver alongside the Countess Mary Tolstoy (nee Wicksteed). Russ and Tolstoy subsequently divorced their respective spouses and married each other. The couple moved to Wales in 1945 to begin their new life together, and Russ changed his name to Patrick O'Brian, under which he would publish his most successful books. O'Brian wrote in a variety of genres, including novels, short stories, history, and biography. In the 1950s and 60s, he earned success as a French-to-English translator; his work in translation included Henri Charriere's Papillon and many of Simone de Beauvoir's writings. He penned detailed biographies of artist Pablo Picasso (Picasso, 1976) and the naturalist and explorer Joseph Banks (Joseph Banks: A Life, 1987). O'Brian was best known for his acclaimed Aubrey-Maturin series of 20 historical novels published from 1969 to 1999 (plus one unfinished work published posthumously in 2004). The Aubrey-Maturin series follows the friendship of Jack Aubrey, an officer of the Royal Navy, and Stephen Maturin, an Irish-Catalan naval doctor and intelligence agent, during the Napoleonic Wars.

Thomas Clayton Wolfe was born on October 3, 1900, in Asheville, North Carolina. He began his college education at the University of North Carolina, and with the intention of becoming a professional playwright, he enrolled at George Pierce Baker's Harvard University workshop. After three years at Harvard, Wolfe moved to New York City where he taught at NYU's Washington Square College. In addition to plays, he wrote short stories, novellas, and novels reflecting American culture in the 1920s and 1930s. Wolfe was known especially for his autobiographical style of writing in works such as Look Homeward, Angel (1929). From 1925 to 1929, he was romantically involved with set designer and costumer Aline Bernstein, and she served as the inspiration for Wolfe's character Esther Jack in the novels Of Time and the River (1935), The Web and the Rock (1939), and You Can't Go Home Again (1940). Wolfe died in Baltimore, MD, on September 15, 1938, at age 37, leaving many manuscripts that were published posthumously. Aline Bernstein was born Hazel Frankau on December 22, 1882, in New York City. Orphaned at the age of 17, young Bernstein designed and sold greeting cards, hats, and dresses with her sister Ethel to support her family. She studied art at the School of Applied Design and under Robert Henri, a master painter of the Ashcan School. Bernstein began to invest her artistic talents in the world of theater by volunteering with the girls' dramatic club at the Henry Street Settlement House and later the Neighborhood Playhouse. From 1916 to 1951, she worked as a set designer and costumer for fifty-one productions. In 1926, Bernstein became the first female member of the AFL's designers' union. In the late 1920s, she had a romantic relationship with the playwright and novelist Thomas Wolfe, and in 1938, Bernstein published a novel about their friendship: The Journey Down. After a prolific career in theater, Bernstein passed away in New York on September 7, 1955, at the age of 74.

Fremont's expeditions exploring the Rocky Mountains and was an interpreter for Chief Red Cloud. By the 1860s, he had moved to the Nebraska Territory, near Fort Laramie, where he worked as a trader. He eventually moved to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and died in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, in August 1894. 
Eric Arthur Blair, better known under the pseudonym George Orwell, was born on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, Bengal, India, where his father worked as an opium agent for the Bengalese government under the British Raj. When Blair was three years old, his mother brought him and his siblings to England to receive an education at England's best schools. His family had an English aristocratic background but by Eric Blair's generation, their wealth had run dry, and so he relied on scholarships and the generosity of his maternal uncle to support his education. At a young age, Blair showed great intellectual aptitude and won a scholarship to attend Eton, but his stubborn resistance of authority and neglect of assigned tasks prevented him from attending university. Instead, he took the Indian Civil Service exams and joined the Burma police in 1921. While in Burma, he was not popular among his police colleagues and grew to resent British colonial rule and its effects on the Burmese people. In 1927, he resigned from his position to become a writer and live among the poor in England. A year later, he moved to Paris to write and, failing to find a publisher for his work, lived in poverty. His personal experiences inspired the first book he published, Down and Out in Paris and London (1933). His first novel, Burmese Days (1934), was so obviously based on his days as a discontented policeman in Burma that the work had to be published in the United States for fear of libel suits in England. Over the next few years, Blair struggled to succeed professionally as a author and began to equate literary success with selling out. His big break came when in January 1936, Victor Gollancz gave him a large advance payment to write a book about poverty and unemployment, which resulted in his controversial The Road to Wigan Pier (1937) on working-class life in northern England. In June 1936, Blair married University College, London educational psychology student Eileen Maud O'Shaughnessy, 1905-1945. Though Blair was critical of political parties, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War aroused Blair's anti-fascist passion, and shortly after completing The Road to Wigan Pier in December 1938, he joined the independent Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista (POUM) militia to fight the Francoists, but found hostility from the Communists as well, which turned him ideologically against communism. In June 1937, Eileen helped a wounded Blair to escape Spain and return to England. Gollancz refused to publish Blair's subsequent indictment of the Communists for endangering the Spanish socialist cause in Homage to Catalonia, so the Trotskyite publisher Frederick Warburg published it in 1938. In the same year, Blair was diagnosed with tuberculosis and spent some time in a sanatorium and Morocco for recovery. He tried to join the army in World War II, but was rejected on account of his disease, and instead joined the Home Guard and worked as a BBC producer. During the war, he gained success as a political and literary essayist. In 1944, Blair tried to publish his seminal Animal Farm, but many publishers, including Gollancz, refused to put it out while Russia was still an ally. Shortly after the war, Harcourt Brace published the book with massive success. After the death of his wife, Blair wrote Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) in seclusion and dying of tuberculosis on the island of Jura. At age 46, the writer succumbed to the disease in a London hospital on January 21, 1950. 
Mary Anne Italia Mitchell was born on December 18, 1855, in Alton, Cook County, Illinois, to Chicago banker and businessman William Hamilton Mitchell and Mary Anne Kelly. In 1882, she married the banker Chauncey Justis Blair, and they had four children. Mrs. Blair enjoyed traveling to Europe, particularly Italy and Paris, and amassed large collections of books, art, and other antique artifacts. Her acquisitions included Roman silver excavated near Tivoli; Italian needwork and gold dinner service; Gothic statuettes; and medieval and renaissance paintings. She kept an apartment in Paris filled with artwork and fine furniture. Blair also made a major donation of her medieval and renaissance artwork to the Chicago Art Institute, which is detailed in the Catalogue of the Mary Blair Collection of Mediaeval and Renaissance Art. She passed away at the age of 84 on August 5, 1940, in Hollywood, CA. 
Major Marcus A. Reno, 1835-1889, was a soldier involved in the Battle of the Little Big Horn River in 1876. Reno was born in Carollton, Illinois. After the death of his mother in 1848, Reno applied for the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1857 and was assigned to the 1st U.S. Dragoons. During the Civil War, he fought for the Union Army at the battles of Antietam, Kelly's Ford, Williamsport, and Cold Harbor, among others. By 1876 Reno was serving as the senior officer under General George Armstrong Custer, 1839-1876. At the Battle of Little Bighorn, Reno led his company to retreat to a defensive position while Custer's company was overrun. His unit was the only unit to survive the battle. A court of inquiry on January 13, 1879 cleared Reno of charges of cowardice, but his behavior during the battle continued to be portrayed as the antithesis to Custer's brave "last stand." Reno was court marshalled on unrelated charges in 1880, but this ruling was overturned posthumously in 1967. He was then reinterred at Custer National Cemetery. 
James Benjamin Blish, who also published under the pseudonym William Atheling, Jr., was born on May 23, 1921, in East Orange, New Jersey. He studied zoology at Rutgers University and attended graduate school at Columbia University after serving in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1944. In 1950, Blish began writing science fiction short stories that he would later develop into the four-part Cities in Flight series that adapted Oswald Spengler's cyclical theory of culture in a futuristic society. In 1959, he won the Hugo Award for A Case of Conscience, which launched another novel series, After Such Knowledge, centered on the theme of competition between science and religion. While working primarily as an advertising copy writer in the 1950s and 60s, Blish authored a number of other science fiction works and also was among the first literary critics of the science fiction genre. In the late 1960s, he transitioned into writing fiction full-time and moved to England. He devoted much of the rest of his career writing novelizations of the television series Star Trek with his wife, J. A. Lawrence. Blish died on July 30, 1975, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, at the age of 54. 
Leon Paul Blouet, also known by the pseudonym Max O'Rell, was born on March 2, 1847, in Avranches, Normandy, France. For his education, he studied at the Ecole Polytechnique and the Sorbonne in Paris and embarked on a military career by studying at the Ecole Militaire from 1866 to 1869. Shortly after leaving the Ecole Militaire, Blouet served as a cavalry officer in the Franco-Prussian War, being discharged in early 1871 on account of a wound. Blouet subsequently decided to pursue journalism. His liberal newspaper met resistance in his native France, and so Blouet moved to England in 1872 to work as a correspondent for French newspapers. In 1874, he became the French master at St. Paul's School in London and married Mary Bartlett. Blouet led a successful career teaching French at the prestigious London boys' school in the 1870s and 80s, but he eventually turned to writing. In 1883, he published a book on English eccentricities and manners titled John Bull et son ile, which his wife also translated into English, and the work was such a hit with both the French- and English-speaking world, Blouet quit his position as a French teacher to devote himself to full-time writing and lecturing. The humorist authored John Bull's Womankind (1884), Drat the Boys (1886), Jonathan and his Continent (1889), Woman and Artist (1900), Her Royal Highness Woman (1901), and Rambles in Womanland (1903), all of which were originally in French but published simultaneously in English. From 1887-1890 and 1892-1893, Blouet toured the United States and British colonies as a lecturer taking a humorous spin on British culture; he became known as the French Mark Twain. In 1902, he returned to Paris where he worked as a French correspondent for the New York Journal. He died on May 24, 1903, in Paris at the age of 56.

His plays are characterized by variety and versatility; he seldom created a structured plot, relying instead on the interaction of the physical action with other dramatic elements like music, film footage, and slide projections. Many of his characters are social outcasts living in Mumbai shantytowns, and his plots explore themes such as postcolonialism, racial tension, the interactions of Eastern and Western culture, and social inequality. His most famous play, Goa, was published in 1964. Other notable works include The Doldrummers (1960), The Dumb Dancer (1961), The Hungry Ones (1965), The Refugee (1971), Sonar Bangla (1972), and The Dissident M.L.A. (1974).

In the 1870s, Gissing moved to the United States, spending time tutoring and teaching in classics as well as writing short stories for American newspapers. Such experiences collectively informed many of his novelistic works, including Workers in the Dawn (1880), Thyrza (1887), and New Grub Street (1889). Stylistically, these and Gissing's other novels are known for their naturalism, gritty realism, and thematic confrontations of poverty, sexuality, and marital discontent.

A large portion of Horton's collection is his correspondence with the Pound family, along with correspondence with various people about Ezra Pound. However, materials about Pound are not limited to the letters only, as Horton preserved a wide range of items from Pound's publications to Pound's hand-written notes and comments on society, politics, and the economy. The date span of the collection overlaps with the period when Ezra Pound was accused of Fascism, imprisoned, and hospitalized. The fierce controversy surrounding Pound during this time is reflected on Horton's collection, which contains various materials such as articles, statements, and legal and medical documents by diverse people that both criticize and defend Pound. His careful records of his publishing business (the Square Dollar Series) also provide insight into how Pound's works were published and circulated. 
John Waynflete Carter, 1905-1975, was an English bibliographer and antiquarian bookseller. With Graham Pollard he wrote An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets (1934), which exposed the forgeries of book collector T.J. Wise. He is also the author of several canonical works on book collecting, including Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting (1948), Printing and the Mind of Man (1963), and ABC for Book Collectors (1952, with many later editions). Carter was a student of A.E. Housman's at Cambridge, and Housman inspired him to collect Catullus. Carter edited Housman's Collected Poems (1939 onward) and Selected Prose (1961). With John Sparrow, Carter also compiled an annotated hand-list of Housman's work, first published in 1941 and revised 1952.Alfred Edward Housman, 1859-1936, was a poet, classical scholar, and textual editor. The oldest of seven children, he was born in Worcestershire in 1859. He won a scholarship to Oxford, where he became friends with the bibliographer Alfred Pollard and with Moses Jackson, famously the object of Housman's unrequited love. Despite being a capable student, Housman failed his final examinations and had to return to Oxford for an additional semester, receiving a lower-level pass degree. In 1882, he took the civil service examination and worked as a clerk in the Patent Office in London while living with Moses Jackson and his younger brother Adalbert. He simultaneously worked in the evenings at the British Museum Library and began publishing well-respected papers of textual criticism on Greek and Latin authors, during which time he established his reputation as meticulous in his own scholarship and ruthless to other scholars whom he considered sloppy. In 1892, he applied to become the Latin Chair at University College, London. In 1896, he published at his own expense his first collection of poetry, Shropshire Lad, which became a popular success. In 1911, he received the Kennedy Professorship at Cambridge University and a fellowship at Trinity College. Between 1903 and 1930 Housman dedicated his considerable abilities in textual criticism to a five-volume critical edition of Manilius' Astronomicon. He published his second book of poems twenty-six years after the first, Last Poems (1922), at the age of 62. A third volume of poetry, edited by his brother, the writer Laurence Housman, was published posthumously in 1936. 
The Howard Shipyard and Dock Company is said to be the oldest continuous, at one time the largest, and in the post-Civil War period, the most famous shipyard of its kind on Western American rivers. The shipyard was founded by James Howard, who was born in Oldham, England, on September 1, 1814, and brought to Cincinnati, Ohio, by his parents in 1820. After serving an apprenticeship to William Hartshorn, steamboat builder of Cincinnati, Howard established his own yards at Jeffersonville, Indiana, in 1834. In 1836 he moved his yards to Madison, Indiana, were he remained until 1844. The depression of 1844 induced him to spend the years 1844-1845 as an engineer and ship carpenter on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. In 1846 he returned to the construction of steamboats locating his yards at Shippingsport, Kentucky. Soon he moved to Louisville, and from there in 1849 back to Jeffersonville, which became his permanent location. At this time he took his brother Daniel Howard in the firm. In 1865 his younger brother, John C. Howard, and his son, Edmonds John Howard, became his partners under the firm name, James Howard and Company. After the drowning of James Howard in 1876, his son and brother continued the business until the retirement of John C. Howard in 1888 left Edmonds John Howard in control. Under his presidency the business was expanded to include shipyards and marine ways at Cincinnati, Ohio, Madison and Jeffersonville, Indiana, Mound City, Illinois, and Paducah, Kentucky. In January 1919 Clyde Howard and James E. Howard succeeded their father in the shipbuilding business. James was vice-president and buyer and Clyde the secretary and treasurer. The chair of president remained vacant. Upon the retirement of Clyde, James became the principal owner and president of the company. From 1925 to 1941, Mrs. Loretta M. Howard, (Mrs. James E. Howard), was secretary and treasurer of the firm. In 1942, the US Navy bought the shipyard, which was renamed the Jeffersonville Boat & Machine Company, and tank landing ships (LSTs) and submarine chasers for World War II were built there. For the history of the firm, lists of boats constructed by it, and biographies of members of the Howard family see Lewis C. Baird's Baird's History of Clark County, Indiana.

Leases were obtained from the Colombian government for the mines of Santa Ana and La Manta. In October 1825 operations began on the mines, but soon the Governor of Honda became angry with the conduct of the miners, as proper care had not been taken in England to select sober, steady men.
William Henry Ireland, 1777-1835, was a forger whose forgeries primarily centered around Shakespearean documents and ephemera. He was born on August 2, 1775 in London to Samuel Ireland, a collector of Shakespeare plays, and Anna Maria de Burgh Coppinger. William Ireland created his first Shakespeare forgery in 1794: a fake document containing a fake signature of Shakespeare's. He gave this document to his father, much to Samuel Ireland's delight. After an expert confirmed Ireland's forgery as "genuine," he grew bolder. He would go on to forge many more documents relating to Shakespeare, including letters to Anne Hathaway and Queen Elizabeth supposedly in Shakespeare's hand, as well as "original" manuscripts for Hamlet and King Lear. His most daring move was to claim that he had discovered a manuscript of lost play of Shakespeare's: Vortigern and Rowena. When this play, which had actually been written by Ireland himself, was staged on April 2, 1796, it was met with catcalls and jeers from the audience after one of the actors, John Philip Kemble, repeated the line "and when this solemn mockery is o'er" to indicate that he suspected the play to be a fake. This incident, coupled with the publication of Edmond Malone's book An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments on March 31, 1796, exposed Ireland as a forger and all his documents as fakes. Ireland published an apology in 1805, but his reputation had been permanently ruined. He died on April 17, 1835 in London.

This manuscript appears to be a previously unrecorded copy of the second part of Zavaleta's Elementa universae philosophiae, a work which exists only in manuscript. The other parts and another copy of part 2 "Physical generalis" are all held in Buenos Aires. The second copy of part 2 (4o, 196 pages) is in the Biblioteca Nacional; part 3 (the "Physica particularis"; 4o, 175 pages) in the library of the Consejo Nacional de Educación; and part 4 (the "Metaphysica"; 4o, 456 unnumbered pages) in the Convent of Santo Domingo. No copy of a part 1 is attested.Each of the other manuscripts, save the second copy of the "Physica generalis," claims to be by someone who personally heard ("me audiente") the Elementa propounded by Zavaleta himself: part 2 by Tomás García de Zúñiga; part 3 by Juan Manuel Fernández de Agüero; and part 4 by Juan José Castañer [see: Bibliography of the philosophy in the Iberian colonies of America / Redmond, Walter Bernard (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1972) entries 820-822, pages 109-110.]Just as Part 2 bears the date August 3rd, 1795, part 3 is dated July 10th, 1796. Part 4 is undated. Copies of both title-pages and the drawing from the copy of part 2 (which matches that at the back of the Lilly's copy, albeit not exactly) may be found in El Deán de Buenos Aires Diego Estanislao de Zavaleta / Guiñazú, Enrique Ruiz (Buenos Aires: Ediciones Peuser, 1952). All copies seem to be in different hands. The part of the "Generalis physica" reproduced in Guiñazú which overlaps that of the Lilly copy reveals that the copies are not identical.There is a detailed overview of each of the works in: Nacimento y desarrollo de la filosofia en el Rio de la Plata 1536-1810 / Fulong, Guillermo (Buenos Aires: Guillermo Kraft, 1952) pages 364-370, who considers Zavaleta one of the three greatest Scholastics of late 18th century Argentina, along with Mariano Medrano and José Valentín Gómez. Guiñazú's summary of the work highlights what's probably most striking about it: "El texto de las lecciones de física que dictó el doctor Zavaleta en 1795, demuestra un verdadero esfuerzo de aplicación para difundir el conocimiento de las leyes de la naturaleza, siendo de admirar cómo tal enseñanza podÍa hacerse valedera sin el empleo del cálculo, sin la experimentación y con pocos instrumentos de gabinete. Sólo la autorizada palabra del maestro, su exposición intuitiva, de principios y aforismos, era el bagage depositado en la mente del alumnado ... pues afirma Gutiérrez que 'tenemos motivos para creer que el curso del Dr. Zavaleta fué redactado con mayor esmero y mayor copia de luces entre cuantos se dieron en el Colegio carolino, especialmente en la materia de que tratamos'" [Guiñazú, page 22; see also: Origen y desarrollo de la enseñanza pública superior en Buenos Aires (2nd ed.) / Gutierrez, Juan María (Buenos Aires: La Cultura Argentina, 1915), page 317].

Sir Compton Mackenzie, 1883-1972, was a writer, Scottish nationalist, and cultural commentator. He was born Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie on January 17, 1883 in West Hartlepool, County Durham, England. He attended St. Paul's School in London and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in modern history. One of his first early successes was his novel Carnival (1912), which was later adapted into a film three times as The Ballet Girl (1916), Dance Pretty Lady (1932) and Carnival (1946). His coming of age novel Satire Street (1913-1914) was known for its influence on other authors, such as George Orwell, who read it as children. From 1913 to 1920, Mackenzie and his wife Faith Compton Mackenzie lived on the island of Capri, where he befriended William Somerset Maugham and converted to Catholicism in 1914. As a result of his experiences on Capri, Mackenzie published a trilogy of books with religious themes and two novels, Vestal Fire (1927) and Extraordinary Women (1928), based on the lives of the islanders, many of whom were homosexual. After 1928, Mackenzie moved to Scotland where he co-founded the Scottish National Party and supported Scottish nationalism. He would go on to set two of his novels in Scotland: Monarch of the Glen (1941) and Whisky Galore (1947). Throughout the 1930s he held several positions, including rector of Glasgow University (1931–34), literary critic for the London Daily Mail (1931–35), and founder and editor of Gramophone magazine (1923–62).

Over the course of his career, Mackenzie published over a hundred books of different genres and subjects, including fiction, history, biography, literary criticism, satire, children's stories, and poetry. One of his last works was his autobiography, My Life and Times, published in ten volumes from 1963–1971. He was knighted in 1952 and died on November 30, 1972 in Edinburgh, Scotland.

She was born on May 3, 1879, the daughter of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, 1850-1937, president of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1935), and his wife Charlotte Garrigue. Alice's brother Jan Masaryk served as the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1940 to 1948. After graduating from high school in 1898, Alice enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague, one of very few women to do so. She later switched to the Faculty of Arts, furthered her studies in London, Berlin, and Leipzig, and received her Doctorate in 1903. She then traveled to the United States to study at the University of Chicago Social Settlement (UCSS), where she met Julia Lathrop, Mary McDowell and Jane Addams. After returning to Czechoslovakia in 1907, Masaryk worked as a teacher in Prague and České Budějovice until 1910. During World War I, she was arrested and accused of treason by the Austro-Hungarian Empire for failing to produce political papers belonging to her father, who had been advocating for Czechoslovak independence.

McClure would also use his magazine to promote the pedagogical theories of Maria Montessori after meeting her in 1910. After McClure's Magazine was met with a series of staff changes and financial difficulties, McClure turned to his own publishing pursuits. In 1914, he published My Autobiography, ghostwritten by Willa Cather who had worked as a managing editor at McClure's Magazine. During World War I he was concerned with matters of peace, joining Henry Ford aboard his "Peace Ship" in 1915 and publishing a book entitled Obstacles to Peace in 1917. From 1915 to 1917, McClure also became co-owner with Edward A. Rumely of The Evening Mail.

Robert Southey, 1774-1843, was an English poet whose work fell within the Romantic school. He was part of the "Lake Poets" group and was friends with poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Despite his vocal support for the French Revolution at the beginning of his career and his initial reputation as a radical, he served as poet laureate of the United Kingdom from 1813 to 1843 and was subsequently derided by his contemporaries for his support of the Tory establishment. His prolific output included poetry, reviews, and histories, but his poetic reputation rests on his "exotic" epic poems, including Thalaba the Destroyer (1801), Madoc (1805), The Curse of Kehama (1810), and Roderick the Last of the Goths (1814).Born the son of a Bristol linen draper, he was expelled from Westminster school for producing with his friends a satirical magazine, the Flagellant, in 1792, which included a critique of the school's system of corporal punishment. Afterwards he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford. In addition to Wat Tyler, a poem about the 1381 English peasant rebellion, and Joan of Arc, a poem in which the eponymous Joan of Arc defends France from English invaders, and in 1794 he coauthored with Samuel Taylor Coleridge the play The Fall of Robespierre. He and Coleridge also planned to set up a utopian "Pantisocracy" in Pennsylvania, a plan that never materialized due to lack of funds. Instead, in 1795, Southey married seamstress Edith Fricker and Coleridge married Fricker's sister Sara, and in 1800 the two couples settled at Greta Hall in the Lake District in Spain. Southey would remain there for the rest of his life as one of the "Lake Poets." Southey learned Spanish and Portuguese and began translating literature from these languages into English as well as writing Spanish and Portuguese literary biographies. The Peninsular War (1807-1814), during which the UK assisted Spain and Portugal against the invasion of Napoleon, turned Southey's sympathies toward the Tory establishment. He began writing for the conservative Quarterly Review, and in 1813, Southey accepted the post of poet laureate of the United Kingdom. For his political turn he was criticized by William Hazlitt and parodied ruthlessly by Lord Byron in The Vision of Judgment (1822).

Edwin Hardin Sutherland, 1883-1950, was a professor of sociology at Indiana University. He introduced the concept of "white collar crime" in his 1939 presidential address at the American Sociological Association annual meeting. This concept pushed back against prevailing theories of the causes of criminality and highlighted gaps in a criminal justice system more interested in the crimes of the lower classes. He expounded upon the idea in his 1949 monograph White Collar Crime, which was censored by the publisher who feared defamation lawsuits for calling certain corporations "criminal." Sutherland was born in Gibbon, Nebraska, on August 13, 1893. He received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1913 in sociology and political economy. He worked at William Jewell College (1913-1919), the University of Illinois (1919-1926), the University of Minnesota (1926-1929), and the University of Chicago (1930-1935).

Trevor Thomas, 1907-1993, was an art historian and former Director of the Leicester Museum and Art Gallery. He was also the last person to see poet Sylvia Plath alive. Thomas was born in Ynysddu, Gwent in 1907. He served as Curator and then Director of the Leicester Museum and Art Gallery from 1940-1946, during which time he was instrumental in building the museum's collection of German expressionist art. Like his colleague Sir Kenneth Clark at the National Gallery, Thomas organized educational and social programming at the museum to provide the public with entertainment and keep up morale in spite of the war. In 1944 he arranged "Mid-European Art," an exhibition of German expressionist art, strategically sponsored by the respected anti-Nazi Free German League of Culture. The artworks had been purchased from German emigres Tekla Hess, widow of Jewish shoe manufacturer and art collector Alfred Hess, and her son Hans, who fled Germany only to be detained by the British as an enemy alien and put to work as a farm laborer near Loughborough. Thomas arranged to have Hans Hess appointed as an Art Assistant at Leicester Museum for the exhibition; Hans would go on to become Keeper of Art at York City Art Gallery. However, in July 1946, Thomas was accused of public indecency (i.e., homosexuality) after a policeman witnessed him and another man "looking towards each other in a suspicious way" in a public lavatory. Despite receiving a character testimonial from Sir Kenneth Clark, who expected Thomas to succeed him as Director of the National Gallery, Thomas lost his career at the Leicester Museum and in the museum field more generally. Thomas would go on to work as Programme Specialist for Education through the Arts at UNESCO (1949-56) and as professor of art history at the State University of New York and the University of Buffalo, among other positions. In 1963, Thomas lived in the flat below Sylvia Plath's on Fitzroy Road in London. He was the last person to see her alive before she committed suicide. Thomas published a memoir about his time as Plath's neighbor, Sylvia Plath: Last Encounters (1989). He was subsequently sued for libel by Plath's widower, British poet laureate Ted Hughes, for asserting that Hughes attended a "high-spirited and boisterous party" the day of Plath's funeral. The suit was withdrawn after Thomas apologized for the assertion and agreed to destroy copies of his book.

The New Jerusalem Church in Peoria, Illinois was one branch of the New Church, a religious movement based on the writings of Swedish Lutheran theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, 1688-1772. The General Conference of the New Church was established in England in 1789, and the US church was organized in 1817 in Philadelphia, where it was known as the General Convention of the New Church or the Swedenborgian Church of North America. The denomination was spread west in the United States by missionaries like John Chapman, 1774-1845, better known as Johnny Appleseed. In 1890, due to doctrinal differences, the General Church of the New Jerusalem split from the General Convention of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem Church in Peoria was established on Jefferson Street in 1846 under the leadership of Reverend John Randolph Hibbard. In 1855, the church moved buildings to Hamilton Street. In 1896 the building was condemned by the city inspector and the furnishings sold to the Presbyterian Church at Pottstown.

She married Gyula Heller, an engineer, in 1906. They had six children, living a comfortable life in Hungary until 1922. Then her husband's illness and unexpected social and economic upheavals left her at age forty, a single mother of six trying to survive. In 1940, one of her sons was able to bring her to the United States where she lived in various locations including Alabama and Ohio. She died three months short of her one hundredth birthday on May 7, 1986. J. Benjamin Horvay, born 1919, author, was the son of Rózsi Horvay.

Professor Gest was born in London, England and emigrated with his family to the US when he was one year old. During undergraduate studies at UCLA (B.A., 1942) he spent two summers assisting Max Delbruck and Salvador Luria doing research on bacterial viruses at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (New York). In 1942, Gest began graduate work with Delbruck at Vanderbilt University, but World War II interrupted his studies. He accepted a position on the Manhattan Atomic Bomb Project with the eminent physical chemist Charles Coryell. Their research focuses on characterization of the radioactive elements formed in uranium fission. After World War II ended, Gest completed graduate work (Ph.D. 1949) at Washington University (St. Louis) as the first student of Martin Kamen, a pioneer nuclear chemist renowned as the co-discoverer of carbon 14. During this period, Gest also did research with Alfred Hershey on the fate of radioactive phosphorus during the multiplication of bacterial viruses. The latter culminated in the discovery of "P-32 suicide" of bacteriophage. Prior to 1950, Gest had worked with Delbruck, Luria and Hershey, who shared a Nobel Prize in 1969. Gest has been on the faculties of Case Western Reserve University and Washington University. He has been a visiting researcher at the California Institute of Technology, Dartmouth Medical School, Stanford University, Oxford University, Tokyo University, and UCLA. Professor Gest has been a Guggenheim Fellow twice and has served on a number of advisory committees of the US Government. He is widely recognized for his research on microbial physiology and metabolism, especially with photosynthetic bacteria. Gest is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society for Microbiology, American Academy of Microbiology, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
Richard E. Vasquez, 1928-1990, was a Chicano author and journalist.
Vasquez's novel Chicano (Doubleday, 1970) was the first novel about Mexican-Americans released by a major publisher, and it helped establish him as a significant figure on the Chicano literary scene. That same year he began to write regularly for the Los Angeles Times, covering Chicano affairs and human rights issues. Vasquez, who dropped out of high-school to fight in WWII, returned home to work in construction, then began driving a taxi full time. His first stories were human interest newspaper columns based on his experiences as a cabbie. Beginning in 1960, he worked on Chicano for ten years. In spite of his initial success, his subsequent career was marked by struggle and rejection as the notion of "Chicano writing" became increasingly radicalized. Nevertheless, his novel is now considered a classic in the field, and it was reissued in 2005 as a Harper Perennial. In addition to Chicano, he published two other novels, The Giant Killer (1978) and Another Land (1982). 
Barry Allen was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, in December 1943. Despite initial aspirations of being a newspaper photojournalist, Kevin Brownlow's The Parade's Gone By and working with a large library of classic films at Channel 8 shifted Allen's career interests to the programming and ultimately the preservation of moving images. In 1967, he started working as an editor for WISH-TV in Indianapolis, where he edited on 16mm all movies that would be broadcast. In subsequent years, he transitioned to booking and programming repertory and commercial films for Heaston Theatres in Indianapolis. In 1999, he was assigned the role of film preservationist for the Republic Pictures library, a subsidiary holding of Paramount & Viacom. In the mid 2000s, he became the Executive Director of Film Preservation and Archival Resources at Paramount Pictures. In 2005, Allen was awarded the Anthology Film Archives Honor for his work to preserve the Republic Pictures library. Allen retired from Paramount Pictures in 2010.

Jackson was born on February 11, 1895, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, the daughter of George L. Weymouth, 1865-1950, and Martha Stuart (Connell) Weymouth, 1865-l932. In 1897 the family moved to Richill, Missouri, where her father had a printing shop and a daily paper of his own. She graduated from Lake View High School and spent two years at Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Michigan in 1900. Her father became the editor of Farm Life and moved his family to Spencer, Indiana, where Jackson did editorial work for her father for a year, then took a position as secretary to the Dean of Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In 1917 she went to Boston to find war-related work, but eventually moved to Chicago to become associate editor of Better Farming. There she met Charles Carter Jackson, l892-l969, and was married on January 10, 1920. That Spring the family settled on a farm in Canada. Her daughter Martha Florence was born on October 7, 1920, and Elizabeth Ann was born on August 6, 1922, but, because of an injury her husband received in the war, farming was impossible and the winters were so severe that they came home again to Spencer, Indiana, where their son Charles Weymouth was born on April 1, 1924. Jackson began writing short articles and poems for farm papers, and in November 1923 the first Katherine stories appeared in Farm Life which ran until December 1925. She wrote novels, short stories, and articles for magazines such as American Magazine, Country Gentleman, Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, and The Saturday Evening Post. The Jacksons lived for a while in Indianapolis in order to give her children better educational advantages, but returned to Spencer, Indiana, where her husband published a magazine and they had a gift shop. Jackson died on April 4, 1974. 
A parody (also called a spoof, send-up, take-off, or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of satiric or ironic imitation. This collection includes literary parodies of works by authors including Thomas Moore, Rudyard Kipling, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Allan Poe, Alfred Tennyson and William Shakespeare. No attempt has been made to research or verify name forms, titles, or authorship for this preliminary listing. 
A press kit is a pre-packaged set of promotional materials that provide information about a person, company, organization or cause and which is distributed to members of the media for promotional use.

Salesmen's dummies (also called Salesmen's samples) are smaller representations of the finished book, containing example pages of the text and any illustrations, enclosed in a cover like the binding, plus the dust-jacket (if any). The samples were easily portable by a publisher's commercial traveller, who used it to encourage booksellers to order the book. 
The Ngũgĩ mss. (ca. 1950s-2014) consist of the papers of Kenyan author, playwright, essayist, educator, and activist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. Born in Limuru, Kenya, on January 5, 1938, Ngũgĩ was raised a Christian and attended Church of Scotland Mission school at Kamaandura. Eventually he attended a Gĩkũyũ independent school, and later Alliance High School. He went on to attend Makerere University College, Kampala, Uganda, and the University of Leeds, Britain. Both British colonialism (which ended in 1963) and the Mau Mau Rebellion had a profound impact on him, and each is reflected in his non-fiction writings and creative works. Ngũgĩ burst onto the theatrical and literary scenes with his acclaimed debut play, The Black Hermit (1963), and his successful first novel, Weep Not, Child (1964). He cemented his reputation with a pair of subsequent novels: The River Between (1965) and A Grain of Wheat (1967). Years later, he caused a stir with The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976) a stage production about the Mau Mau Rebellion. Ngũgĩ's novel Petals of Blood and play Ngaahika Ndeenda (aka I Will Marry When I Want), both 1977, were openly critical of life in neo-colonial Kenya and precipitated his imprisonment from December 31, 1977 to December 12, 1978. (He never was formally charged with a crime.) Ngũgĩ found employment difficult following his release and eventually fled into exile in 1982. That same year he published Detained: A Writer's Prison Diary, an account of his incarceration, and Devil on the Cross, which he surreptitiously wrote in on a roll of toilet paper in his native Gĩkũyũ (the first modern novel in that language) while imprisoned. His later works include two novels, Matigari (1989) and The Wizard of the Crow (2006), and two memoirs, Dreams in a Time of War and In the House of the Interpreter (2012). He has taught and lectured at several universities in the United Kingdom and United States, most recently at the University of California, Irvine, and has received numerous honorary doctorates and literary awards. 
Lyle G. Adair, 1843-1918, was the nephew of abolitionist Rev. Samuel Lyle Adair. He grew up in Indiana and Ohio. He enlisted with the 81st Ohio Infantry as a priate in September 1861. His regiment served in Tennessee and Alabama and was heavily engaged at Shiloh. In January 1864 he joined the 3rd Alabama Infantry, an all Black Union regiment, as orderly sergeant. The 3rd Alabama Infantry was one of the first two Black regiments recruited in middle Tennessee. Stationed at Fort Pulaski, the 3rd Alabama was charged with guarding critical rail lines between Tennessee and Alabama. In June 1864, the regiment changed its name to the 111th United States Colored Infantry, which served until April 1866. Lyle G. Adair died 28 Nov 1918 in Terre Haute at the age of 73. 
Roger Allen, 1942- , obtained a Phd from Oxford University in modern Arabic literature, the first student ever to do so. He served as a Professor of Arabic, Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Pennsylvania until his retirement in 2011. He retired from the University of Pennsylvania in 2011. He has authored and translated numberous books and articles on modern Arabic fiction, novels, and stories. His is perhaps best known for his The Arabic Literary Heritage: The Development of Its Genres and Criticism (Cambridge University Press, 1998). Between 1973 and 2010, Allen translated six works by Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz into English, including Mirrors in 1999 with American University in Cairo Press. Mahfouz won the Nobel prize in Literature in 1988. 
Charles Ralph Boxer was born on March 8, 1904, in Sandown, Isle of Wight, England, to Hugh Edward Richard Boxer and Jane Patterson. He attended Wellington College from 1918 to 1921 and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from 1922 to 1923. In 1924, Boxer began his military service by joining the Lincolnshire Regiment. From 1930 to 1933, he was seconded to a regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army, an experience that stimulated his scholarly interest in East Asian cultures and history and impacted his later academic career. Before the start of World War II, Boxer made his mark in academic circles by publishing over eighty scholarly works. On June 8, 1939, he married Ursula Norah Anstice Tulloch (1909-1996), and Boxer was stationed in Hong Kong from 1939 to 1941 to serve as chief of army intelligence. While in Hong Kong, Boxer fell in love with the American feminist writer Emily (Mickey) Hahn (1905-1997). In December 1941, the Japanese invaded Hong Kong and took Boxer as a prisoner of war until the conclusion of World War II. The Japanese military also confiscated his prized rare book collection and transferred it to the Imperial Library; Boxer later recovered most of his library. In 1945, Boxer divorced Tulloch as a result of his widely publicized love affair, and he married Hahn in New York on November 28. Boxer retired from the army at the rank of major in 1947 and moved his family to the family estate in Broadmayne, Dorset, England. Shortly after the end of his military career, Boxer was offered the Camoens chair of Portuguese in King's College London, which he accepted and held until his retirement from King's College in 1967, excepting a three-year period (1951-1953) when Boxer was professor of history of the Far East in the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. In 1955, Boxer moved to Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, England, which remained his permanent place of residence until his death. From 1967 to 1972, Boxer was simultaneously a research professor at Indiana University and professor of the history of the expansion of Europe at Yale University. In 1972, he retired from Yale as professor emeritus and continued to teach at Indiana University for seven more years. His initial research interests concerned early contact between Europeans, particularly the Dutch, the Portuguese, and Jesuit missionaries, and Japan, but Boxer later expanded his field of study to international history more broadly. He was a prolific writer and scholar, authoring about 350 books and articles. Boxer received many honors for his work, including election to the British Academy in 1957 and various honorary degrees and fellowships. King's College, London's Charles Boxer chair of history was established in his honor. Boxer passed away on April 27, 2000, in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England, at the age of 96.

He graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Vienna and the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He spent two years, from 1906-1908, in the United States designing movie posters and working in advertising. Upon his return to Europe, he was imprisoned for evading military service. Czechs were at that time a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and thus in 1914 he was sent to the Russian front in World War I to fight for Austria-Hungary. In October 1915 he was captured and joined the Czech Legion, a unit of Czech prisoners of war fighting for Russia as part of a bargain in which Russia promised Czech independence if they were victorious against the Austro-Hungarian empire.

Percy Muir was associated with the antiquarian bookselling firm, Elkin Mathews, Ltd. from 1930 until his death in 1979. Founded in 1885 by Charles Elkin Mathews, the business began in the Cathedral Close at Exeter but moved to London in 1887 when Elkin Mathews and John Lane went into partnership. Within a very few years publishing became the principle interest of the firm, now Elkin Mathews and John Lane Ltd., with retail sales of books, old and new, taking a secondary place. The two men parted company in 1894 and Mathews, although continuing to publish, returned to a greater concentration on bookselling. He died in 1922. A.W. Evans, ex–curate, ex–journalist, and himself a collector and customer of Elkin Mathews, acquired the business as a going concern from Mathews' widow. Percy Muir joined the firm, as a partner, in January 1930, becoming managing director in 1939. It was under his stewardship that the firm moved from London during the German blitz to Blakeney, Norfolk. Percy Muir was president of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association in Britain from 1945-1947, and chaired the first conference of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) in 1947. He became president of the ILAB from 1950-1952 and was subsequently elected the first Life President of Honor. The author of several bibliographies and books on book collecting, as well as an autobiography: Minding My Own Business (Chatto & Windus, 1956), he also made frequent contributions to Colophon, Library, and various bibliographical journals such as Bookman's Journal.

Carl Wilson, a.k.a. Tramp Starr, was born in Clark's Hill, Indiana in 1885, the son of a Methodist minister. He lived much of his life in Moores Hill, Indiana, but did venture west in his youth to try his hand at horsemanship and become a cowhand. Upon returning to Indiana, he met and married 15 year-old Marjorie Mitchell of Worthington. Wilson began writing under the name "Tramp Starr" and started publishing poems in the mid- to late-1920s, extolling the virtues of farming and rural living in Indiana. He was occasionally featured in The Indianapolis Star and was a regular contributor to Farm Life magazine, published in Spencer, Indiana. His column, called variously "Chimes and Chuckles from Curly Shingles" or "Jokes and Jingles from Curly Shingles" after his farm, was very popular with readers who appreciated his embrace of the joys of farming, the outdoors, and traditional homespun values. In 1930, Wilson began reading his poems on the R.F.D. Radio Hour, which was broadcast on station WLW out of Cincinnati, Ohio. Listener response was exceedingly positive and Wilson received fan letters from as far away as West Virginia and Montana. However, in early 1931, Wilson and his poems were taken out of the format of the show. Wilson did continue to write and publish his poems after this point. In addition to his first book, My Indiana Farm, published around 1930, Wilson went on to write and publish Radio Rhymes (1933) and Pop. 359 (1941). He continued his contributions to The Indianapolis Star and various other periodicals and also earned money by speaking publicly around the state at conferences and meetings. Wilson and his wife moved to Nashville, Indiana, in scenic Brown County, around 1944 and ran an inn. He continued to write and publish until June of 1946, when he died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 60. At the time of his death, Wilson was survived by his wife, four daughters, a son, and several grandchildren. Often called "The Hoosier Poet," Wilson rejected this title whenever he could, as he felt this honor should be reserved for his forerunner and successful poet, James Whitcomb Riley. Despite his humility concerning his reputation, Wilson was proud of his contribution to the Hoosier state and the fact that every poem he had ever written had been published. 
William James Swan, 1896-1978, was born to William E. and Augusta Juniata Swan in Gas City, Indiana. Swan served during World War I as Sgt. 1/CL, QMC in the 38th division. After the war, Swan married Jessie Walton Gallaher and worked at Smokeless Fuel Co. in Charleston, West Virginia.

Born on October 26, 1927 to German publisher Johannes Asmus, Marion Boyars spent her childhood in New York and Switzerland, going on to earn a degree in politics, philosophy, and economics from Keele University at a time when few women attended British universities (McNamara, 1997). Boyars (then Marion Asmus) married clothing manufacturer George Lobbenberg and had two daughters, Susan and Catheryn. Through an ad in The Bookseller shown to her by her financial advisor in 1960, Boyars bought a 50% stake – allegedly funded by the alimony of her divorce from Lobbenberg – in independent publisher John Calder's firm Calder Publishers. Boyars claims that her interest in publishing was due to a desire for "a career that was intellectually stimulating and demanding" as well as to "give voice to exciting new ideas" (McNamara, 1997). It was through this firm, which became Calder and Boyars Ltd. in 1964, that she met her second husband, translator and poet Arthur Boyars. The firm specialized in translated fiction, the writings of modern composers, social sciences, film studies, and controversial literature, notably including the works of Hubert Selby Jr. and Henry Miller. Due to insurmountable differences, Calder and Boyars began to dissolve the firm in 1975, dividing their published authors between them over the next five years while forming Calder Publishers and Marion Boyars Publishers, respectively. As "the first woman in the United Kingdom to become a publisher in her own right – not through marriage or inheritance" as well as the "first woman British publisher to establish an American firm" (Reuter, 1978), Boyars continued to favor experimental fiction and politically radical non-fiction as Marion Boyars Publishers. According to Boyars, she "mainly broke the rules because she didn't know them" (McNamara, 1997), though she also firmly believed that obscenity and taboos were "necessary subjects" (McNamara, 1997). Though other publishers and authors' agents found her to be "slightly eccentric, publishing books no one else wants" (McNamara, 1997), they also noted her success at selecting and promoting authors and their works, often trying to steal authors from Boyars after she had discovered them. With roughly 20-25 books published annually, Marion Boyars Publishers published six authors who went on to win Nobel Prizes and was often the first publisher to bring international authors to English audiences. Boyars's conviction regarding the importance of publishing avant-garde and challenging subject matter also led her to publish a not-insignificant number of queer authors and stories; in 1976, Boyars was involved in challenging the obscenity and blasphemy charges of James Kirkup's poem "The Love that Dares to Speak its Name" as well as the magazine in which it was published, Gay Times. After Boyars's death in 1999, her daughter Catheryn Kilgariff continued to run the firm. Cited Sources Reuter, Madalynne. (1978, October 2). "London publisher launches U.S. firm.".

He subsequently moved to New York City and did postgraduate work at NYU (1948-1950). During the first decade of his career, Hughes worked as an assistant editor and critic at Musical America (1950-1953), a free-lance writer in Paris (1953-1955), a music critic at The New York Herald Tribune (1955-1960), and a music instructor at Brooklyn College (1958-1960). In 1960, he started working at The New York Times, where he was a dance critic (1961-1964) and a music critic (1960-1961, 1965-1986). On 28 March 1964, Hughes married Marian "Nina" Berklich, who graduated from Wayne State University and worked as an interior designer and a theater make-up artist. Although Hughes retired in 1986, he continued writing about dance for The New York Times and wrote a column for Chamber Music from 1998 to 2002. In 2003, he and his wife moved to Sarasota, Florida. Hughes died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 16 November 2009. 
David K. Frasier is a retired reference librarian and author/editor of Suicide in the Entertainment Industry, Murder Cases of the Twentieth Century, Russ Meyer: The Life and Films, and Show Business Homicides. Frasier gained an interest as a teen in show-business and entertainment crime from filmmaker and author Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon, which he describes as "the very first tale of Hollywood sexcess, murder, suicide, and failed dreams." Frasier has since maintained a nearly 40-year friendship and correspondence with Anger. Around the same time, Frasier saw a double billing of Good Morning...and Goodbye! and Common-Law Cabin by Russ Meyer, a director known for his campy sexploitation films featuring large-breasted women. This discovery led Frasier to write a biography/bibliography/filmography of Russ Meyer and his works, sparking a decades-long friendship and leading to Frasier's editorial work on Meyer's autobiography, A Clean Breast. As Head of Technical Services at the Kinsey Institute, Frasier contacted serial killer John Wayne Gacy in prison to acquire his artwork for the Kinsey's collections. This led to several years of correspondence between Frasier and Gacy (and at least one visit) until Gacy's execution. More information on Frasier's complicated correspondence and acquaintance with Gacy can be found in his essay "Murder is My Beat," located in the John Wayne Gacy series of this collection.

"Kock, Charles Paul de (1793-1871), French novelist, was born at Passy on the 21st of May 1793. He was a posthumous child, his father, a banker of Dutch extraction, having been a victim of the Terror. Paul de Kock began life as a banker's clerk. For the most part he resided on the Boulevard St Martin, and was one of the most inveterate of Parisians. He died in Paris on the 27th of April 1871. He began to write for the stage very early, and composed many operatic libretti. His first novel, L'Enfant de ma Femme (1811), was published at his own expense. In 1820 he began his long and sucessful series of novels dealing with Parisian life with Georgette, ou La Mere de Tabellion. His period of greatest and most successful activity was the Restoration and the early days of Louis Philippe. He was relatively less popular in France itself than abroad, where he was considered as the special painter of life in Paris. Major Pendenis's remark that he had read nothing of the novel kind for thirty years except Paul de Kock, who certainly made him laugh, is likely to remain one of the most durable of his testimonials, and may be classed with the legendary question of a foreign sovereign to a Frenchman who was paying his respects, "Vous venez de Paris et vous deves savoir des nouvelles. Comment se porte Paul de Kock?" The disappearance of the grisette and of the cheap dissipation described by Henri Murger practically made Paul de Kock obsolete. But to the student of manners his portraiture of low and middle class life in the first half of the 19th century at Paris still has its value." - 11th Edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica [1911]"[Kock was] the prolific and immensely popular author of rollicking, risky, and more often frankly coarse frequently sentimental, and fundamentally good-natured novels. Written with an untiring comic vigour which made up for their complete lack of style, they were good pictures of the life and amusements of the people of Paris and the country c. 1825-45. They were read and enjoyed in England (by Macaulay and Elizabeth Barrett Browning among others..." - Harvey & Heseltine, Oxford Companion to French Literature 
Carleton Beals, 1893-1979, was a leftist journalist and historian from the United States.

Eric Partridge (1894-1979) was born February 6, 1894, in Poverty Bay, New Zealand, son of John Thomas (a farmer) and Ethel Annabella (Norris) Partridge. In 1907, the family moved to Brisbane, Australia where Partridge passed his school years graduating from the University of Queensland in 1921, after studying Classics, French and English. He received his B.Litt. (with first class honors) from Oxford University in 1923. Serving in the Australian infantry during World War I, he lived through the horror of the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. In 1925, Partridge married Agnes Dora Vye–Parmenter with whom he had one daughter, Rosemary Ethel Honeywood Mann. After teaching for two years as a university lecturer in Manchester and London, Partridge gave up a promising academic career to found the small London publishing house, Scholartis. The press was moderately successful until the Great Depression, when he was forced to take on work as a free–lance writer. He often commented that the Depression allowed him to discover his real love and talent for writing books. Partridge wrote over forty books on the English language, including well–known works on etymology, slang, jargon, and clichés. He died on June 1, 1979 in Devon, England. 
Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) was an American journalist from Louisville, Kentucky. Credited as the founder of "Gonzo journalism," his writing is characterized by a high-energy, first-person narrative style that disregards traditional journalistic objectivity and blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction. This collection includes material from Thompson's early career, after he had been honorably discharged from the Air Force and fired from the Middletown (New York) Daily Record, when he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico to work for the magazine El Sportivo, a job which quickly fell through. Afterwards, he bounced between short-lived journalism gigs and odd jobs in the Caribbean, the United States, and South America. The turning point in Thompson's career came in 1965, when The Nation hired him to write about Hell's Angels; the material was published as a book, Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga, in 1966. His style reached its apotheosis with his 1971 novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which was serialized in Rolling Stone under the byline Raoul Duke, with illustrations by Ralph Steadman. Blending fiction and autobiography, the book is a lurid and hallucinogenic narrative of illicit drug use and a meditation on the failures of 1960s counterculture and the death of the American Dream. Thompson's literary output dwindled in the mid-1970s due to the pressures of celebrity and his heavy drinking and drug use, though by that time he had already achieved cult status for his colorful journalistic persona. He died by suicide in 2005.

Over the course of his prolific scholarly career, anthropologist Svend Einar Holsoe has greatly advanced our knowledge and understanding of the history and culture of the peoples of Liberia. During his youth, Holsoe's family lived in Liberia for nine years. His interest in a close study of this country and its peoples began during his senior year in high school. Asked to write an essay on his hometown for his senior English course, Holsoe chose Monrovia, only to discover the dearth of material on the nation and its people. It was at this moment, he says, that he dedicated himself to finding and collecting printed materials on Liberia. Unparalleled in his dedication to the preservation of documents and artifacts on Liberia, in 1997 Holsoe donated his collection of materials to Indiana University's Archives of Traditional Music, Liberian Collections Project, Mathers Museum, and Art Museum. A product of his years of research and relentless materials collection, The Svend E. Holsoe Collection is one of the largest and most comprehensive deposits of resources on the West African nation. The Collection includes: copies of Liberian Government Archive Documents between 1824-1983 ; extensive genealogical records, including analyses and family trees developed from these records; political, institutional, social and cultural surveys from the 1980s Liberia Rural Radio Project; field notes and oral history tapes of Vai and Bandi research; Vai script materials, including research notes, examples and articles; and slides and photos spanning decades and covering many geographical areas and activities. Due to looting and the destruction of Liberia's National Archives during the civil war that began in 1989, the Liberian Government Archives, part of the Holsoe Collection, contains the only extant copies of important historical and cultural documents. During his career, Holsoe published numerous important scholarly contributions on Liberia. As early as 1966, Holsoe's article, "The Condo Confederation in Western Liberia," was published in the Liberian Historical Review. Over the next thirty years, Holsoe wrote twenty-seven articles related to Liberia for numerous publications. Holsoe and D. Elwood Dunn collaborated on the first edition of The Historical Dictionary of Liberia (1984). He followed up this major project as a co-author of A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian Folk Architecture (1988). More recently, he co-edited African American Exploration in West Africa (2003). A co-founder of the Liberian Studies Association, Holsoe created and edited the Liberian Studies Journal from 1968 to 1978, as well as a Liberian Studies Monograph Series. In 1999, Indiana University awarded Holsoe the Chancellors' Medallion in honor of his unique contributions to scholarship. In presenting the honor, Chancellor Kenneth Gros Louis said of Holsoe: "We know, thanks to his collecting and preserving, thanks to his selfless donation to a public university which will make his work available to all in what we hope will be perpetuity, that Svend Holsoe has done more than his part to ensure that much of what constitutes the country and the cultures of Liberia will remain, and that we, as stewards of his materials, will harvest richly from his efforts." Indeed, Holsoe's scholarly legacy and invaluable collection will long remain an indispensable source of information and inspiration to future scholars of Liberia. 
Over the course of his prolific scholarly career, anthropologist Svend Einar Holsoe has greatly advanced our knowledge and understanding of the history and culture of the peoples of Liberia. During his youth, Holsoe's family lived in Liberia for nine years. His interest in a close study of this country and its peoples began during his senior year in high school. Asked to write an essay on his hometown for his senior English course, Holsoe chose Monrovia, only to discover the dearth of material on the nation and its people. It was at this moment, he says, that he dedicated himself to finding and collecting printed materials on Liberia. Unparalleled in his dedication to the preservation of documents and artifacts on Liberia, in 1997 Holsoe donated his collection of materials to Indiana University's Archives of Traditional Music, Liberian Collections Project, Mathers Museum, and Art Museum. A product of his years of research and relentless materials collection, The Svend E. Holsoe Collection is one of the largest and most comprehensive deposits of resources on the West African nation. The Collection includes: copies of Liberian Government Archive Documents between 1824-1983 ; extensive genealogical records, including analyses and family trees developed from these records; political, institutional, social and cultural surveys from the 1980s Liberia Rural Radio Project; field notes and oral history tapes of Vai and Bandi research; Vai script materials, including research notes, examples and articles; and slides and photos spanning decades and covering many geographical areas and activities. Due to looting and the destruction of Liberia's National Archives during the civil war that began in 1989, the Liberian Government Archives, part of the Holsoe Collection, contains the only extant copies of important historical and cultural documents. During his career, Holsoe published numerous important scholarly contributions on Liberia. As early as 1966, Holsoe's article, "The Condo Confederation in Western Liberia," was published in the Liberian Historical Review. Over the next thirty years, Holsoe wrote twenty-seven articles related to Liberia for numerous publications. Holsoe and D. Elwood Dunn collaborated on the first edition of The Historical Dictionary of Liberia (1984). He followed up this major project as a co-author of A Land and Life Remembered: Americo-Liberian Folk Architecture (1988). More recently, he co-edited African American Exploration in West Africa (2003). A co-founder of the Liberian Studies Association, Holsoe created and edited the Liberian Studies Journal from 1968 to 1978, as well as a Liberian Studies Monograph Series. In 1999, Indiana University awarded Holsoe the Chancellors' Medallion in honor of his unique contributions to scholarship. In presenting the honor, Chancellor Kenneth Gros Louis said of Holsoe: "We know, thanks to his collecting and preserving, thanks to his selfless donation to a public university which will make his work available to all in what we hope will be perpetuity, that Svend Holsoe has done more than his part to ensure that much of what constitutes the country and the cultures of Liberia will remain, and that we, as stewards of his materials, will harvest richly from his efforts." Indeed, Holsoe's scholarly legacy and invaluable collection will long remain an indispensable source of information and inspiration to future scholars of Liberia.

The Rev. Dr. Gay served as an Episcopal missionary with his wife, The Rev. Dr. Judy Gay, in Liberia from 1958-1974. Gay and his wife continued their missionary work in Lesotho until he took an early retirement in 2001. In Lesotho he worked with the Sechaba Consultants on social and economic analysis, as well as various agricultural projects. Gay began his missionary work in Africa at Cuttington College (now Cuttington University) located in Suacoco, Liberia, serving periodically from 1958-1965, 1966-1968, and 1970-1973. For those years he was Chairperson of the Social Science division and also Dean of Instruction from 1958-1960. Along with teaching, Gay also supervised student research projects, worked within the community, and conducted his own research. During a few of his years away from Cuttington, Gay had fellowships at Stanford University, 1965-1966, and Cambridge University, 1975-1976, and again in 1986. Gay took that time to study how new ideas in theology and social and economic development relate, as well as write up his research from in Liberia. Gay later taught sociology and African studies at the National University of Lesotho. For two of those years Gay taught as a Fulbright Lecturer. He also voluntarily taught at the Anglican theological seminaries in Lesotho and South Africa. After retirement, Gay became involved with the Episcopal Divinity School and Boston University, organizing seminary tours in Africa and administering contextual theology consultation at the Episcopal Divinity School. Gay continues his support in current research done at Sechaba Consultants in Cambridge and in several visits completed from 2002-2005 to Lesotho, South Africa and Namibia. Because of his expertise, he now serves on the Advisory Committee of the International Institute for Justice and Development (IIJD).

Mellonee V. Burnim received a Ph.D. in Folklore and Ethnomusicology from Indiana University in 1980; the title of her dissertation is "The Black Gospel Music Tradition: Symbol of Ethnicity." She joined the faculty of the IU African American Studies Department in 1980 and served as chair of the department from 1991-1994. She is currently a professor in the IU Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology and the director of the Archives of African American Music and Culture at Indiana University. She has previously served as director of IU's Ethnomusicology Institute. Burnim's primary areas of study include Black religious music and aesthetics, and music in the African Diaspora. She has led workshops in the history, performance, and instruction of African American religious music and has been a music consultant for various educational projects and documentaries. She has served as the Minister of Music for the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) and Fairview United Methodist churches in Bloomington. She also leads community choruses in the Bloomington area for special events. Burnim's numerous publications and presentations have analyzed the aesthetics, cultural significance, and theological functions of gospel music. Her written works have become essential reading for those studying African American music. Her numerous articles can be found in journals and reference works including Ethnomusicology, The Western Journal of Black Studies, and The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Most recently, she and Portia Maultsby co-edited the second edition of their seminal work African American Music: An Introduction, which has been used as a key text on the subject in classrooms across the nation. 
Willie Amzie Whitten, Jr., was born on August 14, 1929, in a small rural community in Choctaw County, Mississippi. His formal education began at Weir High School, from which he graduated in 1946. He attended Mississippi College during the 1946-1947 academic year and served in the United States Army in 1947. Whitten married Anna Lucille Stinnett from Addison, Kentucky, on June 6, 1948. They enrolled in Mississippi College together in September, 1948, and graduated in June, 1951. Thereafter, Willie attended the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky and received a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1954. From 1956 to 1963, Whitten served as associate director of the Seminary Extension Department of the Southern Baptist Convention. His main duties were establishing and operating adult religious education learning centers in Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana and Texas. Other duties included curriculum development and the preparation of course-writing guides. Whitten began a doctoral program in adult education at Indiana University in 1959. In 1963, while completing his graduate studies, Whitten accepted an assignment to Liberia with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to conduct research that would address the urgent educational needs of people living in traditional communities in rural Liberia. The goal of his research was to discover ways for educational leaders and other visitors to improve the use of town meetings for educational purposes. He found the research to be valuable not only in Liberia at the time, but in similar circumstances in other developing nations in the years that followed. His four-year assignment in Liberia provided a rare opportunity for Whitten and changed the direction of his dissertation research and his professional career. He graduated with a doctorate in education in 1966. During the early stages of his research, Whitten began an informal collection of rice farming tools, musical instruments, small furniture and other artifacts and items that were in use by the traditional peoples with whom he worked. Priority was given to items commonly recognized, accepted and in actual use at the time. These items would form part of the W.A. Whitten Collection, which he donated to the Indiana University Liberian Collections in 2009. Whitten received career status in the Foreign Service in 1965 while on assignment in Liberia, and was later commissioned as a Foreign Service Officer. During his career of nearly twenty-five years, he achieved the personal rank of FS-1 before retiring in 1987. Whitten had two assignments at USAID Washington and four separate assignments to foreign posts. The first was to Liberia, as described above. This was followed by two years in Tanzania from 1968 to 1970, two years in Afghanistan from 1970 to 1972 and a second assignment to Liberia for over three years from 1977 to 1981. Additionally, he was given numerous short-term assignments overseas to Anglophone countries in Africa and parts of Asia. This variety of overseas experiences brought the Whittens in close personal and professional relationships with many foreign leaders and local citizens. Occasionally, Whitten's work led to contacts with senior government officials and, in some instances, heads of state. However, the typical experience was with local government ministries, donor agencies of other governments, and private organizations, in the design and implementation of joint project undertakings involving USAID funding. Whitten welcomed cross-cultural exchanges throughout his career, and focused in particular on advocating and testing new educational technologies and approaches for their use in local communities. Whitten is currently busy in retirement in the Atlanta, Georgia area. He remains active in the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) and returns to the Department of State for Foreign Affairs Day in early May of each year. From 1991 to 2002, he served as State Chaplain of the Georgia Good Sams, a national association of campers. Willie and Lucille Whitten continue to be active in the Johns Creek Baptist Church and other community organizations.

William C. Siegmann (1943-2011) was a leading expert on the arts of Liberia and Sierra Leone and was particularly associated with West African masking traditions and performance. His interest was not only in their aesthetics, but in understanding the cultural meanings and context of these arts, including their relationship with cosmology, music and dance. During his career, Siegmann served as a curator at the Africana and National Museums in Liberia, Museum of the Society of African Missions African Art (NJ), Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, and the Brooklyn Museum. He wrote and lectured extensively on the art of masquerades in Liberia and Sierra Leone, as well as on issues in museology, collecting, interpretation and connoisseurship. Siegmann shared his skills in collections development broadly, conducting frequent seminars on museum management and curatorial training in Europe, Africa, and South America. Both Siegmann’s papers and photographs are held by the Indiana University Liberian Collections. 
Blondell Harris Hill was born in Marianna, Arkansas on February 9, 1904. At the age of 19 she was recruited to attend Earlham College and moved to Richmond, Indiana. At Earlham she completed two years of study, including music, piano, and other required course work. She then married Roy Hill, whose mother owned the Mary E. Hill Nursing Home in Richmond, Indiana. Blondell Hill was active as a church musician and played for the Sunday School and the Senior Choir at the Bethel A.M.E. church in Richmond. She passed her love of music on to her daughter, Rochelle, who sang in the children's and junior choirs. Hill also worked for the Leeds family in Richmond as a cook. They spent the summers of 1952-1956 in the resort town of Petoskey, Michigan, where Hill performed with a local gospel choir. Originally formed by a seasonal household employee from Dayton, Ohio, the choir was comprised of African Americans in the Petoskey area who came from Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Kentucky to work in the resort town. Since there was no African American church in Petoskey and most of the household employees had been accustomed to singing in gospel choirs, the employers in the area made sure their help became familiar with the other Black household employees and directed them to a church that was preferred by the seasonal workers. Hill and her daughter both performed in the Petoskey Gospel Volunteer Choir and are pictured in the photograph included in the collection. Blondell Hill passed away at the age of 101 on August 26, 2005, and is buried in Earlham Cemetery, Richmond, Indiana. Rochelle Hill Tinsley attended Indiana University, graduating with a BS in 1976 and an MS in 1978. 
Charles DeWitt Coleman, Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan on January 29, 1929. He was the founder and director of the Coleman Studio of Music, later known as the Northwestern School of Music, and a member of the Artists Bureau of the National Assocation of Negro Musicians. Coleman was a pupil of Robert Nolan at the Robert Nolan School of Music, August Maekelberghe, Robert Cato, and Virgil Fox, and received his Bachelor of Music degree from Wayne State University in 1954. He later studied with reknowned organist and composer Marcel Dupre from Paris, France and European piano pedagogy and organ with Lode Van Dessel of the Palestrina Institute. He conducted at many schools in the Detroit Public School System, as well as various church ensembles of various ages and faiths, and was awarded the degree A.A.G.O. by the American Guild of Organists in 1955. 
Arizona Juanita Dranes was the first recorded African American female gospel pianist and singer. Born ca. 1894 in Dallas, Texas, she recorded a series of groundbreaking gospel records in Chicago between 1926-1928 for the OKeh label. Dranes, who was apparently born blind, combined southern barrel-house style piano with a sanctified style of singing. Her many health problems, combined with the economics of the depression, contributed to the demise of her brief recording career. She remained active within the Church of God in Christ, the largest African American Pentecostal denomination and producer of such acts as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Edwin and Walter Hawkins, and Andrae Crouch. Initially a Fort Worth-based pianist for Bishop Samuel M. Crouch, she also assisted F. W. McGee and other COGIC leaders, and toured with Katie Bell Nubin and her daughter, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. In her later years she moved to Los Angeles where she died on July 27, 1963.

Performer, producer, and songwriter, Prince was one of the most popular artists of his generation. Though his rise to fame was a slow one, he received widespread recognition for the album 1999 in 1982, leading to more successful hits. His band, The Revolution, was innovative for its multiracial and multi-gendered makeup, and Prince himself tended to mix styles of both black and white music, going from pop and rock to soul and funk, as well as writing the soundtrack albums for Purple Rain and Batman. 
Jodie Hearon lived and worked in farming and agriculture in Mississippi during a period of industrializationa and mechanization. Hearon and his wife, Ella, managed farming, dairy, and livestock operations. The Hearons chose to attempt a capital intensive strategy of purchasing industrial and mechanized farming equipment, while also employing local families as sharecroppers and wage-workers, to work much of the land that was previously owned by plantation-owner Palmer H. Brooks in the area of Drew, Mississippi. Photographs from the collection indicate that some or all of the family relocated to St. Louis, Missouri by the late 1960s. An interview with Jodie and Ella Hearon was conducted in Memphis, Tennessee on July 3, 1989 [see related material].

A former music editor of the Atlanta alternative weekly, Creative Loafing, he has also written numerous articles about music for Vibe, Rolling Stone, XXL, and Spin magazines and has published two books about music: The Third Coast: Outkast, Timbaland, and How Hip Hop Became a Southern Thing and Secret History of Rock: The Most Influential Bands You've Never Heard. 
Marietta Simpson is a renowned American mezzo-soprano with an illustrious music career that spans well over fifty years. Simpson was born in November, 1958 in Philadelphia, PA to Melvin and Evelyn Simpson. The second youngest of eight siblings, Marietta was raised within an exceedingly talented musical family that included her sisters Joy Simpson, the late internationally acclaimed soprano, and Evelyn Simpson-Curenton, composer and pianist. During Marietta's youth, the Simpson family toured as a musical act, the Singing Simpsons, performing both classical and gospel music repertoire. The family strove to break the barriers of what was expected from Black musicians performing in predominantly White communities and churches. Simpson attended Temple University studying music education with a concentration in trombone and transitioned to voice toward the end of her degree. She earned a masters degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton, studying under Carmen Savoca and Peyton Hibbitt, and made her operatic debut as Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana with the Tri-Cities Opera Company. In 1984, after a stint with the Chautauqua summer program, Simpson auditioned for the Houston Opera where she was cast in the role of Maria in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. In 1985, she auditioned for Robert Shaw as a soloist for the Bach B Minor Mass but was ultimately hired as a soloist in his production of Handel's Messiah. Simpson continued to work with Shaw for the next thirteen years and marks this period as a catalyst for her career. Under Shaw, she also made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1988 as soloist in Brahms' Alto Rhapsody with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Simpson's opera career continued over the next two decades, including performances with many opera companies including Lyric Opera of Chicago, LA Opera, Washington National Opera, and on prestigious international stages such as La Scala, Glyndebourne, and the Royal Opera House at Convent Garden. Simpson has also sung with every major orchestra in the United States, under many of the world's greatest conductors, and with numerous choral ensembles. As a recitalist, she frequently performs spirituals and other works by Black composers, and is often accompanied by her sister, Evelyn Simpson-Curenton. Simpson began teaching at Indiana University in August 2005, where she earned the title of Distinguished Rudy Professor of Voice in the Jacobs School of Music. In 2019 she was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and also received an IU Bicentennial Medal honoring distinguished and distinctive Service. In 2020 she was named an IU Distinguished Professor. Other achievements include her solo role on the Grammy Award-winning recording of William Bolcom's Songs of Innocence and Experience with Leonard Slatkin conducting, an Emmy award-winning rendition of "Strange Fruit" with guitarist Tyron Cooper, a Temple University Certificate of Honor for Distinguished Alumni and the Leontyne Price Award. 
Albert "Diz" Russell was born in Nashville and raised in Cleveland where he began singing in vocals groups such as the Modern Sounds, which later became 4 Kings and a Queen. After recording a few songs as 4 Kings and a Queen, the group saw some personnel changes and changed their name to 4 Jays, but after moving to New York changed their name again to the Regals, soon winning an Apollo amateur show contest under that name. After performing and recording as the Regals, the group was recruited in 1955 by Sonny Til to become the new personnel of his backing group the Orioles. The group saw successes with touring and recording through the rest of the 1950s, but in the late 1950s the group began to experience financial and personnel problems. Russell left the Orioles in 1960. Russell would eventually come back to take leadership of the group after Til's death in the 1980s and the group was named The Legendary Orioles. Russell died in 2016. 
In the 1970s an interesting collaboration began in Los Angeles between two entertainment industry pioneers: Johnny Otis, the legendary R&B songwriter and bandleader, and Bill Griffiths, one of the original promoters of roller derby and former owner of the L.A. Thunderbirds franchise. Otis's success as a recording artist and radio deejay led to an opportunity to host a weekly television variety show for KTTV in L.A., which aired for eight years beginning in the mid-1950s as The Johnny Otis Show. Griffiths, who at that time ran an ad agency, assisted by finding sponsors for the show and a friendship formed between the two men. By the 1970s Griffiths had his own TV truck, primarily used for filming roller derby events, and offered to shoot some of Otis's live shows. The resulting video footage was recently donated to the AAAMC by Otis and Griffiths and consists of two distinct series. 
Stanley Lewis was born in 1927 in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1948, he established Stan's Music Shop where he began distributing rhythm and blues records from independent labels. In 1954, he began producing R&B and Rock n' Roll records and by 1964, he founded and began releasing records on Jewel Records, soon followed by subsidiary labels, Paula and Ronn. The combined labels released over 1,000 releases over the next twenty years from artists such as John Lee Hooker, Lowell Fulson, Soul Stirrers, and Ike and Tina Turner. During 1972, he sold over 2.5 million singles and over 470,000 albums. Lewis was inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame in 2009 and remained in Shreveport until his death in 2018. 
Johnny Otis, known as the "Godfather of R&B," was born in 1921 to Greek immigrants in Vallejo, California. Two years later his family moved to a predominantly Black neighborhood in Berkeley, where his father opened a grocery store. In this environment, Otis experienced and internalized Black culture from an early age and was particularly influenced by African American music styles. In high school he learned to play the drums and in 1940 landed his first professional job with Count Otis Matthew's West Oakland House Rockers. The following year he began playing and touring with Black territory big bands led by musicians such as George Morrison and Lloyd Hunter. After settling in Los Angeles, Otis became a session drummer for jazz greats such as Lester Young and performed and recorded with his own big band, scoring his first hit with an arrangement of "Harlem Nocturne" in 1946.As the demand for big bands waned, Otis downsized to a combo, forging a new style that became known as rhythm and blues. Over the next decade he played an important role in the development of rhythm and blues, discovering, producing, promoting and performing with artists such as Little Esther Phillips, The Robins, The Coasters, Mel Walker, Etta James, Jackie Wilson, Big Mama Thornton, Little Willie John, and Hank Ballard. Otis led the house bands at Club Alabam on Central Avenue and the Barrelhouse, a nightclub he opened in Watts, and toured extensively with his popular live revue show. During this period Otis also released a string of hit records including "Willie and the Hand Jive," wrote songs for other artists, served as a record label talent scout, and operated a recording studio, record shop and the Dig Records label. In 1954 Otis began his media career as host of "The Johnny Otis Show," a rhythm and blues radio program which he adapted into a weekly television series that aired on KTTV from 1955-1961 and was briefly revived in the 1970s. The popularity of Otis's radio show persisted over several decades, continually introducing new audiences to the many African American artists he worked with throughout his career, highlighting their achievements, and addressing issues such as systemic racism within the industry. Otis also ventured into print media in 1960, writing a column for the Sentinel, one of L.A.'s leading Black newspapers, which he used as a platform to address racial equality and social justice. Otis was voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation for his role in the development of these styles. In addition to his musical career, Otis was an avid painter and sculptor, author, ordained minister, organic farmer, and civil rights activist. He founded the Landmark Community Church in the late 1970s and advocated tirelessly for the homeless, organizing food drives such as the Red Beans and Rice Festivals promoted on his radio shows. He married Phyllis Walker, an Afro-Filipina woman, in 1941 and had several children. Otis frequently performed with his sons, guitarist Shuggie Otis and drummer Nicky Otis, and in later years with grandson Lucky Otis on bass. Johnny Otis died in 2012 at the age of 90.

The University Interests Committee Collection consists of 12 folders covering the years 1926 to 1929. It is organized in three series: Correspondence, Administrative files, and Women's University Interests Committee.
Correspondence forms the bulk of the collection and is arranged chronologically in three broad groupings. The first consists of correspondence between several committee members on the Bloomington campus and potential leaders for the statewide organizational system the committee hoped to establish. The second includes correspondence between committee members and committee representatives, county chairs, and state legislators (including letters from President Bryan to state legislators). The third includes correspondence of William A. Alexander on behalf of the University Interests Committee in organizing for the 1929 legislative session. Arrangement within each chronological grouping is alphabetical by recipient and includes responses along with the initiating correspondence.
The Administrative files series consists of two folders. One folder contains questionnaires completed by Committee representatives as well as some miscellaneous reports. The questionnaires include data on legislators, community leaders, IU alumni, and newspapers in the Indiana towns and cities in which the representatives lived. The second folder contains lists of county chairmen and chairwomen, Memorial Regiment representatives, and state senators and representatives.
The final series, Women's University Interests Committee, consists of a single folder of minutes and reports of meetings and some correspondence of the Women's University Interests Committee. The Women's University Interests Committee was organized in June 1926 and worked both independently and as part of the University Interests Committee.
The Theodore W. Torrey Papers, 1945-1986, are organized in four series: Professional Materials, Sunday Evening Discussion Group, Speaking Engagements, and Personal Materials. With the exception of the items in Professional Materials, all items were forwarded to the Archives by Biology Professor L.S. McClung in 1983 and 1984.
The Professional Materials consist of two copies of one of his publications and an item from his course in Developmental Anatomy which correlates references in the lab manual to the 2nd and 3rd editions of his textbook and which was probably meant as a handout to students in the class.
The Sunday Evening Discussion Group Materials contain typewritten and handwritten copies of talks Torrey prepared, most probably, according to Professor McClung, for the Sunday Evening Discussion Group, a faculty group which included President Wells and which met in rotation at the members' homes for paper presentations and discussion. The Discussion Group materials, most of which are undated, are arranged by title. Although most of the items are undated, citations and references in a few of the texts give approximate dates of their creation.
Speaking Engagements Materials consist of typed and handwritten copies of speeches he gave and are arranged chronologically.
In Personal Materials are two items: a "Petition" presented to Torrey when he stepped down as chair of the department and "The Torrey Genesis," a genealogy he wrote.
While a small collection, consisting of only 1.4 cubic ft., the Sigma Xi records still hold a wealth of information for the researcher interested in the Society at Indiana University.
The first series, Nominations, consists of individual nominations to the Society from the time of its inception to 1938. Nomination forms include candidate information such as degrees, status at IU, and qualifications for membership.
The Minutes series, 1904-1972, is surprisingly complete. In addition to the meeting minutes, the Secretary also sometimes included correspondence and flyers about Society events.
The final series, Administrative records, 1904-1974, includes by-laws, constitutions, secretary correspondence, and member information. Also found is a history drawn up circa 1974 entitled "Indiana University Chapter: The Society of Sigma Xi, 1904-1974."
The collection has been organized into five series: Correspondence; Financial records; Speeches; Testimony; and Administrative files. All files are arranged chronologically within their series. Because the Archives holds so little from Daily and his tenure as president of IU, this collection holds both his administrative records and a small amount of personal papers.
The collection begins with a Correspondence series and includes both university and personal correspondence. Prominent are letters written by Daily to his brother, "D.O." in Huntington, Ind., as well as letters written to Theophilus Wylie regarding his appointment at IU.
This is followed by a small series of Financial records, which has two receipts from Samuel Buskirk to the university.
The next series, Speeches, consists of formal addresses from Daily's presidency. Of note is a report on his fiery farewell address in February 1859. This latter item was not written by Daily; it appears to be in T.A. Wylie's hand.
The Testimony series chronicles the charges made against Daily in 1858 and 1859. Included are the initial charges brought by A.M. Murphy in August 1858 and testimony collected by Reverand F.A. Hester on behalf of the Methodist Church on Daily's immorality charges. Witnesses include several prominent Indianpolis citizens, including Benjamin Harrison, then an Indianapolis attorney, who went on to become the 23rd President of the United States. Also found here are responses of the faculty, written by T.A. Wylie.
Within the Administrative files, researchers will find additional records relating to Daily's dismissal, but also a subscription book of donations given to the university after the 1854 destroyed the First College Building, tuition announcements, and a resolution regarding standard text book adoption for the state.
This collection is organized into four series: Journals, Notes, Personal files, and Teaching materials.

The Notes series includes Hale's notes from his college and graduate school years. These also include his interpretation of certain poems and views on their authors.
Personal files include Professor Hale's correspondence, engagement calendars and journals. The latter of which also include his records of weather and sport scores. Also in this series are materials about the house the professor built along with information and samples of how he decorated. Included also are Hale's notes and writings from when he was a student.
Teaching materials include lesson plans, papers on assignment format, and notebooks that include notes on his students.
The Scott R. Sanders papers are organized into two series. The first series, Teaching files, consists of the records created for classes taught by Sanders during his tenure at Indiana University. The individual folders are arranged chronologically by semester, and span the period from 1971 to 2009. The series includes handouts, teaching and lecture notes, as well as some of Sanders' correspondence with students and fellow faculty. For some of these files access is restricted because they contain sensitive or confidential information.
The second series, Faculty files, contains records created by or about Sanders during his Indiana University career. Included within this series are notifications about various awards that Sanders received during his career, promotional material about talks or recitations that he would deliver, correspondence, and his annual faculty summary reports. For some of these files access is restricted.
Additional papers of Dr. Sanders are housed at IU's Lilly Library. Consult Lilly staff for further information.

The Schuyler F. Otteson papers are organized into six series: Organizations and committees; Indiana University; Research and writing; Papers and talks; Conferences, Workshops, and Seminars; and Subject files. Because the papers had no discernable original order, they have been arranged to best highlight Otteson's activities.
The first series, Organizations and committees, which spans the period from 1954-1971, encompasses all those organizations in which Otteson was involved that were not associated with Indiana University. This series is then divided into five subseries: American Marketing Association, Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), Council for Professional Education for Business (CPEB), the U.S. Department of Commerce National Marketing Advisory Committee, and General. The first sub-series, American Marketing Association, spans the years 1954 to 1971 and pertains to Otteson's participation in this organization, both as a member and as national president (1965-1966). Document types include correspondence, minutes, conference proceedings, and trip plans. Traveling and speaking at various AMA chapters constituted much of Otteson's activity during this period. The second sub-series, Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), spans the years 1963-1969, and contains general information on the CIC, correspondence from other schools, and bulletins and class lists, also from other institutions. The CIC, at the time, was comprised of many of the Big Ten universities and was dedicated to sharing educational information and resources for the common good of all members. The third sub-series, Council for Professional Education for Business (CPEB), spans the years 1966-1970, and covers Otteson's involvement in this group, especially on the executive committee and long-range planning committee. The bulk of this material pertains to CPEB's effort to define its identity in relation to its fellow group, the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business. The fourth sub-series, the U.S. Department of Commerce National Marketing Advisory Committee, spans the years 1966-1969, and includes conference proceedings, general files, and meeting minutes. Otteson served on the executive committee of this group during this time. This group met yearly to discuss ways for the Department of Commerce to best market itself to consumers, as well as how the Department should understand consumer trends.
The second series in this collection contains all those materials relating to Indiana University and Schuyler Otteseon's tenure as a member of the faculty. Spanning the period from 1962-1970, this series consists of three subseries. The first, International Business Research Institute (IBRI) (.2 cubic feet), spans the years 1966-1970. Otteson was one of the founding members of this organization, which sought to provide support, both academic and monetary, for international business projects. The second sub-series, Marketing chair records (.1 cubic feet), spans the years 1964-1965. Otteson served as chair of the Marketing Department from 1960 to 1965. These files encompass everything the Archives have received from Otteson's tenure as chair of the department, and they include correspondence and administrative files. The third sub-series, Service, covers the period from 1962-1970, and includes materials pertaining to all the other various committees and programs with which Otteson was involved related to Indiana University.

This collection contains the 1892 constitution of the four-member Moonlight Pleasure Club. This short constitution documents the club's rules, functions, purpose, and other details. It is a very 'pro-Hoosier' document that calls for the club members to enjoy their social lives together and to enjoy their time at Indiana University. The constitution appears to, at times, satirize formal IU student groups and their official documentation. However, the language in the document also seems to make a genuine point for the club to be a welcoming place for the members to enjoy their time together and to have fun.
The collection spans the years 1914 to 2008, with the bulk of the materials from 1930 to 1995. The collection includes items pertaining to both Bowie's work and personal life.

The Jonathan Krause Rare Newspaper and Magazine Collection consists of approximately 900 original issues of historical newspapers and magazines, with a focus on late 18th- and early 19th-century American publications. Mr. Krause's goal in building the collection was to focus on issues that included the texts of writings by important historical figures. This is an often overlooked area of historical research, in that many scholars look primarily at early monographic publications, rather than periodicals. Printed books and pamphlets typically cost a great deal more than periodicals, and so their readership was necessarily more limited in many respects. The essays, letters, speeches, and excerpts from larger works, which were often published in various periodicals, provide a glimpse into the ways these texts were disseminated to contemporary readers.
The newspapers and magazines are listed under categories and titles applied by Mr. Krause, with his notes on selected items included. Titles established by Mr. Krause are listed in all capitals.
The Burton mss., 1940-1967 and 1976, are the papers of Lindley James Burton, 1921-1968, professor of Mathematics at Lake Forest College, Illinois, concerning various phases of the work of the United World Federalists movement in Illinois.

The notebook bound in brown cloth may formerly have been the property of George Barker bearing the words Notebook 1957-58. G.B. on one page. A five-word phrase "This face won no smile" in purple ink on a page about quarter way into the book and a drawing of an erotic nature in pencil on another page near the beginning of the notebook are both attributed to George Barker.

The letters are concentrated in the years that Debs served a sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for his conviction of sedition in 1918 after criticizing the 1917 Espionage Act. Approximately seventy of the letters are undated, but a perusal of the contents separates them into "Pre-prison," "Prison," "Post-prison," and "Indefinite" categories.

The letters from Prison are largely personal in nature. The Post-prison letters are written on stationery for the Congressional Campaign of 1922 and from Lindlahr Sanitarium.

Other letters of Debs are written to Rosalie Heaton Goodyear, poet and editorial assistant for radical and liberal papers.

Goodyear in turn relates how she was introduced to Debs and how she received the letters via Mabel (Dunlap) Curry.
Other correspondents include Theodore Debs, 1864-1945, bookkeeper and younger brother of Eugene Victor Debs, and socialist official William H. Henry. Henry wrote to Debs while Debs was serving in the West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia, prior to going to Atlanta.

The Harper mss., 1923-1925, deals chiefly with the North Star Klan No. 2 Realm of Minnesota and includes letters, newspapers, and other printed materials. Harper joined the KKK in 1922 when he was the pastor of the Methodist church in Jonesboro, Indiana. He began traveling around Indiana to deliver Klan lectures, and when the state convention convened at Kokomo, Indiana, on February 15, 1923, he met a number of national officers. Later that month, he was persuaded to deliver an address in Minnesota.
When Harper arrived in Minnesota in February 1923, he was told to stay and take charge of the Minneapolis Klan. By June 5, 1924, however, he had been dismissed from the Klan. He refused to leave Minnesota, and the National Committee took action and banished him that fall. In September, he requested his salary and moving expenses back to Indiana. On October 20, 1924, he received a letter about the Independent Klan of America with national headquarters at Muncie, Indiana, organized for the purpose of perpetuating true Klankraft. There is no further correspondence to indicate what steps Harper took.
Included is printed matter on the Ku Klux Klan and the Independent Klan of America. Copies of newspapers of the Klan are in an oversize folder.

In her first letter to Lyndona, Miller reported having read her "story of the nickel" and was so delighted by it that she had to tell her "so on paper." Thereafter Miller writes about her life and activities in Indiana, her own children and what they are reading and doing as they grow up, and comments on the general state of affairs of the country. In a short note of 9 July 1930, she tells of her brother Percy's death following a knife and gun battle with a hold-up man in Los Angeles, and in her letter of 8 December 1950, she encloses an article published in the Sunday Indianapolis Star Magazine about her. Also present are two letters to Lyndona's mother: one from Mrs. Buchanan, "News" representative, who requests information regarding Miss Miller's visit to the Hastings and about her "opinion of Colorado," and one from Elizabeth Miller in 1920, thanking Mrs. Hastings for the photograph of Lyndona and her young daughter.

Most correspondence related to Nancy Mitford (renowned 20th century author and socialite, who worked in the shop 1942-1945) can also be found here.
Much of the "Correspondence" subseries of "Lady Anne Hill" was organized to varying degrees by Lady Anne herself. As she organized mainly chronologically and thematically (e.g. "Cyprus trip 1968"), I chose to leave many non-correspondence material (such as programs, photos, catalogs, press clippings, etc.) in Lady Anne's original arrangement as they often cohere thematically or lend each other context. Notable correspondents that can be found in this series include author Frances Partridge and James Lees-Milne.
Due to the organizational system used in correspondence, a number of photos are in that subseries. Any photos without clear organizational logic, dates, or seeming relevance to the materials near which they were originally located were placed in the "Photos" subseries.
The "Personal" subseries to "Lady Anne Hill" contains many of the materials that were less organized/more loosely organized by Lady Anne. Some overlap between the folders can be found throughout the collection but especially in this subseries due to multiple processors who processed roughly half the collection.
"Jane Gathorne-Hardy" includes correspondence (some with Anne) as well as personal papers, documents, and photos of Lady Anne's aunt, Jane Ethel Gathorne-Hardy (Sept. 26, 1872-1943).

This subseries also includes Anne and Heywood's work of compiling their wartime letters into what would become A Bookseller's War (1997), as well as some work related to a memoir. Lady Anne's "Nannies," written for a collection her nephew, Jonny Gathorne-Hardy, was working on.

In the collection are one hundred and fifteen letters from Robert Stephenson to Illingworth mostly written from Mariquita, Colombia, between September 1824 and November 1828 on the management of mining affairs in Colombia, mining laws in general and how they could be adapted to conditions in Colombia. Fourteen letters were written by Stephenson to Illingworth between 1848 and 1858 when both men were living in England which deal with news of their native country. Among the papers are also fifteen diaries of Illingworth, kept between 1816 and 1842, on the location of mines, including small sketches and positions of mines, reports, an informative and vivid description of a journey on land and aboard the Bongo boats giving a clear idea of the life, people, geographical position, and conditions in Colombia in 1829, a list of the staff and miners with comments on their work and character, supplies required, calculations and cost of mines, detailed mining information on selection and treatment of ores, and an account of a journey to the United States. Another important item is a thirty-nine-page report to the Board of Directors of the Colombian Mining Association. Of interest is also a detailed and descriptive itinerary of a journey from Mariquita to Arma in August 1826 written by Ed Walker.
A memoir, reports, observations, and several letters on mining written in French between 1823 and 1836 from Jean Baptiste Boussingault, the French agricultural chemist, who became famous for his discoveries on the absorption of nitrogen by plants, add to the value of the collection. Boussingault went to Colombia about 1813 as a mining engineer for the Colombian Mining company. During the insurrection of the Spanish colonies he was attached to the staff of Simon Bolivar and traveled widely in the northern parts of the continent. Included are also two letters, August 15, 1870, and March 20, 1872, discussing the Franco-Prussian war.
Four letters from Simon Bolivar and one from his nephew and secretary, Fernando Bolivar, in Spanish are of interest to the scholar because of their content. The first two letters to Jose Fernandez Madrid dated September 27, 1827, refer to finances in connection with his mines in Venezuela with special reference to a bill of exchange for twenty thousand pesos made out to Joseph Lancaster, the noted British educator, to help him further the cause of primary education in Caracas by importing the benefits of his system. The third letter was writen to the naval officer Juan Illingworth. In this letter of June 9, 1830, the Liberator expresses his affection and trust in Illingworth and asks him to turn over to Manuela Saenz the money coming from the impending sale of a mule. In the fourth letter which was written to Richard Stonhewer Illingworth dated August 2, 1830, Bolivar profusely thanks Illingworth for fulfilling a mission for him and adds that he is thinking of going to England at once to show how deplorable conditions are in Colombia and how much damage ships leaving the harbor of Cartagena have suffered. A brief note was appended to the letter from Bolivar's nephew, Fernando. On January 9, 1831, Fernando Bolivar wrote to Juan Illingworth thanking him for the valuable services rendered to his uncle and discussing the circumstances surrounding the Liberator's death. Something of a more personal nature in this collection is a lock of Bolivar's hair which was cut after his death and was given to Juan Illingworth on January 10, 1831, at Guaduas.
Six documents and copies of six letters in Spanish on the Panama Canal, 1825-1829, concerned with the mines and the Isthmus of Panama, add to the value of the collection.

The James mss., 1911?-1971, consists chiefly of those letters of musician Lesley Payne, 1891-1976, to artist Louis James, 1909-1971, concerning a copy of a life mask of the poet John Keats. With the material are two framed photographs: one of Lesley Payne and her mother, Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken sometime during their stay in Paris, 1908-1914, and one of Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken by James in 1930. Miss Payne, in a letter of February 20, 1971, commented on the recent death of Paul Hadley, who in 1917 had designed the Indiana state flag.
The copy of the Keats mask is present in the collection, along with a magazine clipping and James' information about it. The original of the life mask was made by Benjamin Robert Haydon in December 1816. This copy is presumed to have been the one given by James Whitcomb Riley to the Art Association of Indianapolis and acknowledged by them on October 24, 1911. Louis James, as Louis James Globenskey, attended the Herron School of Art between 1927-1933, during which time he acquired the mask in Indianapolis and at a later date gave it a terra cotta exterior.
A later addition of 7 scanned photo slides of the Paynes and John Keats' life mask completes the collection.
The James, C.L.R. mss., ca. 1942-1974, consist of the correspondence and writings of West Indian writer and political activist Cyril Lionel Robert James, 1901-1989.

A more extensive correspondence file, 1962-1973, is between James and New York bookseller Walter Goldwater. Goldwater owned University Place Book Shop and acted on James' behalf as unofficial literary agent. A third, smaller, correspondence folder consists of letters to Constance Webb, James' former wife, from Eric R. James and from C.L.R. James as well as two letters from Webb to Walter Goldwater.
Among the writings by James present are a typescript of From Toussaint Louverture to Fidel Castro and a 1967 mimeograph copy of The Black Jacobins with holograph additions and changes.

Many of the letters were written during the time that Janes was president of the Brooklyn Ethical Association, 1885-1896. The two Garrisons, however, writing in 1865 and 1866 respectively relate to Garrison, Sr. addressing the Union League of Rhode Island "upon our late lamented President." James writes about matters philosophical, including "the question of immortality," while Spencer's letters talk about his antagonists who continue to call him "a materialist whether you [i.e. he] like it or not," and about his poor health.

The foundation of the Sprague-Thacher-Ball-Lilly Library-Indiana University set of Signers of the Declaration of Independence lies in one of the three full sets formed by Dr. William E. Sprague, pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Albany, New York, who is generally believed to have originated the idea of collecting Signers. It is based on a collection presented by Dr. Sprague to his son, Edward Everett Sprague. The wrapper with presentation inscription is present in the set. It reads: "Autographs of all the Signers of the Declaration of Independence: a New Year's Present for my dear boy, Edward Everett Sprague 1861." This set is believed to have been completed as early as 1848, thus ranking as one of the first five completed sets.
Shortly before 1889 the younger Sprague sold the set to John Boyd Thacher of the Thacher Car Wheel Works of Albany, New York, a boyhood friend who served as a State Senator and Mayor of Albany. At the time of the purchase Thacher already possessed a partial collection of Signers, and he used the Sprague set to complete and enrich his own. Thacher died in 1909. His set of Signers was cataloged by the Anderson Galleries, New York, New York, in Part I of the catalog of the John Boyd Thacher sale, October 1913. A negative photostat of the pages of this catalog describing the manuscripts in the Thacher set of Signers is filed with the set. A comparison of the set as it is today with this catalog listing shows that no changes have been made in the set since Thacher's day. The collection of Signers was not sold at this time. It was withdrawn from the sale and was not disposed of by the Thacher heirs until 1924 when it was sold privately by Mitchell Kennerly of The Anderson Galleries to George A. Ball of Muncie, Indiana. It remained in his possession until 1953, when it was acquired by an anonymous donor for presentation to the Indiana University Library.
The Lilly Library, Indiana University, manuscript collections has a carbon copy of a typewritten volume entitled "The Indiana University Library Set of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, Acquired by Gift, November 2, 1953."

"The original manuscript of one of Charles de Kock's later novels, a closely written manuscript comprised of 19 chapters, with copious corrections, additions and deletions throughout, with occasional long notes in the margins. Written in May 1868, it was published by Ferdinand Sartorious as a 272-page book the same year. It reached a third edition by 1870. Kock appeared in Thackeray's History of Pendennis and James Joyce's Ulysses. A good natured story partly about a street violinist and singer, theatre, vaudeville, love, all of which includes a long chapter about preparing and eating a sumptuous meal, "Nouvelle omelette soufflee." Written near the end of Kock's long literary career, the romance was reprinted a number of times into the 20th century, as well as being translated into Polish in 1878. It's interesting that Kock would gravitate towards "Madame Tapin" as a fictional character 55 years after she appeared in his first book, L'enfant de ma femme [the Child of My Wife] (1813)." - Bookseller's description, Howard S. Mott, Inc.

One drawing illustrating life in Ruhleben Camp. An individual in the foreground is carrying a large box full of food, and in the background undifferientiated individuals queue before an office.
Signed in corner: FW. Ruhleben Prisoner of War Camp was a civilian detention camp in Ruhleben, Germany during World War I. The majority of the prisoners were British, and many of them were taken prisoner because they were in Germany due to travel, school, or work at the outbreak of World War I. The prisoners largely administered their own internal affairs, and they had active art, theater, music, and sports groups.Six letters written to author Wilhelm Hemsen, by Hermann Hauff (in Stuttgart), dated as follows: (1) Nov. 13, 1855(?); [2] Sept. 27, 1856; [3] Nov. 6, 1856; Dec. 3, 1856; Dec. 8, 1857; and, June 19, 1858. The letters discuss Grimm's translation of an article on Shakespeare, which led to the Hauffs receiving a half dozen of Emerson's essays in translation--translations so poor Hauff could do nothing with them. But the translations of Emerson he has now received [from an unnamed translator] seem to him much better. In subsequent letters the discussion over the translation of Emerson's essays into German continues. He raises specific objections to various words and phrases, although he suggests that it's a worthy effort for a woman...He eventually decides to revise the whole of the translation.
Herman Hauff became private secretary of the publisher Johann Friedrich von Cotta in 1827. Upon the death of his brother, Wilhelm Hauff, in that year, he took over as editor of the Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände, and remained in that post until his death. In addition to essays which he published in numerous journals, he was the author of Skizzen aus dem Leben und der Natur. He was active as both an editor and translator.
Wilhelm Hemsen (1829-1885) was a friend of Mörike nd Nerthold Auerbach, and an acquaintance of many famous literary figures. In 1869 he became the Court Librarian in Stuttgart.The Garrett mss., 1946-1947, consist of letters from John P.

Five boxes of materials, 1828-1911, that range chronologically from Liberia's colonial period under the American Colonization Society through the end of Arthur Barclay's term as the fifteenth president of Liberia. The collection consists of correspondence, reports, records, minutes, and other miscellaneous manuscript items. These materials are typically either photocopies of items from the Liberian Archives in Monrovia, Liberia, or are typescript copies/notes created by Dr. Holsoe in the course of his research (however, there are some manuscript notes and, in at least one case, photographs of documents).
The collection is divided into three main sections to reflect the three branches of Liberian government: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The Executive Branch is further broken down by executive department, with the Presidential materials under the heading "Executive Mansion;" the Legislative by House, Senate, and General (for those materials deriving from, or going to, both Houses); and the Judicial by geographic area and then by court. The organization is intended to reflect the inventory of the Liberian Government Archives as established by Dr. Holsoe and Tom W. Schick (see bibliography).
Because so much of the correspondence comes in the form of Letterbooks or Letter Despatch Books, items of correspondence can be found in many different places. For example, someone looking for Presidential correspondence will find much of it under Executive Mansion General Correspondence, but there will also be materials to be found in the Despatch Books of the Department of State or of the Treasury Department.
Researchers using the Holsoe Collection Liberian Government Archives will find many items of interest: there is a wealth of correspondence, both intra- and extra-governmental, and the cabinet minutes and Legislative materials provide great insight into the workings of government. Of particular note are the Legislative materials from 1871-1872 covering the impeachment of President Roye and members of his cabinet; there are also court records from Montserrado County during the same period that cover related trials. The court records from Maryland County contain a wealth of information concerning wills and estates, giving one a glimpse into the possessions and livelihood of early Twentieth Century Liberians. Other notable items include Arthur Barclay's office diary from 1909; correspondence relating to the "Regina Coeli" affair (1857-1858); and the Native Shipping Bureau Correspondence, which consists primarily of ledger books detailing the traffic in native labor in the late Nineteenth Century.
The materials range chronologically from 1911-1968, though the bulk of the material focuses on three presidents: Dennis E. Howard, C.D.B. King, and Edwin Barclay. There are also a few materials from William Tubman's presidency, mostly as correspondence dealing with international boundaries after World War II. The collection consists of correspondence, reports, records, minutes, and other miscellaneous manuscript items. These materials are typically either photocopies of items from the Liberian Archives in Monrovia, Liberia, or are typescript copies/notes created by Dr. Holsoe in the course of his research (there are also a few hand-written notes)
The collection is divided into three main sections to reflect the three branches of Liberian government: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The Executive Branch is further broken down by executive department, with the Presidential materials under the heading "Executive Mansion;" the Legislative by House and Senate; and the Judicial by geographic area and then by court. The organization is intended to reflect the inventory of the Liberian Government Archives as established by Dr. Holsoe and Tom W. Schick (see bibliography). One change in arrangement made to this second part of the collection keeps local materials together. Thus, after departmental correspondence is filed correspondence from local executives by county or province rather than by government agency.
Researchers using the Holsoe Collection Liberian Government Archives will find many items of interest: there is a wealth of correspondence, both intra- and extra-governmental, and the cabinet minutes and Legislative materials provide great insight into the workings of government. Of particular note are the files from President King's term covering the international forced labor scandals in Spanish Guinea, and the encrypted telegrams used during the World Wars. The administration of the interior provinces changed dramatically during this 33-year period until the British system of indirect rule was imported in President Barclay's term. Correspondence on border wars, the Liberian Frontier Force, and the subsequent divisions of the hinterland into tribes and clans can be found.

The 1939 production of Prelude to Swing was directed by Malvina Fried with Carlton Moss and was first performed in Philadelphia. The musical revue featured dancers, a black chorus, and a swing orchestra.
The Mellonee Burnim Collection consists primarily of analog field recordings of religious music in African American and African settings, most of which Burnim recorded between 1978 and 1996. The formats currently include 145 audiocassettes, 33 slides, 9 VHS videocassettes, 8 audiotape reels, 6 videotape reels, and 3 binders of documentation, as well as sheet music and song texts. These materials document over 150 hours of music and interviews recorded in the United States, Malawi, Liberia, and Cuba. Singers, composers, and gospel association leaders appear in recordings of worship services, funerals, choir rehearsals, gospel music workshops and festivals, and choral workshops. Burnim's interviews generally focus on the aesthetics and history of gospel music and its performance. The interviews include the perspectives of soloists, ministers, choral directors, congregants, and participants in gospel music workshops and the gospel music industry.
Series 1 includes Burnim's earliest recordings, which were made in conjunction with her dissertation research for "The Black Gospel Music Tradition: Symbol of Ethnicity" (Ph.D. dissertation, Indiana University, 1980). The formats in this series include 104 audiocassettes, 4 audiotape reels, and 6 videotape reels. Burnim recorded nearly all of her dissertation field recordings in 1978 and 1979, and these are also cataloged in her dissertation on pages 200--205. The purpose of Burnim's dissertation was "to define the extent and the mechanisms through which gospel music serves as a symbol of ethnicity among Black Americans in the United States" (Burnim 1980, page 2).
Burnim's primary research populations included the predominantly African American congregations of Mercy Mission Apostolic Church of Bloomington, Indiana, (217 North Elm Street) and Grace Apostolic Church of Indianapolis, Indiana (643 East 22nd Street). At the time of her research, these two churches differed according to the proximity of their location to urban centers, the structures and styles of church leadership, and the compositions of their congregation in terms of gender, race, and class. However, the two congregations shared denominational ties to Apostolic Pentacostalism. Burnim compared the "musical traditions" (Burnim 1980, page 8) of Mercy Mission and Grace Apostolic to those of other churches in Teague, Texas (Federation of Choirs, St. James U.M.E. Church) and Atlanta, Georgia (Wheat Street Baptist). Recordings of the choir rehearsals, worship services, broadcasts, and other performances are located in Subseries 1.1 along with Burnim's recorded reflections on these events. This subseries contains 33 audiocassettes, 4 audiotape reels, and 6 videotape reels.
The 12 audiocassettes in Subseries 1.2 include detailed commentaries on gospel music performances solicited by Burnim through the use of feedback interviews techniques. Interviewees were primarily culture-bearers, but also included two European American researchers studying White Pentacostalism. Data also was generated through transcription and analysis of recorded performances and Burnim's journal entries of her own experiences during participant-observation.
Subseries 1.3 includes 53 audiocassettes from additional short-term field research conducted at the August 1979 meeting of the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA) and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, which were both held in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as performances and participant interviews recorded by Burnim after the completion of her dissertation at various meetings of the GMWA and the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC) hosted throughout the United States in 1992-1995.
Burnim stated in a July 1997 interview with AAAMC staff that she recorded a cross-section of group activities occurring within each convention, including those involving no musical performance. Burnim feels this effort will support an accurate interpretation of the bodies, their meaning, and their significance to gospel music. Interviews probe the structure, history, and role of the GMWA and NCGCC conventions in African American gospel music. Such interviews include NCGCC President Kenneth Moales, GMWA Founding Member Ed Smith, NCGCC Historian Gladys Berryman, gospel pioneer Albertina Walker Brooks of the Caravans, and others. Burnim's recordings particularly document the participation of choirs and worshipers in the performance of gospel music at each convention--including instructional periods, rehearsals, and worship. Interviews with a Bahamanian choir director and a French singer document the international appeal of opportunities to learn more about gospel music in worship settings.
Subseries 1.4 contains 6 audiocassettes with miscellaneous content--primarily lectures and commercial recordings--related to African American gospel and religious music.
The post-dissertation field recordings from Liberia, Malawi, and Cuba in Series 2 reflect Burnim's ongoing interest in African American religious music in cross-cultural contexts. The 4 audiocassettes in Subseries 2.1 were recorded in Santiago de Cuba circa 1990 and document Burnim's participation with a touring group of African American ministers and professors of music. This group was sponsored by African American churches of the United States to present African American religious music to a Cuban audience in a context that educated listeners in the religious and historical context of the music. Burnim explained in her July 1997 interview with AAAMC staff that she values the recordings as examples of cross-cultural musical interaction, particularly the Cuban audience's reaction to the African American musical styles. Ethnomusicologist and AAAMC founder, Dr. Portia K. Maultsby, participated as an organist for the group.
Subseries 2.2 consists of 4 audiocassettes from Burnim's 1989 trip to Monrovia, Liberia. In the 1997 interview, Burnim explained that this research was intended to serve as a preliminary study for a longer ethnomusicological project examining the religious music of Americo-Liberians. The outbreak of civil war in Liberia after the conclusion of her visit there led Burnim to postpone indefinitely plans for further research in the area. According to Burnim, the recordings of worship and choir rehearsals of the interdenominational Tuesday Cottage Prayer Band and St. Peter's Lutheran Church confirm the presence of African American sacred songs in these West African congregations. Burnim's selection of research sites drew upon contacts made by ethnomusicologist Ruth M. Stone (Professor and Chair, Folklore Institute, Indiana University) during her long-term field research in Liberia. Burnim explained in the 1997 interview that her own Liberian field research directly offers data for comparison with ethnomusicological studies focused on indigenous Liberian music, such as Dr. Stone's study of Kpelle epic.
The 33 audiocassettes and 6 videocassettes in Subseries 2.3 were recorded during Burnim's residence in Zomba, Malawi--where she was visiting associate professor at Chancellor College of the University of Malawi (1991)--and her brief return as a director for the university's annual Choral Workshop in 1992. While there, Burnim conducted field research on music in several Malawian Christian communities. As in Liberia, Burnim investigated the use of African American religious music in Malawian contexts, primarily in the cities of Blantyre and Zomba. In addition to worship services in churches, Burnim recorded the Mhango Salvation Singers' gospel-styled performance at an outdoor festival and received a copy of a commercially-produced studio recording from the group. As with this tape, the commercially-produced recordings of the Burnim Collection generally offer supplemental information on the repertoire or broader musical scene of musicians Burnim recorded during field research.
Though English language predominates in the Choral Workshop recordings, most of the Malawian field recordings include music and speech in indigenous Malawian languages, particularly Chichewa. Therefore, Burnim obtained help from a few of her Malawian students, who served as field research assistants and translators. Several of the field recordings from Malawi contain sections where communications in an indigenous language are translated or summarized in English. Burnim noted in the July 1997 interview, however, that her limited familiarity with indigenous Malawian traditions necessitated additional clarification by Malawians. To assist in receiving Malawian interpretations of such field recordings, Burnim conducted feedback interviews with members of a church congregation. For these feedback interviews, she played a videotaped worship service and recorded the church members' responses (in their indigenous language) to the events of their service. The Burnim Collection contains both the videotaped performances used for the feedback interview and the audiotaped responses of the congregants.
In addition to performances featuring religious music in Malawi, Burnim recorded a concert featuring the Vaal Reef Choir of South African miners and interviewed one member of the all-male group. This performance presented--in the order printed here--repertoire from Western European art music, arranged choral (African American) spirituals, popular music in English, and indigenous South African music. According to Burnim's 1997 interview with AAAMC staff, this performance invited the examination of social issues. Burnim said that differences along the lines of gender, race, and ethnicity between the White South African director and the Black South African members of the Vaal Reef Choir are implicated in the musical performance and organizational operations of the group. At the time of the field recordings, South Africa's system of apartheid strictly enforced White supremist rule over the Black majority population.
Subseries 2.3 contains 2 audiotape reels and two videocassettes with miscellaneous content and Subseries 2.4 contains of 33 slides related to Burnim's Africa research.
Series 3 consists of 4 videocassettes of Black music performances hosted on the Philadelphia Stage at the Smithsonian Institution American Folklife Festival from July 1-17, 1984, while Series 4 contains 39 pieces of gospel sheet music and song texts dating from approximately 1861-1981.

The Johnny Otis Show collection is comprised of original video masters for 13 half-hour television programs taped in a Los Angeles studio circa 1975. Billed as "America's only rhythm and blues TV series," the program featured Johnny Otis with his stellar band and back-up singers, the Otisettes, along with many of the great R&B artists as guests. Regulars included Delmar "Mighty Mouth" Evans, Marie Adams & the Three Tons of Joy, Joe Turner, Twiggy Hamilton, Roy Milton, Shuggie Otis (Johnny's son), Pee Wee Crayton, Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson, and Cardella Di Millo. Melody Maker (a London magazine) described the program as "a happy, unpretentious show that harks back to the halcyon days of R&B" while a San Francisco Chronicle critic exclaimed, "if you would like an instant history of one large segment of popular music, The Johnny Otis Show must be one of the greatest blues/R&B/rock & roll shows ever put together as one act!"
The Johnny Otis's Oldies but Goodies musical revue was a live show in L.A., similar in nature to the popular television programs American Bandstand and Soul Train, where popular artists lip-synched to their hit recordings while members of the audience danced along. Otis's revue featured R&B artists that had been popular during the early days of the rock & roll era, hence the "oldies" designation. Griffiths taped many of these performances between 1975 and 1977, resulting in approximately five hours of footage and including nearly 100 hit songs. Between segments Otis casually chatted with guests before introducing their songs. Of particular interest are numerous performances by Etta James, who was originally discovered by Otis, and who teams up with Richard Berry on her hit song "Roll With Me Henry." Other performers include the Penguins, the Coasters, Richard Berry, Ted Taylor, Richard Berry, Shirley & Lee, Bobby Day, the Medallions, Joe Houston, the Robins, Gene & Eunice, and many more.
These videos are highly recommended for anyone interested in the history and development of black music and the classic sound of R&B.
This collection contains about eighty 45 rpm records from Stan Lewis' personal collection.
This collection includes materials created during Johnny Otis's career as a musician, artist, writer, minister, civil rights activist and radio deejay. Personal papers consist primarily of articles, biographical information, programs and press clippings from 1949-2012. Writings include copies of Otis's L.A. Sentinel column "Let's Talk" from 1960-1964, an undated article on rhythm and blues music and books published from 1993-2009. Photographs span the years from 1940-1994 and feature portraits of Otis with many notable rhythm and blues artists, candid photos taken during camping and hunting trips, family portraits, and performances at various venues including the Barrelhouse and the Hollywood jazz club Shelly's Manne-Hole. Other images capture Otis in radio, television and recording studios and his participation in political activities.
The bulk of the collection documents "The Johnny Otis Show" radio programs through recorded airchecks, original handwritten cue sheets and tape logs compiled at Indiana University. The weekly radio programs are divided into two subseries, beginning with Otis's "Blue Monday" edition broadcast over KPPC-AM (Pasadena) from 1970-1972. In addition to playing the music of blues and rhythm and blues artists, the shows feature interviews and live performance segments by artists ranging from Freddy King, Joe Liggins and Frank Zappa to Shuggie and Nicky Otis. The majority of the airchecks are from the second subseries, broadcast from 1982-1994 over public radio stations KPFK (Los Angeles) and KPFA (Berkeley) and syndicated by Pacifica. These programs frequently include musical guests from the glory days of rhythm and blues as well as call-ins from radio listeners, while other programs follow the standard deejay hosted format with Otis introducing R&B, jazz and gospel records and publicizing local events. In 1993, Otis opened the Johnny Otis Market and Cabaret in Sebastopol where he broadcast his show live, often featuring members of his band. The most notable live broadcasts were recorded at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1984 and Chicago Blues Festival in 1993; other shows were broadcast live from hotels where Otis was performing with his band.
Other time-based media in the collection includes Otis's appearance at the 1998 Society for Ethnomusicology conference at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he participated in an interview, forum, and performed at the closing concert with the IU Soul Revue.
