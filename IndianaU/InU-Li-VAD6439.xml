    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Josiah Gregg, 1806-1850, was born on 19 July 1806 in Overton County, Tennessee. In the 1820s, he studied law and surveying and became a school teacher at Liberty, Missouri. Due to declining health, Gregg traveled with a merchant caravan to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1831. In 1844, he published <emph>Commerce of the Prairies</emph>, a two-volume account of his time spent as a trader on the Santa Fe Trail from 1831 to 1840; it includes Gregg's observations of the geography, botany, geology, and culture of New Mexico. The book was an immediate success and went through several editions. His map of the Santa Fe Trail and surrounding plains was the most detailed to that time. In 1849, Gregg joined the California Gold Rush. On November 5 of that year, he led a party of ill-provisioned miners west from a mining camp on the Trinity River to find "Trinity Bay" (later named Humboldt Bay). At the end of this expedition, he reportedly died of a fall from his mount due to starvation near Clear Lake, California, on 25 February 1850.</p><p>John Bigelow, Sr., 1817-1911, was born on 25 November 1817 in Malden-on-Hudson, New York. He graduated from Union College in 1835 and was admitted to the bar in 1838. From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the New York Evening Post. Bigelow began his political career as a reform Democrat, working with William Cullen Bryant in New York. In 1848, his antislavery convictions led him to leave the party, and in 1856, he led other former Democrats into the newly-formed Republican party. After being elected president in 1860, Abraham Lincoln appointed Bigelow American Consul in Paris. Bigelow helped block attempts to have France and the United Kingdom intervene in the American Civil War in favor of the Confederacy. In 1865, he was appointed American ambassador to France. Bigelow was Secretary of State of New York from 1872 to 1876. He wrote several books, including <emph>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</emph> (1868) and <emph>The Life of Samuel J. Tilden</emph> (1895). Bigelow died on 19 December 1911.</p>  </bioghist>
