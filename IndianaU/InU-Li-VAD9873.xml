    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Lyle G. Adair, 1843-1918, was the nephew of abolitionist Rev. Samuel Lyle Adair. He grew up in Indiana and Ohio. He enlisted with the 81st Ohio Infantry as a priate in September 1861. His regiment served in Tennessee and Alabama and was heavily engaged at Shiloh. In January 1864 he joined the 3rd Alabama Infantry, an all Black Union regiment, as orderly sergeant. The 3rd Alabama Infantry was one of the first two Black regiments recruited in middle Tennessee. Stationed at Fort Pulaski, the 3rd Alabama was charged with guarding critical rail lines between Tennessee and Alabama. In June 1864, the regiment changed its name to the 111th United States Colored Infantry, which served until April 1866. Lyle G. Adair died 28 Nov 1918 in Terre Haute at the age of 73.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Adair, Lyle G. mss., 1863-1864, consists of wartime correspondence of Lyle G. Adair during his service with the 111th United States Colored Infantry. His letters comment on race relations during the height of the Civil War. Adair wrote six letters from May 6, 1863, to July 21, 1864, to his mother, Nancy Templin Adair, describing his service with the 3rd Alabama Infantry. In his letters he describes the early interactions of Black soldiers with the white local population in occupied northern Alabama; his comrades, their mannerisms, his assessment of their performance as soldiers, his developing kinship with them; and his outrage over the Confederate massacre of approximately 300 Black soldiers at Fort Pillow in April 1864.</p>  </scopecontent>
