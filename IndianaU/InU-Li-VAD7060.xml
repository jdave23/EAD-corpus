    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Robert Southey, 1774-1843, was an English poet whose work fell within the Romantic school. He was part of the "Lake Poets" group and was friends with poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Despite his vocal support for the French Revolution at the beginning of his career and his initial reputation as a radical, he served as poet laureate of the United Kingdom from 1813 to 1843 and was subsequently derided by his contemporaries for his support of the Tory establishment. His prolific output included poetry, reviews, and histories, but his poetic reputation rests on his "exotic" epic poems, including <title render="italic">Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), <title render="italic">Madoc</title> (1805), <title render="italic">The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), and <title render="italic">Roderick the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</p><p>Born the son of a Bristol linen draper, he was expelled from Westminster school for producing with his friends a satirical magazine, the <title render="italic">Flagellant,</title> in 1792, which included a critique of the school's system of corporal punishment. Afterwards he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford. In addition to <title render="italic">Wat Tyler,</title> a poem about the 1381 English peasant rebellion, and <title render="italic">Joan of Arc,</title> a poem in which the eponymous Joan of Arc defends France from English invaders, and in 1794 he coauthored with Samuel Taylor Coleridge the play <title render="italic">The Fall of Robespierre.</title> He and Coleridge also planned to set up a utopian "Pantisocracy" in Pennsylvania, a plan that never materialized due to lack of funds. Instead, in 1795, Southey married seamstress Edith Fricker and Coleridge married Fricker's sister Sara, and in 1800 the two couples settled at Greta Hall in the Lake District in Spain. Southey would remain there for the rest of his life as one of the "Lake Poets."</p><p>Southey learned Spanish and Portuguese and began translating literature from these languages into English as well as writing Spanish and Portuguese literary biographies. The Peninsular War (1807-1814), during which the UK assisted Spain and Portugal against the invasion of Napoleon, turned Southey's sympathies toward the Tory establishment. He began writing for the conservative <title render="italic">Quarterly Review,</title> and in 1813, Southey accepted the post of poet laureate of the United Kingdom. For his political turn he was criticized by William Hazlitt and parodied ruthlessly by Lord Byron in <title render="italic">The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822).</p>  </bioghist>
