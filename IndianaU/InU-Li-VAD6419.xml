    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Gilbert mss., 1867-1932 contains the typescripts of works and correspondence by Sir William Schwenck Gilbert (1836-1911). Born in London, Gilbert studied at the Great Ealing School and then King's College, London. After receiving his undergraduate degree in 1856, Gilbert then joined Civil Service for a brief period, and afterward the Militia until 1878. In the 1860s, as a way to make some money, Gilbert wrote fictional stories, drew illustrations, and composed theater reviews, many of which were parodic in nature. He also began to write plays, the best-known of which were <emph render="italic">Uncle Baby</emph> (1863), pantomimes in 1865 and 1866 like <emph render="italic">Hush-a-Bye, Baby, On the Tree Top</emph> (1866), and later (with partner composer Arthur Sullivan) several operas, including <emph render="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</emph> (1879). His works maintain their legacy in theater styles of various kinds: namely, in stage musicals and in absurdist and comic theater.</p>  </bioghist>
