    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Whitcomb Riley, 1849-1916, was an American poet and author known as the "Hoosier Poet." Born in Greenfield, Indiana, he was an indifferent student but a voracious reader, and he worked selling Bibles and painting houses while writing poetry. In 1874, he began working as an unpaid editor at <emph render="italic">The Greenfield News,</emph> and in 1875, he published his first poem in <emph render="italic">Hearth and Home</emph> magazine. In 1877, he began editing the <emph render="italic">Anderson Democrat,</emph> and in 1879, he joined the staff of the <emph render="italic">Indianapolis Journal.</emph> Several of his poems that appeared in the <emph render="italic">Indianapolis Journal</emph> were collected in his first volume <emph render="italic">"The Old Swimmin'-Hole" and 'Leven Other Poems</emph> (1883).</p><p>Riley's poetry is notable for its use of Indiana dialect and its depiction of small-town America. His work was enormously popular in his lifetime: Riley toured the country on the lecture circuit to perform his poetry and published over fifty volumes.</p>  </bioghist>

Hitt &amp; Co., publishers of 'The Old Swimmin'-Hole...,'" tear sheets for "The Object Lesson," noted as being by Riley and carrying penciled notations and changes, and two clippings from 1909 re: a facsimile edition of <title render="doublequote">The Old Swimmin'-Hole</title> complete the collection. </p><p> Collection size: 26 items</p>  </scopecontent>
