    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Plomer mss. II, 1960-1964 consists of  letters between author Ian Fleming (1908-1964) and author William Plomer (1903-1973). Born in Lancaster, Fleming later studied at Durnford School and Eton College, where he was known for his attitude and womanizing behavior, and (for a brief one-year period) at the Royal Military College. In 1927, Fleming then prepared for entering the Foreign Office, but eventually failed at the examinations. Between 1927 and 1939, Fleming held various journalistic and baking positions. After that period, the Director of Naval Intelligence in the Royal Navy enlisted him as a personal assistant. He was later enrolled into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, through which he eventually became a lieutenant-commander. Fleming was famously in charge of Operation Goldeneye between 1941-1942, which sought to establish a stronghold of intelligence in Spain should the Nazis have taken over the area. After the war, Fleming turned to novel writing and in particular the spy genre. He channeled his personal and romantic life as well as his naval career when he wrote the first of the James Bond novels, <emph render="italic">Casino Royale</emph> (1953). He wrote fourteen others in the series, along with his children's novel <emph render="italic">Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang</emph> (1964) as well as a series of nonfiction works. </p><p>Born in Pietersburg, Plomer is known for his modernist novels that tackle rather controversial topics of the time: namely, interracial love and marriage as well as homosexuality. His works of note include <emph render="italic">Turbott Wolfe</emph> (1925), <emph render="italic">Sado </emph>(1931), several librettos for Benjamin Britten, and some poetry under the name Robert Pagan.</p>  </bioghist>
