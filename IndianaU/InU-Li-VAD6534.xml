    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Whitcomb Riley, 1849-1916, was an American poet and author known as the "Hoosier Poet." Born in Greenfield, Indiana, he was an indifferent student but a voracious reader, and he worked selling Bibles and painting houses while writing poetry. In 1874, he began working as an unpaid editor at <emph render="italic">The Greenfield News,</emph> and in 1875, he published his first poem in <emph render="italic">Hearth and Home</emph> magazine. In 1877, he began editing the <emph render="italic">Anderson Democrat,</emph> and in 1879, he joined the staff of the <emph render="italic">Indianapolis Journal.</emph> His first volume of poetry, <emph render="italic">"The Old Swimmin'-Hole" and 'Leven Other Poems,</emph> was published in 1883.</p><p>Riley's poetry is notable for its use of Indiana dialect and its depiction of small-town America. His work was enormously popular in his lifetime: Riley toured the country on the lecture circuit to perform his poetry and published over fifty volumes.</p><p>Charles Louis Holstein, 1843-1901, was a lawyer from Indiana. Magdalena (Nickum) Holstein, 1845-1916, was Charles Louis Holstein's wife. The Holsteins lived at 528 Lockerbie Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. Riley lived with the Holsteins as a boarder from 1893 until his death. His correspondence with them is often referred to as the "Lockerbie letters."</p>  </bioghist>
