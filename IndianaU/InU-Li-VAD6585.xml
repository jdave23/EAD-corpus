    <head>Biographical Note</head>
Lesley Payne, 1891-1976, was a musician and the niece of Indiana poet James Whitcomb Riley. She was born on January 23, 1891, the daughter of Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne, 1864-1936, sister of the Hoosier Poet, and Frank Charles Payne, 1862-1947, a newspaperman. Schooled as a violinist under Jacques Thibaud, Miss Payne went with her mother to Europe in 1908 to study and remained until the outbreak of the First World War. They were financially supported by Riley, and following Riley's death in 1916 they were named heirs with the Eitel cousins to the Riley estate. She lived most of her life in Noblesville, Indiana and played violin in a symphony orchestra. Lesley Payne died on November 3, 1976 and is remembered as "the poet's favorite niece." 

Louis James, 1909-1971, was an artist and former owner of the Keats life mask. He was born on July 14, 1909 in Coldwater, Michigan to Myron F. Globensky and Hazel D. Globensky. After graduating from Elkhart High School in Elkhart, Indiana in 1927, he attended the Herron School of Art until 1932. He purchased the life mask at an antique market in Indianapolis and at some point added a terra-cotta finish to the plaster cast. He died in 1971.

John Keats, 1795-1821, was a prominent British Romantic poet. He was born on October 31, 1795 in London. As a young man he was apprenticed to a surgeon, but in 1816 he decided to devote himself to poetry (the same year the life mask was completed). His first volume of poems, <title render="italic">Poems by John Keats</title>, was published in 1817. He spent much of his brief career as a poet writing long epic poems, such as <title render="italic">Endymion</title> (1818), influenced by his reading of Greek myths. 1818-1819 was his most prolific period, cut short by the death of his brother from tuberculosis. His most famous poems include <title render="italic">Hyperion</title> (another epic poem, unpublished until 1856), "Ode on a Grecian Urn," "Ode on Melancholy," and "Ode to a Nightingale." Keats contracted tuberculosis himself in 1819, and he died on February 23, 1821 in Rome.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The James mss., 1911?-1971, consists chiefly of those letters of musician Lesley Payne, 1891-1976, to artist Louis James, 1909-1971, concerning a copy of a life mask of the poet John Keats. With the material are two framed photographs: one of Lesley Payne and her mother, Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken sometime during their stay in Paris, 1908-1914, and one of Mary Elizabeth (Riley) Payne taken by James in 1930. Miss Payne, in a letter of February 20, 1971, commented on the recent death of Paul Hadley, who in 1917 had designed the Indiana state flag. </p><p> The copy of the Keats mask is present in the collection, along with a magazine clipping and James' information about it. The original of the life mask was made by Benjamin Robert Haydon in December 1816. This copy is presumed to have been the one given by James Whitcomb Riley to the Art Association of Indianapolis and acknowledged by them on October 24, 1911. Louis James, as Louis James Globenskey, attended the Herron School of Art between 1927-1933, during which time he acquired the mask in Indianapolis and at a later date gave it a terra cotta exterior. </p><p> A later addition of 7 scanned photo slides of the Paynes and John Keats' life mask completes the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
