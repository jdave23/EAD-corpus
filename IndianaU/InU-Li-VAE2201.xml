    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Richard Owen, 1810-1890, was a geologist and natural scientist known for his expertise on earthquakes. After moving from Scotland to settle at New Harmony, Indiana – a social experiment founded by his father, Robert Owen – Owen assisted his brother, David Dale Owen, with geological surveys and projects, eventually taking over his brother's position as Indiana state geologist after David Dale's death. During his time serving the Union army in the Civil War, Owen oversaw Camp Morton, a prison camp for captured Confederate soldiers; his humanitarian treatment of the prisoners was widely praised. After the war, Owen joined the faculty at Indiana University and served as chair of the natural science department, going on to serve as Purdue University's first president in 1872 for two years. In 1890, Owen drank embalming fluid mistakenly labeled "medicated water" and passed away.</p>  </bioghist>
