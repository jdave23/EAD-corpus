    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Sir Compton Mackenzie, 1883-1972, was a writer, Scottish nationalist, and cultural commentator. He was born Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie on January 17, 1883 in West Hartlepool, County Durham, England. He attended St. Paul's School in London and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with a degree in modern history. One of his first early successes was his novel <title render="italic">Carnival</title> (1912), which was later adapted into a film three times as <title render="italic">The Ballet Girl</title> (1916), <title render="italic">Dance Pretty Lady</title> (1932) and <title render="italic">Carnival</title> (1946). His coming of age novel <title render="italic">Satire Street</title> (1913-1914) was known for its influence on other authors, such as George Orwell, who read it as children.  From 1913 to 1920, Mackenzie and his wife Faith Compton Mackenzie lived on the island of Capri, where he befriended William Somerset Maugham and converted to Catholicism in 1914. As a result of his experiences on Capri, Mackenzie published a trilogy of books with religious themes and two novels, <title>Vestal Fire</title> (1927) and <title render="italic">Extraordinary Women</title> (1928), based on the lives of the islanders, many of whom were homosexual. </p><p>After 1928, Mackenzie moved to Scotland where he co-founded the Scottish National Party and supported Scottish nationalism. He would go on to set two of his novels in Scotland: <title render="italic">Monarch of the Glen</title> (1941) and <title render="italic">Whisky Galore</title> (1947). Throughout the 1930s he held several positions, including rector of Glasgow University (1931–34), literary critic for the London Daily Mail (1931–35), and founder and editor of <title render="italic">Gramophone</title> magazine (1923–62). His two most notable, and controversial works, were also published in the 1930s. Mackenzie wrote the autobiographical <title render="italic">Greek Memories</title> (1932) based on his experiences working for British Intelligence during World War I. The British secret service later prosecuted him under the Official Secrets Act, claiming that he revealed secret information in the book. Mackenzie responded by attacking the secret service in his satirical <title render="italic">Water on the Brain</title> (1933). </p><p>Over the course of his career, Mackenzie published over a hundred books of different genres and subjects, including fiction, history, biography, literary criticism, satire, children's stories, and poetry. One of his last works was his autobiography, <title render="italic">My Life and Times</title>, published in ten volumes from 1963–1971. He was knighted in 1952 and died on November 30, 1972 in Edinburgh, Scotland. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The correspondence includes Mackenzie's letters to and from poets, novelists, publishers, and journalists. They deal primarily with literary figures and requests for articles on particular subjects. Many of the sixty letters to Martin Secker, 1882-1978, publisher, are of a personal nature. Included is also the agreement with James Brand Pinker appointing him as Mackenzie's literary agent accompanied by a letter of March 25, 1912, in which Pinker expresses the hope that this may be "the beginning of a long and prosperous alliance." </p><p>Correspondents represented include: Sir Arthur Beverley Baxter, Francis Victor Blackwell, George Blake, Mrs. Elsie Thornton Cook, Caradoc Evans, Faith (Stone) Lady Mackenzie, Lilian (MacSween) Lady Mackenzie, James Milne, Thomas Power O'Connor, James Brand Pinker, Herbert Greenhough Smith, Sewell Stokes, George Malcolm Thomson, Frank Whitaker, Wilfrid Whitten, Pearkes Withers, Barbara Frances (Adam) Wootton, and Baroness Wootton.</p><p>The collection also includes "The Grindstone," the opening chapter of a novel never completed, 1914; a collection of photographs; and a few printed items. Among the photographs are two of his wife, Faith (Stone) Lady Mackenzie; four of Mrs. Christine (Humphreys) Mavrogordato (Mrs. John Mavrogordato); and fifteen of Sir Compton Mackenzie from his childhood through his Oxford period, World War I, and Capri.</p><p>Note on Indexing Term - "Radio": Of interest is a Jan. 12, 1929 radio play entitled "Radio Drama" and a 1949 application for election to membership to the Radiowriters Association, London.</p>  </scopecontent>
