    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Peters mss., 1844-1967 contains the letters and manuscripts of John Addington Symonds (1840-1893) that were collected by Robert Louis Peters (1924-2014). Born in Bristol, England, Symonds studied at Harrow School and Oxford University. In 1862, Symonds was then elected to a fellowship at Magdalen. He is known for his lectures and essays on classical and Renaissance literature: in particular, his <emph render="italic">Introduction to the Study of Dante</emph> (1972), <emph render="italic">Studies in Greek Poets</emph> (1873-1876), and <emph render="italic">Renaissance in Italy</emph> (1875-1886). He is also known for <emph render="italic">A Problem in Greek Ethics</emph> (1873), often thought to be Symonds's advocacy for homoerotics, homosexuality, and/or intimate male friendships.</p><p>Robert Louis Peters was a poet and scholar of Victorian literature who was particularly fascinated with Symonds's writings. After serving in the American army in World War II, Peters studied English at the University of Wisconsin where he received his undergraduate, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees in Victorian literature. He then taught in several institutions of higher learning throughout the country, bringing him to the University of California, Irvine in 1967. He is known in part for co-editing the letters of Symonds. He also received a Fulbright Fellowship to Cambridge, England. In addition to several works of literary scholarship, Peters also wrote his own books of poetry as well as four memoirs.</p>  </bioghist>
