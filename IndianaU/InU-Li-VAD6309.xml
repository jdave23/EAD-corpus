    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Alexander H. Dunihue, 1807-1891, was a merchant in Bedford, Indiana. He was born in 1807 in Marietta, Ohio to Daniel Dunihue, 1769-1850, and Abigail (Poole) Dunihue. He was educated chiefly at Livonia, Indiana, and later came to Bedford, Indiana. He first worked as a clerk in the store of Samuel F. Irwin and Isaac Stewart. From 1830 to 1834, he worked in the store of Colonel William McLane, 1788-1873, merchant, banker, and farmer. They became business partners in 1834. Their partnership continued until 1856, when Colonel McClane moved to Texas. His son, Hiriam H. McClane, took up his father's share, and Dunihue and the younger McClane ran the store together for a time. Robert Kelly bought Hiriam McClane's share, and he and Dunihue ran the store together until 1870, when the firm name became Alexander H. Dunihue and son (the son's name being William). On February 7, 1836 Dunihue married Ann McLane, 1817-1887, daughter of William McLane. They had at least twelve children. The store ceased business in 1880, and Dunihue died on June 14, 1891. </p><p>Daniel R. Dunihue, 1812-1887, was cashier of the Bedford branch of the Indiana State Bank and operator of a summer resort at Indian Springs. He was born on March 9, 1812, the brother of Alexander H. Dunihue. He was a citizen of Bedford, Indiana for many years. In 1832 he served under his uncle, Colonel James B. Gardiner, Ohio editor and printer, in the removal of the Ohio Indians beyond the Mississippi River. In 1839, he married his cousin, Caroline L. Gardiner, 1815-1877. They had four children together. Caroline's sister, Harriet Eliza Gardiner, -1888, became the wife of Richard Wigginton Thompson, 1809-1900, lawyer, U.S. congressman, and secretary of navy in the Hayes administration. Daniel Dunihue died on December 15, 1887. </p>  </bioghist>
