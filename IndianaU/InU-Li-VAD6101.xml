    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Benjamin Blish, who also published under the pseudonym William Atheling, Jr., was born on May 23, 1921, in East Orange, New Jersey. He studied zoology at Rutgers University and attended graduate school at Columbia University after serving in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1944. In 1950, Blish began writing science fiction short stories that he would later develop into the four-part Cities in Flight series that adalpted Oswald Spengler's cyclical theory of culture in a futuristic society. In 1959, he won the Hugo Award for A Case of Conscience, which launched another novel series, After Such Knowledge, centered on the theme of competition between science and religion. While working primarily as an advertising copy writer in the 1950s and 60s, Blish authored a number of other science fiction works and also was among the first literary critics of the science fiction genre. In the late 1960s, he transitioned into writing fiction full-time and moved to England. He devoted much of the rest of his career writing novelizations of the television series Star Trek with his wife, J. A. Lawrence. Blish died on July 30, 1975, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, at the age of 54.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Blish mss., 1966-1972, consist of letters from science fiction and fantasy writer James Benjamin Blish, 1921-1975, to editors at Doubleday and Company in New York. The majority of the letters are addressed to Lawrence P. Ashmead and concern manuscript corrections and changes, corrections on flap copy for various titles, and Blish's "abiding and far-reaching" interest in witchcraft. Concerning the latter matter, Blish planned to do a history of witchcraft, demonology, and magic, and proposals for that project are included in the collection. </p><p>Titles discussed in the letters include <emph>A Torrent of Faces</emph>, <emph>Nebula Award Stories 5</emph>, <emph>And All the Stars a Stage</emph>, and <emph>Anywhen</emph>.</p>  </scopecontent>
