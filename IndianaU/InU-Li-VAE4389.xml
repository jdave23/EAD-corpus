<p>The Thompson, Hunter S. mss. consist of correspondence and writings from 1960 and early 1961, a period when Thompson worked as a freelancer in Puerto Rico and Bermuda before moving to San Francisco and Big Sur, California. Collected by Joe Yasinski, the materials are housed in a custom enclosure decorated with red marbled paper. </p><p>The typescript correspondence consists of Thompson's pitches to various publications, including to his hometown <title render="italic">The Courier Journal/The Louisville Times</title> and to <title render="italic">Playboy</title>; also included are responses, frequently rejections, from the publications. Of particular interest may be Thompson's May 14, 1961 letter to Walter Goodman at <title render="italic">Playboy</title> describing a conversation with author Henry Miller, another resident of Big Sur, California.</p><p>The collection also includes about a dozen typescript drafts of articles by Thompson with minor revisions in pen.

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) was an American journalist from Louisville, Kentucky. Credited as the founder of "Gonzo journalism," his writing is characterized by a high-energy, first-person narrative style that disregards traditional journalistic objectivity and blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction.</p><p>This collection includes material from Thompson's early career, after he had been honorably discharged from the Air Force and fired from the Middletown (New York) <title render="italic">Daily Record,</title> when he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico to work for the magazine <title render="italic">El Sportivo,</title> a job which quickly fell through. Afterwards, he bounced between short-lived journalism gigs and odd jobs in the Caribbean, the United States, and South America. The turning point in Thompson's career came in 1965, when <title render="italic">The Nation</title> hired him to write about Hell's Angels; the material was published as a book, <title render="italic">Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga,</title> in 1966. His style reached its apotheosis with his 1971 novel <title render="italic">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,</title> which was serialized in <title render="italic">Rolling Stone</title> under the byline Raoul Duke, with illustrations by Ralph Steadman. Blending fiction and autobiography, the book is a lurid and hallucinogenic narrative of illicit drug use and a meditation on the failures of 1960s counterculture and the death of the American Dream. Thompson's literary output dwindled in the mid-1970s due to the pressures of celebrity and his heavy drinking and drug use, though by that time he had already achieved cult status for his colorful journalistic persona. He died by suicide in 2005.</p>  </bioghist>
