    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Claude McKay was a Jamaican poet and writer, an influential member of the Harlem Renaissance, and supporter of communism. In 1922, he traveled to Russia with Max Eastman. Throughout the 1920s and 30s he also spent time in France, Germany, Spain, and Morocco. Upon his return to the United States in 1934 he became interested in starting a new periodical of African affairs called <emph render="italic">Bambara</emph>. Shortly thereafter he spent a few months at Camp Greymont in New York, a work relief camp. He continued to write, to endeavor to have his writings published, to struggle with privation and ill-health, and to recall the days when he served as an editor on <emph render="italic">The Liberator</emph>, the magazine co-founded by Max Eastman and his sister, Crystal Eastman. He later became disillusioned with communism, due in part to his anti-Stalinism. In 1944 he became a consultant on Communism and the Negro and on the Russian Revolution to the Catholic Youth Organization in Chicago, Illinois. The following October he was baptized into the faith of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1946 McKay went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for his health. He died in 1948 in Chicago, Illinois.</p>  </bioghist>

A telegram in 1948 from his friend Selma Burke announcing his funeral arrangements and a letter of 1968 from literary agent Carl Cowl both refer to McKay's daughter, Mrs. Hope (McKay) Virtue.</p><p> Included also are receipts for money forwarded to Claude McKay by Eastman, printed material by and about McKay, and snapshots of McKay's tombstone, Hope (McKay) Virtue, and Carl Cowl.</p><p> The correspondents in the collection are Donald Clifford Brace, Selma Burke, Grace Campbell, Carl Cowl, Max Eastman, Gustave Lippman, Claude McKay, Charles F. Paterno, John J. Trounstine, Oswald Garrison Villard, and Vivian Lancaster Virtue.</p>  </scopecontent>
