<p>Albert Ludwig Kohlmeier, 1883-1964, was a professor of history at Indiana University. He was born on March 24, 1883, in Mackey in Gibson County, Indiana, the son of Julius and Anna (Kramer) Kohlmeier. He graduated from Oakland City High School and enrolled at Indiana University, completing his B.A. degree in 1908. He received an M.A. degree in 1911 and Ph.D. in 1920, both from Harvard University under the direction of Edward Channing. Kohlmeier taught grade school in southern Indiana 1901-1903, served as principal of the Oakland City High School, 1905-1907, and was head of the history department at New Albany, Indiana, High School, 1908-1910. He married Lucie Charlotte Mayhall on September 14, 1910. At Indiana University, he was an instructor in history at Indiana University 1912-1914, made assistant professor in 1914, associate professor in 1917, full professor in 1921, and head of the department of history in 1926, a position he held until 1948.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Kohlmeier mss., 1940-1949, consists of speeches and notes made by Albert L. Kohlmeier. Although his field of specialization was American history, the wide range of topics evident in these speeches demonstrate his versatility in dealing with the problems of modern history. One address dealt with the exploits and significance of "Oliver Cromwell" in English history, while another was concerned with the problem of "New Imperialism" in the world during the latter half of the nineteenth century.</p><p> The area of the philosophy of history is well represented in Kohlmeier's speeches and they are a definite contribution in man's theoretical approach to history. Some examples are "Human Energy" and "The Incarnation of Thought." With respect to American history his speeches include: "The Undertow of Puritan Influence," "Revolution," "Social and Economics Aspects of the American Revolution," "Antecedents as Causes in History," and "Washington." The area of American historiography is represented by two selections entitled, "Historical Documents" and "Individual Consciousness." Great American statesmen are included as topics in the speeches, notably the one already mentioned on George Washington and the two addresses devoted to Abraham Lincoln namely, "Lincoln in Indiana" and "Lincoln, the Son of Man." The speeches are arranged alphabetically by title.</p><p> Included are also mimeographed course and reading outlines.</p>  </scopecontent>
