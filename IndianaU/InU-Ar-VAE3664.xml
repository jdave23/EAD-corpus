    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Willkie Quadrangle, named after Wendell L. Willkie, opened in the fall of 1964 as a residence hall for men and women. Born in Elwood, Indiana, Wendell Willkie became an accomplished attorney, businessman, and statesman. He completed his bachelor's and law degrees at Indiana University. </p><p>Construction of the Willkie Quadrangle buildings began in July 1963 and was completed in February 1965, but the first students were able to move in for the fall semester of 1964. At its opening, the Willkie Quadrangle residence hall was the tallest residence hall on campus, with two eleven-story buildings and accommodations for 589 men and 577 women. Each building had utility and laundry rooms, a student lounge, recreation and TV areas, and single and double bedrooms and a smaller lounge on each of the 11 floors. The service building had kitchen, dining and library facilities. </p><p>Willkie Quadrangle had an organized student government, with governors representing each of the units to formulate dress codes, approve budgets, and create an election code. Willkie Quadrangle had its own newspaper staff, glee club, and at least two magazines: a literary magazine called The Thistle, and a general interest magazine called Willkie Life.</p><p>There were two cooperative living units in the center building of the quadrangle, which housed 57 men and 57 women. Students who lived in these cooperative living units did their own housekeeping and performed dining hall duties, and in exchange they received housing at a cost lower than that of the regular residence halls on campus.</p><p>In 1997, the board of trustees approved a $28 million renovation plan to convert Willkie Quadrangle from a traditional dormitory to a complex of suites and apartments. The renovation was completed in 1999, and in September 2000 the building was rededicated as the Willkie Residence Center.</p>  </bioghist>
