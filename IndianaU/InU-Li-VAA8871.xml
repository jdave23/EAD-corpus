    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>
Richard Curle, 1883-1968, was an author, traveler and bibliophile. In his early career he wrote leaders for such newspapers as the <title render="italic">Pretoria News</title> (South Africa), <title render="italic">The Rangoon Times</title> (Burma), and <title render="italic">The Daily Mail</title> (London). He also wrote articles for other newspapers and magazines, short stories, and books of fiction and non-fiction. In 1912 Curle was introduced to Joseph Conrad and, as a consequence of their long-standing friendship, much of Curle's writings and correspondence with colleagues and friends reflects his considerable knowledge of Conrad and his works.
</p>
<p>
Lady Margaret Brooke, 1849-1936, was a writer and queen consort of the White Rajah of Sarawak. Born Margaret Alice Lili de Windt in England, she married the second White Rajah of Sarawak, Charles Brooke, in 1869, becoming the first Ranee, or "queen," of the region by marriage. She wrote a memoir about her life as queen titled <title render="italic">My Time in Sarawak</title> (1913) and enjoyed the company of many famous English writers once she returned to England after the birth of her last three children. 
</p>

<p>
Nigel Maxwell was a bibliographer who worked to compile <title render="italic">The Dictionary of the Works of Joseph Conrad</title>. 
</p>

<p>
J.M. (John Mackinnon) Robertson, 1856-1933, was a prolific writer, journalist, and member of Parliament. Over the course of his career he worked as an editor and writer for the <title render="italic">Edinburgh Evening News</title> and London's <title render="italic">National Reformer</title>. He was a member of the Liberal party, a secularist, and a supporter of free trade and rationalism.
