    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Cronin mss., 1957-1958, consists of two holograph notebooks, a study of James Joyce, draft of an essay on Joyce's Ulysses, and galley proofs of the first half of the review of Stanislaus Joyce's <emph render="italic">My Brother's Keeper</emph> of Anthony Cronin, 1923-2016, author. </p><p> The notebook bound in blue cloth contains seventy-eight pages of notes and drafts of poems, a ten-page prose passage, and a four-page letter to "Dear Mrs. Hutchinson." </p><p> The notebook bound in brown cloth may formerly have been the property of George Barker bearing the words <title render="doublequote">Notebook 1957-58. G.B.</title> on one page. A five-word phrase "This face won no smile" in purple ink on a page about quarter way into the book and a drawing of an erotic nature in pencil on another page near the beginning of the notebook are both attributed to George Barker. All other entries in pencil and blue ink on one hundred and twenty-four pages are in Cronin's hand. They consist of drafts for poems which range from single-line entries to poems, heavily revised, of fifteen or more lines; penciled notes on James Joyce, including a brief study of the early essay <title render="doublequote">Ibsen's New Drama</title>; a check list of books on Joyce; a list of chapter headings for a study of Joyce; brief notes towards reviews of books; and a draft list of twelve chapters of <emph render="italic">Finnegans Wake</emph>. </p><p> The original typescript of the critical and biographical study of James Joyce bears many deletions, revisions, and insertions in the hand of Cronin. The first chapter of twenty-eight pages is entitled <title render="doublequote">God Be With Old Times,</title> and the second chapter of only sixteen pages is entitled <title render="doublequote">Father John Conmee And All</title> is incomplete. A group of nine pages are largely concerned with the autobiographical element in <emph render="italic">Finnegans Wake</emph>. </p><p> Some phrases are underlined on the typescript in red of a draft of an essay on Joyce's <emph render="italic">Ulysses</emph> and page references and twelve words in pencil were added. </p><p> The galley proofs of the first half of Cronin's review of Stanislaus Joyce's <emph render="italic">My Brother's Keeper</emph> as printed in <emph render="italic">Time and Tide</emph>, May 10, 1958, were used for the essay on Joyce's <emph render="italic">Ulysses</emph>. </p><p> For biographical information on Anthony Cronin see L.G. Pine, <emph render="italic">The Authors &amp; Writers Who's Who</emph> (4th ed. London, 1960), p. 87. </p><p> Collection size: 4 items</p>  </scopecontent>
