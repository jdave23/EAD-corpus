<p>The University Interests Committee, which had been organized in 1912, moved into action in the 1920s to lobby the state legislature for funds on behalf of Indiana University and to generate interest in the University among civic and community leaders throughout Indiana. Lobbying became necessary at this time because in 1925 the state legislature adopted legislative appropriation as the method to be used in determining funding for public higher education in the state (previous budgets had been based on a percent of the mill tax collected). </p><p> In anticipation of the 1927 appropriations process, the University Interests Committee organized a statewide network of alumni, students, and community leaders to identify key legislators, assess their attitudes toward Indiana University, and press them to be favorable to IU in the allocation of funds. W.A. Alexander, who had headed the Memorial Fund Campaign, played an important role in the work of this committee as did the Memorial Regiment, an organization composed of participants in the Memorial Fund Campaign who had united earlier in 1926 to offer further volunteer service to Indiana University. </p><p> The University Interests Committee set up the same kind of network for the 1929 legislative session. </p><p> A Women's University Interest Committee paralleled and overlapped with the University Interests Committee throughout this period.</p> </bioghist>

<p>William Mitchell Daily was born in Coshocton, Ohio, in 1812, but was raised in Indiana. He became a Methodist minister at the age of 19 and traveled throughout Indiana preaching. In 1835 he came to Bloomington with his ministry and began studies at Indiana University; he graduated the following year. Daily moved to St. Louis in 1838 and worked as an agent for the Missouri Conference. Shortly after this move he became a professor at St. Charles College. He returned to Indiana in 1840 to recover from a medical condition called hemorrhage of the lungs; upon recovery, he resumed his ministerial career. Daily married Permelia Northcraft in 1843 while he was a minister in Madison, Indiana. Beginning in December 1844 until November 1845 Daily served as Chaplain to the United States House of Representatives. Later he became an agent for Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw) and a member of the Indiana General Conference in 1852.</p><p> Upon his return to Bloomington, he became a member of the Board of Trustees at Indiana University on February 10, 1853, and attended his first meeting on July 30, 1853. On August 3, a mere day and a half after the resignation of President Ryors, the Board elected Daily as the third president of the university. Daily's appointment came in the midst of rife sectarianism on campus and in the community. From the beginnings of the university, Presbyterians had constituted most of the school's staff and faculty. This caused the Bloomington community to raise questions about the diversity of the school and about the politics involved. The Indiana Methodist Conference, established in 1832, made it a priority to be represented at the university itself, not just on the board. The sect met with certain opposition. Samuel Bigger, who was elected Indiana governor in 1840, declared that "there was not a Methodist in America with sufficient learning to fill a professor's chair if it were tendered him." (Woodburn p.115) But in 1853 the state had a new governor, Joseph A. Wright, who believed Daily's status as a Methodist and a Democrat could help the institution with its financial troubles. Daily's lack of credentials as an educator, however, caused many members of the IU faculty to feel he was unqualified for such an important position.</p><p> Daily's presidency was threatened in July 1858, when Dr. Alexander M. Murphy filed eleven separate charges against him. These charges included incompetence, plagiarism, and incurrence of debt. Other charges concerned incidents of sexual advances towards young women while his wife was away, with these being particularly damning. Murphy maintained that Daily was a "lecher and a lewd man at heart," and that he had used his position to seduce women. </p><p> Murphy's statements were compounded by other incidents involving Daily at the end of 1858. Louisa J. Smith, who did not know Daily, stated that on December 29, a strange man had accosted her in the street-the man matched Daily's description. On New Year's Eve, prominent Indianapolis citizens William Wallace and Benjamin Harrison (future President of the United States) testified that they had seen Daily intoxicated in public. These complaints came to the Board with Murphy's charges in January 1859. The body decided that Murphy would need to produce a list of witnesses to sustain the accusations. The next morning, instead of producing this list, Murphy dropped the charges altogether.</p><p> Although none of the charges against Daily were substantiated, he resigned his presidency on January 26, 1859, "in order that the unfavorable publicity connected with the trial might not be prejudicial to the University." (Myers p. 328) In a separate farewell address he delivered in February, Daily spoke of the affair as "slimy subterranean damnable conspiracies, brought about by malignant selfish, fiendish, devilish men who are instigated by malice." He also called the members of the faculty "a set of pusillanimous, narrow-minded bigots." </p><p> Local Methodists were disappointed by Daily, who was the first major Methodist faculty member at the University. In October 1859, the Indiana Methodist Conference met in Bloomington to decide upon Daily's fate in the association. It was a closed meeting; there were no witnesses presented and no minutes recorded, except for the decision: William Daily was expelled from connection with the conference. Regardless of the university's decision, the Conference felt that Daily should have been free of all suspicion in his position. </p><p> During the last years of his life Daily continued his ministry. Anxious to move South, he accepted the appointment of President Lincoln to become hospital chaplain in 1862. He served with the Louisiana Conference beginning in 1869. Daily was in the midst of this new career in the North New Orleans district when he became ill and died a few days later on February 5, 1877. He is buried in Madison, Indiana.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Indiana is a state that is part of the American Midwest. Sitting at the "crossroads of America," Indiana borders Lake Michigan to the north, Illinois to the west, Ohio to the east, and Kentucky to the south. Indiana was the 19th state to enter the union, being admitted on December 11, 1816. Indianapolis became the state capital in 1825. The state is known for its people, known as "Hoosiers,"; its industries, including agriculture, quarrying, and mining; and its transportation infrastructure. </p><p> The area that would later become the state of Indiana was first inhabited by members of the Miami Confederation, including the Miami and Potawatomi. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, French traders established the first white settlements in the area. After the land was claimed for the United States during the American Revolution, it was added to the Northwest Territory by the Ordinance of 1787. The 18th century brought with it an influx of white immigrants and settlers to the area, leading to a series of conflicts with the native inhabitants. Battles continued until 1811, when the Battle of Tippecanoe was won by future-president William Henry Harrison. Further settlement of the area and statehood soon followed.</p> </bioghist>

<p>The Finlay mss., 1953-1972 contains of correspondence and writings by Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006). An influential proponent of concrete poetry, Finlay moved from solely literary forms of poetry, drama, and short stories in the 1950's to kinetic forms of poetry expressed in stone, wood, neon and other tangible structures in the 1960's. Boats and boating, sails and the sea were used by Finlay to suggest poetic ideas in many of his poems such as Archangel of Archangel, Boatyard, Four Sails, The Four Seasons..., Homage to Gomringer, Little Drummer boy, The Old Nobby, Seashells, Sepia Barge and others. Sundials were used in like manner as in Arcadian Sundials, Biggar Sundial, and Land/Sea Indoor Sundial. Letters exchanged with woodcarvers, stone carvers, photographers, typographers, printers, and artists give the instructions for the creation of many of his works. A book of poems, <title render="italic">Poems to See and Hear</title>, was prepared especially to introduce to children Finlay's poetic concepts. During 1968 to 1971 there was much work by Films of Scotland in the preparation of the films <title render="italic">Ocean Stripe 5</title> and <title render="italic">KY 365</title> based on Finlay's life and poetry. </p><p> Following an agreement with the Fulcrum Press in June 1968 to publish an edition of <title render="italic">The Dancers Inherit the Party</title>, a controversy developed over the next several years concerning the first appearance of the work.

<p>The Temperance Movement was a social movement against the sale or drinking of alcoholic beverages. In Britain, the movement reached its peak in the mid-to-late 1800s, as alcohol consumption and alcohol-related violence was a wide-spread problem. Advocates formed numerous societies and associations to combat alcoholism, each group with their own ideas about how to go about stamping out the problem. Some advocated moderation in drinking, while others espoused complete abstinence; some focused on the religious message of temperance, while others sought to put pressure on the government to pass temperance legislation. The Central Association for Stopping the Sale of Intoxicating Liquor on Sundays, centered in Manchester, England, focused on petitioning Parliament to pass legislation that would close public houses and bars on Sundays. During the 1860s and 70s, the issue became highly politicized as the Temperance Movement became closely tied to the aims of the Liberal Party.</p> </bioghist>

<p>As a scholar of library science, Walter Lange conducted several bibliographical studies, while actively working as a rare text collector. For his Master of Arts degree, Lange wrote a dissertation on the French Revolution and the "lost Dauphin," the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who was rumored to survive the French Revolution. Lange was also interested in the Wise Forgeries, concerning Thomas James Wise, a widely known book collector later turned out to be a forger. To investigate Wise's case, Lange exchanged correspondence with various scholars and collectors. One noteworthy part of the Lange collection is his own collection of the autographs related to the French Revolution. For several years, Lange conducted research on the rumor and the false claimants of the lost Dauphin, during which he created a collection of letters, hand-written documents, and notes of highly important figures, such as Karl Wilhelm Naudorff and Eleazar Williams, both widely known false claimants in the nineteenth century. His collection also encompasses first-hand records of the contemporaneity by French nobility and royal members, along with autographs and original letters of others who are less directly connected to the French royal family and the revolution. Besides the French Revolution, Lange's study on the Wise forgeries is also taking up a huge portion of the collection, although this part mainly consists of Lange's correspondence and book catalogues rather than firsthand texts. Lange also left a vast amount of book and autograph catalogues along with letters with other book collectors, which reflect his deep bibliographic interest in various types of rare texts.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Eric Arthur Blair, better known under the pseudonym George Orwell, was born on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, Bengal, India, where his father worked as an opium agent for the Bengalese government under the British Raj. When Blair was three years old, his mother brought him and his siblings to England to receive an education at England's best schools. His family had an English aristocratic background but by Eric Blair's generation, their wealth had run dry, and so he relied on scholarships and the generosity of his maternal uncle to support his education. At a young age, Blair showed great intellectual aptitude and won a scholarship to attend Eton, but his stubborn resistance of authority and neglect of assigned tasks prevented him from attending university. Instead, he took the Indian Civil Service exams and joined the Burma police in 1921. While in Burma, he was not popular among his police colleagues and grew to resent British colonial rule and its effects on the Burmese people. In 1927, he resigned from his position to become a writer and live among the poor in England. A year later, he moved to Paris to write and, failing to find a publisher for his work, lived in poverty. His personal experiences inspired the first book he published, <emph>Down and Out in Paris and London</emph> (1933). His first novel, <emph>Burmese Days</emph> (1934), was so obviously based on his days as a discontented policeman in Burma that the work had to be published in the United States for fear of libel suits in England. </p><p>Over the next few years, Blair struggled to succeed professionally as a author and began to equate literary success with selling out. His big break came when in January 1936, Victor Gollancz gave him a large advance payment to write a book about poverty and unemployment, which resulted in his controversial <emph>The Road to Wigan Pier</emph> (1937) on working-class life in northern England. In June 1936, Blair married University College, London educational psychology student Eileen Maud O'Shaughnessy, 1905-1945. Though Blair was critical of political parties, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War aroused Blair's anti-fascist passion, and shortly after completing The Road to Wigan Pier in December 1938, he joined the independent Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista (POUM) militia to fight the Francoists, but found hostility from the Communists as well, which turned him ideologically against communism. In June 1937, Eileen helped a wounded Blair to escape Spain and return to England. Gollancz refused to publish Blair's subsequent indictment of the Communists for endangering the Spanish socialist cause in <emph>Homage to Catalonia</emph>, so the Trotskyite publisher Frederick Warburg published it in 1938. In the same year, Blair was diagnosed with tuberculosis and spent some time in a sanatorium and Morocco for recovery. He tried to join the army in World War II, but was rejected on account of his disease, and instead joined the Home Guard and worked as a BBC producer. During the war, he gained success as a political and literary essayist. In 1944, Blair tried to publish his seminal <emph>Animal Farm</emph>, but many publishers, including Gollancz, refused to put it out while Russia was still an ally. Shortly after the war, Harcourt Brace published the book with massive success. After the death of his wife, Blair wrote <emph>Nineteen Eighty-Four</emph> (1949) in seclusion and dying of tuberculosis on the island of Jura. At age 46, the writer succumbed to the disease in a London hospital on January 21, 1950. </p> </bioghist>

Asif Currimbhoy, 1928-1994, was a playwright born in Mumbai, India. He attended St. Xavier's High School in Mumbai, where he learned English, and he went on to study at the University of California and the University of Wisconsin in the United States. His exposure to Western culture (especially the works of William Shakespeare) heavily influenced his playwriting, but he also drew on his experiences as a non-practicing Muslim and his own native Indian culture. Currimbhoy essentially laid the foundation of modern Indian drama and is one of the most significant figures in Indian English literature.
</p>

<p>

His plays are characterized by variety and versatility; he seldom created a structured plot, relying instead on the interaction of the physical action with other dramatic elements like music, film footage, and slide projections. Many of his characters are social outcasts living in Mumbai shantytowns, and his plots explore themes such as postcolonialism, racial tension, the interactions of Eastern and Western culture, and social inequality. His most famous play, <title render="italic">Goa</title>, was published in 1964. Other notable works include <title render="italic">The Doldrummers</title> (1960), <title render="italic">The Dumb Dancer</title> (1961), <title render="italic">The Hungry Ones </title>(1965), <title render="italic">The Refugee</title> (1971), <title render="italic">Sonar Bangla</title> (1972), and <title render="italic">The Dissident M.L.A.</title> (1974).

<p>Eugene Victor Debs, 1855-1926, was a socialist leader and labor organizer. He was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, and left home at 14 to work in the railroad industry as a locomotive fireman. He married Kate Metzel on June 9, 1885, and they made their permanent home in Terre Haute. A strong proponent of organized labor, Debs became the president of the American Railway Union in 1893, and his first imprisonment came as a result of his prominent role in the 1894 Pullman Palace Car Company strike. He discovered the works of Karl Marx while in prison and became a Socialist in 1897. He ran for president as the Socialist Party candidate in 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920, the latter election occurring, famously, while Debs was in prison again for criticizing the government's enforcement of the 1917 Espionage Act. His time in jail negatively affected his health, and he spent the remaining years of his life at Lindlahr Sanitarium in Elmhurst, Illinois. </p><p>

<p>David Horton was a lawyer who corresponded with the Pound family, mainly with Ezra Pound and his wife Dorothy Pound. Horton also worked with John Kasper as publishers of the Square Dollar Series, which produced several works by Pound, such as Pound's translation of the Confucian Analects. A large portion of Horton's collection is his correspondence with the Pound family, along with correspondence with various people about Ezra Pound. However, materials about Pound are not limited to the letters only, as Horton preserved a wide range of items from Pound's publications to Pound's hand-written notes and comments on society, politics, and the economy. The date span of the collection overlaps with the period when Ezra Pound was accused of Fascism, imprisoned, and hospitalized. The fierce controversy surrounding Pound during this time is reflected on Horton's collection, which contains various materials such as articles, statements, and legal and medical documents by diverse people that both criticize and defend Pound. His careful records of his publishing business (the Square Dollar Series) also provide insight into how Pound's works were published and circulated.</p> </bioghist>

Thomas Richardson of the Association and partner of the Stephenson Company in Newcastle offered the post of engineer to Robert Stephenson, the son of George Stephenson.

William Ireland created his first Shakespeare forgery in 1794: a fake document containing a fake signature of Shakespeare's. He gave this document to his father, much to Samuel Ireland's delight. After an expert confirmed Ireland's forgery as "genuine," he grew bolder.

This incident, coupled with the publication of Edmond Malone's book <title render="italic">An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments</title> on March 31, 1796, exposed Ireland as a forger and all his documents as fakes.

One of his first early successes was his novel <title render="italic">Carnival</title> (1912), which was later adapted into a film three times as <title render="italic">The Ballet Girl</title> (1916), <title render="italic">Dance Pretty Lady</title> (1932) and <title render="italic">Carnival</title> (1946). His coming of age novel <title render="italic">Satire Street</title> (1913-1914) was known for its influence on other authors, such as George Orwell, who read it as children. From 1913 to 1920, Mackenzie and his wife Faith Compton Mackenzie lived on the island of Capri, where he befriended William Somerset Maugham and converted to Catholicism in 1914. As a result of his experiences on Capri, Mackenzie published a trilogy of books with religious themes and two novels, <title>Vestal Fire</title> (1927) and <title render="italic">Extraordinary Women</title> (1928), based on the lives of the islanders, many of whom were homosexual. </p><p>After 1928, Mackenzie moved to Scotland where he co-founded the Scottish National Party and supported Scottish nationalism. He would go on to set two of his novels in Scotland: <title render="italic">Monarch of the Glen</title> (1941) and <title render="italic">Whisky Galore</title> (1947). Throughout the 1930s he held several positions, including rector of Glasgow University (1931–34), literary critic for the London Daily Mail (1931–35), and founder and editor of <title render="italic">Gramophone</title> magazine (1923–62). His two most notable, and controversial works, were also published in the 1930s. Mackenzie wrote the autobiographical <title render="italic">Greek Memories</title> (1932) based on his experiences working for British Intelligence during World War I. The British secret service later prosecuted him under the Official Secrets Act, claiming that he revealed secret information in the book. Mackenzie responded by attacking the secret service in his satirical <title render="italic">Water on the Brain</title> (1933). </p><p>Over the course of his career, Mackenzie published over a hundred books of different genres and subjects, including fiction, history, biography, literary criticism, satire, children's stories, and poetry. One of his last works was his autobiography, <title render="italic">My Life and Times</title>, published in ten volumes from 1963–1971. He was knighted in 1952 and died on November 30, 1972 in Edinburgh, Scotland. </p> </bioghist>

<p>Alice Garrigue Masaryk, 1879-1966, was a Czech sociologist. She was born on May 3, 1879, the daughter of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, 1850-1937, president of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1935), and his wife Charlotte Garrigue. Alice's brother Jan Masaryk served as the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1940 to 1948. After graduating from high school in 1898, Alice enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague, one of very few women to do so. She later switched to the Faculty of Arts, furthered her studies in London, Berlin, and Leipzig, and received her Doctorate in 1903. She then traveled to the United States to study at the University of Chicago Social Settlement (UCSS), where she met Julia Lathrop, Mary McDowell and Jane Addams. After returning to Czechoslovakia in 1907, Masaryk worked as a teacher in Prague and České Budějovice until 1910. During World War I, she was arrested and accused of treason by the Austro-Hungarian Empire for failing to produce political papers belonging to her father, who had been advocating for Czechoslovak independence. She spent eight months in prison in Vienna before she was released. When the Czechoslovakian Republic was founded on October 28, 1918, Alice was named a member of parliament, and she acted as the first lady of the state after her mother's death in 1923. In 1919, Alice founded the Czechoslovak Red Cross (Československý červený kříž) and served as its president until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938. She was exiled to the United States for the duration of World War II, returned to Czechoslovakia briefly after the war, but was forced into exile a second time when the Soviet Union seized control of the country in 1948. Masaryk spent the remainder of her life in the United States, advocating for a democratic Czechoslovakia. She died on November 29, 1966.</p> </bioghist>

Like his colleague Sir Kenneth Clark at the National Gallery, Thomas organized educational and social programming at the museum to provide the public with entertainment and keep up morale in spite of the war. In 1944 he arranged "Mid-European Art," an exhibition of German expressionist art, strategically sponsored by the respected anti-Nazi Free German League of Culture.The artworks had been purchased from German emigres Tekla Hess, widow of Jewish shoe manufacturer and art collector Alfred Hess, and her son Hans, who fled Germany only to be detained by the British as an enemy alien and put to work as a farm laborer near Loughborough.

<p>After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, Washington Territory's governor Henry M. McGill activated a Territorial militia on May 10, 1861. Initial response was slow, but eventually a few county militias were formed. The primary role of the militia was to replace the soldiers who had been called to fight for the Union army in the east, especially those who had been staffing the various forts in the area. In the fall of 1861, Colonel Justus Steinberger was sent to organize a regiment of infantry in the Washington territory. He was again met with little enthusiasm; as a result, his "First Washington Volunteer Infantry" was composed of men from California, Oregon, and Washington. This infantry, which totaled approximately 1,000 men, never saw battle or faced any Confederate soldiers.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Jackson was born on February 11, 1895, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, the daughter of George L. Weymouth, 1865-1950, and Martha Stuart (Connell) Weymouth, 1865-l932. In 1897 the family moved to Richill, Missouri, where her father had a printing shop and a daily paper of his own. She graduated from Lake View High School and spent two years at Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Michigan in 1900. Her father became the editor of <title render="italic">Farm Life</title> and moved his family to Spencer, Indiana, where Jackson did editorial work for her father for a year, then took a position as secretary to the Dean of Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In 1917 she went to Boston to find war-related work, but eventually moved to Chicago to become associate editor of <title render="italic">Better Farming</title>. There she met Charles Carter Jackson, l892-l969, and was married on January 10, 1920. That Spring the family settled on a farm in Canada. Her daughter Martha Florence was born on October 7, 1920, and Elizabeth Ann was born on August 6, 1922, but, because of an injury her husband received in the war, farming was impossible and the winters were so severe that they came home again to Spencer, Indiana, where their son Charles Weymouth was born on April 1, 1924. Jackson began writing short articles and poems for farm papers, and in November 1923 the first Katherine stories appeared in <title render="italic">Farm Life</title> which ran until December 1925. She wrote novels, short stories, and articles for magazines such as <title render="italic">American Magazine</title>, <title render="italic">Country Gentleman</title>, <title render="italic">Good Housekeeping</title>, <title render="italic">Ladies Home Journal</title>, and <title render="italic">The Saturday Evening Post</title>. The Jacksons lived for a while in Indianapolis in order to give her children better educational advantages, but returned to Spencer, Indiana, where her husband published a magazine and they had a gift shop.

<p>Charles Ralph Boxer was born on March 8, 1904, in Sandown, Isle of Wight, England, to Hugh Edward Richard Boxer and Jane Patterson. He attended Wellington College from 1918 to 1921 and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from 1922 to 1923. In 1924, Boxer began his military service by joining the Lincolnshire Regiment. From 1930 to 1933, he was seconded to a regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army, an experience that stimulated his scholarly interest in East Asian cultures and history and impacted his later academic career. Before the start of World War II, Boxer made his mark in academic circles by publishing over eighty scholarly works. On June 8, 1939, he married Ursula Norah Anstice Tulloch (1909-1996), and Boxer was stationed in Hong Kong from 1939 to 1941 to serve as chief of army intelligence. While in Hong Kong, Boxer fell in love with the American feminist writer Emily (Mickey) Hahn (1905-1997). In December 1941, the Japanese invaded Hong Kong and took Boxer as a prisoner of war until the conclusion of World War II. The Japanese military also confiscated his prized rare book collection and transferred it to the Imperial Library; Boxer later recovered most of his library. In 1945, Boxer divorced Tulloch as a result of his widely publicized love affair, and he married Hahn in New York on November 28. Boxer retired from the army at the rank of major in 1947 and moved his family to the family estate in Broadmayne, Dorset, England. </p><p>Shortly after the end of his military career, Boxer was offered the Camoens chair of Portuguese in King's College London, which he accepted and held until his retirement from King's College in 1967, excepting a three-year period (1951-1953) when Boxer was professor of history of the Far East in the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. In 1955, Boxer moved to Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, England, which remained his permanent place of residence until his death. From 1967 to 1972, Boxer was simultaneously a research professor at Indiana University and professor of the history of the expansion of Europe at Yale University. In 1972, he retired from Yale as professor emeritus and continued to teach at Indiana University for seven more years. His initial research interests concerned early contact between Europeans, particularly the Dutch, the Portuguese, and Jesuit missionaries, and Japan, but Boxer later expanded his field of study to international history more broadly. He was a prolific writer and scholar, authoring about 350 books and articles. Boxer received many honors for his work, including election to the British Academy in 1957 and various honorary degrees and fellowships. King's College, London's Charles Boxer chair of history was established in his honor. Boxer passed away on April 27, 2000, in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England, at the age of 96. </p> </bioghist>

<p><P>
Colonel John H. James, 1800-1881 was an American lawyer, legislator, banker, and railroad builder. He lived the majority of his life in Urbana, Ohio and graduated from Cincinnati College. As a prominent lawyer in Urbana and an Ohio State Senator from 1835-1839, he supported and advised members of the Whig party in Congress and the General Assembly of Ohio, including his friends William Henry Harrison and Henry Clay. In addition to his law career, James worked as a banker and railroad builder. He was a pioneer in the development of western banking and transportation, building one of the earliest railroads in the United States: the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad. After attending the Kentucky Military Institute and achieving the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1829, James traveled briefly throughout the Midwest as a land surveyor. As recorded in a contract, during the summer of 1835, he formed a partnership with Indiana's fifth governor, Noah Noble (served 1831-1837), and land agent Captain John Walker to speculate in Indiana land "with a capital of twelve thousand Dollars which is to be procured from the Urbana Bank in the names of Noah Noble and John Walker on notes payable at such times as may be agreed on by the Bank and renewed from time to time until the lands shall be sold, and the partners shall decide it best to pay up the loan."

<p>Charles-Adolphe de Pineton, Marquis de Chambrun (1831-1891) was a French lawyer who served as the unofficial French representative in the United States during the Civil War. He married Marthe-Helene de Corcelles, a direct descendant of Marquis de Lafayette, after she was introduced by Alexis de Tocqueville. The family and their circle of friends were liberals in the age of Napoleon III. Adolphe's political leanings and pamphleteering against Napoleon III and the French state forced him out of France. Despite not speaking any English, he left for America to establish a law practice. Ignoring Chambrun's politics, Edouard Drouyan, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, gave him an informal diplomatic role in the United States: to observe the progress of the American Civil War, as well as Napoleon III's scheme that had put Maximilian I on the throne in Mexico -- a move highly unpopular in the United States.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Jindra Vlček, 1885-1968, was a Czech artist and World War I veteran. He was born in 1885 in Malá Skalice in what is now the Czech Republic. He graduated from the School of Applied Arts in Vienna and the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. He spent two years, from 1906-1908, in the United States designing movie posters and working in advertising. Upon his return to Europe, he was imprisoned for evading military service. Czechs were at that time a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and thus in 1914 he was sent to the Russian front in World War I to fight for Austria-Hungary. In October 1915 he was captured and joined the Czech Legion, a unit of Czech prisoners of war fighting for Russia as part of a bargain in which Russia promised Czech independence if they were victorious against the Austro-Hungarian empire. The Czech Legion became highly popular in the U.S. press, which in part helped to ensure that the Czechs achieved independence once World War I ended. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Vlček focused on his art, producing four designs for postage stamps commemorating battles in which the Czech Legion was involved, of which some originals are preserved in this collection.

<p>Percy Muir was associated with the antiquarian bookselling firm, Elkin Mathews, Ltd. from 1930 until his death in 1979. Founded in 1885 by Charles Elkin Mathews, the business began in the Cathedral Close at Exeter but moved to London in 1887 when Elkin Mathews and John Lane went into partnership. Within a very few years publishing became the principle interest of the firm, now Elkin Mathews and John Lane Ltd., with retail sales of books, old and new, taking a secondary place. The two men parted company in 1894 and Mathews, although continuing to publish, returned to a greater concentration on bookselling. He died in 1922. A.W. Evans, ex–curate, ex–journalist, and himself a collector and customer of Elkin Mathews, acquired the business as a going concern from Mathews' widow.

<p>Born on October 26, 1927 to German publisher Johannes Asmus, Marion Boyars spent her childhood in New York and Switzerland, going on to earn a degree in politics, philosophy, and economics from Keele University at a time when few women attended British universities (McNamara, 1997). Boyars (then Marion Asmus) married clothing manufacturer George Lobbenberg and had two daughters, Susan and Catheryn. Through an ad in <title render="italic">The Bookseller</title> shown to her by her financial advisor in 1960, Boyars bought a 50% stake – allegedly funded by the alimony of her divorce from Lobbenberg – in independent publisher John Calder's firm Calder Publishers. Boyars claims that her interest in publishing was due to a desire for "a career that was intellectually stimulating and demanding" as well as to "give voice to exciting new ideas" (McNamara, 1997). It was through this firm, which became Calder and Boyars Ltd. in 1964, that she met her second husband, translator and poet Arthur Boyars. The firm specialized in translated fiction, the writings of modern composers, social sciences, film studies, and controversial literature, notably including the works of Hubert Selby Jr. and Henry Miller. Due to insurmountable differences, Calder and Boyars began to dissolve the firm in 1975, dividing their published authors between them over the next five years while forming Calder Publishers and Marion Boyars Publishers, respectively. <lb/> </p><p>As "the first woman in the United Kingdom to become a publisher in her own right – not through marriage or inheritance" as well as the "first woman British publisher to establish an American firm" (Reuter, 1978), Boyars continued to favor experimental fiction and politically radical non-fiction as Marion Boyars Publishers. According to Boyars, she "mainly broke the rules because she didn't know them" (McNamara, 1997), though she also firmly believed that obscenity and taboos were "necessary subjects" (McNamara, 1997). Though other publishers and authors' agents found her to be "slightly eccentric, publishing books no one else wants" (McNamara, 1997), they also noted her success at selecting and promoting authors and their works, often trying to steal authors from Boyars after she had discovered them. With roughly 20-25 books published annually, Marion Boyars Publishers published six authors who went on to win Nobel Prizes and was often the first publisher to bring international authors to English audiences.

<p>"Kock, Charles Paul de (1793-1871), French novelist, was born at Passy on the 21st of May 1793. He was a posthumous cild, his father, abanker of Dutch extraction, having been a victim of the Terror. Paul de Kock began life as a banker's clerk. For the most part he resided on the Boulevard St Martin, and was one of the most inveterate of Parisians. He died in Paris on the 27th of April 1871. He began to write for the stage very early, and composed many operatic libretti. His first novel, <title render="italic">L'Enfant de ma Femme</title> (1811), was published at his own expense. In 1820 he began his long and sucessful series of novels dealing with Parisian life with <title render="italic">Georgette, ou La Mere de Tabellion.</title> His period of greatest and most successful activity was the Restoration and the early days of Louis Philippe. He was relatively less popular in France itself than abroad, where he was considered as the special painter of life in Paris. Major Pendenis's remark that he had read nothing of the novel kind for thirty years except Paul de Kock, who certainly made him laugh, is likely to remain one of the most durable of his testimonials, and may be classed with the legendary question of a foreign sovereign to a Frenchman who was paying his respects, "Vous venez de Paris et vous deves savoir des nouvelles. Comment se porte Paul de Kock?" The disappearance of the grisette and of the cheap dissipation described by Henri Murger practically made Paul de Kock obsolete. But to the student of manners his portraiture of low and middle class life in the first half of the 19th century at Paris still has its value." - 11th Edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica [1911]</p><p>"[Kock was] the prolific and immensely popular author of rollicking, risky, and more often frankly coarse frequently sentimental, and fundamentally good-natured novels. Written with an untiring comic vigour which made up for their complete lack of style, they were good pictures of the life and amusements of the people of Paris and the country c. 1825-45. They were read and enjoyed in England (by Macaulay and Elizabeth Barrett Browning among others..." - Harvey &amp; Heseltine, Oxford Companion to French Literature</p> </bioghist>

<p>Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005) was an American journalist from Louisville, Kentucky. Credited as the founder of "Gonzo journalism," his writing is characterized by a high-energy, first-person narrative style that disregards traditional journalistic objectivity and blurs the line between fiction and nonfiction.</p><p>This collection includes material from Thompson's early career, after he had been honorably discharged from the Air Force and fired from the Middletown (New York) <title render="italic">Daily Record,</title> when he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico to work for the magazine <title render="italic">El Sportivo,</title> a job which quickly fell through. Afterwards, he bounced between short-lived journalism gigs and odd jobs in the Caribbean, the United States, and South America. The turning point in Thompson's career came in 1965, when <title render="italic">The Nation</title> hired him to write about Hell's Angels; the material was published as a book, <title render="italic">Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga,</title> in 1966. His style reached its apotheosis with his 1971 novel <title render="italic">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,</title> which was serialized in <title render="italic">Rolling Stone</title> under the byline Raoul Duke, with illustrations by Ralph Steadman. Blending fiction and autobiography, the book is a lurid and hallucinogenic narrative of illicit drug use and a meditation on the failures of 1960s counterculture and the death of the American Dream. Thompson's literary output dwindled in the mid-1970s due to the pressures of celebrity and his heavy drinking and drug use, though by that time he had already achieved cult status for his colorful journalistic persona. He died by suicide in 2005.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Blondell Harris Hill was born in Marianna, Arkansas on February 9, 1904. At the age of 19 she was recruited to attend Earlham College and moved to Richmond, Indiana. At Earlham she completed two years of study, including music, piano, and other required course work. She then married Roy Hill, whose mother owned the Mary E. Hill Nursing Home in Richmond, Indiana. Blondell Hill was active as a church musician and played for the Sunday School and the Senior Choir at the Bethel A.M.E. church in Richmond. She passed her love of music on to her daughter, Rochelle, who sang in the children's and junior choirs.</p><p>Hill also worked for the Leeds family in Richmond as a cook. They spent the summers of 1952-1956 in the resort town of Petoskey, Michigan, where Hill performed with a local gospel choir. Originally formed by a seasonal household employee from Dayton, Ohio, the choir was comprised of African Americans in the Petoskey area who came from Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Kentucky to work in the resort town. Since there was no African American church in Petoskey and most of the household employees had been accustomed to singing in gospel choirs, the employers in the area made sure their help became familiar with the other Black household employees and directed them to a church that was preferred by the seasonal workers. Hill and her daughter both performed in the Petoskey Gospel Volunteer Choir and are pictured in the photograph included in the collection.</p><p>Blondell Hill passed away at the age of 101 on August 26, 2005, and is buried in Earlham Cemetery, Richmond, Indiana.

Her many health problems, combined with the economics of the depression, contributed to the demise of her brief recording career. She remained active within the Church of God in Christ, the largest African American Pentecostal denomination and producer of such acts as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Edwin and Walter Hawkins, and Andrae Crouch. Initially a Fort Worth-based pianist for Bishop Samuel M. Crouch, she also assisted F. W. McGee and other COGIC leaders, and toured with Katie Bell Nubin and her daughter, Sister Rosetta Tharpe. In her later years she moved to Los Angeles where she died on July 27, 1963.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Marietta Simpson is a renowned American mezzo-soprano with an illustrious music career that spans well over fifty years. Simpson was born in November, 1958 in Philadelphia, PA to Melvin and Evelyn Simpson. The second youngest of eight siblings, Marietta was raised within an exceedingly talented musical family that included her sisters Joy Simpson, the late internationally acclaimed soprano, and Evelyn Simpson-Curenton, composer and pianist. During Marietta's youth, the Simpson family toured as a musical act, the Singing Simpsons, performing both classical and gospel music repertoire. The family strove to break the barriers of what was expected from Black musicians performing in predominantly White communities and churches. </p><p>Simpson attended Temple University studying music education with a concentration in trombone and transitioned to voice toward the end of her degree. She earned a masters degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton, studying under Carmen Savoca and Peyton Hibbitt, and made her operatic debut as Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's <title render="italic">Cavalleria Rusticana</title> with the Tri-Cities Opera Company.

Simpson continued to work with Shaw for the next thirteen years and marks this period as a catalyst for her career. Under Shaw, she also made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1988 as soloist in Brahms' <title render="italic">Alto Rhapsody</title> with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Simpson's opera career continued over the next two decades, including performances with many opera companies including Lyric Opera of Chicago, LA Opera, Washington National Opera, and on prestigious international stages such as La Scala, Glyndebourne, and the Royal Opera House at Convent Garden. Simpson has also sung with every major orchestra in the United States, under many of the world's greatest conductors, and with numerous choral ensembles.

<p>In the 1970s an interesting collaboration began in Los Angeles between two entertainment industry pioneers: Johnny Otis, the legendary R&amp;B songwriter and bandleader, and Bill Griffiths, one of the original promoters of roller derby and former owner of the L.A. Thunderbirds franchise. Otis's success as a recording artist and radio deejay led to an opportunity to host a weekly television variety show for KTTV in L.A., which aired for eight years beginning in the mid-1950s as The Johnny Otis Show. Griffiths, who at that time ran an ad agency, assisted by finding sponsors for the show and a friendship formed between the two men. By the 1970s Griffiths had his own TV truck, primarily used for filming roller derby events, and offered to shoot some of Otis's live shows. The resulting video footage was recently donated to the AAAMC by Otis and Griffiths and consists of two distinct series.</p> </bioghist>

<p>Johnny Otis, known as the "Godfather of R&amp;B," was born in 1921 to Greek immigrants in Vallejo, California. Two years later his family moved to a predominantly Black neighborhood in Berkeley, where his father opened a grocery store. In this environment, Otis experienced and internalized Black culture from an early age and was particularly influenced by African American music styles. In high school he learned to play the drums and in 1940 landed his first professional job with Count Otis Matthew's West Oakland House Rockers. The following year he began playing and touring with Black territory big bands led by musicians such as George Morrison and Lloyd Hunter. After settling in Los Angeles, Otis became a session drummer for jazz greats such as Lester Young and performed and recorded with his own big band, scoring his first hit with an arrangement of "Harlem Nocturne" in 1946.</p><p>As the demand for big bands waned, Otis downsized to a combo, forging a new style that became known as rhythm and blues. Over the next decade he played an important role in the development of rhythm and blues, discovering, producing, promoting and performing with artists such as Little Esther Phillips, The Robins, The Coasters, Mel Walker, Etta James, Jackie Wilson, Big Mama Thornton, Little Willie John, and Hank Ballard. Otis led the house bands at Club Alabam on Central Avenue and the Barrelhouse, a nightclub he opened in Watts, and toured extensively with his popular live revue show. During this period Otis also released a string of hit records including "Willie and the Hand Jive," wrote songs for other artists, served as a record label talent scout, and operated a recording studio, record shop and the Dig Records label.</p><p>In 1954 Otis began his media career as host of "The Johnny Otis Show," a rhythm and blues radio program which he adapted into a weekly television series that aired on KTTV from 1955-1961 and was briefly revived in the 1970s. The popularity of Otis's radio show persisted over several decades, continually introducing new audiences to the many African American artists he worked with throughout his career, highlighting their achievements, and addressing issues such as systemic racism within the industry. Otis also ventured into print media in 1960, writing a column for the Sentinel, one of L.A.'s leading Black newspapers, which he used as a platform to address racial equality and social justice.</p><p>Otis was voted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation for his role in the development of these styles. In addition to his musical career, Otis was an avid painter and sculptor, author, ordained minister, organic farmer, and civil rights activist. He founded the Landmark Community Church in the late 1970s and advocated tirelessly for the homeless, organizing food drives such as the Red Beans and Rice Festivals promoted on his radio shows. He married Phyllis Walker, an Afro-Filipina woman, in 1941 and had several children. Otis frequently performed with his sons, guitarist Shuggie Otis and drummer Nicky Otis, and in later years with grandson Lucky Otis on bass. Johnny Otis died in 2012 at the age of 90.</p> </bioghist>
